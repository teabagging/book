The story, which I have read many times, is sweet and sentimental. I last read \\"Little Women \\" as a teenager, and now that I am a 40-something year-old mother and wife myself, I am frankly shocked by how touched I was by the effect that re-reading it had on me. The little words of guidance, maternal advice, and quiet examples of virtue and self-sacrifice take on new meaning and seem to reflect even more timeless wisdom now that I have some years of life experience myself.

I read it multiple times, and even held my own version of their Pilgrim's Progress roleplay. I hadn't read it for years, but when I got my Kindle for Christmas and saw this free version, I had to download it. The book is still as wonderful as I remembered (and some part of me still pulls for Jo and Laurie to get together, though I love Professor Bhaer, too). It's a gentle, quiet book filled with profound wisdom and loving relationships between family members. The path of growing up is never easy, but this book shows how for many, faith and family can be the underpinnings for a bright future."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"\\"Little Women\\" is so well written and accessible. I had only seen the movie before reading the book, and as with most all stories, the book is by far better. I felt as if I were a silent member of the March family. I laughed at Jo's antics, and cried at Beth's departure. I really think this book has encouraged me to be a genuinely better person. I feel challenged to hold my tongue and have patience and to show kindness. This is definitely a must read for everyone!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I love this book and the charming characters in it.

I guess I was thinking too often the movie I so loved (the 1994 version) since there was so much that had not been in the movie, making it more drawn out and boring at times. However I still loved the characters and the tale. I was not as awed by the ending either, since it seemed more drawn out than in the movie.

When I received my new Kindle Fire a few weeks ago, I downloaded some free books to test it out and among them was Little Women. I enjoyed the eloquent language and writing used. I had heard about this book many times over the years as a must-read chick-lit, but had never taken the time to do it. I even remember them talking about this book on an episode of Friends. Now I'm really glad that I've read it.The four Little Women are sisters in the March family, who has gone from fortune to working-class when their father became a preacher and went off to the War. At first, they regret losing their wonderful rich things and beautiful clothing, but through time and with their mother's coaching, they learn that money isn't as important as helping others and loving others.There are wonderful parts of the story that highlight each daughter's quest for marriage and grows into her own. Watching each girl grow up into mature women was like seeing your niece grow up, mature, and turn into a new person."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I've been reading on this book for some time; truth be told, I actually started reading this book about forty-five years ago! I set it down then, never realizing it would take this long to get back to it. Little Women is the story of four girls and their mom and dad during the Civil War. Their dad has gone off to minister to soldiers in the war and the girls and their mom are quite poor. Optimism is a key concept among the Marches, however, so you do not hear bellyaching or whining in this household. The girls find ways to entertain themselves with nary a Nintendo or tv. They continually renew their vow to keep a happy face and try harder to be good. Genuinely inspiring people in this book."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I loved this book. I found a lot of life lessons in it. I had such an easy time reading it on my Kindle, especially during my sleepless nights before having my baby."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa Alcott was born in the 1832 in a town called Germantown, Pennsylvania United States.Her father was a philosopher and teacher averse to any work activities.For this reason the family was forced to move in areas in and around Boston Massachusetts.In my opinion it is wrong to criticize him like an layabout mainly because he was surely against the labor exploitation and the alienation of the man - machine.The family was involved in an intense moral conviction, for instance they did not wear cotton, because it was produced by slave labor in the south of the United States.Reading this novel we will be conscious of the good teachings and the tension due to the Civil War.In my opinion this is a fundamental reading for young and adult readers, because they will learn the significance of poverty, the importance and rules of the family for the evolution of the society, and the collateral effect of the American Civil War on a family of four daughters.From the first paragraphs emerges their purity and social commitment when the girls decided to renounce of their Christmas' gift for buy a present to their mother and their commendable attitude in regard to the Hummels.The central character is Josephine March, in my opinion the author of this novel and the particular description of her childhood in a difficult context in a difficult time and her true love for a man and the culture.Before analyzing the most important phrases, I have to say that the good teaching of this novel is that as responsible citizens we must empower our children about their centrality for a proper development and maintaining of the society."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I remember opening up this book one day when I was in a particularly melancholy mood. After reading a few chapters of this book, however, I found my heart warmed to its very core.I cannot even count the amount of times I shed tears while reading this book. Mr. Laurence and Beth's relationship is beautiful. The unbreakable bond of the four sisters is heartwarming. Laurie's friendship with the girls is moving. The connection between the girls and their mother is tender.&lt;Little Women> is...A captivating little novel that makes one remember that there are things more dear on this earth than money, fame, and other worldly things.A story of four magnificent young girls who go through sorrow, joy, suffering, and happiness to grow to be great women, all wonderful in their own way.Louisa May Alcott's way with words makes one adore the American language, as Alcott uses her words to paint the best picture of the welcoming home of the March family."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Very good book. I know why it's considered a classic. Nice easy read. Well written. Type of book that you just want to sit down and enjoy yourself."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This has been my favorite book since I was 10 and it still is 30 years later! I was so giddy they had it on Kindle and it was the correct version!

I decided to download the free kindle book and read it. It was a truly touching story, but I have found that it varies somewhat from what I remember from the movie. Of course that is always the case. Still it had a bit more explanation about things and it was a really good book I recommend it to everyone above the age of 12."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I loved Little Women, and I am actually surprised that I did.There is something alluring and engaging when the first chapter of a novel starts in a cold winter. My own temperament is neither made nor able to be trained for cold weather. I shiver even in a mild wind sometimes and yet I crave reading about my characters bravely battling a brutally cold winter, especially when the setting takes us to Concord, Massachusetts in late 19th century civil-war era America. Harsh and gloomy as the weather may be, the bleak of winter is no match for the warmth which stems from love, happiness, and tightness of the March family. Four sisters, one mother, one nanny, and a father at war, Alcott introduces us one by one to the March sisters and the bond of sisterhood which is tested, broken and mended again and again throughout the novel.The theme and plot of this novel paint the pictures from every day life for an ordinary family caught in, yes you guessed it, extraordinary times. The hardships of Civil War and near-poverty, while real for the March family, are not central to the plot and so \\"Little Women\\", which has many important messages, comes across as extremely light, fun and beautiful reading. Even if it's considered a children's classic, I shamelessly admit that I enjoyed it thoroughly.My most favorite character, of course, is the one and only Jo who shows us.......that short temper can bring about only regrets and how to channel that energy to good use....that we need to deal with the loss of a loved one and the abandon friendships at times....that we can create magic if we write from the heart....that maternal love can afford us more comfort than any other imaginable in good and especially in desperate times....that age difference and cultural gaps are no strike against a love story.Oh I loved Little Women! So happy to have read it. Pick up this classic TO-DAY!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"It's nice to have these freebie classics. Especially when I don't want to pop for a kindle, just the iPhone app."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I must have read this book a dozen times before I graduated from junior high, but it is still a favorite of mine. Even after first reading it 15 years or re-reading it, I still cry when Beth dies, laugh when the sisters write and star in their own plays and pull for Jo as she makes a way for herself in a man's world. If you are looking for a perfect gift for a daughter or sister this rich story of the relationships between these young women is without a doubt a solid choice. It's also a winner if you are just looking for a great story to fall in love with and enjoy for years to come, this is a rare gem that will be more than worth the price. I can't recommend this book strongly enough. In fact I am beginning to read it again even now!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"My Mama used to read to us all the time, and this was and is still onbe of her favs."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"When my book club selected this book, I didn't want to spend alot of money on another copy since I had already read and thrown out 2 others.

Many thanks!!!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The last time I read \\"Little Women,\\" I must have been somewhere between the ages of 10 and 12. I'm now almost 70. The opportunity to play Aunt March in a local theatrical production spurred me to read the book again. And I'm so glad. First of all, I realized I had never read the complete story. I'm sure I read the illustrated abridged version that is usually read by young children (and the edition I just bought my 9-year-old granddaughter). The 500+ pages would have seemed a bit overwhelming when I was reading it the first time. I also realized that even though it is recommended for children ages 9-12, I would never buy this unabridged version for a child in that age group.That being said, I would have to say that this book is absolutely delightful. I loved the story 60 years ago, and love it even more now. At times I'm reading with a big smile on my face. Other times the tears are running down my cheeks (when Mr. Laurence gave Beth the piano and Meg's wedding as an example). I cherish every word. Miss Alcott gave each of the girls very individual and endearing personalities. Visions of them run through my head as I read. They are filled with such joy but at the same time experience more than their share of sadness and hardship. Someone said to me the other day that it is a real tragedy that this story has been read primarily by girls.

It's a classic and contains both the first and second part of the original book. The binding is beautiful as well."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, from her \\"blood and thunder\\" tales to heartwarming novels about teens growing up.But there's something special about \\"Little Women,\\" a fictionalized account of her own family's growing pins. Thewarmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and fun little anecdotes of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel New England poverty with their Marmee, while their father is away in the Civil War. The girls don't let lack of money hamper their fun and happiness. But their world starts to expand when Jo befriends \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, and soon he and his tutor are almost a part of their family.Along with him, the girls encounter many of the bumps of growing up -- the destruction of Jo's treasured writing, romps with wealthier pals, Amy's expulsion from school, and Meg's reluctant first romance. But their lives are turned upside-down when Beth contracts scarlet fever, and they receive news that their father has been seriously injured -- and these crises threaten to destroy the heart of their family.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding -- if not to her dream guy, then to her love. But while time has mellowed and matured the Little Women, it hasn't lessened the capacity for conflict and unintentional comedy -- particularly with the now-attractive Amy, whose attempts to pursue art, culture and the appearance of wealthy sophistication usually go horribly wrong.But the platonic friendship between Laurie and Jo is shattered when he admits his true feelings to her... and gets rejected. Distraught, he goes to Europe, as does Amy with crusty old Aunt March. And left in New England, Jo is faced with the question of what her life has in store, despite Beth's picturesquely poor health. Her new job as a governess leads her to put her treasured stories into print... leading her to love and her future.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women\\" -- and since the March girls really are like the girls next door, this doesn't exactly come as a shock. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays a post-\\"blood and thunder\\" Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.And it does. Alcott's writing is a warm, smooth string of interconnected stories, some of them quiet and some peppered with silly jokes, moments of tragedy, poetry, and unintentional humiliation (\\"Salt instead of sugar. And the cream is sour\\"). Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.The best part of this book is the March girls themselves -- they have flaws and strengths, ambitions and dreams that never quite turn out as they expect. And their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster, or Meg's makeover at a rich friend's house -- have the feeling of authenticity.Lovable Jo is the quintessential tomboy -- rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and while Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding. But Laurie makes up for this: a wealthy, artistic, passionate young man who goes through all the growing pains, as he tries to be worthy of the girl he adores. Don't worry, things turn out all right for him.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. The March family will come alive, and never quite leave."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women Louisa May Alcott, 2004, 520 pages. $9.95Sterling Publishing ISBN 978-1-4027-1458-0Have you ever had a brother or sister and you just can't be without them? Would you do anything for them? That's how it is for Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. They are not perfect but great sisters. They all are different, they are strongly bonded together, always their for each other, just like normal sisters.The main characters Meg, the oldest of the four, was sixteen and very beautiful, Jo, the second oldest, was fifteen, tall, thin, and has light brown hair, Beth, was called rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl, and was thirteen, Amy, the most important person to her dad life, the youngest. Some main characters emotions are happy, sad,/ baby time, dieing time, war time, and peace time.The background into the relationships among the four characters are, four sisters, the sisters who have a great relationships among each share in between the four of them. A summarize of the plot in the story would be four sisters and they are going throw, a dad in the war, it's hard to watch the four girls Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy grow up and move on with their live.A hint about the resolution of the plot, I would say a few years later the girls are grown up and someone comes home and then the family is all back together but one know everyone is going to be happy. The genre that I was reading was historical fiction. This book is part of a series, the little men which Louisa May Alcott also wrote. My opinion towards the book would be for the writer to make more books just like little women because the book was very interesting, my reaction on the book were sad, happy, terrified, and cry full. The interesting theme is love, I would recommend this book to children ages, 12 and up and I would also recommend the book to young adults, because the book is very enjoying."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read Little Women as a precursor to my reading of the 2005 Pulitzer prize winning novel March by Geraldine Brooks which tells the story of the least mentioned character in Little Women, Mr. March, who is the father of the characters portrayed in this book. I was very skeptical going into it believing that this was more a book for little women than for big men. I have to admit that it was difficult for me. Their wasn't so much an enticing storyline, but rather a drawn out description and character development of the March sisters and their \\"march\\" into adulthood during the 19th century circa Civil War era. Little is really mentioned about the Civil War except noted that Mr. March served as a chaplain in it. What I did enjoy was the manner of which the March sister's exemplified an era where women prided themselves on fine etiquette, moral behavior, respect of family, the development of culture, and the role of keeper's of the home and hearth. The sister's were quite saintly, but not in a prudish way, but rather in an innocent and genuine way that is often lost in today's culture. I think that most young women today would find this book laborious, but I think it carries lessons that would be valuable to them. By the end of the book I was quite enamoured by the characters and longed for the past where character, poise, grace, and charm were sought after by young women, and young men."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Don't get me wrong.

Let's go through it, marriage by marriage.Meg's marriage. Cute.

Assuming Mr. Bhaer is NOT in his late forties, assuming he is simply forty. Jo is around -- what, nineteem? Twenty? HE -- IS -- OLD -- ENOUGH -- TO -- BE -- HER -- DAD. She hits the ripe ol' halfway mark (in a manner of speaking) at fifty, and where is he? Seventy. Ol' granddad over there.Yep. Loved the book, hated the last romance.

She said I would enjoy it because of the historical setting (Civil War). I took her advice end enjoyed reading it. It gives a look at the social history of the time which is all too often over looked by many authors, something about battles and war being more interesting.

I remember trying this book as a girl and disliking it; I gave it another try now on vacation, at the age of 47. I still dislike it. The characters are caricatures and speak in stilted dialogue unlike that of any real people--much less interesting people. Don't misunderstand--I like good nineteenth century novels. In fact, I love Dickens, Trollope, the Brontes, George Eliot, Mrs. Gaskell, etc. This book is a pale imitation of those--a mere period piece."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I just recieved this treasured book from my childhood along with Little Men and Jo's Boys and now I am in the Christmas spirit.

I loved it so much I got it on my kindle."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This book has become one of my favorites. I don't know what took me so long to read it, I've seen the movie version a few times.The four March sisters named Meg, Jo, Amy & Beth live in a cozy home with their mother 'Marmee' while their father is away in the Civil War. The family was wealthy at one time, but it is hinted that he helped a friend who did not repay the debt, and that is how the family ended up living in poverty. The girls do feel sad having so little, but their mother reminds them that they have more blessings than most.The one thing I didn't like about this book was that it got real 'cheesy' at times. At one point Jo and her professor are singing together out loud in front of family, him in his German accent none the less...lol. It also tends to get 'preachy' as well at times. Looking past that, I highly recommend Little Women. I found it to be a 'comfort book', a very sweet read. It's about family, friends and love."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women has a very weak plot, going back and fourth between what the character is thinking and what is actually happening.This book also completely lacked amusement!

It was already bad enough that the March sister were extreamly good (too good)and how they complained about stupid stuff, like noses and how they were poor (which doesn't even make sense if you have a servant and a manor!)but she killed of Beth so early in the series and Jo didn't even marry Laurie!! But instead married her sister IT'S NOT SUPPOSE TO HAPPEN LIKE THAT!!! It makes me wonder what could possibly fill the pages of the other two books. So I DO NOT recommend this book to ANYONE! Instead, try Harry Potter :)"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott, Little Women (Signet, 1880)I figured attempting to struggle through this for five months (actually, five months and one week) was more than enough torture, and so I gave up about a quarter through the book (I ended on page 124 of 455). I can understand the many accolades the book has gotten from various writers (the afterward of the one I was reading, for example, was penned by Susan Straight) about the depiction of women, especially young women, as groundbreaking for its time. All well and good, but I couldn't get past the aggressive bucolic nature of the thing, which makes the Beany Malone novels seem as if they were written by Huysmans or Lautreamont (or Sartre or any other nihilist/existentialist you'd care to name). I have often wondered if there were a particular novel Melville were parodying in the hilarious opening pages of Pierre; it is obviously not Little Women, published some twenty-eight years after Pierre, but I can see where Melville was coming from anyway. (This was actually an accepted literary style of the time? How depressing.)You may ask what in the world I'm going on about (though I assume if you're a fan of the book you have an idea of what the word \\"bucolic\\" means without me having to explain it to you). It's this--no one in this book ever thinks a truly bad thought. No one could ever even consider doing a bad deed. These characters are squeaky clean. Have you ever, in your entire life, encountered a household with four female children (especially four female children being raised by two females, since dad's off to war) where there was no bickering? Ever? Where every small, unintentional slight was worked out by calm, rational debate? No. Of course not. Why? Because that household does not exist. It did not exist in 1880, and it does not exist in 2009. There are obviously those who can relegate that to the backs of their minds; I found it impossible. Thus, one more book fed to the dustbunnies in 2009. (zero)"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I haven't read this book &amp; probably should.

Lousia May used her childhood stories wrote this book. In the book there was Meg who was a really lady like Louisa's older sister Anna, there is Beth, who is my favarite, she may be sick, but she is a very nice girl; there was a Amy who love to paint, and of course there is the tomboy Jo, who may be a girl but a tomboy in her heart. This book tell the stories that the four March sister have while their father are away. They have some awasome advangers. If you like to knew about Louisa May Alcott, you should read this book, Jo acted a lot like Louisa May herself. I like is book very much it's wonderful."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I have been wanting to read LITTLE WOMEN since I was in BYE BYE BIRDIE in high school because of an allusion made to the book by Rosie Alvarez and Albert Peterson. However, like many books I wish to read, I never got around to it until recently when I was required to read it for an adolescent literature class.LITTLE WOMEN was the book that brought Louisa May Alcott fame, fortune, and freedom. It has become an American literary classic and is probably more popular today than when it was first published. The story explores the lives of the four March sisters and the trials and tribulations they go through while growing up during the mid 1800's in the New England. The book is somewhat long, but easy to read. It contains many ethical and moral lessons. The book primary appeals to girls and women, but men can enjoy and learn from the book, too. The Penquin Classic edition of the text includes a rather dry introduction by Elaine Showalter.I thoroughly enjoyed reading LITTLE WOMEN. It has all sorts of great messages about faith, love, and life. It's a great book and I now know why it is Albert Peterson's favorite novel."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Oh,my sweet Lord I love this book!How original and captivatingcan one book be?From a girl who L-U-V-S Harry Potter ,Redwall,Chronicles of Narnia,The lost years of Merlin,Artemis Fowl,His Dark Materials,and the like,this book was quite out of theordinary.But I found this book thoroughly ripping and a smashinggood read.What a marvelous book!Warm and tender with a lot of TLC(tender Loving Care)!!!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I think the title of this book is wrong. They are women, but they aren't little. They are very mature for their ages. Beth is 13, almost like me, but she acts like she is Meg's age and above. Amy is a little whiner. She dislikes her nose and loves to paint. Jo is a dreamer. She has all the dreams of writing and such. Meg is the oldest. She has a job as a governess for two little kids. Little Women is a great book, although it gets a little lengthy."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The book was absolutely wonderful!! But the introduction was written in very bad taste. The insinuations were offensive and with out just cause!!Had I read the introduction before I purchased the book, I would have chosen another copy. I had purchased it and then read the introduction, so as I write, the pages have been cut out of this book. Louisa May Alcott did not deserve the insinuations from this person."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I had to read a novel for my high school English class. I picked &quot;Little Women&quot; because I had seen all the movies. I thought that I would be able to get through the book without concentrating, or wanting to...but was I wrong. Not only did I enjoy the book, but it was different from the movie which made it exciting to read. Meg- the mature one, Joe-the adventurous one, Beth-the fragile one, and Amy- the pampered one come together to prove how important love is. One would not expect that these four &quot;young women&quot; have the knowledge and intelligence to not only teach, but make an impact on the reader's life. But they do! Throughout the life of these girls, they suffer a great deal of hardships. Their father is at war, and their mother forced to leave for a great deal of time. These girls manage to take care of themselves and eachother, never forgetting the lessons their mother has taught them. Read the book. It is about 450 pages and it took me two weeks. (That is only because my English teacher made me keep a journal). The great thing about this book is that it did not spend 50 pages giving an introduction to the story. The first line is a quote- most of the novel is dialogue which also makes the reading easier. I recomend it. For school, or just recreational, &quot;Little Women&quot; by Louisa May Alcott is a book that every 11-18 year old girl should read."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read Little Women when I was a Little Woman. I just recently decided to buy it for my daughter and read it again. What a classic! This is a must for anyone's reading list both male and female. The story chronicles the March family, in particular one of the daughters, Josephine March. It is a story of hope and love. This is not a love story of romance, but one of tender, unconditional love that exists in a family of a mother, father and four very different daughters. There are moral lessons throughout the book that are refreshing and the character of all the girls comes through vividly. Alcott does a wonderful job devloping the different personalities of her characters. There are lessons for young people written between the lines on strength, wisdom, love, patience and quiet service. Boys and girls alike will benefit from the examples of polished and refined manners. A beautifully wirtten story that well deserves the label of a Classic.Just a note about this particular copy--We like to buy classics that are nicely bound and not cheap looking. I was a little hesitant to buy this online. I was pleasantly surprised when it came in the mail. It is nicely bound. The cover is hardcover cloth. The pages are not great quality but are sturdy and seem \\"old fashioned\\". It was a great value for the money and as well, looks good on the shelf. I am expecting it to hold up to lots of readings!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I love the novel and have been given several copies over the years, but I actually bought this edition.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is one of my favorite books of all time! In this heartwarming story about four sisters growing up during the Civil War, I have learned so much about the world around me, and ironically, myself. It tells of how people can choose to live their lives and how happiness can be found even through hardships.The Marches are a picture of a happy home - with brave and moral Father, who has gone into the army to do what he can for the North's cause, and kind, caring Marmee, who watches over her girls with gentleness and love. Then, there's the little women: sixteen-year-old Meg, who's pretty and mature; rough-and-tumble Jo, determined to become a famous writer; timid Beth, always putting others before herself; and spoiled Amy with her artistic talents. There's also their amiable neighbor, Theodre Laurence (Laurie). Join in on the fun and read all about Amy's trouble at school, Jo's precious book being burned, Meg going to &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; Beth's tragedy, and so much more! I highly recommend this book for guys and girls of all ages! No one can resist this incredible story!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The story of four sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy is one that will forever be a part of American liteary culture. Set in the mid-1800s in a small New England town, Louisa May Alcott invites the reader into the home of these four sisters as they deal with the struggles of having a father off fighting in the Civil War, having to mature and grow up supporting themselves with little jobs here and there and finding out about the joys of love, children, and the sadness of death. This coming of age novel follows Jo mainly as she is faced with the day to day choices that will help her sisters and mother make it through the harsh New England winters. My nana gave this book to me and I hope to continue on the tradtion of passing this book on. It's a wonderful book to be shared by mothers and daughter and granddaughters alike since it shows the true spirit of women."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women focuses on the four March girls; Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, as they grow up from childhood to adulthood. The characters in the book try to teach each other helpful lessons about life, virtue, and morality. The novel is a real eye opener for everyone. Each of the mistakes the girls in the novel make are intended to provide some guidance for the reader. Society is explained, the harsh winters are described, and the profound work ethic of the people is described to also give the reader a strong sense of what life was like during the nineteenth century. I can strongly relate to all the character's feelings which are strongly depicted in Alcott's writing. I firmly believe all teenage girls should read the novel to hopefully be as strongly influenced as I was. The girls are constantly troubled by the necessity of being good, even when they feel the desire to be bad. There are also many issues on relationships between girls and boys. Friendship turns into love and vice versa, making a strong theme out of gender relations. The girls also struggle with the ideas of motherhood, sisterhood, pride, education, and marriage. After reading this novel, the reader will hopefully look more at their own life and his/her morales. Through the novel there is clear representation of the benefits of what good does."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Buy this book now because in a year or two you'll want to read it again -- no matter what your age.I think I read Little Women first as a preteen. I identified strongly, probably like most girls, with the protagonist Jo, a tomboy who struggles to find her place in society. But as the years have worn on, I have found myself returning again and again to this enthralling story. The book has an emotional impact unlike any other I have encountered.The girls' antics will make you laugh; alternately, the book features two of the saddest scenes you will ever read. If you want to become engrossed in another world, affected profoundly not just by the fictional girls but by the knowledge that this book is semi-autobiographical for Louisa May Alcott, read it. Little Women is wholesome but not boring; classic but not hard to read; better than all of the Little Women movies combined. At the heart of the book is pure love and goodness -- what we all long for in life."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I give this a one-star only for the introduction. The book \\"Little Women\\" itself is a wonderful and lovely classic. However, this Barnes and Noble edition with the introduction by Camille Cauti is what I have decided to rate and I give it a one-star rating. If you are wishing to read a 21st century review of a 19th century book and desire to bring into the story links to homosexuality and questioning the sexual orientation of the author, Louisa May Alcott, then by all means, buy this edition and read the introduction by Camille Cauti. I bought this book to give to my 12yo daughter not realizing the introduction would be discussing this topic ...I thought the edition a beautiful copy...cover picture, etc. It wasn't until later that I read the introduction. Altho. I did not buy this from Amazon(I bought it at our local Barnes and Noble store), I offer this review of this particular edition to provide others with awareness of the introduciton by Camille Cauti and her unfortunate 21st century analysis. If you wish to have this sort of analysis of this book in your personal home library, then so be it...buy this edition. If you, like me, wish to have a copy of a classic and lovely story of Little Women without the 21st century analysis, then do not buy this edition. Just a heads up for anyone considering this Barnes and Noble edition."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This may sound ridiculous, but I was bound and determined to hate this novel. I had managed to avoid it all my life, but was recently assigned the text in a graduate class on the \\"Study of the Novel.\\" I consider myself a feminist, and a somewhat cynical one at that, and was sure this was going to be too \\"Pollyanna\\" for my literary tastes. I stand corrected!I absolutely fell in love with Jo's tomboyish headstrong character and furthermore, I must confess that next to Dolores Price (from Wally Lamb's \\"She's Come Undone) and David Copperfield (Dickens' own), Laurie has become one of my all-time favorite literary characters.There are a lot of overly religious maxims being spewed forth in the first half of the book, but it was not enough to detract from my overall enjoyment. And while the book is \\"light hearted\\" in many respects, there are many serious topics worthy of graduate level discussion, such as the suppression of feminine anger and utilization and importance of self control, inner versus outer appearances, Victorian expectations of behaviors across classes and genders, and the cause and effect of the absence of the \\"father\\" for the sisters, as well as Laurie.My overall literary experience has been greatly enriched by having read this book and I recommend it to all who have not yet had the pleasure of reading it. Of course, I especially recommend it to those skeptics out there, like me, who think they already have the whole thing pegged for \\"fluff\\" :)Alcott's \\"Little Women\\" is, without question, an American masterpiece and deserves to be on the shelves with the \\"Huck Finn\\"s and \\"Great Gatsby\\"s."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I purchased a copy of this book strictly based on the graphics of the cover.

I truly wish they had made it along the lines of the faric covered hard cover classics.

But their world starts to expand when Jo befriends \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, and soon he and his tutor are almost a part of their family.Along with him, the girls encounter many of the bumps of growing up -- the destruction of Jo's treasured writing, romps with wealthier pals, Amy's expulsion from school, and Meg's reluctant first romance. But their lives are turned upside-down when Beth contracts scarlet fever, and they receive news that their father has been seriously injured -- and these crises threaten to destroy the heart of their family.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding -- if not to her dream guy, then to her love. But while time has mellowed and matured the Little Women, it hasn't lessened the capacity for conflict and unintentional comedy -- particularly with the now-attractive Amy, whose attempts to pursue art, culture and the appearance of wealthy sophistication usually go horribly wrong.But the platonic friendship between Laurie and Jo is shattered when he admits his true feelings to her... and gets rejected. Distraught, he goes to Europe, as does Amy with crusty old Aunt March. And left in New England, Jo is faced with the question of what her life has in store, despite Beth's picturesquely poor health. Her new job as a governess leads her to put her treasured stories into print... leading her to love and her future.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women\\" -- and since the March girls really are like the girls next door, this doesn't exactly come as a shock. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays a post-\\"blood and thunder\\" Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.And it does. Alcott's writing is a warm, smooth string of interconnected stories, some of them quiet and some peppered with silly jokes, moments of tragedy, poetry, and unintentional humiliation (\\"Salt instead of sugar. And the cream is sour\\"). Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.The best part of this book is the March girls themselves -- they have flaws and strengths, ambitions and dreams that never quite turn out as they expect. And their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster, or Meg's makeover at a rich friend's house -- have the feeling of authenticity.Lovable Jo is the quintessential tomboy -- rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and while Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding. But Laurie makes up for this: a wealthy, artistic, passionate young man who goes through all the growing pains, as he tries to be worthy of the girl he adores. Don't worry, things turn out all right for him.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. The March family will come alive, and never quite leave."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I found this version to be very trite and the voices did not match the depth of the characters. I was quite disappointed compared with other audiobooks that I have listened to."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Set during the Civil War, \\"Little Women\\" is the story of the four March sisters. Meg, the oldest, is sixteen and very much into being a \\"young lady\\". Jo, fifteen, is the exact opposite of Meg, a tomboy who hates everything girlish. Beth, thirteen, is a homebody, always cheerful and looking at the bright side of things. Amy, the youngest, is loving but a bit selfish and shallow. The March's don't have much money, but they are rich in love and that love carries them throughout the course of \\"Little Women\\" which takes place over a span of ten years. The March's have many adventures as they grow up, several of them with their next door neighbor, Teddy Laurence. There is joy and sorrow in their lives, but the love they have for each other carries them through everything.\\"Little Women\\" is old fashioned, sentimental but not too sentimental, and a wonderful book to read. The book is partially autobiographical, based on Louisa May Alcott's own sisters and the love she had for them is evident throughout the book. There are heartbreaking parts which make me cry each and every time I read \\"Little Women\\", yet there are heartwarming and comical moments that make me smile every time I read it. The four March sisters are very realistic, even Beth, who is almost too good to be true. Alcott was an imaginative writer who could make inanimate objects, such as roses, seem alive. \\"Little Women\\" was originally written in two parts and Alcott's style changes a bit in the second part, as she addresses the reader directly and at times delivers little \\"sermons\\" to her readers.\\"Little Women\\" is a delightful book for readers young and old."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I love to read and have begun reading many classics. My teacher recommended \\"Little Women\\" for me to read. So, I went off and bought it at the bookstore. In this edition you read an introductin first which I thought was a bit boring and long. It tells about the back round of the author and how this book was made. This story is broken up into two parts. The story starts out with four girls- Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. Their father is away at war. The first part of the story was too drawn out I thought. There is a description for everything. I did however enjoy reading it. The second part had a lot of action. There are weddings and births, and sadly even a death. It was more paced then the first part. I think Jo had the best character. She was so realistic. All in all, I thought this story was pretty good and I am not disappointed in it. I am very happy I read it. I know it is a classic and I do understand why."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This particular hardcover book is an abridged version of the books Little Women/Good Wives, (The movie is actually the two books filmed in one). The text is sort of a mixture between what happens in the actual books, and what happens in the movie, a happy medium.It is all in colour and has beautiful big colour picture stills from the movie. Some being of the four girls together and individually, Marmee, Lauries proposal, Jo and the Professor, Amy and Laurie. A good read for a younger person who doesnt want to go through the two books, but even better for a fan of the movie.FYI- If you are interested in one that doesnt have a dustjacket from Amazon, it's exactly the same underneath so you don't have a blank cover, still the big glossy picture and text."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"As much as I enjoyed this book when I was a girl, I still enjoy it now. It's a wonderfully warm tale of family love. There is tragedy, but from that tragedy comes hope. Real family values are taught by this book. It is a story about four sisters and their mother. Life deals them a series of blows, and the story is how each of these remarkable women persevered, and how they actually got the better of life. Miss Alcott has a real knack for characterization, and each of her characters in this story are so very real. If you've read this book before, but not for awhile, I strongly suggest that you take it up again. There are unlimited surprises in store, not the least of which is how much you'll enjoy reading this book again."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This is not an exciting book. But it gives a lot of insight about life, such as a positive attitude, selflessness, kindness and honor. It's got a lot of values and morals. Mostly this is a pleasant book, with short bits in between that are slightly boring. I usually finish novels in 2 or 3 days, but this took me about 2 weeks to finish, seeing as it's not that exciting. But overall I think it is worth reading for its messages, plus it's free on the Kindle so I have no complaints."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Ms. Alcott presents a charming mixture of realistic children's behavior and idealistic moral lessons. The escapades save the moral lessons from becoming treacly and the moral lessons provide satisfying closure for the escapades.An absolute delight."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I loved this story as a girl and especially related to Jo's character, whom I feel I resemble even today for her ability to choose her own path and make unconventional choices. I was glad to get this book on Kindle so my daughter and I can read it anytime. A wonderful book for any mother and daughter to read together.Priya Florence Shah, author of \\"Step Into Your Feminine Power And Rule Your World: 24 Empowering Ideas for the Modern Indian Woman\\"."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This novel touches my soul and warms my heart in ways I never thought possible. I find myself relating to Jo, then to Beth, then to Meg, and rarely, to Amy. I understand these girls and feel as if they are my sisters. Marmee is my second mother. Professor Bhaer is my hot older intelligent German professor. Laurie is my tag along buddy. This story speaks to me. I'm so in love with it that words will not do them justice. This novel produces feelings so strong and sure. I bought this edition at BN for the full retail price. It's a beautiful linen cover and, unfortunately, I GOT A LITTLE NAIL POLISH ON ONE OF THE PAGES! Sorry, I had to vent. Anyway, I'm not sure why some people rate this as one star. This is certainly not an abridged version, there are no pictures, and it's definitely not written for children. Perhaps the picture is deceiving customers and we are not talking about the same edition?GABRIELLE"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I ordered these books for a Christmas gift.

At first I thought that it would be a girlish book, and I did not accept the offer. I will now mention that I LOVE to read. Several years later, one of my very good friends that had the same taste as I handed it to me and said, &quot;Read it.&quot; I obeyed and it turned out to be one of the best books that I had ever read. This classic story about the March sisters and their joys, hardships, and growing up has proved to be a great lesson to me and my friends. My favorite character is Beth (although I am nothing like her) because she is exactly like the person tht everyone wants to be. She is so kind and thoughtful, but so humble about her generosity. If you have not read this book, I highly reccomend that you do!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read Little Women by:Louisa May Alcott.This book is an amazing book. It does not necessarily teach you lessons on how to live, but from reading the book you learn alot. I enjoyed this book so much. It taught me about family, love, sacrifices, hardships, and alot more.When Beth goes and visits the Hummel family and gets Scarlett Fever from the baby, you sense alot of feelings from everyone. That was a very intense part for me. Also when the Dad gets sick, and the Mom leaves that is another intense part. Alot of things happen that make you feel like you do not know what is going to happen.Then the sister's start to grow up and fall in love. You get to know them so much throughout this book. When they feel something like when Jo thinks Beth loves Laurie, the guy Jo met and become friends with, and then goes away and lets Beth have him. That hurts to know how she is feeling. But when Jo meets Professor Bhaer and starts to fall in love with him you get very excited.I was did not specifically like how the book ended becuase I wanted something else to happen that did not.

Though it is long I read it pretty quickly and enjoyed it immensely. After reading this wonderful book I became inpired to finish the trilogy about Jo and her family/life, and to read more of Alcott's work. right now I am reading An Old-Fashioned Girl which I am enjoying, but isn;t as good as Little Women, Alcott's masterpiece. this book is perfectly balanced because there are joyous moments, though sad things occur. This fictionalized story about Louisa may Alcott as a teenager is written well. I would reccomend it to any girl between the ages of 9 and 12! I will defenitely read this book again, to rediscover the timeless tale of four wonderful sisters.-S.L.B."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I think Little Women is a wonderful book. It is about four sisters who live with their mother, \\"Marmee\\". Their father is working in the Civil War. I think it was very interesting because Miss Alcott makes it full of surprises.

I am not huge fan of reading, but for some reason i really liked this book. It was sort of boring at parts, but other time you couldn't put it down. There was also very upsetting parts and even happy parts which made u keep reading and keep wondering. An ex. of sadness was when Beth passed away. It was shocking when Laurie asked Jo to marry him and she said no, and then he asked Amy to marry him and she said yes! A point of happiness was when Meg delivered her babies! I would recommend this book o others, but prefeberly women because guys will not enyjoy it or get enought out of it!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I can't imagine someone disliking this novel. That is impossible. This book has things for all tastes: romance, friendship, betrayal etc. I have read this book 3 or 4 times and everytime I can find something different, or, even, be surprised. I think it is a wonderful thing how long Louisa May Alcott's masterpiece has been delighing readers everywhere.As everyone knows this is the story of four sisters and their love for each other , but above all, for life. Jo is the most impetuous and she wants to be a writer; Meg wants to get married and be a housewife; Beth, the most sweet, loves helping people; and, Amy wants to be an important person somehow. Through many years of their lives we learn how they succed --or fail-- in their ambition.Alcott's novel became a paradigma of the condition of American Women during the civil war. Each girl can be seen as a possibility of what women had for their future by that time. Maybe this is why this novel is so timeless. The writer didn't want to make a sociological analysis of that period, but her work is very helpful, once it is quite reliable as a portrait of that society.This novel deserves to be read over and over again, and not only by little women."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is a story of four sisters with thier own point of views. This book has a very strong romantic field, but yet it has all of our child hood fantacies. The story is about four remarkable young girls, and as the pages turn they all grow up. Each one finds thier own love but desperate times happen more often. I love this book and, I think that this is a remarkable story of four sisters growing up together. As you read this book you may feel sad but everyone faces tough times. So read this book, It truly is worth reading."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is a charming book for all ages old and young. It has been cherished in our libraries for so many years and it never gets old. The story is one of four sisters battling not only with perosnal issues but family issues. The March family is not exaclty wealthy and they must find their money is places they wish not to. But despite their financial issues the sisters make believe they live in other places, putting on theatricals, plays, making up clubs and tellong their most apauling secrets. With their father in the Civil War and their mother having the reputation of helping a young black girl, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy must search for ways to fit in. The book tells their story from when they are young girls in the Pickwick Portfoliio, to young women getting married and having a family of their own.I can relate to this book a lot because having sisters of my own I went and still go through a lot of the same things. When my sisters and I were little girls we played with eachother and made up games together much like the March sisters. And as we a growing older we find that life is not always as simple as when we were kids, like Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy all find out together. The book captures the essence and wonderful things to come when you have a sister that you love and care for and can tell all your secrets to. When you doubt yourself your sister will back you up and love you no matter what. There is nothing like a sister and to quote the book, \\" a sister's bond is one which that is stronger than marriage\\"."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"I read this book when I was 12 and I can't remember how many times I've read it in total.

The merit is the popularity of this book which gives some insight into the 18th century ways of life, which in some aspects is quite modern!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Very long and boring never read this book you will regret it with all your life trust me and my friends we all read this and we all hate it!!!!&"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Nothing like a classic novel to cozy up to on a winter day! I have always loved this story, especially the movie! I am so happy this is on my Kindle instead of lugging the book around!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The novel, Little Women, By Louisa May Alcott is what people would consider to be a classic real life novel. It tells about the lives of young people and all the events they must go through. The girls in this novel have to go through a death of a sister, a person that they all love more than life itself, the girls must grow up with their father in the war, forcing them to try and earn money for their family, and there is many other problems these girls must face. Even with all the troubles they had, they never let it get to them because they still tried hard in whatever they came across and respected and loved one another until the end. This book inspires readers because of the commitment of one of the sisters, Jo, and how she never stopped believing in her dream to be a writer, and how she felt committed to the family more than anyone else why her father was away. This book teaches young and even older girls how to live their lives. The girls in this novel learn everything from their mother and she is confident in all of them. This story shows the true meaning of love between a family."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The heartwarming book, Little Women, has won its readers love and support. The generalized assessment shows fondness to the realistic viewpoint of the lives of Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy and descriptive details that transport the reader into the beloved fairy tale. The plot of the story centers upon the girls' lives as they grow up during the Civil War. Each of the girls is extremely distinct in their character, taste, and dreams for their future. The positive role model and personal advisor to all of the girls is Mrs. March. I feel that she advised all of her daughter in making good decisions, except for when she agreed with Jo that Laurie was not a suitable match. The change the girls undergo as they get older is completely intriguing as each has special qualities and drawbacks to their character. The realistic aspects of the tale is one of my favorite characteristics of Louisa May Alcott's writing style. The detailed descriptions sent picturesque scenes through my mind. The variety of emotions throughout the duration of the book takes the reader on an emotional roller coaster ride."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This timeless classic still makes me cry, still makes me laugh and still seems fresh, every single time I reread it! My mum read it as did her mum probably, I've read it over and over and now my two teenagers are reading it. I used to recite my own version of this wonderful story when my children were young girls. They loved it! Of course, they weren't quite old enough back then to fully understand or appreciate Louisa May Alcott's version so I'd improvise for them. They would hear about all the fun times the sisters had during the Civil War era. The games they played, how Amy (May) used to draw on her bedroom walls. You see, the wonderful thing about living in this suburb of Boston is the fact that I can drive 15 miles into Concord. Of course, as soon as my girls were old enough, off we went, to the Alcott house where we visited this big rambling house which they'd heard me talk about and by now, had seen in the movies. They SAW Amy's bedroom drawings all over her bedroom wall and her dresses laid out on her bed. They saw everything first hand which was a real treat for them. They didn't seem to enjoy the trip up to the old cemetery where Louise and her 'real life' sisters lay. Not quite as entertaining to youngsters...ha ha. I seem to have told you about the thrill of being able to actually visit the real Alcott surroundings, which seem to be stuck in a time warp with all the original old furnishings inside. So, back to the book. Need I even say it! I'm sure everyone who visits this site has read this wonderful book about a New England family growing up and their many adventures. Sure, we all know Louisa changed the names of her sisters then wrote a book around their lives. You can read this book a million times and never tire of it so imagine how I felt, looking at the actual sites and just imagining in my mind! I saw my girls eyes open wide in wonder! No, not everyone can come to Concord to see the Alcott house but you can pick up this book for your teenagers or just read it again yourself! In case you didn't guess, I LOVE this book. Please read it! As my daughters are right now...and so on...and so on...and so on...."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"The four March girls (Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy) come of age in Civil War America in this classic from Louisa May Alcott.This is a morality tale in which the girls experience separation from a parent (Dad is off to fight for the Union), caring for each other and their mother, travel, loss and death, love, marriage and most of the life experiences one might expect a young woman to encounter.My abridged edition proved to be a good reader... The story held her interest and the experiences of the sisters almost always led to good discussions about dating, loss, marriage, caring and the other topics Ms. Alcott does a good job of rostering up a chapter at a time.A good book for the elementary school set."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little women is a very heartwarming book it is about four sisters and their family, and what they go through. I think that what makes this book so heartwarming is, because of the fact that they deal with normal everyday problems. With most books they don't have too much reality involved, but Little Women does. The Marches family is a really close family who sticks together through everything that happens to them. None of the sisters are alike they all have different personalities, which is probably another reason why I like this book. Meg is the mature one, she is also very pretty. She is sixteen years old. Jo is the adventurous one; she wants to be a write. Beth is the very fragile one, and Amy is the one who is pampered. She puts everyone before herself. Marmee, the mother is all alone taking care of her children, because the father had to go fight for the north. The mother takes care of the children very well. She gives them lots of love and tender loving care. To me the mother seems like a second mother to me, because she seemed so real. I'm sure anyone who has read this book, and who doesn't have a mother thiks of Mrs. Marches as a mother to them. To me I think the funniest part was when the one sister cuts off the other sisters hair. The saddest part was when one of the sisters die. Yes, I did shed a tear when Laurie who is the Marches' neighbor proposed to Jo, and yet Jo turned his offer down. So, basically I would say that this book is somewhat humurous at points and somewhat sad at points. I'm not a book reader, actually I hate reading, but this book was a definite page-turner. I liked this book very much; I couldn't put it down. It took me about five days to read it, which is how good it was. Between a scale from one to ten, I would definitely give it a ten. Thsi book I would say is about four hundred and fifty pages. I wouldn't reccomend this book for anyone under the age of eleven."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This is how my life used to be: I get home from school, wander around in the pantry for awhile wondering what to eat, snatch a bag of chips, grab the comics, sit down and read the &quot;Marvin&quot; and &quot;Pickles&quot; comic strips. Marvin's fun to read, and the Pickles' characters, Earl and Opal, put on an entertaining show. That was the past. Now I've found a book that sends Marvin, Earl, and Opal packing. When I started to read Little Women, things dramatically changed. It was good-bye to Marvin, Earl and Opal and hello to Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. It was Little Women before food. It was Little Women first. Because of poverty, the characters stumble over many rocks on the road of their lives. Once in a while, they find a golden nugget lying in their path. In Little Women, author Louisa May Allcott shows the life of four sisters. Meg is a quiet proper young lady, who in spite of here desire of wealth, falls in love with her neighbor's poor tutor. Jo is the wild one with the lowest amount of properness and the highest amount of dreams. She is a young and talented writer and finds a deep friendship with the neighbor boy, Laurie, because of their great similarities. Amy is the artist. Her wish is to be popular at school. She is proper and receives great credit for it. As for Beth, she has nothing to look forward to. This frail young girl knows her future and has no wish other then love and happiness. Now I leave you, my friend, to find the future of these women by picking up the book and entering their lives."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"Little Women is the best book I have ever read. The heartwarming story of the four sisters Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy is a classic everyone should grow to read and love. The story depicts one family's hope and strength to overcome one struggle after another. This story is wonderful for both children and adults, and it really shows how close families can be and how their love can affect one another. I think that anyone in need in a good book to read whenever should pick up Little Women by Louisa May Alcott. The sequels Little Men and Jo's Boys also give readers the stories of the March family after Little Women ends. Five stars for sure!!"},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"When I first read &quot;Little Women&quot; I was twelve years old and now, several years later, it is still my favorite book. One of the reasons for that is that the book is effidently written with much love and feeling, which is quite understandable, knowing that it is based on Louisa Alcott's own life. It is really tragic when one finds out what Louisa's real life was like and the way she describes it in &quot;Little Women&quot;. It is as if she were decribing the life she wished for, while she tries at the same time to depict the truth. The way she describes the family life is heartwarming and I always hope that my children will love me as much as the March girls love their mother. The book is a picture of love, confidence and goodness. Some people may say it is too soft and moralistic, but I think that it can't do any harm to think about that once in a while. I mean, what is wrong with being good? The March girls are not saints, not even Beth, but they try to be as good as possible and many people should try that too. This book is most surely the loveliest story I have ever read and probably the best I'll ever read. And I don't think I am alone in that, otherwise it wouldn't be so popular today, over a hundred years after its first publication."},{"Title":"Little women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy","review":"This was a well written book by Alcott.

(Picture Puffins)","review":"ISBN 0805053883 - Curious to know what a polar would hear... I'm just a wee bit disappointed because I still don't know. The fact that this book is by the author ofChicka Chicka Boom Boom (Book& CD)was an added attraction because Bill Martin Jr's always a favorite here.What does a polar bear hear? He hears the sounds of the animals around him in the zoo! The sounds they make aren't the traditional, and fairly boring, \\"meow\\" of a cat or \\"woof\\" of a dog, either. There's the peacock yelping and a flamingo fluting and so much more.The unusual animal sounds will no doubt present parents with a challenge. How many can imitate a snorting hippo or the bellow of a walrus? Children will enjoy the effort, of course, and the book serves the purpose of introducing more uncommon animals than most. To make it work, I'd suggest taking it along to the zoo, seeking out the animals inside and learning their noises - adding an extra level of education AND fun.

(Picture Puffins)","review":"I enjoyed this book when I was little because of the great pictures and the unique or weirder animals rather than the every day animals. This helps learn more animals and to hear the noises they make. That is one of the most exciting things about this book, people trying to impersonate the noises that a wild animal makes. This also teaches kids what noise each animal makes This book was newer when I was in about forth grade and I liked it then even."},{"Title":"Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear?

We cut out circles and squares and then glued them on paper and told our own story. I love being able to take a book and do activities that jump off of the book pages. My almost three year old son does too.The story is simple and fun. The repetitive nature of this book makes it great for pre readers. With a little bit of practice your child can memorize the book to 'read' it to others. What an ego boost.I like the last page with all the kids acting out the parts of the animals. One day I will make some masks with my son....enjoy."},{"Title":"Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear?

It is great at involving the readers with the experience."},{"Title":"Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear? (Picture Puffins)","review":"This is my son Tyler's (17 mos) favorite book. He loves the colorful pictures and loves it even more when Mommy tries to make all the animal noises for him! (Ever try to make a yelping peacock or fluting flamingo noise??) No matter how many times I read this book to him, he wants to hear it just one more time...ok, maybe two...or three... I especially love the fact that it is about more unusual animals - peacock, flamingo, walrus, as opposed to your everyday dog, cat, cow -type animals. I highly recommend this book, it's a must have!"},{"Title":"Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear? (Picture Puffins)","review":"This is a really good book for all ages.

However, the obscure animals do not make for good sound affects. While it is easy to hiss like a snake and growl like a polar bear, how do you flute like a flamingo or brey like a zebra? Nonetheless, the book is great for teaching colors and new animals. It has the same charming illustrations that Brown Bear has. (My daughter loves the elephant!) I recommend this book for the vivid colors and pictures, but not for animal sounds. It would compliment your child's book collection wonderfully!"},{"Title":"Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear?

(Picture Puffins)","review":"This is a fun interactive book about the animals in the zoo and the sounds they make. It's a great vocabulary builder, since it uses words that small kids may not hear every day. The book is quite enjoyable for kids who like animals, and not at all scary. The story may get kids wound up, however, so it might not be the best choice for a bedtime story. The book has about 200 words."},{"Title":"Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear? (Picture Puffins)","review":"Small children (18 mos-4yrs) will enjoy mimicking the animal sounds and following along with the melody of this tale. The repetition of the story, as with many of Mr. Carle's books, helps my 2-yr old child participate and enjoy the reading experience to the fullest. These are his favorite books."},{"Title":"Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear? (Picture Puffins)","review":"Okay, so you might not be able to make the sounds of the animals (what does a walrus and flamingo really sound like anyway?) but the words they use in this book really help out. With words like &quot;snarling&quot; or &quot;hissing&quot; or &quot;yelping&quot; or trumpeting&quot;, it's easy to change your voice and use your body and face to &quot;become&quot; the appropriate animal when you read those words. My 2-year old daughter listened carefully when I read the book for the first time, then took the book and &quot;read&quot; it back to me. Well, she only got the &quot;(animal name), (animal name), what do you see?&quot; as she paged through the book but it only took a few more days before she pretty much memorized all the lines. This only happens with a few books (like The Napping House or Clothesline) so I was pretty surprised. I think it's great for kids to learn other animal names, like peacock and hippopatamus, and other words like for the sounds they make. It gets tiring to always read about puppies and kittens or farm and jungle animals."},{"Title":"Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear?

He shrieks with delight as he hears us make the animal sounds and sees the colorful illustration, Mr. Carle is so well known for. My question is, What next? When can we expect the next in series of wonderful tales of animals living in perfect harmony, accompanied by the beautiful illustrations??"},{"Title":"Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear? (Picture Puffins)","review":"What I had expected in this book was the onomatopoeia (\\"buzz\\", \\"meow\\", etc.) that is usual to other books about animal noises.Although this book used some familiar terms, many of the terms for animal sounds were confusing to my daughter. For example, I had a difficult time explaining what \\"fluting\\" might sound like, since I really don't know what a flamingo sounds like (I live in the frozen Midwest). It's also hard to explain \\"trumpeting\\" to someone who doesn't know or understand what a trumpet is.The text flows beautifully, the repetition is soothing to little ears and Eric Carle's illustrations are always a treat. Despite this, I can't recommend this book as highly as some other reviewers have.I know that my disappointment stems from the fact that I had planned to use this book to explain the sounds that some exotic animals make. I really don't need this book just for the repetition and poetry, I think that the \\"Brown Bear...\\" book by the same team does a better job at that task."},{"Title":"Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear? (Picture Puffins)","review":"This companion book to Carle's \\"Brown Bear, Brown Bear\\" is another winner. Rather than focusing on the visual, it focuses on the auditory: \\"Polar Bear, Polar Bear, what do you hear? I hear a lion, roaring in my ear; lion, lion, what do you hear...\\" The illustrations are big and captivating and the phrasing hard to beat for young children learning how to read. Along with Brown Bear, my 3 year old memorized this book after just a few readings and now reads it aloud to anyone who will listen. My only very tiny complaint is the choice of words in two cases: does a peacock really \\"yelp\\" or does a flamingo really \\"flute.\\" Not sure about that. In any case, this is a classic."},{"Title":"Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear? (Picture Puffins)","review":"Your two and a half year old can read this book by him/herself after you read it with them a few times! It is my daughter's favorite just like the Brown Bear, Brown Bear what do you see? book by the same author. The kids like to peep at the next page and see which animal it next and then read it. They learn a lot of new words from this book such as hissing, braying, bellowing, etc. And the most impressive thing is my daughter has learnt how to pronounce certain hard words from this author's books and she does just fine. At her age, she can actually say &quot;boa constrictor&quot; (one of the animals in the book) very clearly and with such innocence she reads the third last page as follows: &quot;zoo peeker, zoo peeker, what do you hear? instead of zookeeper zookeeper! Thank you Bill Martin Jr and Eric Carle, for creating this book. I have had this book for months and my daughters still love it. It is nothing but the BEST !!!!"},{"Title":"Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear?

Even though the whole focus of the book is animals making sounds, a large proportion are basically impossible for a human being to imitate: e.g., Hippopotamus, Flamingo, Peacock, Elephant or Walrus. It's a lot easier to just add sound effects to the animals in Brown Bear, almost all of which can be easily imitated."},{"Title":"Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear?

This might be one of my son's top 3 books since the age of 6 months simply because he has so much fun listening to me (or any of us) making the sounds of the animals. Actually, I think he saw us more than he saw the book in his first year, because he was just fascinated by all the sounds! This is not to take credit away from the book - were it not for the book, those opportunities would not have been created. Super book, and totally essential to the baby collection."},{"Title":"Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear?

Rather than an alphabetical organization, it is organized by \\"saint days\\" (I'm not sure that that is the correct phrasing).

These are notes D. L. Moody made in his Bible and their relevancy is very much still applicable. I found perspectives here that I have not read anywhere else.Moody connects various Scriptures together holistically, showing the relationship one has to the other. At times he juxtaposed contrasts such as: \\"If we are quiet, we shall hear. (Eccl. 9:17). If we hear, we shall be quiet (Prov. 1:33)\\" on page 191. And on page 72, \\"Fear should lead to faith.

I also dare to suggest that old cronies like me, whether formally or informally trained, will gleam usefulness from these pages, so much so, that the price of this book is way too cheap given the benefits realized.If ever you wish to read a book about Wicca, Witchcraft, Paganism or Spirituality this really should be the one you read: first, now...sometime.

It is a work of contradictions, searching yet grounded; hungry yet consumed; concerned with metaphysical matters yet held to time and place with a crafted and careful naming of those things that are Tipton's life. We are invited to join in a dance of bees, high desert sage, Colorado canyon landscape, Peruvian tourism, longing, loneliness, and loving.Tipton's restlessness is a discomfort and an example of one seeking and finding a connection through the stuff of the world, a world that is chocked full like a vivid dream, unfettered and embracing. These Letters are ones of love for they expose the author inside and out, a challenge to what we are willing to give away to strangers. The language of Letters From a Stranger is ecstatic and surreal with images of love and the landscape interspersed with pieces of personal information.In It Is True That I Lack Focus, we find a man examining his strengths and weaknesses outloud. He confesses, \\"It is true that I remain clumsy...\\", but knows what is good in himself and for him. As honest and local as one can be in Those Evenings When All of God's Conundrums he admits,\\"...what I lack in purity of spiritual intention I compensate for in purity of desperation; and some compensation, unexpected, sets in, like the subdued pain in the ring finger from the bite of the Black Widow six weeks ago;\\"Again Tipton looks to find how his happiness might be made in Being Stubborn,\\"Being stubborn is the only thing that ever brought me is this place I have come to, where caught in God's own curfew I wander through this late house, realizing longing is the hardest wing of the gossamer child?\\" from-- What Is This Place I Have Come To?Here is the tale of a man who has abandoned the comforts of one life or several, to find that which is dear and true about life, love, and his inner being. It is informative that we are told Tipton has a dog, named Ananda, a cat, named Gosi, and lives in Glade Park, Colorado on top of a mesa. It is through how we are told these things that the craft of poetry lives and opens to us like the flower to Tipton's beloved bees. His abstract as those words are, these poems are immediate, emotional, and full to the top of loving and life. These Letters are missives sent out without need of recompense. They make the world a richer place for us all"},{"Title":"Letters from a Stranger","review":"His poems made me laugh and cry and remember what poets are supposed to do. Tipton is among the best because he writes for all of us. His poetry arises from the longing that makes us human beyond the labels, the money, the education or profession. Having nothing to do with poetic vanity, intellectual games or self-indulgence, it is accessible to everyone. Whether you are a lover of poetry or one who has never found it appealing, I hope you will treat yourself to this rare and wonderful book."},{"Title":"Letters from a Stranger","review":"The poetry of James Tipton collected in Letters From A Stranger is unique, engaging, splendidly crafted, and enduringly memorable. A Stray God, Or A Thump In The Night: A stray God, or a thump in the night,/or a cathedral bell far off/begins its steady prayer,/coming closer and closer until/I wake on this damp hill and realize/the bell that woke me/is this very heart,/a prodigal sound come home.//Putting consciousness together, I do/simple things: &quot;two and five make four,/and then ten&quot;; still nothing, nothing but/the mother of breathing/beneath me, nothing but the fragrance/of hill, the head of stars in the cool night,/nothing but the rivers inside pulled awake/by the Pope on the moon, by the mist/at the edge of a woman in another galaxy."},{"Title":"Letters from a Stranger","review":"Would that we all could receive Letters from a Stranger. The story behind this book (told by Isabelle Allende in the introduction) is one of old-fashioned romance, mystery and curiousity. This is a book that surpasses its introduction. Poem after poem, Jim Tipton shares with the reader his passionate treasure chest. His images range from familiar (window shades) to shocking (feet found in the desert). Every line sings with wanton beauty and longing. Tipton is a seeker who has found the key to poetry, yet keeps searching. This is a book to cherish, to share and to snuggle with all by yourself. Read the poems out loud ... there's a magic to these words that you'll discover when you speak them. Letters from a Stranger is a triumph for the West."},{"Title":"Letters from a Stranger","review":"James Tipton is the greatest living American poet. His most recent work Letters from a Stranger reverberates among the mesas and canyonlands of the American West, finding joy in the love of a dog, a solitary trek across the desert, a ray of sunlight illuminating a jar of honey on a windowsill. With a unique insight into the depths and complexities of human life, Tipton examines the riddles and paradoxes of the universe and emerges from the experience with words of gold that celebrate life and love, beauty and simple goodness. His work will be required reading for generations of students of literature and will stand for all time as a living monument to its creator."},{"Title":"A Parent's Guide to Special Education in New York City and the Metropolitan Area","review":"This book is a priceless gift to parents who are navigating the special education system in New York City. It is written in an accessible style by a special educator with 30+ years of experience and by a mom who has successfully advocated for her child for eight years.When I entered the world of special education with my son 14 years ago, there were no internet searches to be done and no books like this one to be read, although I often perused the shelves at Barnes & Noble praying for a book just like this one. At that time, information was exchanged by parents on the playground and in professionals' waiting rooms. Now it is all gathered in one place, in one all-inclusive book.A comprehensive overview of the special education process in NYC, including referrals and evaluations, eligibility criteria, the IEP and parents' rights precedes an exhaustive section on private school placement. Profiles of 33 private special education schools, followed by a list of schools by classification, a sample referral letter, checklist for school visits, checklist for applications and a glossary, make this book a highly practical tool. The resources section encompasses evaluation centers, therapists, medical professionals, web sites, attorneys, after school programs, and summer camps and can save parents immeasurable time and put them in touch with parent-recommended resources.This book is a must-have for any parent involved in the special education process. It reminded me of all of the wonderful parents and professionals I was fortunate enough to meet along this road."},{"Title":"A Parent's Guide to Special Education in New York City and the Metropolitan Area","review":"If you're navigating the maze of special education in New York, you need this book as a guide. It's a superb resource & we found an appropriate school for our child, thanks to this book."},{"Title":"A Parent's Guide to Special Education in New York City and the Metropolitan Area","review":"I wish this book had been around eight years ago when I was trying to navigate the special education maze. The good news is that it's here now, and there is finally a book I can recommend to anyone who needs the latest information on evaluations, referrals, testing, and schools. The co-authors are a Ph.d. in special education who became the founder and head of a special education school, and a mom who has hands-on experience in the special education world. The result is a readable and informative guide to the special ed world that encapsulates the experiece of this world from both sides of the fence in a seamless, practical guidebook, in which all the necessary information is presented with professionalism and empathy. P.S. . . . A few months later . . . I just got back from my local Barnes & Noble where this book was sold out. I wanted to pick up a few copies to keep on hand to give to friends, because this is a book you don't get back when you lend it out! Although my son now has an appropriate school placement and is thriving, in part thanks to the widsom and support of the authors of this book, it is my main reference when I get calls from people who've heard I've been there, done that. So, gotta go order those copies, but believe me, this book is \\"Still the One\\"!Bookless in Manhattan"},{"Title":"A Parent's Guide to Special Education in New York City and the Metropolitan Area","review":"I would state unequivocally that every parent, educator, medical personnel, social worker and therapist should have this book -- it is the first concise, straightforward view of the system. While most parents of special needs kids become quite savvy at the system over time, this book would have saved me hours of headaches, heartaches and trauma if it had been available when I was first entering the system with my son fifteen years ago -- even so, it still has great information (summaries of over 30 private schools, lists of OT, PT and ST, lists of evaluators, and best of all, definitions that have been a mystery, i.e. I FINALLY know the difference between a psychoed and a neuropsychoed eval!). As you can tell, I highly recommend it. The only negative - it really deals with only the first 16 years in the system - I really wish the authors would consider doing a part 2 - middle school and beyond!!!"},{"Title":"A Parent's Guide to Special Education in New York City and the Metropolitan Area","review":"There are so many books out there, this one I highly recommend.In a nutshell: THE BASIC 5-STEP CHECKLIST was really helpful, They are: 1) Identifying Your Child's Need's. 2) Informing Yourself. 3) Educating Your Child. 4)Entering the World of Special Education. 5) Locating a School. (My only complaint is that I almost missed it - as it was in the Introduction section of the book, and I don't always read that. If you buy this book don't skip the Preface and Introduction.)The book then addresses each of these processes, in a really concise way. In the middle of the book there is a section called School Profiles that gives a really informative description of Special education schools. the authors write that they personally visited each school and met with the directors, saw the programs first hand, gathered all the relevant criteria. I don't know of another book that has this type of detailed information.The sections on how to apply to a school, how to prepare yourself and your child, how to work with the CSE (Committee on Special Education) and the DOE (Department of Education) are full of information that I was able to personally follow and recommend to others.It's also endorsed by Michele Shackelford, Program Director for the Center for Attention & Learning Disorders, Lenox Hill Hospital NYC."},{"Title":"A Parent's Guide to Special Education in New York City and the Metropolitan Area","review":"This book is a valuable resource for any parent trying to navigate the special ed system in NYC."},{"Title":"A Parent's Guide to Special Education in New York City and the Metropolitan Area","review":"I am a special educator, and I frequently give this book to parents who want their children enrolled in schools for special needs children. It is a very valuable resource to, both, parents and educators."},{"Title":"A Parent's Guide to Special Education in New York City and the Metropolitan Area","review":"my only complaint is that this guide has not appeared in editions for every city and county in the United States. For any parent navigating the unique world of special learning, this book is essential. Not only are we dealing with intensely emotional issues regarding our children, but we face the highly mysterious world of finding appropriate help. Written from the perspective of a parent and a specialist in the field - this book clearly and compassionately takes parents by the hand and leads them through the world of special learning. Even if you do not live in New York City, the process and key aspects of getting help is outlined, made clear - steps you need to take and in what order are laid out. Thank you to Jana Fromer and Laurie Dubos for giving parents a huge embrace and huge empowerment."},{"Title":"A Parent's Guide to Special Education in New York City and the Metropolitan Area","review":"As a psychologist in NYC, I've been involved in the special education world of NYC for many years. It is important for accurate information to be readily available to parents and professionals. However, sadly, this book does not deliver. The descriptions in the book of the private special ed. schools in NYC are full of inaccurate information (including what ages the schools take and what diagnoses), which may put parents off some programs and have them pursuing others that are not apprpriate for their children. Additionally, there are recommendations the authors make to parents, such as suggesting that parents withhold certain information about their children from schools they are applying to, which could be potentially damaging to the child ultimately. It is important for parents to be open and forthcoming about who their children are, in order for schools and therapists to determine if they are a good match to work effectively with the child. I've seen many cases in which parents withheld information about their child which may have allowed their child to be accepted to a program initially, only to have that program ultimately ask the child to leave. It is damaging for children to be put into programs they are not ready for and then to be switched from one program to another.Lastly, a little comment about a parent's review who said he/she now finally understood the difference between psycho-educational and neuropsychological evaluations because of this book - the description in the book about the difference between a psycho-educational and a neuropsychological evaluation is not accurate either. Many professionals and schools actually use these terms inter-changeably, so I would recommend asking the individual professional what exactly their evaluation entails.Parents are a vulnerable group who understandably will seek out as much information as possible in order to help their children. When inaccurate and incomplete information is published as fact, this is horribly mis-leading and ultimately not helpful to a group of parents and children with real needs. It is really a shame that the editors/publishers of this book were not more careful in examining the accuracy of the material in it."},{"Title":"A Parent's Guide to Special Education in New York City and the Metropolitan Area","review":"As a professional in the field of early childhood special education in NYC I can vouch for the need for what this book promises. Unfortunately for those of us that know the field and NYC it does not deliver. It is full of inaccurate and misleading information from beginning to end. The fact that some parents are raving about it says more to me about the confusing red tape parents have to go through rather than the helpfulness and clarity of this book.To parents who want some help- Resources for Children with Special Needs and each boroughs Early Childhood Direction Center offer *excellent* free guidance. (And I am not affiliated w/ either though I am grateful for the real wisdom their employees tirelessly offer to parents *and* professionals.)"},{"Title":"Soma in Biblical Theology: With Emphasis on Pauline Anthropology","review":"Gundry tackles Bultmann's existential reading of 'soma' and finds it...wanting. Okay, just plain wrong.Bultmann, who cast such a long shadow in biblical studies, had been heavily under the influence of existentialism. Like far too many biblical scholars, Bultmann mistook the current fads of his day for the historical Jesus. In light of this, he called those who had translated 'soma' in its most obvious meaning--a physical body--naive.Of course, most of Bultmann's theories are now refuted or under attack.Gundry's investigation into soma is very thorough. It is difficult to imagine how anyone could marshal a defense of Bultmann's interpretation after reading this book.After long investigation, Gundry points out that \\"within Pauline passages...soma denotes the physical body, roughly synonymous with 'flesh'\\" (p 50).Bultmann, Gundry points out, talks about how sin is nothing but self estrangement. \\"Self integration constitutes authentic existence; self-estrangement constitutes inauthentic existence. Again, Heideggerian forms of thought...rise to the surface\\" (p 205). It is hard not to smile at existential concepts mashed onto early Christian thought.There was an idea current in the ancient world which placed evil wholly in the body, an idea which later influenced some Gnostic philosophical schools. But \\"The Pauline answer is to locate evil throughout the whole man, willing spirit and acting body alike\\" (p 216).A rewarding book to pick up."},{"Title":"Archduke of Sarajevo The Romance & Tragedy of Franz Ferdinand of Austria","review":"Brook-Shepherd, a longtime European correspondent for the British newspaper _Daily Telegraph_, has put in a great deal of effort and time into the research on this book. As he wrote in the 1980's, he had access to Sophie, the last surviving child (and the firstborn) of Franz Ferdinand and Duchess Sophie of Hohenberg, and conducted extensive interviews with her and other descendants of the murdered pair which provided fascinating insights into their ancestors' private lives and personalities.Brook-Shepherd's portrait of the Archduke is simultaneously balanced and sympathetic. He carefully examines the complicated political issues which confronted Austria-Hungary, and which Franz Ferdinand would have had to confront in his turn had he survived to ascend the Hapsburg throne. Intertwined with these affairs of state, he presents a comprehensive portrait of the Archduke as a person, offering strong evidence for the proposition that Franz Ferdinand's notorious bad temper and misanthropy were in large part driven by the nasty slights both small and large inflicted on his wife Sophie, the great love of his life.Illustrated with a good number of high-quality black-and-white photographs. Recommended."},{"Title":"Trusted Platform Module Basics: Using TPM in Embedded Systems (Embedded Technology)","review":"Wow, where to start? I guess with the introduction that contains errors of fact - RSA does not stand for random scheduling algorithm. This gets the book of to a really bad start and it just lurches along from there. This book is just full of details without any relevant context. The first chapter tells what calls to use to initialize the TPM for memory present and memory absent implementations, but doesn't define the difference between memory present and memory absent and why you would choose one over the other. Let alone not providing a context chapter and jumping right into providing call details. The writing style is the most confusing thing that I have ever run across, with irrelevant clauses included that just confuse the situation. I had to read it with a pen and cross out all of the irrelevant parts and then re-read the paragraph in order to understand it. It's a stream of conciousness technical book. As hard as the TCG specifications are to understand, this book doesn't make them any easier. I was hoping for a guided trip through the architecture to prepare me for tackling the specifications. I think the specifications are easier to read directly than this book.I've been in the computer industry 20 years and never have I encountered such a poorly written work."},{"Title":"Trusted Platform Module Basics: Using TPM in Embedded Systems (Embedded Technology)","review":"Wow. As an engineer, I've read some seriously bad writing, but rarely does a technical book plead so convincingly for review by a competent editor. The book is so littered with \\"with regards to,\\" \\"relative to,\\" \\"concerning,\\" and \\"it is safe to say that,\\" I'd swear it would shrink by half if only the author had the vaguest familiarity with the work of Professors Strunk and White. The passive voice has never found a more welcoming home. And you know you're in for a rough ride when you find the publisher's name misspelled on the very first page (it's \\"Newnes,\\" not \\"Newness\\").On top of that, the author insists on promoting his employer's products, and spends half a chapter ranting about \\"hackers\\" who levied \\"malicious attacks\\" on their Xboxes by installing Linux on them. Simply unprofessional.As for content, the book promises early on to guide embedded systems developers in implementing TPM in their designs, but ends up devoting far more space to niggling protocol details than to suggestions on their use.There's some good information buried somewhere in this book, but unless you have a babelfish handy, I'd recommend you hold your nose and read the freely-available TPM specifications rather than spending money on this volume."},{"Title":"Trusted Platform Module Basics: Using TPM in Embedded Systems (Embedded Technology)","review":"There is not a whole lot to complain about. This is the only book I found with no mention of having to use operating systems calls, which when working with embedded micro controllers is usually irrelevant. It gives a step by step detail low level walk through of each command which is helpful if your trying to wade through the spec. I got both the IBM press book and found it to be a good overview, but not much help when it comes to the low level interfacing and non-os work. There are some mistakes, but this is a pretty small niche area to develop on, I'm really surprised there are any book written on it at this level at all."},{"Title":"Trusted Platform Module Basics: Using TPM in Embedded Systems (Embedded Technology)","review":"The book may have some writing issues as Kinney writes in a very informal style. But engineers aren't known for their writing - they're known for building things. We are also known for being very critical.Still, his book provides a basic background in trusted computing and the cryptography implemented using TPMs. It's main focus is explaining the various Trusted Platform Module (TPM) commands used within the TCG v1.1b spec. There is a chapter on some of the differences between v1.1b and v1.2. I would have liked to see some very basic c programs included to get a better feel of actually using the commands together. That would be my only real complaint.The author does have some pride toward the product he helped develop. But from talk within the TCG community, he no longer works for Atmel, where he helped developed the TPM firmware. So he's not trying to sell anything he can profit from. I think he's just proud of his team's work."},{"Title":"Trusted Platform Module Basics: Using TPM in Embedded Systems (Embedded Technology)","review":"I work for the company that makes the TPM's in the book, and the company that Steve used to work for. This book is simply wrong in many places. Steve blamed the editor for \\"correcting\\" the book. Go get the IBM press book or just read standards on the TCG site. We use the copies we have (we got a case of them) to level wobbly desks."},{"Title":"Leo Kottke Transcribed","review":"I love this book, this was the first book I purchased, authored by Mark Hanson. The most of the material is challenging. A &quot;Trout Towards Noon&quot; is on the easy side, so start with that on. I found the accompaning cassette to be very useful. Mark plays the tune at half speed, which allows you play along at some speed. His verbal notes on the recording are very useful to."},{"Title":"Leo Kottke Transcribed","review":"Love the stuff Mark Hanson does. He really teaches you how to play these songs note for note.

Book will keep you busy for a while....."},{"Title":"Leo Kottke Transcribed","review":"Received this book a few weeks ago and have been doggedly working on \\"William Powell\\", one of my Kottke favorites but a really challenging piece for an intermediate guitarist. It's made wonderfully accessible by Mark Hanson's notes and the accompanying CD - I find that hearing a song at half speed is an incredible learning tool. I can now play a recognizable, if decidedly watered down, version of the song. With Hanson's help I'm picking up more of the nuances that make the song a masterpiece and improving my playing A LOT. This is an excellent book."},{"Title":"The Smart Card Report, Seventh Edition","review":"An excellent survey of the Smart Card industry for 2001. And still very relevant. It describes the state of the art in terms of the technical capabilities of the latest cards. Plus the possible directions of advance suggested by the major players.The competencies of the latter are also well outlined. So the book is not just for the engineer. Marketing and financial analysts may well find it of use in their fields.One related type of card, that uses RFID, may be on the verge of huge growth. Its cost of production is steadily falling, and may plummet if it is broadly adopted in a mass market. Interested readers should check this out."},{"Title":"The Lion in Autumn: A Season with Joe Paterno and Penn State Football","review":"As a Penn State freshman and one who grew up hearing of Joe Paterno only infrequently, this book was a satisfying and appropriate introduction to the living legend Head Coach of Penn State football. On the forieth anniversary of his position as Head Coach, and his 55th year as a Penn State coach, it is fitting that Fitzpatrick's book be published now.With the Nittany Lions back in position to possibly even play in the Rose Bowl (and even if not the Rose Bowl, definitely some type of bowl game), assuming Penn State beats Michigan State this weekend to capture our second Big Ten title and Bowl Championship Series bid. With \\"Happy Valley\\" happy again and our Nittany Lions ranked #4 in the nation with what should have been a perfect 10-0 season thus far, had it not been for poor officiating in the Oct. 15 game at Michigan, this text highlights Paterno's career up to this point for anyone interested - and everyone in State College should be.Although this is not an \\"official\\" biography and even though the author failed to secure more than one personal meeting with Paterno himself, the book is still a fascinating read due to the vast amount of background material Fitzpatrick was able to glean off various other sources and accounts.It's a fast, fascinating and if nothing else, satisfying read. Pick up your copy now if you haven't already. Joe Paterno is still king of Penn State football, even as he turns 79 this December. It's time people got to know the man of character, morals and determination again."},{"Title":"The Lion in Autumn: A Season with Joe Paterno and Penn State Football","review":"One of the great joys of Penn State football fandom is reading books about Coach Paterno and his program. As both a fan and a reader, any disappointment I had with this one was chiefly due to the limited access given to the author. After a nine-loss season in 2003 that marked the nadir of precipitous competitive slide, and an increasing number of off-field incidents, Coach Paterno was understandably guarded -- even abandoning a longstanding tradition of meeting with reporters over cocktails the night before game day. (Stiffing reporters in this fashion was probably an unwise political move that helped to contribute to the \\"JoePa Must Go\\" sentiment.)What then is a writer to do? One approach could have been to chronicle the growing division within the Penn State community -- former players, alumni, students, and the media -- over the tough times in Happy Valley, using a few colorful and outspoken characters as a catalyst for that division.Instead, Mr. Fitzpatrick delivers a fairly straightforward chronicle of the 2005 season's aspirations and disappointments. He does an adept job for those readers who may not be familiar with the programs history, but for those readers who are the chapters on glories past provide no new insight and interrupts the narrative of the current season.Penn State's decline was primarily attributable to lackluster recruiting that produced players unable to compete effectively in the Big Ten, and Mr. Fitzpatrick is spot on when he writes that Paterno was mindful of this: \\"Other teams had more talent than Penn State. But to admit that too often in public was to demean his players.... [He] understood that the quickest solution to the Nittany Lions' troubles would be to search harder and more selectively for talent.\\" (p. 287)Once again, Coach Paterno's refusal to publicly contemplate life after football is highlighted, where is prospective retirement activity has changed over the years from collecting stamps to cutting grass. With the almost immediate death of Alabama's Bear Bryant after his retirement, Mr. Paterno is quite candid about his deep seated fears: \\"I'm alive. I don't want to die. Football keeps me alive.\\" (p. 276) This outlook is quite tragic and perplexing, given his successes off the field as an educator, philanthropist, community leader and family patriarch.In short, this volume does not quite rise to the level of incisiveness of Ken Denlinger's \\"For the Glory\\" or Coach Paterno's decades-old autobiography, which is in desperate need of an update. But it reads quickly and provides and admirable journalistic account of Happy Valley's darkest days in the Paterno era."},{"Title":"The Lion in Autumn: A Season with Joe Paterno and Penn State Football","review":"This is a must read for anyone interested in understanding what leadership is all about. In a profession where winning is everything and a world where loyality and tradition are no longer valued, this book chronicles what happens to a highly successful Division 1A football coach when he is no longer winning games.This book was written before the successful 2005 season for the Penn State football program and Joe Paterno being named AP Coach of the year on his 79th Birthday! All the more reason to read.I think this book is an inspiration for Oldies everywhere. Many people who experience what Joe Paterno went through in the Autumn of their careers, will identify with the choices that he faced when he was no longer valued and respected after a long and successful career.In this world of Free Agency, Joe Paterno is a throw back. This book reminds us that Values, Principles, Tradition, and Loyalty are what really matter.....even in today's world."},{"Title":"The Lion in Autumn: A Season with Joe Paterno and Penn State Football","review":"It is fall : time for college football, books about college football and biographies about legendary dead coaches like \\"The Last Coach: A Life of Paul Bear Bryant\\" by Allen Barra. An exception is \\"The Lion In Autumn\\" about a legendary living coach, Joe Paterno. Entering his 40th season as head coach of the Nittany Lions, Coach Paterno began as an assistant in 1950 and succeeded Rip Engle after his retirement following the 1965 season.Mr. Fitzpatrick covers in passing a half century of coaching at a single institition while focusing on the disastrous 4-7 campaign last year. The author is a sportswriter at the Phildelphia Inquirer who covered the 2004 season from afar (in a buried footnote, he acknowledges that he spoke personally to Coach Paterno only once). Mr. Fitzpatrick synthesizes existing source materials into this book which is a quick read.This account is not the definative story of Joe Paterno (which would be hard as the Nittany Lions has rebounded into a top 20 team once again) but merely an introduction to the man. The definative biography of the man who has won two national championships in major upsets (1982 against Georgia & Hershall Walker and 1986 against Miami & Vinny Testaverde) would be twice as long as \\"The Lion In Autumn\\" and is yet to be written."},{"Title":"The Lion in Autumn: A Season with Joe Paterno and Penn State Football","review":"This book was a great read. It is an inspring book on leadership while telling the story of one of the most legendary college football coaches of all time. Aside from being a great and accomplishing coach, we also read about the passion and effort Joe Paterno put into making Penn State one of the most respectable college institutions in the country. It is through his tireless devotion that Penn State has one of the best football programs in the country while maintaining one of the highest graduation rates as well.I highly enjoyed reading the historical flashbacks in Paternos career. It gave me a glimpse of who he was and how ambitious of a leader he was. It showed how he cared for his students/players and how he cared for the institution in which he represented. This drove him to become the selfless legend that he is today. What was a little less enjoyable were the chapters on the week to week football games of the season being discussed. I found myself skimming quickly through those chapters. In addition, I was a bit disappointed that the season chosen was the 2004 season which resulted in a losing season. A sequel should have been written the next year as history shows that the Lions bounced back and had a great season.Overall, this was a great book as it teaches us a great deal of leadership qualities. In a commercial age where many leaders are driven by money and ego, it is nice for a change to read about a humble leader who cared only about winning and achieving success on a year to year basis with the same team/school for over four decades.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in being inspired and motivated."},{"Title":"The Lion in Autumn: A Season with Joe Paterno and Penn State Football","review":"I thought the book was very good.

The book takes you through the Nittany Lions 2004 season where they finished the disapointing season at 4-7. The book travels through the rough season with an inside look at Penn State football. Week by week the book takes you in depth into what happened during the 2004 season. The book goes in chronological order game after game with recollections of Nittany Lion football pasts along the way. At the end of the book there is an afterword about the Lions next season whre they went 11-1 and finished 3rd in the country.

You don't see him turning away any of the huge salaries or the other luxuries, do you.Paterno comes across as a control freak, if he is trying to prepare his players and assistant coaches for the outside world, why does he restrict acccess to them so tightly.I am a big sports fan of college and pro sports but I have major issues with people glorifying coaches the way they do. They are just athletic coaches. They are not helping solve the problems of the world, just entertainers.Joepa also comes across as humorless, a man who takes himself way too seriously.It is a shame that Fitzpatrick was denied access to so many sources. It would have been interesting to find out why Joepa's son is unwilling or able to get a job on his own instead of depending on Daddy.As noted above, Joepa was influenced greatly by his days at Brown.

It is indeed a page-turner: the crisp writing is full of factual references but never burdened by them, like the photos, period paintings and documents illustrating the book, they enhance and support the narrative. It is free of ornamental flourishes or fawning, relying only on exposition of facts and quality writing.Rarely do I agree with the marketing hype that usually makes up the front flap of a books dustjacket, but in this case, I agree wholeheartedly:\\"This remarkable story of a great romantic hero separates the facts from legend and yet still manages to capture brilliantly all the excitement of the tale, of gallantry and heroism, of conspiracy and intrigue, of massacres and tragedy, set against the magnificent scenery of seventeenth-century Scotland.\\"At least as thrilling as the story of William Wallace (alongside whom one of Graham's ancestors had fought two centuries earlier), this book is a very exhilarating tale of a remarkable person."},{"Title":"Montrose (Brief lives)","review":"My cyber friend Iain Grimston was assisting as a reader of my pending novel THE LAST KNIGHT and the Queen of Scots, centering on the adventures of Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange, and in an exchange of information on Scotland's heroes, he mentioned Montrose, about whom I knew shamefully little. When I took a break during the editing and production process of my Kirkcaldy book, I ordered Montrose. I did not expect the treasure that came. First of all, there is James Graham himself, a hero by any standard, in a setting so colorful that his story defies fictionalization. I could never write a Montrose as exciting as the one who actually lived. Second, C.V. Wedgwood's well-written treatment is just enough to whet the appetite and entice the reader who is a serious scholar such as I am to want more, without scaring the more casual reader away. Third, the illustrations and plates are magnificent, equal to any of the 'coffee table histories' I displayed before my malamutes ate them all. Montrose now enjoys protected status on a high shelf in a locked library. Anyone interested in the history of Scotland or who is intrigued by men and women who seem larger than life would enjoy adding this gem to his or her library."},{"Title":"My secret war","review":"One of the best air war memoir of any era.

You won't be disappointed with &quot;My Secret War!&quot;"},{"Title":"My secret war","review":"Richard Drury's My Secret War is a must read for Vietnam aviation buffs. As one who flew in that ill fated war I can attest to Mr. Drury's views and experiences. It was indeed the best of times and the worst of times. We were immortal and believed only in ourselves and our fellow comrades. We fought, laughed, and sometimes died longing to return home to the land of the \\"Big BX\\", only to be ridiculed once we got home. Mr. Drury brings home the sights, smells, and feels of that far away war fought in secret places that no one talked about. He highlighted the daily drudgery that we thought of as fun. The small, damp rooms with the constant AC, the smiling Momma-sans, the happy local drivers, and the sad but cute children that seemed to be everywhere. The flying was fun, deadly, and exhilarating all at the same time. Only in combat can one feel all this at once. Mr. Drury did an excellent job of bring this to the reader.Highly recommended if you want to know what it was like to fly, fight, and possibly die in a land far away which the average American only glimpsed on the CBS evening news with Uncle Walter."},{"Title":"My secret war","review":"I have read this book several times and found it to be one of my favorite. I kind of wish that it would be reprinted. I would get a fresh copy to share with friends, because my original book is definitely a keeper which I would not want to lose.I appreciate the author's perspective about higher ranking officers which may have had their own career ambition dictate how they served instead of flying and fighting for for their men. Their motivations should have been more noble. I can relate to those type of military experiences which made me question on how higher ranking personnel got there. Of course I know not every commander fell into that category. I had a down to earth commander who won the Medal of Honor for his USAF flying in S.E. Asia. I pictured that commander (name withheld) as having a personality much as the author, but somehow he managed to hang in their to make a career in the USAF. If I met more officers like the former or men as Richard S. Drury during my time of service, I think an air force career would have been more worth while for me. To get back on topic, the book was a pleasure to read and get an inside scoop on how life was like during the Vietnam War in the USAF."},{"Title":"My secret war","review":"Not only is the author a brave and skilled fighter pilot, he is a gifted writer.This is a first-hand account that puts you in the pilot's seat during the author's year-long tour of duty in the Vietnam War during which he flew 220 combat missions. The squadron's mission was close-quarter warfare against the NVA's heavily-defended supply routes through Laos. The aircraft he flew was the 1944-vintage A-1 Skyraider, which was built to be flown by man rather than by a computer. Richard Drury weaves together the true story in a manner that puts you inside his head as he wrestles with and conquers the fear that accompanies every man who flies off to engage a determined enemy day after day and night after night.The pilot's biggest fear is going down in the jungle alive and facing merciless torture from the Viet Cong. It is hard to imagine how precious life must feel to a man who has been shot from the sky; then listened to the screams of his co-pilot being slowly tortured to death by a savage enemy while he himself shudders wounded and hidden in the jungle all night as the enemy beats the bushes searching for him; then at daybreak he witnesses the hours-long aerial combat at tree-top level as A-1 fighter pilots try to subdue the enemy anti-aircraft guns long enough for a rescue helicopter to hover in and scoop him from the jaws of death. Richard Drury and his heroic comrades participated in dozens of these daring rescue operations. He tells about it a manner that puts you in the battle and lets you come as close as an on-looker can come to feeling the fear, excitement and exhilaration that evolves over the course of the fight and then the joy of the man who is \\"returned to the land of the living\\". And there are many brave and good men who never return; Drury gives you a peek into the lives of some his friends and fellow heros who did not make it back. He reflects on how facing and surviving death changed his outlook on life and made him recognize what is truly important in life.He volunteered for this special duty because he believed in freedom and was willing to lay his on the line for the just cause. But most of all he came to this place because he loved to fly and the A-1 Skyraider was as pure as flying could get, and this was the last time in history that the ancient A-1 Skyraider would see combat action. There is plenty of flying for fun in between the fighting where he aptly describes the beauty and freedom of the sky, along with the not so fun experiences of being hurled about the sky by thunderstorms, wind, lightning and rain. Drury also gives insight into how it felt to be risking your life every day in a \\"limited engagement\\" war, and how demoralizing it was to hear some of the falsehoods coming from the press back home and seeing pictures of the actress who posed at the trigger of anti-aircraft guns with her arms around our enemy.Anyone who has been in the military knows that some of the best and bravest men do not \\"fit the mold\\" and so they find themselves left behind while some who are less-deserving advance up the ranks. Drury expresses his disgust at some of shams that he witnessed, but mostly he focuses on the brave and unselfish warriors who are closer to him than family. And so as his tour of duty draws to a close, the non-conforming Drury faces the decision of whether to leave the Air Force or stay for the pure joy of flying."},{"Title":"My secret war","review":"I first read this book in order to learn what happened at NKP when I was there, since I was an enlistee there when the author was there. His story provides an interesting picture of flying a Skyraider over Laos, and Vietnam, but did not mention anything that happened on the base, proper. We had three airplane crashes on the base during that time. One, was a Skyraider that had a fuel tank on fire as he was taking off, and the pilot had to be taken out of his plane by a Jolly Green Giant before his ordinance went off-as it actually did, later. Then we had an A-26 crash upon landing killing its two pilots. Next we had a F-4 crash within 50' of 7,000 prefilled napalm bombs sitting in crates, without setting a one off. None of these stories were told in the book. One of the other stories was that of the 7,000 prefilled napalm bombs, 50% of them did not have continuity between the initiator and the fuse locations, so, were not going to go off unless modified, by us in the Bomb Dump. The base had parabolic microphones placed all over it so that it could pick up the sounds of 'bean bag' mines that had been dropped around the perimeter in order that insurgents might be heard as they approach the base. Then half-way through 1969 they decided to blow the remainder of the mines up in order to get rid of them. So every day at 11 AM they would set off a canister of them-BANG. I came home completely undesturbed by the sounds of car backfires, thanks to that. We had other odd things happen there that might have been told as well, but I may have been expecting too much from a pilot-author's experiences."},{"Title":"My secret war","review":"One of the very best combat memoirs I've ever read.

True life account of a vietnam war pilot flying in a squadron from Laos in an outdated relic of a plane. True drama. If you like flying, this is a great book as it has plenty of hands-on flying, for the pure joy of flying. It also has plenty of actual combat mission drama from the pilot's seat. The author also spends a lot of time in the book grousing about the futility of it all and pointless (in the grand scheme of things) nature of the missions being assigned, and the feelings of being mere pawns in a greater game that make no sense to the soldier or airman on the front lines... Unfortunately, this all sounds very familiar in mid-2009 with the various \\"limited engagements\\" being carried on in various parts of the world... Will we ever learn? Despite the depressing parts, the book is a lively read that keeps moving and tells of many unsung, heroic actions which only those who were there will ever truly know of or appreciate.

This is one of those volumes which is getting rather difficult to find which is a pity as it is an extremely informative work, which while not the beginning and end of all books related to this subject, is never-the-less well worth the read and ownership if this is where your interests lie.The physical book is a bit larger than what we would call normal book size, but much smaller than what would be traditionally known as a \\"coffee table book,\\" even though it is designed as such.The author has given us a very nice history of ships and sailing form around 4000 B.C. where the author informs us that \\" the sailboat may have appeared in Mesopotamia.\\" Note that \\"sailboat\\" is used here which is the thrust of this work, i.e. seagoing craft and not canoe, raft or dugout type of vessels. We are then taken on a journey through history up until 1960 with the launching of the French Line its huge passenger liner, France.\\" warship and commercial ships are all covered there, not only the physical craft and its purpose, but how these vessels transform and indeed, made history.This work is filled with literally hundreds of pictures which include drawings, paintings and photographs. Most are in black and white but there is a very nice smattering of full color too. The text is quite readable (if on the dry side from time to time) with plenty of dates to sort out and remember.One of the nicest aspects of the book is that the author has given us a very nice chronology designed in a very readable form tracing the advances of ships from 4000 B.C. to 1960. This information alone is almost worth the price of the book...the price when first published anyway as I see that this work keeps increasing in price year after year.Overall this is a very nice little volume to read and browse through if ships and seafaring are in your area of curiosity. I personally love ships and reading about them even though I am one of those people who become extremely uncomfortable if I am on anything deeper than a trout stream and is almost phobic about getting out of the sight of land...but hey, that does not lesson my fascination for ships.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Dewey Decimal System Defeats Truman!: Library Cartoons","review":"Scott McCullar is perhaps the Gary Larson of library humor.

Nikolas Rose's \`Powers of Freedom' is far less of a fiction that anything of Foucault's, but it is similarly a search for truth. I much prefer to read Foucault, though if you are a Foucault fan you won't be disappointed with Rose. He indeed builds on Foucault's ideas. And where Foucauld tends towards nihilism and depression, Rose keeps up a spirit of optimism and hope. Both advise using thought as a weapon in the never-ending battle against those who purport to rule us in our own name and for our own good.There are many interesting ideas in \`Powers of Freedom'. I suppose the main one is that freedom is an invention of modern government. Before the modern age there was no such thing as freedom - one lived in fear of violence and intimidation from above and below. Only with the advent of the modern age with its mores of civility and self-control has sovereign power felt able to let its subjects reasonably alone.Another idea, according to Rose, is that individuality is both an invention and a subjectivity. He develops Foucault's notion of a personal ethics and argues that our current \`wars of subjectivity' emerge around the concept that \`individuals can shape an autonomous identity through choices in taste, music, goods, styles and habitus outside the control of coherent discourses of civility or the technologies of political government. The politics of conduct is faced with a new set of problems: governing subject formation in this new plural field.'

It is perhaps the most important of Richard Niebuhr's books (despite the continued influence of _Christ and Culture_ and _The Responsible Self_). One of the central issues theologians wrestled with in the 20th century was the rise of historicist thought. Such thought is still with us today; it is the grounding of postmodern secularist relativism -- because we are each limited by our prejudices (shaped by our social, geographical, and temporal locations), we cannot possibly critique one another. Niebuhr was one of the first theologians in American to offer a solid theological answer; his thought still resonates today in the work of Stanley Hauerwas and others, who argue that God has entered history and that we are to join this particular history, that of Israel, Jesus, and the Church. Niebuhr tells us Christians that we should acknowledge our groundedness, our contingencies, our limitations. Only God can transcend all these differences and present us with the gift of unity. God invites all to become part of this historical movement. Niebuhr's book is a difficult read, but worth the effort."},{"Title":"The meaning of revelation,","review":"niebuhr is more condensed than the recipe of milk in thai dishes, yet has kernels of real truth and clarity.no run-around, no long-winds, no boring-bragsit's the real deal, in 1/10 the pages of others and with original thought (imagine!)"},{"Title":"The meaning of revelation,","review":"This reissue of a twentieth-century classic by H.

By his focus on revelation as personal experience, Niebuhr served as the igniting force for views of future theological movements that are still prevalent more than forty years after his death.

He is an outstanding example of what seems to me to be a trend in modern philosophy of science, which is to learn the relevant scientific practices thoroughly so that one's contribution as a philosopher is at a high technical level of expertise. This book is accessible to the interested non-professional, but the journal articles on which it is based are quite sophisticated. I am not sure whether we should consider Skyrms' ideas as contribution to social theory, social philosophy, or both. Then again, perhaps it doesn't matter.Skyrms' preferred method is to take a simple two-player game like the stag hunt or the prisoner's dilemma and explore the implications of repeating the game, playing it on a lattice, allowing player strategies to evolve, and otherwise enriching the game's structure to better approximate some forms of real social interaction. Skyrms is above all an explorer rather than an exhaustive taxonomist. He wanders through the forest of exotic plausible assumptions for two-person games, stops here and there to admire a particularly interesting specimen, and the moves on. This is a delightful approach for both the casual reader, who is not interested in complex details, and the professional student of game theory, who is tired of taking a highly specific game and absolutely beating it to death with forays of analytical purity.One serious limitation of this book is that Skyrms is almost single-mindedly concerned with two-player games, whereas understanding human social life requires n-player games for fairly high n (at least 20 in some important cases). While a deep understanding of two-person games does shed light on behavior in larger games, it also can be very misleading. Certainly human society is much more complicated than one might infer from the workings of the prisoner's dilemma, the stag hunt, and the hawk-dove game.I also believe that Skyrms' major point in this book is just dead wrong. In the Preface, Skyrms says \\"If one simple game is to be chosen as an exemplar of the central problem of the social contract, which should it be? Many modern thinkers have focused on the prisoner's dilemma, but I believe that this emphasis is misplaced. The most appropriate choice is not the prisoner's dilemma, but rather the stag hunt.\\" (p. xii) Now, the stag hunt is a pure coordination game of the following form. Suppose there are n players (Skyrms prefers two players, but any n will do). If all players \\"hunt stag,\\" each will receive an payoff of 1000 calories of meat. However, if any player decides instead to \\"hunt rabbit,\\" the stag hunt will fail, and all players will get no calories except the rabbit hunter, who gets 100 calories. This is a coordination game, or an assurance game, because a player can be assured of getting 100 calories no matter what the others do (by hunting rabbit), but if the players can coordinate so all hunt stag, they will all do much better.Skyrms defends his statement that human social life is basically a stag hunt-like coordination game as follows. At first sight, social cooperation seems to be a prisoner's dilemma, or in the n-player case, a public goods game. In this game, by cooperating an individual helps all the other members of the group, but at a cost to himself. Therefore, a self-regarding player will never cooperate. It follows that social cooperation requires altruistic players---people must cooperate even though this is personally costly and the others alone benefit from one's prosocial behavior. It is easy to see why the public goods game is an allegory for social cooperation among humans. For instance, if we all hunt, if hunting is dangerous and exhausting, and we must share the kill equally, then a self-regarding hunter will prefer to shirk rather than hunt. Cooperation in this case requires altruistic hunters. Skyrms' point, however, is that if the game is repeated indefinitely, then cooperation among self-regarding agents is possible using what are known as \\"trigger strategies.\\" A trigger strategy for a player is to cooperate on every round, as long as all other players cooperate as well. However, the first time one player defects, the trigger strategy dictates that all players defect on every succeeding round. It is easy to see that in this case, even selfish players will cooperate on all rounds, because the gains they have from defecting on one rounds may be swamped by the losses incurred by not benefiting from others' efforts on the succeeding rounds.Why is Skyrms wrong? Note first that the repeated prisoner's dilemma or n-player public goods game (the latter is just a prisoner's dilemma with n players) is not really a stag hunt game at all. The stag hunt game has exactly two equilibria, one where everyone hunts rabbit and one where everyone hunts stag. The repeated public goods game (rppg) has an infinite number of equilibria! For instance, suppose it costs 100 calories to generate 1000 calories for the other players. Now suppose in a ten player repeated public goods game, all players cooperate on all rounds, except player 1, who defects on all rounds. With an obvious alteration in the trigger strategies of players 2 through n, we still have a Nash equilibrium of the rppg. This is because 9,000 calories are generated in each period, so each player gets 900 calories, and players 2 through 10 only expend 100 calories, so they have a net gain of 800 calories and hence are willing to participate. Now, by varying who participates and how much, we can generate an infinite number of equilibria for the rppg. In game theory, this is known as the Folk Theorem of Repeated Games.Despite the fact that the stag hunt is not exactly the same as the rppg, Skyrms would be correct in principle if it were true that the rppg were a coordination game, like the stag hunt. But the rppg is NOT a coordination game at all! In fact, in the rppg, a self-regarding player has an incentive to shirk if he can get away with it; i.e., if others do not observe his shirking. This is not the case in the stag hunt.Economists generally treat the Folk Theorem as a brilliant solution to the problem of cooperation among many self-regarding agents, and Skyrms is here merely following their lead. My study of the Folk Theorem, by contrast, shows that the Folk Theorem is no solution at all, except for groups of size two, or larger groups under generally implausible informational conditions (see my book, The Bounds of Reason, Princeton University Press, 2009). The reasons is that cooperation in the rppg requires that each player send a very accurate signal to each other player indicating cooperation or defection, and the same signal must be transmitted to all players if they are to coordinate in their manner of reacting to a defection. When different players get different signals (e.g., when each player sees only a subset of the other players) and/or when the signals have a significant probability of being inaccurate (e.g., a hunter worked hard but by chance failed to be successful in the hunt), the cooperative equilibrium to the rppg will not exist, or will exist but will be extremely inefficient.The implication of Skyrms' position for social theory is quite dramatic. If he were correct, it would follow that humans could cooperate very effectively even if they were perfectly self-regarding, with absolutely no need for altruistic preferences, empathy, no predisposition for cooperating and sharing, nor any other prosocial behavior that goes beyond simple mutualism: An individual would help the group only as a byproduct of helping himself. In fact, there is a great deal of evidence that humans have fundamental other-regarding preferences, including a predisposition to follow legitimate social norms, and to make personal sacrifices on behalf of the group if they perceive that others are make such sacrifices as well.My reading of the empirical evidence is that humans have evolved a cognitive psychology that allows for \\"team cognition.\\" Team cognition means that humans can understand that they are part of a team, that all team members have the same team goal, and that other members also realize this. Most animals completely lack this form of cognition, or have it only to a severely limited degree. The writings of Michael Tomasello offer, to my mind, the most persuasive evidence on team cognition. However team cognition has nothing to do with the stag hunt. In groups of several agents, even with team cognition, it will usually be the case that one of the group can defect and the project will still be worth doing, and hence will benefit the defector. Thus, team cognition will generally be embedded in games of the public goods type, for which altruistic motivation is required for success. This altruistic motivation is a social psychology that leads individuals to cooperate with others even when there is a personal cost, so long as others are doing the same. This implies that to sustain cooperation in a social group, we need a lot more than to simply coordinate on the high-yield strategy. We need a social system that fosters a sense of morality that includes caring about others and sacrificing on behalf of society. When that morality is absent or in disrepair, life will be \\"poore, nasty, brutish, and short,\\" to use Hobbes' famous words."},{"Title":"The Stag Hunt and the Evolution of Social Structure","review":"Skyrms weaves together insights from game theory, evolutionary dynamics, computer simulations, and philosophy to address a crucial question: Where does trust come from? When do the trusting get ripped off? When do the trusting succeed? How can societies be set up so that they're more likely to build trust?Skyrms walks the reader through the key technical tools, so most college-educated readers should have little trouble following the key ideas. And the payoff is large: You'll think things you've never thought before about the nature of cooperation.I'd recommend reading this book along with Axelrod's classic Evolution of Cooperation to get a sense of where the serious study of society is heading. Since life in the modern rich countries depends so much on trust--trust within firms, trust across branches of government, and trust within communities--Skyrms's combination of big-picture thinking and cutting-edge rigor provides a great way to learn about this poorly-understood social phenomena."},{"Title":"Two Weeks In Grade Six","review":"Many of us would call Kaitilin a loner, which she is.Kaitilin has only one friend at school, Shelley.Together they play with each other and unleash their fears, so when Kaitilin enters her new classroom, she is not the little least worried about being friendless.But with the devilious Ashleigh around, anything can happen and Kaitilin finds herself being dumped by Shelley and her two weeks of grade six becoming two weeks of horrorrs.Kaitilin must find a friend, and quick.Read the hilarious diary of Kaitlin in this very book."},{"Title":"Bertolt Brecht: Poems, 1913-1956","review":"Bertolt Brecht has acquired the same status as those other artists whose work is known, but not appreciated. Like Faulkner, Joyce and Proust, he has become transmuted into an adjective; even worse, he has followers who describe themselves as &quot;Brechtian&quot; and who are happy to discuss his theories of drama instead of the dramas themselves.But things get even worse when you get closer to the man himself, for there is a wealth of evidence that &quot;der arme B.B.&quot; was, in fact, a conscienceless thief who stole credit from everyone with whom he worked and, in particular, from the women he charmed into professional and emotional liaisons. Add to this his craven attitude towards Stalin, and his theories of epic theater seem to be, at the very least, a gross exercise in self-deception.All very off-putting. But his poetry is a different matter. Brecht approaches the reader without the arrogance of a theorist interested in instructing the audience how to think. He is more candid, both personally and politically, willing to condemn his own weaknesses and, in his later years, those of the movement that he had defended at any cost. And, most importantly, his poetry is fresh, direct, cutting and beautiful, even in translation. This is a volume that those who are interested in writing poetry should have."},{"Title":"Bertolt Brecht: Poems, 1913-1956","review":"The only thing about this collection that disappointed me was that it didn't seem to contain the famous/infamous \\"The Legend of the Dead Soldier\\" poem."},{"Title":"Bertolt Brecht: Poems, 1913-1956","review":"These poems are brilliant and inspiring because they were written by a socialist.

IN the spirit of Yuletide I decided we should have a hot toddy. I searched my many cookbooks &amp; found nothing. Went to the web and finally found a recipe (this took about 20 minuets via askjeeves) &amp; we were finally able to happily quaff our drinks that cold winter's night. So I bought O'Hara's book in that spirit; hoping for more information and recipes that would be of Yuletides past. O'Hara delivered for I surely got that.O'Hara also tosses in how to stock a bar, make lemonade, grenadine &amp; cranberry juice, the history of most drinks (champagne and wines) &amp; where you have to pay for the premium line and when you could avoid it.On the downside, I did not like that the recipes as a rule were for parties; rarely does O&quot;hara scale down for just a few people but luckily since all the measurements are 1 1/4 quarts of milk for 12 or 12 eggs for 12-14 a calculator could easily manage it for you. Unfortunately he does not tell you how many ounces are in a quart but if you don't know, other cookbooks should be able to manage that for you (hint hint Fannie Farmer, Joy of Cooking).Also he gives the classic recipe for eggnog with raw eggs but neglects that if you use his recipe on Tom &amp; Jerry you could easily produce a cooked (and thus safe) version. Despite these quibbles O'Hara is very thorough on holiday drinks &amp; tells you what you need and don't. The fotos keep the book's spirit and add allot of colour.For those who don't imbibe, O'Hara does tell you how to make non-alcoholic versions , just use more milk, &amp; most of the ingredients are in your house.

He had to learn how to survive by himself with only his hatchet. Brian was 13 and going to visit his dad in northern Canada. While they were flying, the pilot showed Brian how to fly the plane. The pilot had a heart attack during the flight and died, so Brian had to crash land the plane by himself in a lake. This was a terrible experience for him. It reminds me of the time I was on a river raft going down the rapids, and I thought I might die if we flipped in the boat. Once it was over, I told my mom I never wanted to do anything like that again. When he woke up from the crash, Brian built a shelter to protect himself. He realized he was all alone with no food or supplies. He felt scared. Then he remembered what his teacher had told him about staying positive and staying focused. I can relate to this by trying to be positive on the tennis court. When I am playing a big match, I am alone. I know I have to depend on myself. In this situation I try to stay positive and calm. Once when Brian was sleeping, a porcupine came into his shelter. When Brian woke up, the porcupine swung his tail and hit Brian's leg. This made him cry and feel sorry for himself. Then he realized that feeling sorry for himself would not help him to survive. During my tennis matches, I try not to get down on myself if I am losing. I try to be confident instead of feeling sorry for myself if I get behind. Finally after about two months Brian was rescued. His time in the wilderness had taught him to be more cautious. Now he also noticed more things around him. He had learned how to survive on his own. He knew he could take care of himself, and he felt confident.

Everything goes well until Brian's pilot has a heart attack. Brian ends up having to crash land the plane into the water. Brian somehow survives, but unfortunately the pilot doesn't. But sadly Brian was so scared that he tried killing himself by cutting himself with his hatchet. Now Brian has to survive in the Northern Canadian woods all alone for who knows how long. I definitely recommend this book because it is very detailed and well thought out.Brian plays a big part in this book. Brian is a very intelligent kid that knows a lot about being outdoors. Brian ends up having to do some weird things such as take a shower four times a day because he was sprayed by a skunk. Brian also ends up learning a lot too. Brian can teach himself things like how to spear a fish. He learned one day while he was spearing fish that in the water there is some kind of reflection, so you don't aim straight at the fish. He also taught himself how to crash land a plane into the water. The cool thing about Brian is that he is smart, but he knows how to make himself smarter.The main point of this book is survival. Brian struggles but finally successfully finds the survival pack in the plane containing food, matches, pots, medicine, and a compass. Brian has to live out in the woods all by himself with just a hatchet. Brian ends up making a spear, a bow, a raft, and a shelter, all with just the hatchet. Brian had a big log shelter and to improve it, he wove little sticks through it to make it kind of like a basket. He of course spears fish with the spear, but it took him a while to actually get the fish. Brian also learns how to shoot deer, moose, and some other animals with his bows. So in other words, Brian taught himself how to hunt.This book takes place in the northern Canadian woods. The woods are near the little lake where Brian had to crash land the plane. In these woods there are many big animals such as, moose, bear, deer, etc. But unfortunately Brian had to kill some of the animals to survive. Every now and then Brian will go for a swim in the pond near the woods.Overall this book was great, probably one of the best books I've ever read. I would recommend this book to a person who enjoys reading nonfiction books and knows what its like to be out in the woods. This book is now easy to read, but not too hard either. You also might enjoy this book a little bit more if you hunt. If you enjoy reading and learning about survival you would love this book. All in all I really enjoyed this book and I'm looking forward to reading all the sequels."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Plot Summary:Brian Robeson, a 13-year-old boy, travels to see his father in Northern Alaska in a little two-seat plane. On the way, the pilot suffers a massive heart attack and crashes hundreds of miles off course. Brian must learn to survive - alone - against the hugeness of the wilderness. Masses of mosquitoes, canny foolbirds, gutcherries, a tornado, and an insane moose seem to be working together to bring around his demise. With only a hatchet and his wits, can Brian manage to survive long enough to be rescued?My Review:Even though this classic story is almost twenty years old and has reached an almost pedestal-like level of acclaim, it has managed to not be read by me up until now - through no fault if its own. I always figured a book that had garnered that much praise would never live up to the standards I had set for it, and was somewhat reluctant to read it. However, I am planning a Hatchet unit for later on this school year with my fourth graders, and had to finally read the book. I am pleased to say that it is as good a book as I have heard.The author goes to quite a length to make the facts in the story not only accurate, but makes the plot itself almost non-fiction with its realism. I read somewhere that he actually went out and tried all the things Brian does in the story - and it shows. The book is absolutely fantastic - a solid, multi-dimensional main character, a wonderfully beautiful and dangerous setting, a twisting and active plot line, and even the admirable, overall theme of humans not being above nature and \\"conquering\\" it, but that humans are just a small piece of the natural world.Sewn throughout the story is an ironic tone, making the story much more enjoyable to read that a normal survival story would have. The story could easily have focused on the emotional turmoil and the loneliness too much, but Gary Paulsen touches on the negative feelings and then moves on. This makes the story much less dark, and thus more appropriate for younger audiences, like my fourth graders.It is hard to put praise on top of the mountain of commendations that have already been heaped on this book. To repeat them seems rather monotonous; so I will wrap up this review by saying that if you have not yet read this book, do so! I know that I will be going to the library soon and picking up a copy of the sequels with the hope that they are anywhere near the literary quality of Hatchet. That is the best praise I can give to any author."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I loved this book so much it showed a lot of good actions in words.It was about a boy that was in an airplane when the pilot had a heart-attak.The boy's name was Brian.He did not know how to fly an airplane.He crashed in a place where there was a pond beside him.There was a tornado and it flipped the plane in the pond. the boy got really hungry after about 2 or 3 days he has been eating turtle eggs.He decided to go to get the survival bag that was in the plane.The end ended up that the boy heard an airplane and it dropped down and got Brian."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I gave it 5 stars, because it was adventurous, with some action, and survival book.

Brian Robeson is flying north to see his father when the pilot has a major heart attack. They crash land into a pond and Brian gets stranded. This is a gripping novel that pulls you right into the book. Gary Paulsen explains it so well, that it felt like I was in the actual plane when it crashed. In the bush, Brian encounters moose, wolves, and a tornado. They all drive Brian further into hunger, aloneness, and craziness. The point of view of the book is excellent. It is told right from Brian himself, as if he was right there telling it to you. I would consider the genre of the book to be an adventurous book. The sequels to Hatchet (shown in order) are The River, Brian's Winter, Brian's Return, and Brian's Hunt. Gary said he might actually publish another book about Brian. I would recommend this book to all."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I thought this book was one of the best books I've ever read.It's like it made me keep reading it. I loved the fact that ithad only 1 character because it was easier to focus on what wasgoing on. My favorite part is when Brian eats the foolbirdbecause it sounds so delicious and I imediately wanted some.Anyone who is unsure about reading this book shouldn't be.It is a great book for all ages. I also think the fact I couldrelate to some of it might have had something to do with itbut I still loved it.I hope others enjoy a wonderful story about a crash, beingready, and survival in the wilderness."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian is thirteen years old and is completely stranded with only a hatchet to survive. Brian Robeson's parents divorce so he has to take plane rides to visit his dad, who built a self cleaning self sharpening drill. In his trip the pilot teaches Brian how to keep the plane steady. During his flight he realized that the pilot was having a heart attack. Brian took the wheel and kept it steady until he ran out of fuel and landed in an L-shaped lake. Brian had to live of the land until someone found him. Eventually he was able to get into the plane and find a distress beacon and get back to civilization.This was a very thrilling book. You really get attached to Brian and fear for his life. I suggest this book to anyone who has free time or has to read a book for school.Brian displayed great courage many times in this book like when he grabbed the wheel of the plane and kept it steady a lot of people would have lost their cool in that situation. Also it took a lot of courage to venture back into the plane even though he knew that there was a dead body waiting for him. These are just a few of the times that he displayed great courage.In this book you could really see the main character developing. Like when he ate those bad berries and got sick but then later he was able to figure out how to eat what the animals were eating. I really enjoyed seeing the main character mature through this story.The conflict in this book was very interesting because you couldn't really tell who the antagonist was. It could have been nature because he had to survive in nature. Also it could have been his divorced parents because they were the actual cause of the problem because he was on a plain going to visit his dad.This was an all around great book I really didn't want to put it down. The main character Brian was very interesting because he wasn't just a stock character. I would definitely recommend this book to any one who is looking for a good riveting book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"If you like wilderness or hunting books, then this book is for you.

I think it is the best because it tells alot about some of his life time as a chiled and all of that stuff. Some thing about the book is this..... When he had to go see his dad in Canada, then his mom went to take him to the airport then brians mom gave him a Hatchet then the plane took off. The pilot had a hard attack and he had to control the plane but then he crashed the plane and hit a lake. Then the got stranded out in the middle of canada for over a year! The worst part happend an earthquake hit. After that he got attaced by a moose. About 6 months later he bult a raft so he could go out to the plane in the lake and went under water, and got the servival kit. The sevival kit had a sleeping bag and a year suply of food. Then a rescue plane came and rescued Brian.

Especially, for him. His life goes through a loop when his plane crashes in the middle of nowhere. The pilot is dead and the only thing Brian has is his hatchet. He is in for a loop. While trying to stay positive he makes a pretty good home. But as constant stinging memories remind him about \\"The Secret,\\" everything begins to go even MORE downhill for Brian. He can't catch a break. It's an emotional roller coaster for him. This book contains some life-threatning events for our main character, and it has an amazing ending. You'll have to find out for yourself. - From a student in Mrs. Reynolds' class (A.W.)"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is one of Gary Paulsen's finest works. I think his goal was to establish a great young adult novel that is easy to become immersed in. He looks to create a book that is enjoyable and also has a lot of useful information about life in the wilderness.Paulsen, a writer from Minneapolis, writes young adult novels usually about nature. He has written over 200 books, short stories, magazine articles, and plays. He enjoys dog sled racing and has participated in many Iditarod races.Brian Robeson is trapped in the Canadian wilderness with nothing more than the clothes on his back and a hatchet, given to him by his divorced mother before his trip. He crashes from a bush plane after the pilot has a heart attack and the plane runs out of fuel. He is forced to eat whatever he can find, which includes fish, turtle eggs, wild berries, and a few birds. Isolated from any outside help, Brian must find out on his own by making fire by hitting flint with more flint and other survival tactics. Many dangers seem to get in Brian's way as he tries to get by until he can be rescued. Among these dangers, Brian must face a porcupine, a moose, and even a tornado. Will he survive the elements and get rescued or will the wilderness be too much for him to handle?I feel that Gary Paulsen has achieved his goal with flying colors. You could read this book over and over again and still find inspiration from it. Hatchet sparked the mind with exciting conflicts and kept me entertained from cover to cover. I felt that Hatchet has a certain special touch that no other writer could compare. If you are ever stuck in the wilderness, do not look for a survival guide, look for Hatchet. It will teach you more about the wild than most guides out there."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Gary Paulsen's adventures of Brian are the only books my 15 year old son has ever ASKED me to buy for him.

You will not be able to put it down and can learn so much from this precise and moving story. Read this review by yourself or with your parent to find out more:The Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen, is a must read for all Middle School students coming of age and figuring out a true sense of self. Brian Robeson was a child of divorce. He was burdened with the secrets of his Mother and was living an in-between life so painful and typical of adolescent children in divorced household. The book opens as he is traveling to the Canadians backwoods for the summer to live with his father who was on site as a mechanical engineer in the oil business. When the pilot of the two-seater aircraft has a fatal heart attack, Brian quickly learns his true survival instincts. He is able to land the plane and survive for fifty-four days in isolation in the Canadian backcountry with only a hatchet, given as a gift by his mother, to help him along the way. Through Brian's life threatening struggles and incredible discoveries, such as figuring out a way to make a fish pond and making fire from flint stones, he is transformed into a young man. He becomes a survivor and brings the reader with him through all of his life changing experiences.The only potential negative I could foresee, is how well young ladies could relate to a wilderness story where essentially the only character is an adolescent boy. To this critique I would say that girls I've seen are equally gripped by this story. I've seen female students reading this book independently while walking through the halls oblivious to the rest of the school. One young lady in my class actually was in trouble for reading while the lesson was going on. It speaks to anyone who is growing into maturity, male or female, and hits at deeply human emotions that transcend the male/female divide.My personal appraisal of this book is that it is completely gripping and spun in a tight narrative that stays fresh and interesting. It is one of the few books that I actually remember specific scenes from as a child, and rereading it brought back vivid reading memories that only a select number of books have ever given me. Brian is a personal character and a thoughtful, confused boy. The simplicity of the writing makes the moments deep and fresh. The repetition and descriptive language accentuate Paulson's moving story. When Brian triumphs in creating his shelter and discovering how to make fire you will pump your fist with him. When the tornado takes everything he has worked for away in an instant you will feel his deep crushing despair. When Brian is discovered, he takes the reader with him. Just like Brain you'll be changed."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Thirteen-year-old Brian Robeson knows the Secret. His mom is seeing another man, and his dad doesn't know.

Hatchet is a book about a boy named Brian who gets stranded in the Canadian woods and has to use his brain to survive in the wild. If you like the book Hatchet it is a series. The next book in the series is \\"The River\\" so that is why you could read this book and possible the series. But that is really your choice. I'll tell you my favorite part next.My favorite part in Hatchet is when Brian survives the crash because the pilot had a heart attack and died so Brian has to land on a \\"L\\" shaped lake or else he will die for sure. Will he land? Maybe or maybe not. To find out you have to read the book. I like this part because if Brian died the book would be boring.Brian is a interesting character because he seems like a city boy because he uses memory about stores or TV shows he's seen but he's not a city boy. He is one interesting character.I think the book Hatchet should become a movie because I think many people would like it because many people like the book.These are reasons why I recommend this book to all ages. Thank you for reading my book review."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Gary Paulson is an excellent storyteller with a keen sense of adventure. the story opens with a young boy en route via a small plane to see his father in the wilderness when the plane crashes and the pilot dies. All the boy has is a tiny hatchet that was given to him before he left on his trip. He sets out on a path of survival as he awaits rescuing. This book contains mature themes (death, consequences, mistakes) that portray the realistic images that Gary paulson portrays. Having three Scouts in the house, this was an adventure book they all approved of enought that they have encouraged us to purchase more Gary Paulson books."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This story about a young boy stranded in the Canadian wilderness will never lose it's affect on me. Being a child of divorce I can totally empathize with Brian's struggles to cope. And I appreciate Gary Paulsen's comparing that struggle with actual survival. But this book is in no way a sermon on how to deal with divorce. It's about learning to co-exist, and to overcome any obstacles. The descriptions of how Brian went about ensuring his survival, only with the use of his hatchet (hence the title) were awe inspiring when a pre-teen and the book still retains a sentimental hold over my heart as an adult. the encounters with wildlife range from comical to downright horrifying. Hatchet made me appreciate the things I had and also allowed me to realize that I shouldn't seek too hard the things I desired to have but didn't. Overall this is a great book to give your 10-13 year old, a book about respect for nature, appreciation for life, and above all understanding that you can make it through the toughtest of situations as long as you have the right tools and are willing to learn how to use them."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Imagine being stranded in the wilderness alone and learning to survive. We all think about it at least once in our life, learning to hunt, getting shelter, and staying sane. In the book, Hatchet, Brian Robeson, age thirteen, is stranded in the Canadian wilderness, after his plane crashes, with only a hatchet and the clothes on his back. Brian was on that plane to his dad's house because of the Secret... This survival-fiction book tells how Brian undergoes a complete character change. When he first arrives he is relatively weak, but eventually Brian has keen, alert, senses, and he is a stronger person. In the book, Brian must deal with insane moose, and making a new friend; fire. Hunting and food gathering is a major part of the book, which makes it seem very realistic, but will Brian ever make it home alive? This book is a Newbery honor book and I believe it is very deserving of that prestigous award. Gary Paulsen's portrayal of someone in that predicament is very accurate. He puts you right in the action and in the struggle. I recommend this book to people of all different ages and backgrounds. You will feel every moment of hope and rejection in this amazing Paulsen novel."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"My favorite book that I've read is the very well known novel entitled, Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen. The novel is about a regular boy named Brian Robeson, and he goes to meet his father in Canada, but as he's in the plane heading to his father, something goes terribly wrong; the pilots of the plane gets a sudden heart attack! As the plane goes down in the story, the stakes rise for Brian. That's one example of why this book is so great! Gary Paulsen explains Brian's troubles in simple words, yet he uses lots of those words to describe Brian's troubles well. One other example is, it sparks your mind into reading or makes you start reading Gary Paulsen's nooks. I assure you, give this book to a person that doesn't like reading, and after a week, they'll come to you asking for books written by Gary. In this novel, the question is,\\" How will the main character, Brian, survive?\\" So it's obvious that this book is an adventure and a \\"man against nature\\" conflict novel. As you have probably guessed, Brian suffers from hunger and searches for food and shelter. When Brian finds any kind of food, Gary describes Brian to feel like he just found money []off the street! The third reason why this book is so well thought out is because of the creativity Gary has put into Brian. Brian uses a lot of things in his environment around him in every way; a common stick can be a spear or an arrow. To sum it up, when you start this book, you won't stop reading it until Brian is rescued. I feel that Gary Paulsen gave Brian Robeson life, and that's whatmade, Hatchet a great book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Thirteen year old Brian is on his way to visit his father when the pilot of a small, two-person plane has a heart attack and dies. Brian crashes the airplane into a small lake in the middle of a Canadian wilderness. Sore and shocked from the crash, the boy finds himself on a sandy tree-lined shore with only his clothing, a tattered windbreaker, and the belt-attached hatchet his mother had given him as a present.At first, Brian hopes to be rescued in a couple of days, but later he realizes that his life depends only on him - the rescue is not near, since the plane drifted off course significantly soon after the pilot died. Now Brian has to learn how to survive, to toughen up, and to let go of self-pity: \\"...he learned the most important rule of survival, which was that feeling sorry for yourself didn't work.\\"Gary Paulsen effectively describes how Brian learns to watch, listen, and think before he acts, learning to co-exist, and to overcome any obstacles. The reader sees Brian's mistakes, setbacks, and small triumphs as, with the help of the hatchet, he manages to survive the 54 days alone in the wilderness - he attempts to build a fire, to fish and hunt, and to make his home under a rock overhang safe and comfortable.An epilogue of the book describes the lasting effects of Brian's stay in the wilderness -his character have changed from the \\"city boy\\" mentality to enlightened and being as one with nature. \\"None of that used to be Brian and now that was a part of him, a changed part of him, a grown part of him, and the two things, his mind, and his body, had come together as well, had made a connection with each other that he didn't quite understand.\\"\\"Hatchet\\" is a heart-stopping tale of accomplishment, sadness, anger, and happiness that brings a new appreciation for life and respect for nature.

Thoughtout this book I could tell how the author used descriptive language which then created imagery in my mind. This novel is mainly about a young 13 year old boy, Brian Robeson, who is travelling to his father's with a timid pilot. Soon, the pilot gets sick and has a massive heart attack. Brian panics tremendously and using the knowledge that the pilot has given him Brian tries to land the plane in a lake. With great luck the plane cashed in a L shaped lake leaving Brian in the Canadian Wilderness all by himself. I would diffenitly have to rate this book with 5 stars and I would like to take this time to say congradulations to the intelligent author, Gary Paulson, who made my day every chapter of the novel. It is a magnificent novel, perhaps the best one I have ever read in my entire life. I would love to create a wonderful book like Hatchet and have the knowledge to do so.

This book is about a 13 year old boy named Brian Robeson who goes to visit his father after his parents get divorced. On the way there, the pilot suffers a major heart attack and the plane crashes, but Brian makes it out alive. He has to survive alone by making fire, cooking fish, and hunting meat until a rescue plane finds him. Will Brian be rescued? What I like about this book is how Brian never gives up and always tries his hardest. Brian works hard no matterwhat happens and I like that attitude. This book is well suited for kids who like survival novels. The best age for the reader is ages 9 or older because not all the words are easy to read. The genre for this book is Realistic Fiction because this could actually happen. You should definitely read this book!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This text is frequently assigned for 5th grade readers who are often 10 and 11 years old. Parents should be aware that there is a suicidal attempt made by the main character in the book. He slits his wrist in despair and passes out. He happens to wake up and change his mind.Furthermore, a sub-plot involves the child in the story finding out that his mother is having an affair while still married to his father. His father does not know. Therefore, the boy struggles with having to keep this secret from his father. These issues involve violations of trust in marriage and child-parent relationships. There is never any resolution to this story line or questioning of the moral dilemna this boy is thrust into.The story issues may be more appropriate for older high school students, but the issues of depression among our students and infidelity of parents should have parents and teachers consider any literary value the text might have to be limited.

I read through it and was surprised at the mature subject matter for a third grade school assignment. I love the idea of the story, a determined boy surviving and overcoming on many levels. At one point in the story however, he contemplates slitting his wrists to attempt suicide. My 8 year does not need to learn about suicide and methods to attempt suicide at this age and he doesn't need to read about a boy discovering his parent cheating on the other parent as a third grade school reading assignment. I think this may be a good book for a more mature audience but even the teacher was surprised at the content once I talked to her and she pulled it off the third grade book shelf. I gave it 2 stars because I believe it is targeted and marketed to the wrong age group. The school description says it is designed for boys age 10-13. I think a lot of parents of 10-13 year old boys would want the discussion of suicide to come up in another way rather than as a book assignment. Obviously advanced 8-9 year old readers in the school are being target with this book as well. Teachers and parents need to know the content so a serious topic like this can be discussed with kids rather than introduced in a book without any discussion."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"In this epic tale of adventure/survival Brian,a city boy,crashes in the Canadian wilderness and has to live off the land for fifty-four days. gary Paulsen takes us on this roller coaster of accomplishment,sadness,anger, and happiness.{The importance of the setting and the character traits makes this a delightful book to read.} Nature is a great setting for the story because it provides a lot of imagery for the reader to absorb. &quot;Some swamps,but they had trees scattered through them.&quot; &quot;No roads,trails,or clearings.&quot; Also the reader can connect with the character and imagine what is happening. &quot;As soon as he moved,the hair on her back went up and she charged him again, using her head and front hooves this time, slamming him back and down into the water and she left again.&quot; Brian has changed since the crash so long ago.

It is only him and the pilot on the way there flying over the canadian woods. Oh no, the pilot has a hard attack, Can Brian fly a plane?? Hatchet also has suspense, I did not want to put the book down. Hatchet also made me fall in love with it, because me and Brian are somewhat alike. I love to hear what he does to survive. I also love this book because it is so descriptive and easy to picture in your head. Read this book, you will like it, I gaurantee it."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I read this book when I was very young, about 6 or 7 years old, and loved it. Paulsen's tone of writing has an ebb and flow that is becoming increasingly rare. He doesn't tarry (like Lord of the Flies) on motionless landscapes, but delves the reader straight into the heart of the action.Josh's psyche is deep and ponderous, and I sensed the tincture of lunacy lurking at the back of his mind. The castaway children-novel has been used quite a few times, but no noticable cliches in this book. (or they're just marvelously disguised)Very satisfying read. I'd recommend it to anyone, young or old.Lavaix"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"It all started with a divorce.

I can truthfully say it was the worst book I've ever laid eyes on... Not only is it slow paced and so repetitive that I once seriously wondered if Paulsen had Alzheimer's, but the teacher made us read it one chapter at a time drawing out my agony.The detail, while amazing, dragged on way too long, (If you can't sit through a thousand different descriptions of the same tree stump don't read this book) and the whole book was completely predicable. So much that I found myself constantly, desperately pleading mentally for Paulsen to either get Brian rescued or kill him off and put me out of my misery.As if the plot and place setting being flawed weren't enough the Protagonist is a complete idiot! It is very hard to feel genuinely sorry for him when the survival pack sat at the bottom of the lake for the entire book and he doesn't think to get it until the books almost over. And as for the scene where the moose attacks Brian, I can't honestly say that I wasn't rooting for the moose.Furthermore, before you even start, don't even try to say I'm just some kid that hates to read because I assure you it's not reading I have problems with (having a genuine love of reading and almost all the book in the local library under my belt) it's this book. To make someone who enjoys reading suffer through this is the worst kind of torture in a civil society I can possibly think of! And I can't image it being any better for someone who can't read well or hates to do so, it could more than likely turn them off reading for life!In conclusion the book got one star because Amazon doesn't have a lower rating."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This is the wrost book i have ever read! there is no excuse for Gary Pulsen to write shull a dull book!

In this book the main character Brian has to fight for his life alone. Brian has to defend himself and find food and a city boy doesn't know all of these things. Brian is lost and he only has a hatchet.The book Hatchet wasn't the best book but it wasn't bad the only part I really didn't like was when he is extremely hungry and he can't remember that he saw a survival pack that could save his life and when he finds it he gets saved after about 3 days but that's only because of the radio transmitter but I don't care because I just didn't like it didn't have enough action.The hole book wasn't bad so I don't have any regrets for reading this book so in all I am happy for this book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"People,readers,hypocrites, let me put it this way. It would take a person with no imagination to read this book. When you read it, it is like Gary Paulson is feeding you the story and you don't even have to think. I found the plot boring and lacking insight. The protagonist could have used some real brains. He managed to get himself pricked by a parcupine, and attacked by a moose. Come on, I know people half his age who have survived in the woods longer than he did. Nothing against Gary Paulson but he could do better.I have read Gary's books for many years. When I was young I thought he was good but as I got older and re-read his books I discovered that my tastes had changed and that I was very youg and naive.In fact his books disturbed me so much that I had to write this book review.It makes you think there is no point in life. The book gives off a sense of depression and makes you feel stupid. It makes people look completely stupid. He is stupid because he got scared by an squirrel and cased by a bird. Hatchet is a book that defines all that is not holy. I think I have made my point.I know many people disagree with my views but I got one thing to tell them &quot;Find a better book&quot;"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is about an 8 year old boy, Bryan, who takes a trip from New York to Canada on a bushplane, and crashes in the middle of a jungle after witnessing the death of the pilot from a heart attack. Once Bryan realizes there is nothing he can do to exit the jungle, he starts thinking how to survive while a rescue team comes to retrieve him from such a vast and wild place. On the first week, Bryan struggles to find food, and realizes how easy people can lose everything in life, specially what they take for granted. From that moment on, Bryan starts experiencing a series of changes in his personality, thoughts, soul, and feelings, as he developed a new way of life, by discovering new ways of hunting, protecting from wild creatures, building skills, and making fires. Bryan never lost his hope of getting out of this place, despite the fact that a rescue helicopter didn't see the bushplane in the lake after a few minutes of searching the area. This happend a week after the plain's crash. Bryan ended up trapped in that jungle for 3 months before getting rescued.I enjoyed reading this book, because of its simple language and because of the way the story flowed. The only negative remark I have to mention about Hatchet, is how short the end developed. I know a second part of Hatchet was written by Poulson, due to the complainings of the readers about the lenght of the end.

But there are descriptions which are too real to read. I don't like the kind of these discripotion. I like this book because it is no only about adventure but also has some messages.

There are a lot of ways I can define Brain Robeson, the boy how survived the wild. One way I would define Brain is that he was strong and never gave up. I think this because in one part, a tornado comes and destroys Brian's shelter. Instead of pouting and giving up, he tried again and rebuilt his shelter. In another part, a moose attacks him. He tried to get away, but the moose hurt him badly. Instead of just lying there, he tried to get away and then he kept his spirits up while he healed. I think that shows he is strong and determined.I liked this book because it teaches a person how to survive in the wild. It also shows how to be determined when something bad happens.

I gave it a five star rating for its wonderful insides.I gave Hatchet a five star rating because I thought it was a wonderful book. I love Paulsen's wonderful detail. In his book the way he writes he repeats things like he repeats mistakes, divorce, and secrets. I think this strengthens his writing and makes it more intriguing. This book is one of my favorites I feel I could read it over and over again and never get tired of it.He has explicit details in the parts where he describes the crash and how Brian rips his fingernails off when he was trying to open his seat belt and that whole scene. He was left in the wild to suffer alone. He always overcomes his obstacles and his fears. He builds his fire, avoids the bear he stumbles on to, catches fish, builds a spear then a bow and arrow and survives for the time he has to live.I hope you chose this book because it is the best. Reading isn't my favorite thing to do but this was worth my while. I would also recommend Dogsong, Woodsong, Sleeping Freshman Never Lie, and the Giver.

The main character did his best to live in the wilderness with harsh conditions the best he could.

Well, that is all I have to say about the wonderful book of Hatchet"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet has won the Newberry award and it's one of the best books we've ever read. The author of Hatchet is Gary Paulsen. You should read more of his books (if you have not read one already). The genre is realistic fiction, adventure and action. The main character is named Brian Robeson. Brian is on his way to visit his father, because his parents are divorced but on the way the plane crashes. Suddenly he finds himself in the Canadian wilderness all alone with nothing but his Hatchet."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The book Hatchet was a really great adventure book. It's about a boy whose plane crashes in the wilderness. He has to learn how to survive using the hatchet his mother gave him. All alone, he has to learn how to find food, make a fire, and not give up the hope that he will be rescued.Gary Paulsen is a great writer and I hope that if you get Hatchet, you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I thought the hatchet was an all right book but it wasn't the best book I've ever read. Gary Paulsen could have expanded this book and made it better. Because it was really short and he could have made it longer. It was only 200 pages. I can relate to this book because Brian and me both hunt and love outdoors. I also know what it feels like to lose your stuff by a tornado because this summer my house was hit by an tornado. If you liked Gary Paulsen you should check out some of his other books because they are al full of adventure"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hachet, by Gary Paulsen, is a very strang book. Brian Robeson must survive in the wilderness by his observations of nature. He's a kid who has horrible luck and then good luck. For example, Brian is cold and mosquitos are biting him. He learns how to make fire, which gets rid of the coldness and the smoke gets ride of the mosquitos. I like the book because of all the animals Brian sees in the forest. he sees wolves, rabbits, porcupines, birds, turtles, and fish. I also like the way he survies and how he depends on one single tool. I would recomend this book to people likes adventure stories."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I'm sorry, but it was BORING! I really disliked it. It was kind of interesting the way he survived, but still it was boring. It seemed to drag on forever, and there just seemed no point. I mean I know there was a point and a plot, but I don't think it was shown very well."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Oh, sure, Paulsen is brilliant. And in theory, this book should be, too. Paulsen does a good job of writing, but he does in the wrong way. It's far from a Swiss Family Robonson or a Robinson Crusoe. Heck, after this, you'll be yerning for Gilligan's Island! With little events and nothing happening, the book gets old...fast."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is one of the best books I have ever read. When I ordered it I stayed at home for 3 days waiting for it to show up. When I finaly got I couldn't stop reading it. I recomend this book to any who can read. This book id DA BOMB."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book, called Hatchet is about a boy named Brian. He was going to visit his father in Canada one summer, when his plane crashes in the middle of nowhere. He had to spend most of the summer alone, trying to survive. The only tool he has is his hatchet given to him by his mother before he goes on his trip.I liked this story because it was interesting. It made me want to read on, because I didn't know what was going to happen next, if he will die, or if he will find food, or if he will be rescued.The only thing I didn't like was the ending of the book; it just didn't fit. But you might like it, and there's only one way to find out. Read it!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is a very good book. This book is one of the best book I ever read.

Another thing was Gary Paulsen is a very good writer and uses wonderful details and makes you feel you are Brian. Brian is the main character in this story but one thing that I didn't like about the book is the beginning of the story. I don't think that I would have kept on reading it if I didn't have to. But the part that kept me reading was when the plane crashed. That was one of the scary parts of the story. I recommend this book to people who like adventure stories."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The story is about a boy who gets lost in the Canadian wilderness. He is the lone survivor and makes it through fifty-four days in the wilderness with his brains, common sense, and a hatchet. The hatchet is his link to the world he left behind and the key to his survival. The story tells how the boy progresses from helplessness to resourcefulness. In the end, the boy is finally rescued and brought back to civilization. It is a fairly fast-moving story for only having one character. The author's descriptions make you feel as it you were there with the boy.I would recommend this book to anyone in my age group, or older. The story is well-written and very descriptive. The story itself follows logically from point to point. You can actually imagine being with the boy going through his problems and conflicts. I think anyone in my age group, both males and females, would enjoy such a great book.My favorite part of the story was when the boy experiences his discovery of building a fire. After going through desperate measures, he uncovers a certain type of rock in the wall that explodes with sparks when hit with the metal of the hatchet. This allows the boy to get such a brilliant, blazing fire going as soon as those sparks caught onto his woodpile. As a result, the boy was able to cook his meals. The exhilerating story was full of other adventures that I also enjoyed, but this was one of the best. I absolutely think this story is one of the best I've read so far."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"HACHET IS ABOUT A BOY WHO IS GOING TO MEET HIS DAD.THE PLANE CRASHES AND HE'S THE ONLY SURVIVOR.

The first time I read it, I didn't enjoy it at all. I thought it was very boring. But then I read again just this passed year and I really enjoyed it!! My point? You should always give a book or anything else a second chance before deciding on whether you like it or not. You might end up liking it the second time. I know I am 15 years old, but I still really did like it and I think anybody would like it. It is a really good survival story and I think it is a really good book to read (especially in the summertime). It is definently one of my all-time favorite books! Some other books by Gary Paulsen that are really good and that I have read are &quot;Cayons&quot;, &quot;The River&quot;, &quot;Brian's Winter&quot;, and &quot;Brian's Return&quot;.

Our son has struggled with reading from the get-go, AIS, tutors, ADHD, the works! There is such a huge emphasis put on reading in elementary school and this becomes a nightmare for the parents whose child refuses. I am happy to say that this book took all the stress out of reading. My son, who just started 6th grade (first year of middle school), actually read on his own with no prompting from us, and did it lightning quick. He is now asking to download the sequel--music to our ears! If you have a child that is into this type of story, this book is very well written for child that doesn't love reading. It kept him turning the page. Other than the Wimpy Kid Diaries (which I consider \\"comic books\\"), this is the first book our son has read with huge interest."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"An oldie but a goodie.

The main character, Brian Robeson, age 13, is very realistic and believable. His unique personality can not be matched because he had \\"hope\\" in tough conditions. The story took place in the Canadian woods, and you would not believe how he got there! My favorite part was when the moose \\"visited\\" him.

Brian must survive alone in the Canadian wilderness with nothing but a hatchet. He must face challenges that most stranded people must face. He needs to find shelter, food, water and multiple other things to help him survive. I liked how the story ended, but if I told you what happened I would spoil the book for you.

His character really stands out as he explains about how he had discovered his mom's secret. Gary Paulsen explains every move Brian makes with definite description, which of course brings me to my next reason why you should read this book.The details in this book are excellent but yet can be a bit gross, such as every time Brian throws up it tells you every little detail of what makes him nauseous. Gary also tells in great description on Brian's feelings. He acts as if he is mad at the world. His feeling really erupt when he describes his mother's secret in which in his opinion is very bad.The character that Brian is taking role of is a very good character if I do say so myself. This book really makes you think about who Brian is and what makes him who he is and why. He doesn't try to be anyone else but him and that's what makes this book a really great book.Now that you have heard all about this book now its time to read this book!

He builds a raft and floats out to the plane. He uses his hatchet to cut a hole large enough for him to get in. he finds the pack jammed under one of the seats. When he finally gets it loose he looks up and sees the body of the pilot. There was no skin left on his face because the fish had been eating it, the fishes he had been eating.

On the plane trip to Canada the plane's pilot had a heart attack and died. Brian was in the plane alone and had to crash it into a lake. All Brian had were the clothes on his back and his hatchet and he has to use those things to live by himself in the Canadian wilderness. Will Brian die, get rescued or have to spend the rest of his life in the Canadian wilderness?I liked how Gary Paulson made the book believable by making both the good and bad things that happened to Brian in it. I also liked that the book was so unpredictable. Another thing that I liked was the events that he put in it. He put very few boring events, they were all very exiting. I didn't like that the book was so short and easy to read.Anyone who likes outdoor books would love this one because almost the whole story takes place outdoors in the Canadian wilderness. Also adventure books lovers may like it because the book is about Brian's adventure.

The only people who wouldn't like this book are people who hate the outdoors."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Over all this was a pretty good book. I thought that Brian was going to die for almost the whole story. The book kept me on the edge of my seat/bed or where ever i was sitting at the moment. I think that the author Gary Paulsen did a great job on this book. If you like this book you should check out the book Brian's Hunt, or Brian's Winter they are pretty good books to. If you are an action adventure person then i think you should definetly check out this book and other stories from the award winning author Gary Paulsen. I gave this book 4 out of five stars simply for the fact that the book was great, but there is always room for improvement. I don't know how this book could be any better but I'm sure there is a way. Gary Paulsen might find out what is missing and write another book about Brian and his adventure's. Until then I will be looking for other books created and witten by Gary Paulsen."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This was an excellent book for children looking for an adventure.

There is no one else around to help. now he is stranded in the forest with only a hatchet and does many diffrent things to stay alive when a pilot comes and saves him. I thought this book was a very good book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Your plane just crashed. You're all alone in the Canadian wilderness. What do you do? Newbery award winner Hatchet by Gary Paulsen puts thirteen year old Brian Robenson in this situation. He must use a hatchet, other hand-made tools, and his wits to survive.As I said above Brian Robenson is stranded in the Canadian wilderness after his plane crashed, Brian was the only passenger and his pilot died instantly. He must prolong his life until somebody can rescue him, and try to do so before winter comes. During his journey he must face many obstacles.One exciting moment in the story was when Brian foolishly left recently cooked eggs in the open for animals to smell. Luckily for Brian it was only a skunk that found him. Unfortunately the skunk sprayed him, which quickly contaminated his stored food and made all his clothes (what was left of them) smell like skunk.The novel's strong point is definitely the description. For example, \\" Brian Robenson stared out the window of the small plane at the endless green northern wilderness below. It was a small plane, a Cessna 406- a bush plane- and the engine was so loud, so roaring and consuming and loud, that it ruined any chance for conversation.\\" If this doesn't show great description I don't know what does.I thought this was an okay book, not all that good just okay. At times it seemed like the author was running out of ideas. I recommend this to people who like the wilderness, because they might be able to connect with Brian and like this book more than I did. I'll give it a 2/5."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Gary Paulson's book \\"The Hatchet\\" was nearly mesmerizing. I, personally, would recommend this book to any who can read.This story all begins on an ordinary trip to Brian Robeson's father. This trip is normal until the pilot flying the plane suddenly has a heart attack while they are in the air. Brian then tries to fly the plane but it is no use. The plane crashes into the Canadian forests. Brain, very luckily, survives the plane crash. Brian's anger will not help him on the adventure that he is about to begin. He knows he has nothing, but his strength and knowledge. He has no food or shelter.Gary Paulson just pulls you into the story with his way of words. As you are reading you feel as if you are a part of the story. The imagery seems real and then suddenly the mood of the story nearly becomes reality"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Have you ever Known a survivor are you one.

A porcupine comes trudging into camp. Plus he survives a rough winter.The character of Hatchet is very interesting because, he lives by himself for a very long time. He was forced to fight animals. He built a sweet fort. He is also a 13 year old boy struggling to live.The setting of Hatchet is very real. It is in the frozen upper part Canada. He is surrounded by trees. He is trying to get were his dad is. There is no sight of life. After a long story you will learn how to survive in the wild and I hope you're never in this situation, but you never know!

It was especially exciting when the tornado ripped though his camp. I thought those parts were cool because I had never read a book with a natural disaster as quick as this one.

This story is about a boy named Brian who's flying to Canada to visit his dad. The pilot suffers a heart attack and crashes in a lake. Now Brian's stranded on a lake with no food or water.

Hatchet by Gary Paulson is a great book. Brian faces many challenges such as finding food and just trying to survive. This book is only about two hundred pages long. After the third page I was hooked. I couldn't put the book down. Brian is flying to Canada so he can spend the summer with his dad when the pilot has a heart attack and they crash. Brian is left in the Canadian wilderness with nothing but a hatchet[a small axe]. He has to survive bear attacks, tornadoes and skunks. Brian has almost no knowledge of the wilderness and has trouble surviving.My favorite part of the book is when he finds the dead deer and says it looks like it got hit by a semi truck. I liked this part because I had fun imagining how bad it must have looked.The most important thing I learned from this book is that you must always stay on your flight plan.Other books by this author are Brian's winter and Brain's hunt. They are the sequels to hatchet.This book is amazing so next time you are in a library make sure to check out hatchet and its sequels."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I love the book Hatchet.

I loved the story and the way the author kept the reader engaged. I am now tutoring a 7th grade student who, I hope, will enjoy the book as much as I did! I was thinking ahead for once, and got it as a Christmas present."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet Book ReviewHatchet is a book great for any child to read, it's about the adventures of a thirteen year old boy lost in the Canadian Forest. This book was written by the award winning Gary \\"the MAN\\" Paulsen. Hatchet has been awarded the Newberry Honor Medal. Many students and teachers have enjoyed reading this book it embraces the heart of adventure and challenges.The main character of this book is Brian Robeson. The story begins with him dealing with his parents divorce. He goes to visit his father and this is what puts him on the plane that eventually crashes. Throughout the book we experience how a child views divorce and how it affects their opinion of their parents. Our group enjoyed reading this book because as future teachers we know students would be able to connect to this book. We think it's important to have a book for children to make text to life connections. Another main character in the book is Brian's Hatchet. The character might not be an ordinary character but it proved to be his only companion in the forest. The hatchet protected Brian and created comfort when he was alone. In our opinion Brian wouldn't have survived without his trusted hatchet.The majority of the story was set in the Canadian forest next to an L shaped lake. Brain experienced raw nature at it's finest in the forest. He had to search for food and shelter to stay alive. There are many lessons that Brian learned during his trial in the forest. As readers we grow to understand his battles and can vividly put ourselves in his situation.There are three main themes in the book Hatchet. The first theme is man vs. nature. This theme forces Brian to deal with the elements of nature if he wanted to survive. This is a captivating part of the book, which feeds the mind with adventure and suspense. The next theme is the power of positive thinking, which is a great lesson for anyone. As future teachers this encourages us to stay positive through the difficult times that we will experience. Brian's teacher instilled that into Brian and we hope to do the same in our teaching. The last theme is about maturing. Brian has to be independent and in the process grows up.Our group has loved reading Hatchet. It has captivated our imaginations and created a hunger for children's literature! We highly recommend this book to anyone that wants a good read."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This is my third time reading it and I recommend this book to outdoor enthusiasts and young kids who love adventure."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"in 7th grade i read this book.Hatchet is a book about a boy who was in a plane then the plane crashed.The polit died and the boy had to live in the woods for weeks.At first i thought it was going to be boring,but as i got more and more into the book i started to like it."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Paulsen did a wonderful job with this book.

I live in sunny San Diego, California, where it never snows. I can only imagine being in CANADA lost in the forest, surrounded by all that wilderness, and only having a hatchet to survive. Raw fish, berries, turtle eggs, and no fire for the first few days are definitely not my idea of fun. And after that, finding out the fish Brian's been eating have been feeding on the dead pilot's flesh almost made me puke.

I read this book when I was in junior high, and again in college for a YAL class. The book is very entertaining and easy to read for the less advanced readers. Paulsen is exceptionally good at introducing more difficult words, and then explaining what those words mean. In this way, he can expand the readers vocabulary without confusing them. The book could also appeal to those with more advanced reading skills, because of it's almost peotic rhythm. The author gives his reader the emotions and background of his characters, and then lets the reader fill in the blanks as to how their own senses would react. I would recommend this book to teachers and parents of students who need to devolope the love of reading."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian was 13 year old boy who got lost after getting on an airplane with an older man.

It was a very good book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The middle schoolers at the school I work at recommended this book and I will have to give them a high five on Monday. Brian has a secret, he knows the reason behind his parents' divorce. As he boards a one-engine plane in the co-pilot seat to see his father for the first time in Canada, this is the big thing on his mind. Hours later, when the pilot (who has been passing some horrible gas for a while) clutches his heart and dies, Brian has a lot more to think about. This young man's tale of survival and solitude made me think about the many things we take for granted every day. It also made me think about how modern conveniences have changed us as humans and made us perhaps more crude and uncivilized than the people who came before us. Readers who enjoyed Island of the Blue Dolphin, The Swiss Family Robinson or White Fang would definitely enjoy this book, but most everyone should give it a shot."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is was interesting and good to read aloud.

I really enjoyed the story. It's not long, which I understand since it's for young adults, so you may read it in one sitting. As a former boy scout, I had to laugh at some of Brian's learning curves when he first found himself in the wilderness. The book is the story of his survival, what he learns, and how he changes from a kid to a mature young man. Boys are sure to enjoy the book for it's theme. If you are considering this book but scared off by the YA age rating, don't be, it's a great book!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"In this book, Brian (the main character) becomes lost and alone in a Canadian forest with only a hatchet that his mother gave him.One summer, Brian was on his way to visit his father for vacation. Then, the only thing on his mind was divorce. Lost in his thoughts, he watched the pilot die in a major heart attack, and he began to crash land. After he woke and got bitten by angry mobs of mosquitoes, the only thing left on his mind was food. With only a hatchet, he made a shelter, fishing spears, hunting bows and arrows, and most important of all, fire. After few weeks, when everything was fine, (well, at least on his scale of survival,) a tornado struck and all of his hard works disappeared. Next day, when he scanned the area for repairs, his heart rose at the sight of a crash-landed plane's tail. With his heart driving him, he desperately searched for a survival pack somewhere underwater in the plane and he found it. After ooh and ahh-ing at the contents of the survival pack, a plane arrived telling that the pilot caught his signal through the emergence transmitter which Brian was disappointed at seeing that it wasn't MP3.In MY opinion, the theme of this book was to give us some joy, adventure, and happiness, but most important of all, what we need to survive. Most of us may think about internet and money, but let me tell you, less than a week in a wild with only a hatchet, NO WAY! To sum up, I think it is a very good book, and all of those who read these review should see it."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I bought this book (and the other 4 books in the series) for my sons, 9 & 11 years old.

My older boy has read it already, too, and he also enjoyed reading it. Paulson gives has vivid descriptions of the setting of a boy that is stranded alone in the forest after a plane crash. He describes the boy's actions and also what was going through the boy's mind as he learns to live off the land & survive.

And then he had to survive on his own with only his hatchet he is going to have to depend on the wilderness he will have to build his own shelter and collect his own food.The most important thing I learned is that you are alive and you are alive if you want to be and you try to be and that surviving in the wilderness is really hard by yourself.Another book that I believe will be great is brains hunt and brains winter they are both wonderful books I believe from what other people say and me to.I will give these books 5 stars because it is about the best book I have ever read and because it has so many details and I loved ever single detail. It also has so many great pages I really didn't think a book could get any better."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I've read a lot of books for a kid, but I have to admit, this is one of the best!

During the ride, however, the pilot suffers a heart attack and dies. The plane soon crashes and Brian is forced to live on a lake by himself, living with the thought of his parents' divorce always in his mind, with only a hatchet that his mother gave him as a parting gift. Eventually Brian fends for himself when he is attacked by a moose, a skunk and a porcupine, hit by a tornado and devoured by mosquitoes.

And was it ever! Brian gets a hatchet as a gift from his mother, and when his little plane crashes in a lake in the Canadian wilderness, he finds many ways to use his new hatchet to keep himself alive. He uses his hatchet to protect himself from a porcupine that tries to attack him in the middle of the night; he also uses the hatchet to make firewood to keep himself warm at night. Brian spends 54 days in the woods, by himself. A twister turns the crashed plane so that the tail sticks out of the lake, and another plane, flying overhead, sees the tail sticking out of the water. The pilot lands his plane on the lake and when he sees Brian he realizes he's found the kid that searchers stopped looking for weeks ago.

The story begins when Brain is on a plane going to visit his father because his parents are divorced. During the flight the pilot has a heart attack and dies. The plane crashes but Brian survives the problem he is stranded to an island and no one where he is. The meaning of this book to me is not how to survive on an island is your plane crashes. It shows how you have to stay strong no matter how difficult life gets. Brian goes through a lot of the same situations most teens got through every day. I think teens like me can learn a lot from this book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I read almost all of Paulsen's \\"Brian\\" series and all I can tell you is that he has a knack for fiction of this sort. I don't want to resort to cliches, but nothing can describe this book but the \\"I couldn't put it down for a second\\" line. It is very intelligent fiction at its best, and Paulsen's descriptive eye gives you a look at what it's like to be stranded in the Canadian wilderness.I read this book in fifth or sixth grade and I don't usually read modern fictional works, but this was an exception. I feel that modern fiction lacks the eloquent and beautiful language that the classics have, but this book doesn't need fancy pedantics. It does just fine without them.I recommend this to any young reader, or any adult reader, for that matter, if you are interested in the wilderness, outdoors, or general Gary Paulsen.

Well that's one of the problems in the book hatchet by Gary Paulsen it has one hundred ninety one pages. Brian is the main character. He is lost and alone in the wilderness with only a hatchet, how long will Brian survive? Well if you want to find out go to your nearest library and check out this great book hatchet!The book hatchet is written by Gary Paulsen and the main character is Brian Robinson. He's thirteen and lost and alone in the wilderness with only a hatchet, how long will Brian survive? He has to find food, face animals. Brian also has to make a shelter for himself; he got poked by a porky pine while he was lying down in his shelter. He tried throwing his hatchet but he missed and hit a stone that's how he discovered how to make a fire in the wilderness. Brian is so interesting and brave he's also smart because he has to learn how to survive in the wilderness. I would be freaking out right at that moment but not Brian Robinson. This book is sad its gross it's awesome it's..... HATCHET!My favorite part of the book is when the pilot has a heart attack and dies because it was so tradjic and chaotic it's so scary like when I'm reading the book I start to panic because I'm worried about Brian. I try and read faster to see what happens next. The pilot turns pale white and freezing cold like a vampire or something. I love that part. It's almost the first part of the book. I like the way that it pulls you in and you feel like you're really there.The most important thing that I learned from reading this book is that you always have to be prepared for anything. Just so you don't get hurt and so that your always ready for something bad to happen.The other books that are similar to the book hatchet are\\"The river\\", \\"Brian's hunt\\", \\"Tracker\\", ECT. These books are all by Gary Paulsen and alike to Hatchet.I recommend this book because it's a Newbery honor book, a heart stopper and also this book has some action and if that's the kind of book you're into than Hatchet the one for you."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is my all time favorite book to read with my 5th grade class.

And next thing Brian knows, the pilot starts jerking in his seat. At this point, it is clear that he was having a heart attack. The attack stops and the pilot is dead. Brian is forced to take over the controls. After a long descent, the plane crashes into a lake in the Canadian woods where Brian is stranded. Later in the story, Brian finds a survival pack in the plane and opens it. It has various items and something that just might save him. The item is labeled \\"Emergency Transmitter,\\" and Brian starts tinkering with it, hoping that this will help him get home, but adventure awaits.I would recommend this book to people of all ages. This is one of the best books that I have ever read. It deals with divorce, loss, and survival.

The forests of northern Canada are looming with dangerous animals like a moose he got attacked by and skunks. The forest's only food is berries and fish from the lake. Also, this is a very dangerous place to be due to the violent storms and quickly changing weather. Hatchet is the story of a 13 year old boy named Brian surviving for 66 days after his plane crashes on the way to visit his father. Brian has a lot of sadness in his life because of his parent's divorce. After Brian's parents get divorced, everything goes wrong for him. His father had to move back to northern Canada and work on an oil rig. After not seeing his dad for a while, Brian decides to visit his father. On the flight there, the pilot has a heart attack and the plane crashes in the middle of nowhere. Luckily Brian survives the crash but he is way off course because the pilot changed course accidentally during his heart attack. Brian crash landed in a long lake where he had to battle the forces of nature. He had a hatchet that his mother gave him for the trip, which he uses for a variety of survival skills. Due to his lack of materials, Brian had to figure out how to find food and make shelter with whatever he could find. During his period of time that he is lost in the woods, Brian makes a small hut and a fire with his hatchet, figures out how to catch fish with a spear and learns many other ways to survive. He constantly tells himself to keep believing in himself even though he thought he should give up because his life back home was a mess and he probably wouldn't come out of the forest the same. Why do you think the author chose to end Hatchet the way he did?I would give this book 4 out of 5 stars. I think the author used very intricate details about the events that happened throughout the book. Although he used intricate details, he did not describe the characters very well. The only character the author described which was brief was Brian. The author did not describe his mother or father very much. I really enjoyed the parts of the book where the author talked about all the different ways Brian discovered how to survive and all the different tools he used to survive. The author was very detailed and descriptive about all the events that happened to Brian such as a moose attacking him. The way the author was able to describe all the different parts of the moose attack, like the way the moose hit Brian and how Brian felt when he got up where great to read. If you were looking for a book to read soon, I would strongly recommend Hatchet."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"How many problems do you think can occur through out a novel?

Not a unique storyline, but the nuances of the writer, his amazingly unique 'voice' and the rich details that he points out are ingrediants for an excellent experience.At one point the young man observes something to the effect of: \\"Life was difficult, every bite had to be fought for, worked for and sacrificed for, and yet as I looked out over the setting sun, on the L shaped lake, drew in the rich clean air and listened to the sounds that city-life had deafened me to, I found I only wished to share. Wanted someone, anyone to say, \\"LOOK! LISTEN! TASTE!\\" But there was no one to share with. There was only me, and indescribable beauty\\" (That isn't a quote, but the essence of the feeling I had from the passages)Worth anyone's time, but I believe the reading audience was intended to be from about 10 - 16.

He's going to see his father for the summer (his parents are divorced) when the pilot of his small plane has a massive heart attack and dies. Brian must control the plane for nearly three hours before running out of gas and crashing into a lake.Gary Paulsen uses some great foreshadowing because at one point he describes how trees were knocked down in a path. This later comes into the story and has a great effect on Brian. Once something happened, I realized why Gary Paulsen put detail into what he described to make it a foreshadowing. Gary Paulsen uses great detail in things you might not want to have detail such as when Brian sees the pilot and his dead body.

A lot of it was from you reading to us and teaching us not to write run on sentences.Ms. Parson, do you remember when you read the story Hatchet out loud to the class? Well, that book has really made a difference in my writing and it has made me start liking reading. Before you read that book, I use to hate reading and writing, but then after you read that book to the class it made me realize that reading can be fun if you choose topics that you like and think are interesting.What I liked most about Hatchet was the plot because it had a lot of action/ adventure in it, and I love action/adventure, and it was really funny. So after I read that book I started putting a lot of action/ adventure in my stories. You can see my great adventure in my story \\"Life in the Roman Army.\\"This book has changed the way I write, and it has made me like reading a whole lot better. Thank you for reading Hatchet out loud to the class. It has helped me a whole lot.Another thing that helped me a whole lot is that when you taught us to write complete sentences. Now that you taught me that I now try not to write incomplete sentences and I can pretty much identify if I have incomplete sentences in my writing. It makes it more fun now that I know how to write complete sentences because it makes it easier to write.Thanks again for all of your help.

Everything that he described I could so picture with perfect detail. But, I seriously doubt that he taught himself how to make his own bow and arrows.

(The pilot has a heart attack and crashes the plane.) To survive, Brian has to rely purely on his instincts about what to eat, what to do or not do. I enjoyed this story because it was full of adventure. My favorite part is when Brian, who lives on his own for 54 days, finds \\"the survival pack.\\" Hatchet would have been an even better book had it not been so concerned with \\"the secret.\\" Without this part of the plot, it would have been strictly a survival story, which is really where the author did the best storytelling.

Both are by Jean Craighead George."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book was given to my son's fifth grade class and I was shocked that the plane crash details were so gruesome at times, the topic of the mother cheating on the father and then the very disturbing issue of the main character trying to kill himself.

It was written by Gary Paulson who wrote many great award winning books, including a great sequel. I would give them both four stars for great survival stories. I found the middle and end of Hatchet very entertaining, but the beginning didn't have nearly as much action. A 13 year-old boy, Brian Robeson was going to see his dad in Canada when the pilot of the two person plane got a heart attack and they crashed. Then he was stranded in the wilderness with only a small hatchet on his belt. A good plot. The writing style of this book was pretty good. Gary Paulson put in alot of action but didn't make it too scary, but he made it very realistic. I asked myself, is this really a realistic fiction? Gary Paulson made it seem like the story really occurred. Now I strongly recommend you to read it yourself to enjoy."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This was very boring and uneventful.

It only talked about how he was thirsty and his mosquto bites hurting. It wasn't very interesting for the first 150 pages. After that, there was some exiting and iteresting parts in the book. I won't tell you what they are because you have to read the book to find out. I do not recommend this book to children under the age of ten because there are some suasidal thoughts and suisidal actions involved in the book. If you like a survival story, then read this book.

The best thing about this book is the suspence and detail that Gary Paulsen used to make you feel as if you were right there, looking into the same cave, the same lake, and the same woods as Brian did for so long. It also made me realize that I wouldn't have been able to survive if I were in Brian's place, I would have no clue. By reading this book, it has widened my knowledge toward the wilderness and how we take advantage of it. &quot;HATCHET&quot; is a good book, and I now know some things to do in the wilderness if I were in that position!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"A 12 year old boy is on his way to visit his dad in Canada.

He has only a hatchet as a weapon. Brian needs to learn how to be independent or he will never survive. I recommend this book because it kept me interested, it was usually touching, and has a very detailed setting that is absolutely astonishing.In the same way the theme in this novel is Brian trying to adapt or change to his surroundings, the woods. Three supporting details or examples are building a shelter out of wood. Another is finding materials to make a fire. Lastly he eats fresh fish, berries, and other things he finds to survive.Over this entire novel is about Brian, the main character, who is very believable because he will do everything humans would to survive. Often he tries to contact someone for help. He panics when his life is in jeopardy. Also he's brave and changes to depend on what he has to live.In this novel the woods were so realistic and beautifully detailed. Woods plus wild animals with rivers and lakes spread across the land. Almost every day Brian interacts with wild animals. Miles of land filled with bright, green, and fresh trees. One L shaped lake rights were he crashed glistened when the sun beamed down on this beautiful site.In conclusion I recommend this mid blowing novel to most people who enjoy adventure and ailment put into one amazing story. Some of the thins I loved about this novel is Brian struggling to survive, battle between wild animals, and over all the worries he stored in his mind and heart. I enjoyed reading this book and if I had the chance I would read it again."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"My book review of HatchetWhen was the last time you learned about surviving in the wilderness or getting ideas how to survive? Well if you haven't here is a way you can get ideas and read a great story. This book is about a boy named Brian and a terrible thing happens and that gets him stuck out in the wilderness. All he has is a hatchet that his mom bought him. I recommend this book because it can teach you things and it is a wild, shocking, and some times funny!This theme of the book is all about surviving, courage, family, and friends. Brian gets stranded and has to learn how to survive. When Brian has to find a bear or some times other animals it takes a ton of courage to do that because I would be scared if a bear tried to attack me. In the book something happens to Brain's family and I don't want to spoil it so you have to read it to find out. Another theme is friends. Brian is very lonely until he finds someone or something and the thing saved his life!The main characters in this book play a big role too. If there were no characters in the book there wouldnt be a story! Brian, Mom, Dad, the Pilot, and another friend were the main characters in this book. The most main character was Brian because that's what the book was about. Mom and Dad played a big role in this book because a huge tragedy happens at the end of this book. The Pilot did because something happens to him.The setting is another place that if it weren't there the story wouldn't make sense.The setting takes place most in the woods but there are other places like the airport and at home but there is one other place that he goes and it is pretty mysterious but he comes to find out what it is. But those are not so much of the main setting areas. The main area is the woods because through out the whole book Brian is in the woods most of the time.I was kind of mad at the end because I thought it ended at that point. But a ton of kids wrote letters to Gary Paulson sohe would write a sequal and he began to write sequels. I really like this book so I think you would really like it if you like Gary Paulson and survival stories. I also think this would be a smart and very awesome book to read because you can get ideas so if the same thing happens to you, you would know what to do. All Brian has is his one and only hatchet."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The Hatchet by Gary Paulson is a great book. A boy crashes a plane on the way to Canada where his dad lives. He has to fly to his dad's house because his parents are divorced. The boy's name is Brian. Brian lives with his mom in the city except for the summer when he lives with his dad. I recommend this book to anyone that likes interesting, exciting, and funny books.You now know how the story begins so I will now tell you about the theme. Brian is flying in a plane and the pilot has a heart attack and the plane crashes into the water. Now Brian has to get used to living in the wild. Brian didn't know much about living in the outdoors but then he started learning more and more each and every day. Brian has to go through many obstacles like bears, mosquitoes, and even a tornado! It would be very hard to do all of this on your own. Brian is almost always hungry. It is a good thing he found a lot of berries.Now I will tell you about Brian. Brian is very strong and funny. He also has a great personality. The book would not be the same without his great personality. Brian is the only main character in the whole story. That is probably because he stranded all by himself. Brian gets very smart at living out in the wild. Brian starts out just lying around and sleeping but then he gets up and starts doing work.Now that I have told you about Brian I will tell you about the setting of the book. Brian lives on a beach with a shelter. The beach surrounds a huge lake, which is where the plane crashed. The plane is still there throughout the story. Brian meets a lot of animals and creatures along is long journey.I also recommend this book to anyone that likes the outdoors, medium level books, and adventure. Brian can make you laugh during the story.Find out if Brian ever gets rescued from the beach. I loved this book and I hope you like this book as much as I did."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is about a young, 13 year old boy named Bryan. Bryan's mom takes him to the airport.

Bryan suddenly has to fly a plane all by himself.This book has a theme of survival. This book has the theme of survival because after the plane crashes he has to survive. It's hard to survive because after the plain crash he's hurt and he can't do a lot. He needs food and water if he wants to survive. He also needs a radio to get rescued.The characters in this book are Bryan, the pilot, and Bryan's mom. The characters in this book don't get talked about vary often. Except Bryan he's the main character. Bryans the only one on the plain that stays alive. There were only two people on the plane anyways.The settings are the plane, and the woods. The only way it changes is the plane crash. The main setting is the woods. The woods are in the book the most. In the woods Bryan has to learn how to hunt.I recommend this book for people how like to read medium books. It also has some long words. It's still a good book. I hope you have fun reading it."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I recommend this book to everyone because it is good. When's the last time a book about survival made you think about what you would do if you were there? A boy must survive in the wild. He must survive until someone gets him out of the wilderness. He gets stuck in the wilderness when he is in a plane and the pilot has a heartattack. The boy is thirteen.The setting is in the Canadian forest. This book has a good setting area. The setting is believable. The setting feels real. The setting makes you feel like you're acutely there.The character is brave. The character is smart. The character is happy in some parts and sad in others. The character is cold when he gets out of the water from the plane at the bottom of a lake and warm at night by the fire. The characters name is Brian.Hatchet is about survival. He must survive in the wild. He uses a hatchet to survive. Brian uses the hatchet to make bow and harpoons.He uses survival skills like fishing and hunting to survive. He survives in the wild because of the food there. The food he calls gut berries.Overall Hatchet is good. I give it a rating of 10. At the end the boy survives. A plane picks him up. He goes home in the end. Hatchet is a book by Gary Paulsen. Hatchet is from Gary Paulsens own encounters."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This is the most exciting book I have ever read! Paulsen's words come alive right off of the page! I like it beacuse the main character is a kid close to my age, he's 13 I'm 14, that I can relate to. This book starts off strong and keeps going strong all the way to the end. Once you start reading you won't be able to put it down. I can almost Guarantee you will love this book weather you like to read or not."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The pilot lets Brian have control of the plane for a second and gives him a short lecture on the main controls. After the lesson, the pilot takes control again. A few minutes later, the pilot grabs at his chest frantically and falls over onto the controls. Brian pushes him off the controls and tries to steer the plane back into the sky but it's too late. The plane crash lands into a lake in the middle of the Canadian forest. Brian Robeson is thirteen years old and is on his way to visit his father who lives in the Northern Canadian woods. On the way the pilot has a heart attack and dies. Brian crash-lands the plane into a lake in the forest. When he regains consciousness, Brian takes a look around and is at first frightened. After a little, he decides that he's just going to have to survive until he is rescued. Brian is put through many tests of survival and is injured many times. When a storm hits near him, it displaces the water in the lake next to him, revealing the sunken plane. He finds a way into it and grabs the survival kit. The kit has a lot of food in it and an emergency beacon. Brian turns on the beacon but it doesn't seem to work so he throws it aside. A couple hours later a helicopter comes and rescues him. It turns out that the beacon did work. I enjoyed reading this book. I would recommend it to people of all ages. There are survival situations in which people need to know some necessary actions to take. Brian is also a great character. He shows complete determination and emerges from this nightmare successfully.Brian is forced to get his own food, shelter, and clean clothing while staying in the forest. He does this by teaching himself to create spears, a bow and arrow, and other weapons and learning to hunt wild animals. Brian must also cook them and successfully creates a fire in which to cook them. He uses the lake next to him to wash his clothes and for water (thought it isn't completely clean). He also builds himself a little shelter made out of leaves, sticks, and mud.Within this dangerous adventure, Brian is injured many times. After being stuck in the leg with a porcupine's quills, he doesn't give up. He just, painful though it may be, pulls them out. Brian also becomes very ill from eating a bunch of nasty berries.By the end of Brian's nightmare, he has gathered enough food for more months to come and has acquired better tools from the plane in which to work with. He knows how to create a fire for cooking, a small hut for shelter, and use the lake to clean his clothes. He has also mastered the art of catching fish and hunting wild animals.As said before, I would recommend this book to anyone that is willing to read it. It teaches good morals and shows complete determination. I never got bored of reading Hatchet because I always wanted to know what problem Brian was to encounter next and how he was to emerge from it."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is a story about a boy who has divorced parents and is taking an airplane trip to see his father who lives in Canada.

A few monhs ago I reread it (now an adult). I it is really a good book. Better for those in Middle school then adult but truly entertaining."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"RecommendationI would recommend this book to anyone 11 years old and up because it presents a picture of how a young man survives the wilderness. Another reason would be that it was a very interesting story about survival. For example, any mistake that Brian makes could cause disaster. \\"Small mistakes could turn into disasters, funny little mistakes could snowball so that while you were still smiling at the humor you could find yourself looking at death\\". Another example is when Brian tries to start a fire, but does not know what to use. \\"Clearly there had to be something for the sparks to ignite, some kind of tinder or kindling-but what?\\" In conclusion, if you are interested in survival and adventure, then read this book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The main events in Hatchet are related to the conflict and the solution. The conflict was the plane crash that Brian was in. He had to survive in the Canadian wilderness. One of the solutions that he had to do to survive is make a home. He also had to find food by hunting and fishing. He had to make a fire to help him survive and be seen to be rescued. He was successful because he was rescued.I rate this book 5 stars because it showed how 11, 12, and 13 year old boys can take care of themselves when they are alone in the woods for 54 days.It also was interesting to read because Brian was keeping a secret and never told his dad. It was exciting because you would not know what was going to happen next."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Many others have written wonderful descriptions of what this book is about. I agree that it is is captivating and realistic about survival in the Canadian woods.Now I am teaching English in South Korea and the middle school kids need something to read in English that captures their interest and inspires them to want to read English. Such a book is &quot;Hatchet&quot;. Not only is the story an interesting adventure written in language that is not too difficult for the more advanced young ESL reader, it also provides an opportunity for city kids in another country to learn something about the lore of Canada. One boy that is reading it now can't wait for each new lesson to see what happens next - a rare thing among these kids who seemingly never get an opportunity to learn through sheer enjoyment."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is more than just a survival story. As Brian, a 13 yr old who is the only survivor of a plane crash while going to visit his father, learns to survive, he learns about himself as well as his surroundings. It is different than other survival books I have read because it guides you step by step through his thinking process. It is a primer on how to think, how to reason and problem solve, for this reason alone, I would love my children to read it.Beyond that it is really entertaining. It is suspensful and full of surprising twists and turns. You feel as if you are right there, as if you were Brian.The author Gary Paulsen has spent a lot of time in the woods; he has run two Iditarods (an Alaskan sled dog race). He says (after Brian's Return) that most of the things that happened to Brian have actually happened to him at one time or another.I recommend this book for 10 yrs and up. I will read it again, and I look forward to reading it with my boys.Sequels to this book (that should not be missed!) are The River, Brian's Winter, Brian's Return, and Brian's Hunt."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is about a boy named Brian and how he must learn to survive.

He learns many lessons from nature, including how to find food, keep warm, make a fire, and build a shelter.

This makes &quot;Hatchet&quot; an exciting book, because the reader is scared right along with Brian, happy with him, and even hungry with him.Paulsen uses this same theme, of character getting lost in the wilderness and finding himself, in many of his books. In fact, there are three other books about Brian. One is a sequel to &quot;Hatchet&quot;, another is based upon a different ending to &quot;Hatchet&quot;, and a third is a sequel to that book.

Ruple8R Literacy11 May 2012The main characters or should I say main character in my book, Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen, is Brian Robeson a thirteen year old boy who is from New York City. The setting for a bit in beginning is in a small plane, but the main setting is the wilderness of Canada during the summer. Brian's parents are divorced and he lives with his dad in the summer and his mom during the school year. Brian was on his way to his dad's place to say during the summer when the pilot of his plane has a heart attack and Brian fights to keep the plane flying and does for a little while, but eventually he runs out of gas and crashes in an \\"L\\" shaped lake and is stranded to fend for himself and to survive; thirst, hunger and shelter in the endless green wilderness of Canada.The pace was, in my opinion, a great compliment to the story introducing new struggles Brian has to overcome throughout the story. Brian I think is a very likable character because of his confidence, determination, and his survival and analyzing skills. I think the theme the author was trying to get across was, you could be surprised by what you can do to survive. I do think Paulsen successfully got this point across because of all the obstacles the \\"city boy\\" Brian overcame during his survival in the wilderness.

I always carry a knife with me or some kind of blade close by. I enjoy reading how-to books on camping, hunting, fishing and survival, but sometimes I just really want to enjoy a story. That's when I thought of this book. I read it when I was in grade school and thought it was really interesting, but with my new interest in the great outdoors I bought a copy for myself.I was mostly interested in the survival aspect of the story, but that does not mean the parts before the plane crash did not add to the story. All because he was lucky to have a hatchet with him after the plane crash he was able to create tools for fishing, hunting, building a fire, and building shelter. Close to the end of the book the importance of having that hatchet really shines. He could have had a machete, but it probably would not have been as effective. The book also does a great job of transforming Brian from a city boy to a survivalist. He learned many things about nature and the creatures that dwell in it. The book also shows the importance of thinking fast and acting fast, but not to be reckless since he could have died from starvation, the cold, drowning, wild animal attacks, and anything mother nature could throw at him. This book is a fun way to learn about survival and help the reader become a better person for other situations."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet by gary paulsen.I am doing this review for a book project in my english class. I picked this book because I always hear people talking about how good it is. So I decided to find out for myself weather it is good or not. I'm not really big on reading so not to many books intrest me but when I read the first page of this book it had my full attention and I did not want to put it down. The first chapter is full of action and excitement. Throughout this book a thirteen year old boy tries to survive with very few supplies. Luckly for him though it is summer and not winter. He has a hatchet that his mother gave him and a few more supplies from the plane.I'm not going to spoil the rest of the book for the people who have not read this action, thriller book.

While studying IB Unit of study \\"Sharing the Planet\\" and talking about how the survival of any species depends on it's interaction with outside variables and the adaptations that allow the species to continue to survive, I thought about introducing a book about survival for humans rather than leaning toward the adaptations of animals as is the usual focus. I am SO glad that I did. My students were absolutely enthralled by this novel and are so excited to take on the rest of the series. It's great to have student be able to identify with a character like Brian. Many of my students are living in homes that have been adversely affected by divorce or are currently undergoing a similar transition. The area that I teach in is a very transient area and I feel that this connected to my students on an emotional level, personal level, and additionally it integrated their current unit of study and allowed them to really envision and identify the adaptations that a person must go through to survive...in any situation! Great book! Definitely would have to be used as a read aloud considering the (at times) higher level vocabulary, but the kids were able to use context clues effectively to understand the meaning of words they may not have understood...like fuselage!Can't wait to read the next one, The River!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I read this book when I was a child and felt it should be a must read for my boys.

(#2063 as I write this.) And it's because of this kid-tested longevity that I'm going to suggest you buy \\"Hatchet\\" as the illustrated hardback. I think the drawings by Drew Willis and Gary's own author notes, make this version of the book worth a the extra cash because plainly put, it's likely to be a book that your children will keep and hand down to their own children, another 20 years from now.As for the story, it's about a teen boy, Brian, who suddenly finds himself stranded after the Cessna he was in crashes in a lake-- the pilot dying beforehand of cardiac arrest. It becomes a coming of age story not only because Brian has to overcome his own weakness, but because he also has to come to grips with his parents recent divorce and his mother's infidelity.This is a wonderful book that draws most kids into reading the entire series. Gary Paulsen's writing and his knowledge of how to survive in the wilderness is addictive.Great story that's been kid-test.a Pam T mini reviewBooksforKids-reviews"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The book hatchet was a good book. I recommend it to people that like a lot of suspense and books that you really have to think about. I also recommend the book to people in between the ages of 9-14 because if you're any younger or older it might be too hard or too easy.This book is about a 13 year old boy that is going to see his father in Canada and gets in a plane crash on his way and he is left alone to fight the wilderness with only a hatchet and goes through life changing experiences.My favorite chapter is the first one because in my mind I think that it was the best one that he wrote because it was very descriptive and it was the chapter that he got into a plane crash. Also if you do read thus book you will notice that she repeats things and I think it was kind of annoying but it really helped you understand the book.What I liked the most about the book is the things that he figures out in his life and another thing is how you see him change from depressed and sad to funny very, very smart and nice well I mean at least from what I read.The last I want ot say is the bad things about the book one of them is the auother needs to cool down with the bad things in life and that's really it.Well I hope that you read this book I promise you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Thirteen year old Brian Robson is without food or water and injured in the middle of nowhere... He's a everyday teenager that goes to school. His parents are divorced and he's on a plane to see his dad when disaster strikes... his pilot has a heart attack and dies. But the plane is still running. In a panic, Brian takes the wheel and aims for an L shaped lake with a little sand bed next to it. He crashed and survived... barely...Brian is smart, brave and strong. He was smart enough to figure out that the lake was made during the ice age and the beach was made by a big rock tumbling and a glacier crushing it. And if someone isn't brave surviving a plane crash then I don't know what is. He's physically strong by surviving a plane crash and after being very injured he still had the will to survive.This book is completely full of nature. It had some parts where nature threw everything it had at Brian like when animals were stealing Brian's only food. Brian never had any human friends to comfort him, but he met tons of animals like fool birds, fish, porcupines, bears, annoying bugs, wolfs, and some other birds. He also saw some mountains, trees and \\"gut cherries.\\" But the only not natural things he saw were his hatchet and his clothes.Brian had a huge struggle. Not only did he have to survive, but he had to survive alone. Imagine you're stuck on a island with nothing but the ruined clothes you're wearing. But Brian wasn't completely alone he had only one friend, his hatchet that his mother gave to him. The hatchet plays such a big role in this story that they named the book after it. He made stuff with it and almost died with it.The author's style of writing is a fish hook. If you don't know what that is I'll tell you. It's when the book gets so bad for the character that if you had a graph then all you would see would be a line down. Then something good happens and makes the arrow go up and the end result is the graph would look like a fish hook. The author also throws a lot of bad things at the character. But Brain did more than suffer, he accomplished a ton, like surviving a plane crash and more, but I don't want to ruin the book for you.This book is full of suspense, action, and drama. You should read it if you like books where the author likes to bully the character. You would also like this book if you like nature. Because I like nature and it seemed that I liked the book because I love nature. You might like this book if you like food. Because the food that he struggles to get makes you think more about food. And how grateful you should be for the stuff you have.Over all this Newbery Honor Award book has a hatchet swinging, sparks showering, and it is breath taking. If you like reading then you will never want to put this book down. And if you did read it and you want more then there are two sequels; the first is THE RIVER and the next is BRIAIN'S WINTER. I loved this book and I want to share the love for anybody that hears the book Hatchet mentioned. I promise if you pick it up you CAN'T put it down."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I read this book to my son...he loved the adventure part of the story that I read tohim.

This book reads easy and has a very direct path to the different sections of the reading. There are not too many hidden underlying aspects of the plot; it's more like a non-fiction read that lays out the facts in the order they are occurring. A 13 year old boy name Brian Roberson is the main character and takes up the majority of the book with his crisis and constrains in his new environment. He is very smart for a 13 year and has a self confidence about him. Well groomed and solidly built he transitions from boy-to-man in just 54 days; this being the main idea the author utilizes the tribulations Brian is experiencing with this parents. The story unfolds its structure based on the rugged Canadian Tundra setting and landscape, it is contained to just a small area that Brian hugs to the entire time. Paulsen utilizes this small setting to exaggerate the vast outer land that could be conquered by no man.Brian's mother, worried about him being away from home in Canada for the first time gave him a hatchet that the he uses for nearly everything. This is the relation of Brian with his mother, how she has always taken care of him and kept him safe; now he needs her more than ever and the hatchet which she gave him is representing the mother's presents in the crisis he is in. The complication has exposed itself as the reason Brian is going to his father's new home in Canada is that Brian witnessed his mother having an affair with another man. As mad as Brian is at his mother for her actions he is always reminded of her support by the hatchet in his hands that has saved his life up to this point. The crisis is easily seen by the boy stuck in the wilderness and winter is fast approaching with no real shelter or woodsman knowledge. He struggles through with bears, bugs, wolves, food, fire, shelter, and of course painful memories of home and his mother cheating.There is two climaxes that build from another; Paulsen takes the reader up, down, and then up again but they are two different climaxes with two different missions of delivering feelings. Brian swims to the plane wreckage and hatchets his way into the hull, he drops his hatchets and swims down into the plane to recover it and finds a survival pack, emergency transmitter, food, even a rifle which he had survived without. Now the hatchet given by his mother has delivered the means for escape and rescue. He believes the transmitter is not functioning but a fur-trading plane picks up his signal and brings him home. Other conflicts of the plot come later after the climax; once Brian is being rescued he misses his time in the wilderness alone, away from the drama and conflicts of his parents; this compiled with the transgressions obtained from a 13 year old boy going through his own bodily changes and outlook on life.This novel may seem simply put together and nothing but a story about a boy lost in the wilderness, but it is apparent the author carefully placed the structure of events and narration to deliver more than this. Brian has endured a number of tribulations, he learns and moves on from them being careful to not make the same mistakes again, much like he wishes his mother had never cheated. The boy his mother sent off to visit his father will emerge as a man with a new outlook on life. The resolution sets in as he see's life through new eyes, star struck at site of abundant and verity foods at the grocery store that he always took for granted, and his mother's fail and his coping father never letting go of being stung by the affair. The struggle of survival, and the tragedy of his parents getting a divorced all rolled into a hatchet that saves his life represents the carefully concealed details Paulsen delivered in this captivating story.References:"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is great a perfect read for anyone who likes adventures or survival.

Its about a kid that survies a plane crash and is stuck out in the woods without anyone else. He has to do what most can't. Like survive with only the clothes on his back and a hatchet that his mom gave to him. Anouther reason I like this book is because in away its like real life and not something you can't relate to. In the book he makes spears to kill prey and also makes a bow and arrows to kill what he calls foolbirds and other things he can eat. There is some pretty cool things that go on in this book like when he gets stuck by a porcupine and when he throws the hatchet at it he misses and the hatchet hits the wall. When this happends its makes a spark and thats when he started to use the rock in the shelter for starting fires. I think everyone that is reading this should go out and give this book a try for yourself and trust me you wont be disappointed."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book was great.

When he's going on a private plane to see his father the pilot has an unsuspected heart-attack. Brian lives through the crash and has to survive for months in the wilderness. This book has mystery, horror, laughter and suspense; so if you like these kind of books try this one out; I'm positive it'll be an A+++!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This is an outstanding book that many students in my seventh grade class, 7-216, found very exciting. Brad liked this book so much that he also read The River and Brian's Winter, David likes this book because it was dramatic and hard to put down. Travis reads like a champion and he really liked this book because he likes the wilderness and books about survival."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I really think there is no single book in the world that is similar to the book HATCET. Did you know that I feel so sorry and sympathetic for Brain because he had to stay in the Canadian woods for 54 days? That, for me, is a very long time! All this time Brian was only eating turtle eggs that he found under the sand. He also ate some fish and some raspberries. Brain met a mother bear with her two cubs and he also met the first wolf that he saw in his life. I was wondering if Brain would kill the bears and the wolves with his bow and arrow that he was making with his hatchet. Did you know that he had two best friends in the Canadian woods? They were the fires that he made with a big black stone and the hatchet. Brian cannot live without fire and hatchet! He needed fire for cooking and keeping himself warm at nights. The fire was also the guard to protect him from passing by wild animals. Never had he ever imagined that the Hatchet was so crucial to help him survive. Surprisingly Brain heard a plane approaching him. So he said to himself, &quot;If that is a plane, someone must be here to save me!&quot; But he was too late, the plane gone......gone. He could not understand why the plane was gone so fast. He mumbled to himself,&quot; I was too slow and could not make a smoke signal. I am lost...lost!&quot; I really think that E.B. White and Gary Paulson are brothers. They both share similar writing styles. In Charlotte's Web E.B. White did not introduce the main character Charlotte until the 5th chapter while in HATCHET Gary Paulson used million words to describe a scene. Both authors like to paint pictures in your mind. They are very successful in keeping the stories so interesting that people glue their eyes to their books and cannot get them off!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I was pre-reading this book for my 10-year-old who enjoys adventure stories (along the lines of \\"My Side of the Mountain\\") and was glad that I did. Some of the content of this book is NOT appropriate for this age -- for example, when the boy recalls the details of witnessing his mother engaged in an adulterous passionate kiss with her lover, which became \\"the Secret\\" his father did not know about. I'm not saying it is a bad book for an appropriately aged reader -- but I do want to warn parents looking for an innocent adventure story for their children -- this is not it."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I have read this book twice. Once in middle school and again in high school. Still I believe this is my favorite book of all time. Hatchet is an epic battle between man and nature. In this instance, man wins, but nature gives him a run for his money. This book is about a boy, Brian Robeson, who is flying in a bush plane on his way to Canada to see his father, who had just seperated from his mother. As they are flying, the pilot shows Brian the basics of steering the plane. He is afraid at first, but he gradually gets more comfortable with it. Suddenly, the pilot has a heart attack at the wheel, and Brian is left to navigate the plane on his own. He ends up crash landing in a lake, in the middle of the wilderness, where he somehow gets out and ends up on shore. He is left there to fend for himself, with nothing but a hatchet which he had received before he left for his trip. He built himself a lean-to for shelter, but his biggest threat comes at night with coldness and the inability to build a fire to stay warm. Throughout his time in the wilderness, a few other obstacles get in his way including: being attacked by a bear and a moose which he barely survived, and being sprayed by a skunk, which he probably barely survived either, while coping with hunger, all while trying to find a way out before winter sets in. Luckily he gets out by the time it really hits hard. He was very lucky. He became very strong mentally and physically. This is a great book. I would recommend it to readers of all ages."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Stranded in the Canadian wilderness after his two-passenger plane crashes, thirteen-year old Brian Robeson is forced to tap into reserves of resourcefulness and determination that he never knew he had in order to survive. In Hatchet, Gary Paulsen has managed to take the classic idea of a survival story and with it create an original and engaging masterpiece. This is definitely a book that everyone should read sometime in their life, and is one that especially every teenage boy must read. Paulsen's writing style and creativity are sure to capture and keep the interest of every young reader. This book is written especially for teenage boys, and they are extremely able to connect with it. In Hatchet, Gary Paulsen makes excellent use of characterization and realism to effectively connect with and captivate male young adult readers.One of the first instances in which Paulsen uses characterization effectively to connect with readers is when, while Brian is flying north in the bush plane, the pilot asks Brian if he would like to try taking the controls of the airplane. Brian at first responds the invitation doubtfully: \\"He had never been in any kind of plane, never seen the cockpit of a plane except in films or on television\\" (4). This example reveals to the reader that Brian is just an ordinary thirteen year-old boy just like them. He has not had any special upbringing or training that would prepare him to meet the challenges that he will face; he is just a regular teenager. Before the action of the book has even begun, similarities are presented between Brian and the reader. As the reader begins to identify with Brian, they become interested in how a person that is like them will respond to the challenges are put in his way, and so become more involved in the book.Another example of characterization is when Brian is reflecting on the recent divorce of his parents: \\"How he hated lawyers who sat with their comfortable smiles and tried to explain to him in legal terms how all that he lived in was coming apart\\" (Paulsen 2-3). This example shows again that Brian is just a normal teenager with his own struggles and difficulties. While many readers may not be going through a divorce, they have their own problems in their lives that are hard for them. This struggle gives Brian's character more depth and allows the reader to more fully identify with him. As a stronger connection forms between Brian and the reader, the reader becomes more interested in what will happen to Brian and becomes more fully invested in the book.This connection is strengthened further through Paulsen's use of characterization when Brian tries to light a fire without matches for the first time. He has a very difficult time getting the fire started, and finds himself thinking: \\"If only I had matches ... How did they used to do it? he thought. Rub two sticks together?\\" (65). Many times throughout the book, Brian finds that nothing in his earlier life has prepared him to solve the problem that is before him at that instant. Again the reader sees that Brian is a normal person with a background that is probably very similar to their own. They see that this is just a regular boy who is used to life in the city, but who now has these challenges thrust upon him. Once again, the reader becomes concerned with how Brian will overcome his challenges, because perhaps they would make choices similar to the ones made by this boy who is so like them.Paulsen uses effective characterization again when describing Brian's emotional responses to his challenges. On the second day that Brian is stranded alone in the wilderness, after a particularly difficult night, Brian is \\"almost overcome with self-pity. He was starving and bitten and hurt and lonely and ugly and afraid and so completely miserable that it was like being in a pit, a dark, deep pit with no way out\\" (70). This response to his trials is a very normal and human response. The reader recognizes that it is very ordinary to have such feelings when going through such a hard time, and indeed realizes that they themselves would most likely feel much the same way. Once again, the connection that the reader has with Brian and the story is strengthened.In addition to using effective characterization, Paulsen also successfully uses realistic and believable events to connect with the reader. One of the most significant ways in which Paulsen makes the plot of the story believable is that bad things happen to Brian. When Brian finds some berries to eat on his first day in the wilderness, he thinks that he has finally had some good luck, but the berries end up making him extremely sick: \\"Never anything like this. Never. It was if all the berries, all the pits had exploded in the center of him, ripped and tore at him\\" (67). This is just one example of the many misfortunes that come to Brian throughout the book. This makes the story seem very realistic because bad things do in fact happen to everybody. Brian does not have any extraordinary luck or fortune; he is just like anybody else. Anybody who reads this book will know that misfortunes are a fact of life. This allows the reader to form a connection with the book because it reflects what the reader has observed in his own life.Another way in which this book is realistic is that events occur suddenly with little or no warning. Only a few days into his isolation, Brian goes to sleep feeling good about the day's success only to be woken up the next morning being injured by a porcupine: \\"So fast, he thought. So fast things change. When he'd gone to sleep he had satisfaction and in just a moment it was all different\\" (81). Throughout the book, Brian experiences many other sudden changes in his fortunes. Again, this makes the story seem realistic. In real life, events occur without any warning. There is rarely any foreshadowing to signal that something bad is about to happen. Once again the reader sees truths from real life reflected in the book, and the story becomes easier to believe and to connect with.The story is also realistic because it is hard for Brian to find solutions to his problems. For example, when Brian tries to make a bow to use to catch fish, his first attempt is a failure: \\"He put an arrow to the string, pulled it back to his cheek, pointed it at a dirt hummock, and at that precise instant the bow wood exploded in his hands sending splinters and chips of wood into his face\\" (124). This failure comes after he has already failed at making and using a spear to catch fish, and even after he later successfully makes a bow it is difficult for Brian to learn how to use it effectively. Brian must figure out solutions to his problems by himself just like people in the real world must find their own answers to their difficulties. Those answers are not magically presented to him. The reader realizes that this is the way that things actually happen, and so again the story becomes more believable and reader becomes more interested in it.Paulsen also uses excellent imagery and details to make the story seem tangible and realistic. When Brian stops for a few moments to pay attention to his surroundings, he hears things that he has never experienced before: \\"When he started to listen, really listen, he heard thousands of things. Hisses and blurks, small sounds, birds singing, hum of insects, splashes from the fish jumping--there was great noise here\\" (41). Details and images like this are found throughout the entire book. These descriptions allow the reader to form picture of where the events described in the book are taking place. The details that are given make the setting seem richer, fuller, and more tangible. This firm setting allows the reader to sink deeper into the action of the book because they now have a place established in their minds where the events are taking place.All of these instances of characterization and realism, as well as the countless others found throughout the entire book, work together to effectively attract the interest of male young adult readers, as well as other readers of all ages. Paulsen is able to masterfully use these techniques to create a story that is engaging and captivating. This is one of the best books for young readers that I have come across. I would strongly recommend it for anyone who is looking for a good book to read, and if somebody is not looking for a book I would recommend it to them anyways. This book is a must-read for everybody!Edition Cited:Paulsen, Gary. Hatchet.

I really enjoyed this book and it held my interest with extraordinary descriptions and intense suspense. Hatchet contained adventure, but it also had deeper meanings not usually found in adventure stories. Although this book was not hard to read, and it was not very long, the descriptive details of the wilderness and the survival tactics kept me turning the pages.My favorite part of the story were the conflicts. The main conflict in the story was a boy trying to stay alive in the wilderness alone with no food. There also was a strong internal conflict that surfaced about \\"the secret\\". \\"The secret\\" was that Brian found out about his mother's affair. In trying to survive, smaller external conflicts occurred, such as animal attacks, tornados, and starvation. All of the conflicts combined made an exciting story. Another thing that I liked about the story was the theme. The theme of Hatchet was that Brian learned from his mistakes, and moved on. This was extremely important to the story because every mistake was very crucial. For example, when Brian's shelter was not closed securely, a porcupine was able to get in to the shelter and stick Brian with its quills. This injury caused Brian great pain and limited his ability to get survival supplies. He learned from his mistake and made his shelter more secure so animals could not enter as easily. Because Brian learned from his mistakes the story was more realistic.I disliked the mood of the story because some parts were sad. For example, the mood was sad when Brian thought his situation was hopeless. Actually, the sad mood was the only thing that I did not like about the story. I think that someone who likes adventure and challenge would like this story. A person who dislikes the outdoors probably would not like Hatchet. I enjoyed reading this book and I would read it again. I do not think that this book would make a good movie, because there was not much dialogue in the book, and I really do not think a movie without dialogue would be very good.A good lesson I learned from this book is that being positive will always help make a negative or difficult situation better. Reading this story really gave me a new appreciation for the necessities that I take for granted."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen is an adventurous story about a teenager, Brian Robeson, and how he survives over two monthes in the woods. Brian's pilot dies in the plane, so Brian tries to fly the plane and finds a safe place to land. Brian has to try to survive in the woods with many setbacks. For example, Brian is a city boy. He relies on his parents, a store where he can easily get food, and his house. During this experience, he learns from trial and error, common sense, and a little bit of what he learned from watching television. Brian has encountered many wild animals including a moose, a wolf, a bear, and a skunk. Brian goes through so much and so many set backs, it's hard to believe he lived for more then two months in the woods by himself with only his brain and his hatchet. He matures greatly and quickly when he pays more attention to what happens around him. After one month, the police and his parents quit looking for Brian assuming that he is dead. Will Brian survive through the harsh winter, or will he be saved? I would recommend Hatchet because it let's you see what it is like to live in the wild with nature and wild animals. In this adventurous story, you see how Brian is able to survive in realistic events, as well as see how he matures throughout the book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The book Hatchet is about a 13 year old boy named Brian, who is in a plane crash while on his way to visit his father. He tries to survive in the Canadian wilderness. Along the way he looks back on his past to help him survive. He has to find food, shelter, and make fire. Let me say he runs into some trouble. It is really Mother Nature against man in this book. Also in this book, there is a terrible secret and Brian is terrified.I would rate this book 4 stars because I think the beginning is slow, but it gets to normal pace near the middle. Then, the book is awesome."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"As one of the required readings for my students, I find this book to be interesting, simplistically written, and filled with enough adventure to appeal to the 12-year-old in all of us. While not up to par with similarly themed classics such as Stevenson's &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot; or Dafoe's &quot;Robinson Crusoe,&quot; the book has a contemporary feel and the text is for modern audiences."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Last year my entire class and I were forced to read Hatchet. I can truthfully say it was the worst book I've ever laid eyes on... Not only is it slow paced and so repetitive that I once seriously wondered if Paulsen had Alzheimer's, but the teacher made us read it one chapter at a time drawing out my agony.The detail, while amazing, dragged on way too long, (If you can't sit through a thousand different descriptions of the same tree stump don't read this book) and the whole book was completely predicable. So much that I found myself constantly, desperately pleading mentally for Paulsen to either get Brian rescued or kill him off and put me out of my misery.As if the plot and place setting being flawed weren't enough the Protagonist is a complete idiot! It is very hard to feel genuinely sorry for him when the survival pack sat at the bottom of the lake for the entire book and he doesn't think to get it until the books almost over. And as for the scene where the moose attacks Brian, I can't honestly say that I wasn't rooting for the moose.Furthermore, before you even start, don't even try to say I'm just some kid that hates to read because I assure you it's not reading I have problems with (having a genuine love of reading and almost all the book in the local library under my belt) it's this book. To make someone who enjoys reading suffer through this is the worst kind of torture in a civil society I can possibly think of! And I can't image it being any better for someone who can't read well or hates to do so, it could more than likely turn them off reading for life!In conclusion the book got one star because Amazon doesn't have a lower rating."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I started reading this when, with no uncertainty, my son, age 9 years, told me, he \\"Hated!!!\\" the book. I was shocked to learn this \\"Newbury Honor\\" book has a sub-plot of Brian's struggling with his parent's recent divorce!While it is an adventure, intelligent readers will understand the main character is victim of his mother's behavior and initiation divorce. Throughout the book, Brian struggles with the hurt from his parents' separation. It is the reason why he is on the bush plane. He is being ping-ponged to his father for the summer. After he helplessly witnesses the massive heart attack of the pilot at 7,000 feet and knows he's going to die time after time, he continues to get flashbacks of his parents.Our family has been going through a series of complicated marital troubles this year, but we are desperately trying to do everything we can to make things better for the sake of our family and our children and to communicate opening with our children how much we love them and are trying to hold things together. Tragically, this is not the message the author communicates to readers.Families who have been through or approached these painful issues can imagine what having to explain how \\"separating things\\" felt to me and my son. Brian hates judges, who \\"only separate things\\". These issues are painful and are definitely too mature for elementary school readers.While I pity the author, who had an alcoholic parent and ran away from home at an early age, I don't take any pleasure in him trying to identify with my young son who is going through a complicated, confusing time. I certainly don't want the clumsy handling of the subject to make things worse for my son. I'm deeply concerned that Mr. Paulsen does not provide any comfort or recommendations on how to communicate his hurt, confusion and anger to adults in their lives. In fact, Brain keeps his mother's secret long into the author's other subsequent books.While this might be a fine adventure for certain mature middle school and high school aged students, it is definitely inappropriate for the elementary age level. From what I have seen of this book and Dog Song, Paulsen likes to include death scenes in his books. I simply recommend caution to parents, teachers, librarians, and administrators.Mother, Massachusetts"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I was forced to read this book a few years ago in school.

There is a very slim chance that the pilot would have a heart attack on a plane, and then Brian Robeson, the main character, would actually be able to fly the plane at all. Then there would be an even slimmer chance that anyone would survive a crash of such greatness where a wing broke off and the plane crashing into the lake, and then swimming out.

I've changed my mind about it being appropriate to give to my nephew, I'll save it for my son and when he's old enough I'll read it with him. I did enjoy the book, and believe that it would be a good read for a young teen with discussion of the quotes below. I'll write the page numbers that are in my copy, your copy may be different. Here are the quotes, so that you can do your own research without reading the entire book:Death of pilot, p 10, 11 Chap 1: \\"The pilot was having a heart attack...Spit came from the corners of his mouth and his legs contracted up, up into the seat, and his eyes rolled back in his head until there was only white.\\"Finding dead pilot in plane when he goes back for survival bag, pg 180, Chap 18: \\"...he saw the pilot's head only it wasn't the pilot's head any longer...all that remained was the not quite cleaned skull and when he looked up it wobbled loosely.\\"Twice the boy, Brian, starts a sentence with \\"God\\": Pg 2, Chap 1: \\"A tearing, ugly word that meant fights and yelling, lawyers-God, he thought, how he hated lawyers...\\"; p 155, Chap 16 (during the tornado): \\"God, he thought, on top of the moose not this - not this.\\"The only instance of prayer mentioned in the book was during the tornado: p 156, Chap 16, \\"He couldn't think, just held and knew that he was praying but didn't know what the prayer was-knew that he wanted to be, stay and be, and then the wind moved to the lake.\\"After the tornado, Brian thinks to himself: p 157, Chap 16, \\"...had lost everything and was back to square one. Just like that. A flip of some giant coin and he was the loser...Is that the best you can do? Is that all you can hit me with-a moose and a tornado.\\"Brian's memory of seeing his mom with another man before his parent's divorce, a secret he kept from his father, p 68, Chap 7: \\"His mother sitting in the station wagon with the man. And she had leaned across and kissed him, kissed the man with the short blond hair, and it was not a friendly peck, but a kiss...\\" Last sentence of book: \\"Brian tried several times to tell his father, came really close once to doing it, but in the end never said a word about the man or what he knew, the Secret.\\"Evolutionary view: p 88, Chap 9: \\"There had been fire for thousands, millions of years.\\" p 90, Chap 9: \\"...a Cro-Magnon man would have a fire by now...\\"In the book, Brian has something revealed to him in a dream, then twice he knows there is danger without knowing how.

It is based on a real character and is intended for boys, ages 10 and up. It was a cool book for me because I hunt and camp in the wilderness a lot and it made me think of what it would be like to be stranded. So I easily related to this character. The author did a good job of drawing me into the story such that I felt like I was in the Alaskan wilderness myself! When he was lost, Brian, the main character, learns a lot of stuff about life, himself, and how to survive in the wilderness. Unfortunately, it was all learned the hard way. This book is written in narration, like a stranger watching from afar, but who can see Brian's thoughts. The story also appealed to my senses, for example, \\"his leg was instantly torn with pain, as if a hundred needles were driven into it,\\" allowed me to get a real sense of his pain! This vivid writing combines to make an interesting, spell binding, enriching book, clearly written by one who knows about the wild. Gary Paulsen has run 2 Iditarod's, which are long races across Alaska by dog sled. He also is experienced in trapping and hunting, which he has been doing since a young boy. This is truly one of my favorite books and I would recommend it to anyone who likes adventures or just good books. You might also consider reading Brian's Winter, the sequel to Hatchet, that describes what he would have had to endure in the winter, if he had not been rescued. Paulsen wrote many other adventure books, but these are two are my favorites!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"After 20 years, the paperback version of Gary Paulsen's classic tale of a boy surviving in the wilderness alone is still in Amazon's Top 3000 in Sales. (#2063 as I write this.) And it's because of this kid-tested longevity that I'm going to suggest you buy \\"Hatchet\\" for the home shelves. (Personally I love the illustrated hardback. I think the drawings by Drew Willis and Gary's own author notes, make that version of the book worth a the extra cash.)As for the story, it's about a teen boy, Brian, who suddenly finds himself stranded after the Cessna he was in crashes in a lake-- the pilot dying beforehand of cardiac arrest. It becomes a coming of age story not only because Brian has to overcome his own weakness, but because he also has to come to grips with his parents recent divorce and his mother's infidelity.This is a wonderful book that draws most kids into reading the entire series.

I can only give it my endorsement (for what ever that is worth) and make a few observations from a personal point of view.I must say that this is a first rate survival story, i.e. man (or in this case boy) against the wilderness. Briefly, a young lad, Brian, is traveling to the far North Land to join his father for the summer shortly after his parents have divorced. The pilot of the small aircraft suffers a fatal heart attack and the plane crashes in a lake in the remote wilderness of Canada. The boy, Brian is completely alone and all that he is left with are the clothes on his back and a small hatchet which was on his belt when the plane went down. This is his story; how he survived for an extended period of time in quite a hostile environment.The story is quite well written and is quite realistic in just about every aspect of the setting and circumstances. Anyone who has spent even a brief time in a wild area will appreciate the author's meticulous research on the subject. The author has also been able to nail perfectly the young man's reactions, not only to the situation at had, but his thoughts and emotional turmoil over his parent's recent parting of the ways.There are a couple of points which need to be considered when choosing this work, either to read, or to assigned it as a class read. First, if you examine the text closely you will find that the author has repeatedly reinforced the fact that one of the reasons the boy is able to survive is through knowledge he has consciously or subconsciously received via school, T.V. and reading. This is important; the boy, a city boy, is not completely clueless.Secondly we have the author's ability to stress the fact that a cool head and the use of a bit of logic, after thinking things out, pays off in big dividends.It should also be noted and stressed that this is simply a well written book, good story and well constructed on all levels.Now I note that overwhelmingly this book has received approval from its readers. I do not that there are a number of less than flattering reviews. If you read these not so good reviews you will find that the vast majority are written by the younger set that have been \\"forced\\" to read them in literature or English class. This of course is quite natural. I would suggest that these folks that found the book \\"boring, repetitive, poorly written, etc. read the book again in a few years, on your own time, under your own steam, and see if your take is the same. I know that many of the works that I was forced to read in school, which I hated at the time, became some of my favorite reads as grew older. Your views, taste and general knowledge changes over time and what you are put off by when you are quite young, you will look at with completely different eyes as you grow older.This read is perfect for the middle school group, sat from 10 to 14 years old. It is though a good read for any age. Hey, it takes a couple of hours to read, is truly a page turner, and a well done piece of literature by most standards. A careful reading of this work will teach many good lessons that can be applied to most aspects of life...you just have to leave your mind open for them and if you are \\"made to read it\\" by your clueless English Teacher...don't fight it. Chances are you will thank them in later years.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book was an unpredictable, adventure of a young boy. It made me feel like something freaky was going to happen, cause a tornado happens in this book, how exciting. I was totally captivated-stoked at every turn."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"HATCHET by: Gary PualsenDo you like to read? If you do you need to check out Hatchet! This story is about a boy who got dropped off by his mom at the air port to see his father while flying the pilot has a massive heart attack and dies. Brian has to fly the plane and crash land. You will feel like you are lost in the Canadian Wilderness. I think anyone who likes to read will love to read Hatchet. You will learn how to survive alone in the wilderness with only a hatchetThis story is about survival. A named Brian gets trapped in the middle of the Canadian Wilderness. The only thing he has to defend himself is a hatchet that his mother gave him before he went to see his father. He will learn to use the surrounding materials to live and survive.The main character Brian is very easy tom relate to. Like many kids his parents are divorced. He loves to be outside, hunt and fish. But the last thing he wants is to try to survive for 42 day in the middle of nowhere.The setting of the book is in the Canadian wilderness. He builds a shelter by a small lake with many small fishing it. The area is teaming with grouse, moose and many other wild animals. During the day it is comfortable but during the night it is frigidly cold.Overall my book is very exciting. You never know what will happen next. I hope you check out hatchet and enjoy it as much as I did. If you do you will learn a lot about how to survive with nothing but a hatchet."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"It was a normal summer day when Brian Robeson was flying to Canada to visit his dad due to his parents divorce. The flight was going great until the pilot started to feel bad, worse, and finally he had a heart attack. That is when things started going down hill.Brian encounters many challenging obstacles such as making his own shelter, catching his own food with his own tools, and being attacked by wild animals like skunks, bears, a timber wolf, and a moose. In order to survive, Brian must work past these obstacles.Overall, I think this is an incredibly great action book that is very detailed. I recommend this book to anyone who loves adventure and this book is for both boys and girls."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I had to read this book for a novel study. I loved SSSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOOOOOO so so so so so so so much."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"HatchetThe pilot had a heart attack and 13year-old Brian Robeson is the only one on the plane! Crashing into a forest, Brian struggles to survive with little food and a hatchet his mom gave him as a going away present. Able to fight through the hardships of the forests, Brian Robeson also has to put up with Brians parents and their divorce. If there is anyone that only likes action, I wouldn't read this, but other than that, anyone who likes anything (other than romance too).This book has a good theme. Brian has positive thinking throughout the whole book and it helps him. Thinking of committing suicide, Brian is able to over come that by thinking positively. Like said before, throughout the whole book, Brian is able to overcome every obstacle he faces with thinking positive and using his brain.The book also has good fore shadowing. Such as his mother giving him the hatchet. Having the hatchet gave Brian protection, fire, and food. Also having it, it helped him get the survival pack inside.\\"Hatchet\\" is very suspenseful. When a porcupine had attacked Brian, he had been hurt realty bad. Every little prick he had to take out hurt. He took them out one after the other. Tending to the pain, he attempted suicide thinking he would never get to civilization.From skunks to tornadoes, Brian was able to get through all hardships. Having done that, he is brave and cunning. This book is a good book not great.J.

As soon as he saw a lake that was big enough to fly the plane into he crashed into the water. So the next coupple of months he had to live in the woods. He had to remember how to stay alive. He knew he had to get some food and water so he drank some water and piked some charries. And later on in the book he makes a fish pond to keep the fish alive while he is not going to eat them. He also made a place to store is other food like barries, he put them up int a tree.And all the time he was out there one plane flew by to see if they could but they coulden't find him because the plane was under water, so he tried to make a big fire so sombody would see him. And too make that big bonfire he used his hatchet that his mother gave him to help his father over the summer.Where he put up camp looked like a big cliff or ridge in the background, while he was sitting right next to the water. And if he walked about onehundred yards thats were he got the charries and barrires there.I would recomend this book to anyone that likes adventure books. It starts out kind of slow but give it a chance and don't quite reading it. I also recomend this book because it will help you in case you ever have to stay some where in the woods that you never have stayed in before.I would rate this book a eight because I liked how he remembered and knew everything to stay alive."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is an okay book. I read it because everyone said how good it was. It was interesting, but got pretty boring in parts. I almost fell asleep reading it, and I don't like the way it was written. Here is an example of how Paulsen wrote it:This book is boring.Boring.It would say something, then state it again using one word on the next line.

Sure, this book has some boring parts, but after you get into it, you'll really like it. I reccomend this book to people. Here's a short summary of it:Brian Robeson is a boy who has parents in a divorce. He is going to see his father on a small plane with a pilot over the wilderness. But, when the pilot has a heart attack in the middle of the plane ride, Brian is shocked. He has no clue how to fly the plane, but tries his best. After a Brian is bruised up and very tired. So, he makes a small shelter. Then a bear attacks him one of the nights and tears down his shelter. Brian has to make a new on. The story goes on like this, like when a small tornado tears down his sturdy fort. He survives by eating fish and \\"Fool\\" birds. Finally, after he thinks no one is coming, he remembers that there's a survival packet in the plane somewhere. So, he makes a raft and floats out on the lake a cuts a small hole in the tail of the plain. He accidentily drops his hatchet in the tail and into the water. Then, he dives down to grab it, and sees the rotten face of the dead pilot. He gags and swims back up. So, he tries it again, and this time getting the hatchet without looking at the pilot's bloated face. He also gets the survival packet and presses a button on the transmitter and nothing happens. Brian thinks it's broken, so he leaves it alone. The next day, Brian is eating his food and a plane lands by his camp. Brian is shocked. The pilot takes Brian into the plane and leaves.I reccomend this book to anyone of all ages(Accept for people 7 and under. There was a few bad words)."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I screen each book I buy for my son's reading. Got started on this one one day while waiting for the phone man. Couldn't put it down! I love outdoor things, and I loved the way this book was written and presented. I thoroughly enjoyed how the main character was made to seem so real when he'd break down for a bit and feel as if he couldn't make it. But the human spirit is strong, and he would rally again and realize he had no choice but to make it. I found that to be inspirational to me for the problems I deal with in life. Lots of interesting scenarios, never a dull moment. My son will love it when he gets to this one. Very good read for boys, as well as girls who are interested in outdoor skills.

The plot is one that no one would think of. Who would make a book about a thirteen year old boy that is in a plane crash and is stranded out in the Canadian wilderness? Now he must survive with just a hatchet. I find this book so fascinating because Gary Paulsen wrote this book about past experiences. He actually did some of the survival skills in this book in real life!The other reason I love this book is because of the details Gary Paulsen uses. When Gary Paulsen writes about mosquitoes biting the main character, it is so descriptive I actually start to itch! This is what makes Hatchet such a fantastic book.Other titles I would recommend are Brian's Winter, Woodsong, and Brian's Return. I am an eighth grader at Harris Road Middle School."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Somebody help me! Hatchet is another great and amazing title for this book.

On his way up the plane's pilot has a sudden heart attack and the plane crashes into a lake. Brian has to learn how to survive. Brian faces many challenges like finding food, water, and shelter. Many different animals attack Brian. Brian, my favorite character, is depressed because of his parents being divorced. Brian is my favorite character because he is basically the only character and he has great survival ideas. This passage shows Brian's survival ideas. \\"Storing live fish to eat later was a major breakthrough, he thought.\\" There are other books in this series such as Brian's Winter, and Brian's Hunt.

Basically, Brian, whose parents have just recently divorced, is going to spend his summers with his dad when the single-engine plane he is in, crashes in the Canadian woods. Armed with only a hatchet and his wits, Brian learns to survive. Like any child in his situation, Brian is very upset about the break-up of his family unit. The story is really one about survival so why bring up the divorce? My feeling is that it shows that you can have two types of problems -- those that you can control/fix like the survival issue, and those that you can do nothing about like the divorce. So, why did I give it a two-star? Well, this is a children's book so I saw no reason for a detailed description of a kissing scene in the mother's extramarital affair. Even the affair was irrelevant. In fact, it is not that Brian really deals with either The SECRET or the affair by the end of the book. If Paulsen's intention with the divorce was to just show kids that you cannot always do some thing about all the bad things that happen to you but that should not mean you should drown in self-pity, then including the divorce was okay. However, he should just have left it at that and would probably have received four stars from me."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This exciting book is about a boy named Brian and his journey to be alive.

Hatchet has a Newbery Honors award for Gary Paulsen's great work and also Gary Paulsen has three other books that go along with Hatchet like Brian's Winter, Brian's Hunt and The River which Gary Paulsen wrote too.

He somehow got out of the plane and swam to shore on an island. The island was heavily forested and had plenty of wildlife. It was autumn at the time but winter was coming soon. I really enjoyed the way Gary Paulson, the author, described the island. he used many adjectives and made it sound beautiful.The main character, Brian, was a shy, fourteen year old boy. He had black hair and was about 5'8\\". During the story he was stressed and a little bit depressed because of his parents recent divorce. But during the whole book he was determined to get off the island, yet at some points he really wanted to give up and just die. Actually at one point he tried to kill himself by slitting his wrist. I still admired how he handled the problem and obstacles that came to him.The conflict of this book was that Brian was stuck on the island with the cold, harsh, Canadian winter approaching. At one point in the book he screamed out in agony, \\"I'm hungry! I'm hungry! I'm hungry!\\" As he is being tortured with no food, shelter, communication, nor protection. He was in a very scary situation and when you read the book to the end you will be surprised at what happens.The book Hatchet is one of the best books I have ever read. It has suspense, a lot of action, and also good lessons to be learned."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"A must read for the adventure seeker and wilderness lover!Brian Robeson, thirteen, boards a small bush plane along with thepilot. He is going to visit his father in Canada, after his parent's separation, knowing the secret, the reason for their divorce. Brian leaves New York with a hatchet, a parting gift from his mother. Most of the book is about Brian's experiences on his own, learning to take from nature to find food and shelter, learning to hunt and fish and protect himself. Does he live? Is he saved? These questions keep the reader intrigued for all 195 pages of the text. Brian is a strong, well developed character. He evolves, learns and matures from his experience. His story is one of bravery, determination, and the power of positive thinking. Gary Paulsen's writing style is naturally flowing, highly descriptive, and easy to read. The book is a fast read, but is easy to set down and pick up again without losing one's place in the story. A Newbery Honor Book that deserves to be read!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Fabulous story. I have a 13 year old who is a reluctant reader. He was diagnosed with reading problems years ago, but he is enjoying this book. The story line offers up lots of suspense and sitting on the edge of your seat. Is perfect for middle schoolders. I liked it too and I'm a mom who left school many, many years ago. I could not put it down. My son is less bored with this book than he has been with many books he's had to read in the past. This is a school project and I think we will be getting the follow up book to this one, Brian's Winter, when finished with Hatchet. Highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"When I first read this book with my Freshman English class, I thought it was a bit simplistic. Funny thing, though: the class really liked it. Over the years (I've been teaching 13 years now), it remains a hit with my students. For many of them, it is the first book they have finished from cover to cover.The novel is basically a survival story. Thirteen-year-old Brian Robeson's plane crash lands in the middle of the Canadian wilderness, and much of the plot revolves around his attempts to keep alive until he can be rescued. Other reviewers have mentioned some themes (suicide, marital infidelity) that might trouble younger readers, but no students as of yet have ever voiced any discomfort with reading about these topics. (The sad fact is that many are already too familiar with these in their own lives.)Great literature it is not, but the kids really enjoyed it. Over time, the novel has grown on me because of the kids' reaction. If some students really enjoyed this first installment, Paulsen has a series of books centering around Brian. The sequel, \\"The River\\", is more action and less character driven than \\"Hatchet\\". I haven't read \\"Brian's Return\\" or \\"Brian's Winter\\" (which is an alternate ending to \\"Hatchet\\"), but again, kids might like them."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"STORY BRIEF:Thirteen year old Brian is the only survivor when a small plane crashes in the Canadian wilderness. He has no supplies other than a hatchet which was on his belt - a gift from his mother just before he boarded the plane. It's a story of survival. He needs shelter, warmth, and food. He suffers from insects, other creatures, and the environment.REVIEWER'S OPINION:Parents wanting to encourage your middle school and teenage boys to read - give them this. It's also wonderful for girls and adults. Jacqueline a Goodreads reviewer said that parts frightened her 8 year old, so keep that in mind.At times I was wincing in pain for Brian. Other times I was joyful, relieved, and hopeful for him. I was smiling a lot during the last 15 minutes. There are occasional sprinkles of interesting thoughts on life and what's important. A fun scene was when Brian found something normal to someone in a normal life, but his reaction was \\"I'm rich!\\" Something I liked a lot was seeing how Brian changed his way of seeing and thinking. I like seeing characters grow, learn, or change in a book - which this does well.This was the author's first book. It was so popular that he wrote four sequels and other books. The narrator did a fine job.OTHER BOOKS:The author wrote many books, but the Hatchet series consists of:5 stars. Hatchet (read first)5 stars. Brian's Winter (read second or third but I prefer second)3 stars. The River (read second or third)4 stars. Brian's Return3 stars. Brian's HuntDATA:Unabridged audiobook length: 3 hours 37 minutes.

The answer is probably nothing with the point being that Amazon allows each of its customers an individual voice, despite how many there might be.As a children's librarian (including those middle school children), I know that \\"Hatchet\\" is a great recommended read for reluctant readers for whatever reasons. Why haven't I read this book, I continued to ask myself. So--this summer I asked my great-niece and -nephew, 12 and 10, if we could all read and discuss this book? All agreed, no one finished. Here's how the first couple of chapters go: Brian, aged 13, is flying to a remote area in Northern Canada to stay with his dad. Because the area is so remote, a private plane must be hired. That means one pilot, one passenger in a tiny two-seater. Then, as it so happens from time to time in the real world--out of nowhere, the pilot has a heart attack and dies. In a rush of panic, Brian takes over and flies the plane until fuel runs out. Then he must land. Therein lies the difficulty. With so many lakes and rivers in the Canadian wilderness, where he is, at that point and moment in space and time, reveals an unsatisfactory water bed, but he must land anyway. Water is like concrete to a flying object on impact. Brian hits his head and wrenches his whole body in the crash, but he makes it out and swims to shore in icy water.Now that's an exciting beginning. Who wouldn't want to read further, but I didn't. Finally, when I discovered that none of us had finished the book, I picked it up again and continued reading. At exactly that point begins one incredible episode after the other in Brian's personal and up close experience with a life threatening adventure. A city boy, Brian knows nothing about survival skills or even simple camping. What resources he calls on are two: television programs and a teacher's mantra that each of us is the person to most rely on.As an aside, Paulsen spent a few nights camping in his backyard, using stones and sticks to start a fire. Finally, his wife asked what in the world was he doing? (I think this is just a neat story to relate about the background for his book and not really true.) He replied, \\"Trying to start a fire.\\" \\"Well, why don't you just use matches?\\" she asked. \\"I don't have any,\\" he responded.And neither did Brian, so the description of his efforts to start a fire ring true--because they are. In his two month sojourn (not intentional, mind you), Brian meets a bear, fool birds, chokeberries, a crazed elk, rabbits, a tornado, and a continuing incredible (but believable) array of obstacles and milestones and little victories.Brian fully expected to be rescued within 24 hours until he remembered how off-course he probably flew the plane himself. Hours turned into days, days into weeks, and .... I wish I could comment on the ending because I have some things to say, but in whatever subtle way I said it, I would reveal spoilers. Allow me this: I had been right there with Brian the whole way. The ending stunned me. I mean it--I was stunned!Because of the ending I began researching what else Paulsen had written, and discovered more Brian books. I cannot say anything about them either, but I've ordered them for my school library.Now I know why I can recommend this book to reluctant readers--and of course, anyone who loves a good story!! Hatchet? Didn't I mention it? It's really not the hatchet that saves Brian for so long--it is Brian himself wielding the hatchet. This book is definitely a great read!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet Aladdin Paperbacks, 1987, 189 pagesGary Paulsen ISBN# 0-02-770130-1Have you ever been lost in the Canadian wilderness with only a hatchet?

That's how Perpich had put it -- stay positive and stay on top of things. Brian thought of him now -- wondered how to stay positive and stay on top of this. All Perpich would say is that I have to get motivated. He was always telling kids to get motivated.\\" This thought that entered Brian's mind helped him survive his ordeal.This book is a very culminating adventure book.

Minutes later he fades away and it's up to you to fly. A lot of stress huh? Well that was only the beginning of this wonderful adventure. Brian Robeson is left with nothing but a hatchet and the clothes on his back.The story is set in present day and is a man VS nature book. Brain has to learn to survive in the harsh environment of the Canadian wilderness. Brian went to see his dad but is now stuck, alone in the woods.This is definitely one of Paulsen's better pieces, but it doesn't hold a candle to The Transall Saga. This book is written in good ole' American style. This book is exciting but doesn't have to many details like the European style. Hatchet is a good book though it lacks in detail in some places. When Brian is hunting it shows very little detail however makes up for this flaw in the action of these parts.Brian is utterly calm in some situations. Have you ever met someone like this? This kind of person is usually calm and collected in any situation, no matter how bad.I recommend this book to anyone who likes The Transall Saga. If you do not like the outdoors do not even pick this book up. This book is more for guys, because there is only one very minor female character. I suggest that anyone read this book because it is one of Paulsen's best.Just remember that little boy in the co-pilots seat could be you..."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Gary paulson has delivered a great book to start a great series.The books about a boy named brian who's parents are divorsed and is going to see his father up in northern Canada where he works at a oil feild.

When he first stayed out in the wilderness, it was hard for Brian to survive, but after a few weeks and months, he started to understand things out there. Like how to survive, how to get food, shelter, and understand animals.My favorite part of the story was that when Brian was going to get some berries he found near by a tree, a wolf saw him and attacked. The next day Brian was all wounded. But when he saw the wolf again, the wolf and Brian understood each other by looking staight in the eye of the both of them, and the wolf didn't do anything to Brian this time.

In fact, it was the book that caused me to be a Paulsen fan, if you read any more of my reviews. But after reading more books along with Hatchet, a second time, it just doesn't appeal to me any more. Sure, I like survival stories, and own(or owned, I'm not sure) two copies of this book. Nevertheless, I think he's written better. This novel depicts a young man, or just becoming one, crashing in a private airplane due to its pilot's heart attack. Surviving with only a hatchet for a number of days, (I think more than a month) it's not hard to see the end coming. I know I sound like the CRANKY CRITIC but I really did like this book. It was a hard story to put down and, if I recall, I finished it in one day, so it's not that hard of a read. Still, I think he would have done better by combining all four of the Brian series(Hatchet, The River, Brian's Winter, and Brian's Return) into one long novel, even though most of the thoughts that prompted Paulsen to write these recent additions to the series probably didn't occur to him until after Hatchet was published. Still, don't take me wrong.

The symbolism all boiled down to the same thing. The story didn't move. There wasn't any main theme that made the plot more bearable. This is one of the only books I ever put down and never picked up again to finish."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is just about the worst book I hve ever read in my life. The sequence of events is dull and extremly predictable. Don't read this book if you have a choice."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I just read this book that my 9-year-old read in public school. I cannot believe this book is a Newbery Honor book. I cannot believe this book is actually encouraged to be read. (My son said the teacher played an audio introduction to the book, and if they wanted to continue reading it on their own they could.) Not even halfway through the book, the boy named Brian has vomited three times and almost a fourth (is this really necessary?). Also, about halfway through, 13-year-old Brian begins to despair that he will ever be saved so he takes his hatchet and begins cutting his arm to try and end it all. Nothing like teaching our children how to despair and attempt suicide! This book is in no way a positive moral example of great literature. If you would like to read something that is, I highly suggest \\"Island of the Blue Dolphins\\" by Scott O'Dell rather than this trash. Beautifully written and much more worth your time."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hi everybody!We (Marissa and Emma, both 14 y/o) read that book in school but the German version. We had to read it! We don't like it very much we both think that the book is boring. Because you can't write too much about \\"Being alone in a space without anyone\\". The topic is kind of interesting, but the author took the story too long. He always writes \\"I am Brian, I am 13, I rescued a plane crash\\" and so on.We wouldn't say that book is exciting.Marissa R. and Emma D."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian's story of survival seemed interesting...at first. The story dragged out at an indescribably slow pace and was rather like reading a telephone book, or dictionary. The author repeated words to give them more meaning, and to help you feel Brians pain and yearning for his old life, which was nice, the first few times. It became extremely repetitive and made the reading unenjoyable. I would certainly not recommend this read to anyone at all."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"In English class earlier this semester, the book the Hatchet was the topic of all of our novel studies, and english discussions! We were told to read the book in two weeks and prepare a good solid essay on our points of view! This book was soo boring. I actually found myself skipping chapters just so that I could get through the book faster! It is soo dumb how all of a sudden he is in the middle of a tornado and how a moose is running him over?!? Soo many times in my essay I found myself using the words boring and lame. This book is annoyingly dumb and I can't understand how any one person can enjoy such a lame book!

It reads as if it were dashed off during the commercials in an afternoon of TV watching."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This realistic fiction was an adventurous and suspenseful book. Brian was furious, because Mr. and Mrs. Robeson, his parents, had gotten a divorce. He was in a two person plane going to see his dad. Then all of a sudden, the pilot had a heart attack and croaked. Brian decided to try and land the plane in a lake. When the plane finally went down, he tore free and swam to shore. There he gathered and ate berries. He found a hollowed out place in some lime stone to make some sort of shelter. He wove willow together to form a wall and left an opening for a door. He finally figured out how to make a fire. He made a fish spear but never caught any fish. Then one morning he remembered that water bends light, so the image would actually be a little below where it appeared to be. After a few tries, Brian caught his first fish! It tasted so delicious! Soon he would be able to kill what he called a fool bird. He lived like this for a while. Then he remembered the survival pack in the back of the plane. He finally got the survival pack. Will he be able to live through the winter with the survival pack and his new knowledge, or will someone rescue him? I recommend this book to anyone who likes realistic and suspenseful fiction."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is a marvelous book by: Gary Paulsen.In this book you go on a adventure. First you start with a happy family, then the divorce, but why the divorce. Its because the secret. The secret is why Brain has to go to Canada.Also why he is in thw wilderness and why he got in a plane crash on his way there. Hw will brian get out or will he get out this is all a secret but is it the big secret? what will happen? Will he get out? What will he use to survive????? Read this awesome book by Gary Paulsen to find out!!! This review is made By: Carissa"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"It was slightly better than I expected, though still pretty uninteresting with large gaps filled with nothing but boredom. (Comparable to Deathly Hallow's camping scenes) However, I did like Gary Paulson's narration style quite a bit, it came off as very natural and conversational. The one thing that bothered me about the narration was the repetition. There were lots of ideas that were repeated for no apparent reason (\\"He would have to find something to eat. Before he did anything else, he would have to have something to eat.\\" (57)) This is neither realistic nor simplistic, and just ends up annoying the reader tremendously. I also thought that Brian was not a very consistent character, sometimes showing traits of a boy well beyond his age, and sometimes acting like a five year old would. Brian's repetitive TV/movie related realizations were really getting irksome as well. I suppose it's just hard to relate to this book and some of the things Brian had to do to survive simply due to the fact that I've never been placed in such a situation, so it's very hard to relate. I did not like the convenience of the emergency kit at the end, and the fact that there was no resolution about The Secret was probably the most irritating part of all--why mention it in the first place if you won't solve it?"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Although I have enjoyed Peter Coyote's voiceover on many documentaries, I found this work to be on the boring side. The book has many exciting segments, begging for an excited narration. I was a bit disappointed in his oft monotone, soft voice. When used chapter by chapter in the English Language Arts classroom, this rendition suffices. I will use it again as a teaching companion to reading the novel."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian, a small town boy is on his way to his dad's house and he is traveling by airplane. The pilot of the plane has a massive heart attack that kills him. Brian is scared because he has to land the plane by his self but he does not know how to land a plane at all.Brian thinks he will be dead for sure until he finds the safety kit in side the wrecked plane. It contained a .22 survival rifle, fishing pole and freeze-dried food. Did he die of starvation or did he eat the nasty freeze-dried food. A pilot stopped on the island and saw Brian and did not know who he was, but when he found out that it was Brian, he was highly shocked because he was missing for 7 months. Read the book and you will find out if he is dead or alive when the pilot finds himThis book teaches you to respect and to not take your family for granted while your parents are still together. The reason it teaches you to do that is because his parents had a divorce and while he was gone they missed him dearly because they didn't know if he was dead or alive.The book was good because it was adventurous and showed Brian's hardships in word form. The book also shows how happy he was when he killed his first fish and ate it. However he wasn't so happy when he found out that the fish was eating on the corpse of the dead pilot.I would recommend this book to people that are an adventurous person or if you like adventurous books. The age group would be ages 12 and up. The reason I picked that age group is because younger children may not understand the book.This is a good book in my opinion you might like it to if you read it. If not, you can read more of Gary Paulson's award winning books.By josh"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"i am a 6th grader.

The plane was running out of fuel so Brian had to let it come down. The plane landed in a lake and Brian got out and had to survive in the wilderness until he found out how to get out. He was a city boy so he has no clue about how to survive, like what berries to eat or how to catch a fish, simple things he didn't know how to do.This book was a good book, I enjoyed it except some parts I couldn't understand what the author was trying to describe what he was going through at some parts.

The pilot has a a heart attack and Brian has to fly the plane. But he crashs into a lake and is in the wilderness till someone finds him. The one thing he has is a HATCHET."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"HatchetDate:9-20-02The book I read was Hatchet by Gary Paulson. This book is about a boy named Brian who is on a plane from Hampton, New York. He is on his way to see his dad that lives in the north woods of Canada. On the way the pilot of Brian's plane has a heart attack. When Brian lands in the middle of a lake he is not sure if he is going to make it to the shore. As he keeps on swimming he is determined that he is not going to survive. Brian knows that he has to make a shelter and find food to survive in the woods alone. Brian also has to be aware of the animals like bears foxes and raccoons. As he walks through the trees looking for a shelter, he holds his hatchet by his side. The reason Gary Paulson wrote this book was to show people how hard it is to be stranded in the woods in Canada. This book also has many survival tips too. For example, you should know how to get a fire started without using matches. All of these would help you if you were stranded in the north woods of Canada for 54 days like Brian was.There were many important events in this book. One event that I thought was difficult was trying to find food. This was difficult for Brain because there is not that much food in the woods. At first all he was eating were bright red berries. Later one night while Brian was sleeping, snapping turtle had laid eggs. Since there was hardly anything else to eat he decided to eat those. While he was doing this he thought of his Uncle Carter because every morning he ate raw eggs. He also ate fish (caught from lake) and \\"foolbirds\\" (birds slightly smaller that chickens). It was important that Brian was able to find food for him to be able to survive.I would recommend this book to people who like adventure books. This is an adventure book because after the plane crashes, Brian has to find a way to survive without food or shelter. For many days all Brian ate were bright red berries. He ate them because he knew that without food he would not have survived. While he is in the woods he has many animals come and visit him. There were many bears and mosquitoes. This book was a great book and I didn't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is really good. I would read it again. In the book the main character \\"Brian\\", is in a plane crash and survives. this story is written by Gary Paulsen, and he does a great job writing this book. In this book, Brian also has to live in the wilderness with his hachet. Brian is all by himself too, because the pilot died in the crash.

Brian is in the copilot's seat. When the pilot embarks to have shoulder pains, Brian is pondering about his parent's divorce. Brian never told anyone that he knew about the divorce. The pilot teaches Brian how to steer. Then the pilot has a heart a tack. Brian will now have to steer. He makes a plan. His plan is when he finds a lake he will land in knee deep water. Brian spots a lake; he hits trees then goes out in the lake. He swims a-shore and lays down and sleeps. Brian is very swollen on his forehead. He has to find some food. Brian saw two birds that flew to some berries. He figures that if the birds can eat them he can, too. Brian thought that he was going to get rescued in a few days. A month goes by; he stills does not get rescued. One day Brian was getting fish out of the lake when a moose came and threw him into the lake. Then that night a real strong wind like a tornado came and took everything Brian had. The dead pilot is still in the head of the plane. The end of the plane stuck out of the water that had the survival pack. Brian has to get that pack. He makes a raft. Then the next morning he sets out first thing to get that pack. He starts to pound on the plane with the hatchet his mother gave him before he gets on the plane. Pretty soon he has a hole that is as big as him. He gets in there and gets the survival pack. Brian gets it back to shore late that night. He unpacks all the belongings after a long nights rest.

After he had gut cherries, he found a patch of raspberries where a bear was, but it didn't harm him. Brian learned that feeling sorry for himself didn't get him anywhere. He was trying to make flame, but he didn't have oxygen and finally made fire. When Brian was thinking that he didn't want the fire out, he heard something and found turtle eggs. As his bow was getting finished, he heard a plane and started a bonfire but the plane turned back. After Brian made a spear, he finally learned to catch fish. When he finished his new shelter, he made a pen to catch fresh fish. He was trying to get a fool hen, but he scared them and finally got one.

Brian found gut cherries, and it was getting dark. He thought to get back to the refuge, so that night he threw up because of the gut cherries. In the morning, he meat a cordial bear when he was picking berries. Then one day he got pummeled by a moose. Then one day he found a secret to seizing fool birds. Then one day he built a raft to get over to the plane to get the survival pack. Then he dropped his hatchet. You should read this book if you are10+. Read this great book and don't put it off. I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"HatchetDo you really think you know yourself? Are you sure? Well you might think that over after you read Hatchet, Brian Robeson had to. When his relaxing plane ride went horribly wrong, he found himself stuck in the Canadian wilderness with just the hatchet his mom had given him as a gift. That was the beginning of an epic adventure of life and death, kill or be killed. It was really a struggle for him to survive, as nature threw at him the toughest obstacles he had ever encountered.Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen is a realistic fiction for kids of all reading abilities. If you are a fan of action, survival, and exceptionally vivid details that make you feel like you are in the story, then this book is for you. It is peppered with excitement and drama that will leave you on the edge of your seat.Watch as nature put Brian through a training camp to teach him all about life, as he gradually changed throughout the book. He was not a city-boy anymore, but a patient observant young man. A man that had acquired all the skills it took to survive the wilderness; he was a quick, quiet, and observant hunter. In addition, he learned to look at problems as a whole, while he was carefully assessing the right thing to do. I think he learned a valuable lesson in this book. Even though nature can be rough, it is a beautiful place with luscious natural habitats, unlike the city.Brian matured in many ways. For example, when he first crashed in the wilderness, he could not get anything right. However, as he grew stronger, both physically and mentally, he found better ways of doing things by thinking back to the things he learned in the past and experimenting with new and different ideas. It took several tries to make his first fire. He also was able to fix his raft with just a few minor modifications, and learned how to shoot the \`fool birds' with his bow and arrow. The first time he saw a bear he ran away. Later on, he encountered a few wolves, but simply nodded to each one, accepting that it was their land, and their area, not his.I found Hatchet inspirational. Brian had to reach deep within himself, to find what he really needed, and he showed me you could do anything you put your mind to. It just takes a little thought and motivation.Recommended by Josh"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is a book wrote by Gary Paulson.The main character is Brian.

A book by Gary Paulsen. It's basicaly a book on survival and to just love what you got while you have it. The main charachter is Brian Robeson. He learns how to survive in the woods ALONE. This book won the Newberry Honor Award.If you read the book for the first time the events are unpredictable.Brian Robeson was just a plain old boy flying across Canada to see his father after a divorce between his parents. On his way the something happened to the pilot (which I'm not going to tell). After that happens the plane crashes and Brian is left alone to fned for himself in the wild. After a while Brian realizes he's got to shape up if he's going to survive and he does ever it takes to do so.After some time Brian changes, because he's equipped to his surroundings and knows how to stay alive. He changed because now he knows that self-pity won't help in surviving. I give this book 4 out of 5 stars because it has it's ups and downs, goods and not so goods. Also it's a little graphic. But people, read for your self!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I read Hatchet when it first came out and I have re-read it at least 6 or 7 times since.( I am 54 years old) I learn something new every time I read it. I have also read all of the other Hatchet books, the most recent being \\"Brian's Hunt\\".The \\"Brian\\" series has made me more aware of nature, and more aware of the wild things around me. My wife and I camp and I have found the knowledge I gained from the Hatchet books to have been invaluable in my camping experiences. I know that, should I ever find myself lost in the wilderness, I will think of Brian, and attempt to be like him. Thanks, Gary. I wait with anticipation for the next \\"Brian\\" book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Have you ever gotten stuck in the wilderness or in a plane crash? Well both happened to thirteen year old Brian. He was on his way to Canada to see his dad at the oil mine when suddenly his pilot had a heart attack and the plane crashed into an L shaped lake. Brian had made his way of the plane and he went to shore and then he fainted. When he woke up he did not know where he was. He looked around and was surrounded by many trees and bugs. With no one around he got hungry and found berries, and then he got sick for days and stung by bugs. After he got stung by bugs, he went to find more food in the very dark woods and then it happened. He saw an object heading his way. Then a big black bear popped out of the bushes and was standing on its two hind legs, Brian thought \\"I am going to die.\\" But the bear just looked at him and left him alone. After he got more food he went back to the shelter he made when he arrived there. When he was sleeping an animal went inside and was looking for food. He found Brian's food that he had saved for later. Then he made a wall of sticks so an animal wouldn't come in and steal his food again. I really liked this book. When I read the part where the bear was standing on its feet and I thought Brian was going to get killed, I started to worry for Brian because the bear could have hurt him badly but the bear just left him alone. I think it was a good adventure because he got to check out the place where he was in the Canadian wilderness. He learned how to get food in the wild and how to survive. I could imagine I was there because the author made it seem like if I was there in the wilderness with Brian just waiting on someone to come and save us. I would recommend this book to people that like adventures.

Also it was very action paked with adventure. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for some outdoors and also some fun. This book will keep you interested all the way threw and also keep you on the edge of your seat. As you are about to read is one of the rising actions of this book.Brian is looking out the window looking at the vast wilderness below him wondering, why did his parents split up and what was the secret. He started to cry and tried to hide it from the pilot. He was on his way to see his Dad in Canada working on a oil rig. There was one thing that Brian's mom told him before he left the airport.\\"Get in the co-pliots seat!.\\" And he did. Brian was not very fond of the pilot cause for one he did not mine passing gas all through the plane ride. He was also moaning loudly and rubbing his chest and shoulders. Brian tried to ignore him the best that he could. But the one thing that was mostly on his mind was why there was such thing as divorce. The secret of why they split up in the first place. The more he thought about it the more he started to cry. The pilot started to really moan now. HE must have been in a lot of pain. Then suddenly the pilot shot back into his seat yelling and screaming. Brian started to panic he did not know what to do. The suddenly stopped moving and foam was coming out of his mouth.Brian was shocked and looked around for something to help. He put his ear to his chest and there was no pluse. It was surtain that he was having a heart attack. So Brian saw the radio and picked it up and said \\"Hello! Hello! Is anyone out there, my pilot is having a heart attack and I do not know how to fly the plane!\\" But there was no answer, then suddenly a fuzzy\\"What is your position son.\\" answered back. Brian yelled into the radio\\"I donno somewhere in the middle of Canada. But there was no answer back. And there Brian was alone by himself without anyone.

I enjoyed the book, but wonder why it is so highly regarded. It is a wonderful coming of age story. I did enjoy the imagery and appreciated the lessons it taught, but I question the violence of the plane crash as well as the negative connotations about the reason for his parents' divorce. I wish the book had just noted that the divorce had happened and that Brian was visiting his father for the summer. I did not appreciate the entire story line about THE SECRET. I was shocked when I read the THE SECRET in a book for 5th graders. I think the story line should have been divorce neutral instead of placing blame on the mother who was portrayed in a negative light throughout the book. I worry about a 5th grader whose parents are going through a divorce or who are divorced and that child's reaction to THE SECRET. Whatever happened to Tom Sawyer or Huck Finn?"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I think the book Hatchet is a good book to read. The story of Hatchet is about a boy that gets lost in the wilderness and he has to figure out how to survive there. He has to build tools and uses his brain to survive out in the wilderness.

He endures many hardships along the way from trying to survive. The boys name is Brian Robeson and he is thirteen years old.

There was sometihng unrealistic about Brian's survival attempts. It was as if the book droned on for ever, and the end was no where in sight. Things that should have been summarized and made shorter took up pages; things that should have been packed with detail, description, and emphasis took a matter of sentences. I was itching in my seat for the book to be over.

When the pilot had the heart attack, no one knew what was going to happen next. When the narrator said, \\" The pilot stopped jerking, his legs contracted up into the seat and his eyes rolled back until the whites in his eyes were showing\\". This part of the book gave me the feeling that time just stopped because Brian is stuck with a dead pilot and is still in the air. Brian doesn't know how to fly a plane but manages. When Brian eats a raw turtle egg that he finds in the sand, this shows his fight to survive. He is going to survive any way possible. He has to do some brave things like pulling out porcupine quills out of his leg. \\"He grasped one of the quills, held his breath, and jerked.\\" That was brave because they were deep and the pain would so bad that someone could go into shock. I think that the adventure that Brian has is very well put in the book. Everything that happens to him and everything that he does is exciting in some way. So if you want to read a book that has lots of adventure and action in it, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Imagine being on a plane to visit your father thinking \\"In just a few minutes I'll be getting of in an airport to spend some time with my dad!\\" when the next thing you know, your plane has crashed and you're in the middle of the forest with no supplies except for a hatchet that your mother gave you. This is the story of Hatchet by Gary Paulsen. It's the story of a 13 year-old boy, surviving in the wilderness on his own. It's a very descriptive book and you will find yourself drawn to it from the start. The suspense is so great, you find yourself thinking \\"What's going to happen? Will he be found?

Brian was going to Canada to visit his father during the summer vocation when the plane crashed in the wilderness. While in the wilderness Brian learned how to live by himself by using survival skills. The most important thing that Brian had would be his hatchet. I think that Brian didn't have a hatchet he wouldn't survive forty-four days in the wilderness.In the wilderness Brian met several wild animals such as: moose, bears, porcupine, turtle, and skunk. All these animals at the beginning attacked Brian. The first animal that hurt Brian was a bear and then others. The moose attacked Brian hardest because this animal is not so small; he weights much and is bigger than human. The good thing what Brian got from turtle was turtle's eggs. Brain could eat those eggs and then be full, and of course it's much better than berries.The wilderness changed Brian life forever. Now he was different. What are you impressed? Is Brian such a strong person like the others? What kind the boy can survive forty-four days without human being, without normal and regular food? Brian did he lived those days he never talk with anyone just by himself. Brian should be with his father and have a good time. But now is everything different. He is alone in the wilderness. He should be proud of himself because he learned many things how to make a fire without any matches, how to find food without any store and how to live in the woods. Could any of his teenagers survive like this how he did?I think if I would be in this situation lost in the wilderness, I would like to have Brian with me because he is such a smart boy. So time to say my opinion for this book I'll give 4 stars because in this book were some details which I didn't like it. I don't think that in real life could happen that thirteen-year-old boy could survive by himself. Maybe author could made that boy was a little bit older about sixteen year old, maybe it would work then, but it's just my opinion maybe others think different than me.In the novel Hatchet describes a survival situation about a young boy who survived in the wilderness without anything just a hatchet. He met many animals and now he knows more about the nature and life in the wilderness. This experience had changed how Brian thought about life. He learned that things don't always go as you expect.By: Gintare ..."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is a very suspenseful book.

This was the first book I have read by Paulsen and I have to admit I loved his style. The text is almost poetic in the way that phrases will repeat to add emphasis.When 13 year old Brian's plan is forced down in the Canadian wilderness, he must fend for himself for nearly 2 months. At the same time, he is dealing with his only personal struggles, such as the divorce of his parents, the death of the pilot and his emerging adolescence. Brian learns that his determination and perseverance will get him through this struggle. The problem-solving skills he develops are also a key topic.I would plan to use this book in my classroom in a literature study setting for 3rd-6th graders. The book is appropriate as far as the material and is on their reading level. However, I did take one star away because, while it was well written, I never got into the survivalist aspect. I enjoyed the language and the themes, but not so much the basic plot events.Why 4 stars?:While the book is beautifully written, I was never able to fully get into the plot.

Twenty three years later, I heard my son mention this as required reading in a 5th grade reading challenge our county library, King County Washington, puts on every hear. Once again, I paid little attention until about three weeks ago and we were in a book store, this was sitting on an end-cap and he mentioned how much he liked the book and that I should give it a try. Right there, I went on my phone and downloaded the kindle edition and started reading it when I got home. One nonstop sitting later and I was done, completely enveloped in the story of Brian Robeson that Gary Paulsen created.This coming of age story about survival and finding oneself after being left to ones own devices in the wilderness. This novel reminded me a lot of another young adult book I read a few years ago and loved, \\"Touching Spirit Bear\\". Unlike \\"Touching Spirit Bear\\", \\"Hatchet\\" starts with Brian, child of recently divorced parents, being sent to visit his father in Canada where he now works. Brian is being flown from his mother's in Long Island on a single prop plane when the pilot has a heart attack mid-flight, dies and Brian survives the crash of the plane.Like all good coming of age stories, Brian encounters his share of believable, but harrowing encounters with nature, animals and his own internal demons (his parents divorce and the secret he knows that led to their break-up). As a child of divorce, I can still relate to the emotional turmoil that Paulsen creates with Brian and can imagine how much more powerful this book would be to an early teen going through life transformations, especially someone in a similar family situation. As an adult, I found this to be a entertaining read and adventure and will be certain my younger two children read it as they get older."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet has been one of my long time favorite books. I have read it to classes as young as 4th grade and as old as 7th grade. It reaches a wide range of kids. Boys and Girls enjoy it, as Brian has to problem solve his way out of a life or death dilemma. It is a great book to teach foreshadowing, prediction and problem solving. It also has a great message about how to handle tough situations and the choices you have when faced with these situations. I recently read it on our car trip to New Orleans and even my reading reluctant husband enjoyed listening to what would happen next to Brain Robeson.

For that young man to go through all that alone must be so tough but at the same time your thinking that you would love to be in that position. You imagine yourself in that situation and you think about what that would be like. Gary Paulsen does a great job with the detail and being realistic about what might actually happen. He isn't making the boy out to be some super survival man, he is just a regular guy like any of us. When reading the book you really feel for the guy and I know I found myself so deep into the book that I saw myself in the story. I would like to sit down and chat with Mr. Paulsen about the inspiration behind Hatchet, one of my favorite books. It would be great to pick his brain a little bit.

The pilot has a heart attack and dies. Now Brian has to land the plane in the middle of the forest, all by himself. Brian is about 13 years old, and lives in the city, so he has no idea how to survive in the wilderness. All Brian has with him to survive is a hatchet that his mother gave to him as a present. Brian makes some weapons, and a shelter, and finds some food.

This teaches him how to hunt and fish, how to make a fire, and basically how to survive. He also faces injuries, severe weather and a few more things, but you have to read to find that out.I would give this book 2 thumbs up. I really like this book because there were so many cliff hangers and if you like cliff hangers, you would like this book. I suggest you read this book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian Robeson is the main character of the book named Hatchet. Brian was a normal looking kid with Dark hair and was average weight. When Brian crashed on a plane when he was trying to go see his mother, he smashed down HARD in a lake, which caused his forehead to swell up.And Brian had cuts all over his body that would soon turn into scabs. Brian was also swollen all over his body, his hair was all matted, and was all dirty because he was covered in dirt. Brian then realized that he had crashed right in the middle of nowhere, and that he would have to survive on his own."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Have you ever flown in a bush plane before? Well Brains first time in a plane was a disaster. The Hatchet written by Gary Paulsen is a book about Brian who goes to visit his father in Canada and his plane crashes.The author made the setting very realistic. He talked about the forest, the clear blue lakes, and the blue mountains that Brian was surrounded by as he crashed and landed. I can compare the setting to where I live because I live in Bassett where there is a lot of trees, lakes, and streams.Brian is a thirteen year old boy that gets smarter as the book goes. His Mom and Dad are divorce so his Mom lives in New York and his Dad lives in Canada. His Mom is seeing another man, HIM. The pilot of the bush plane has a heart attack. Brian's friend Terry goes to the mall with Brian and they go to the park together. Don't forget the last character, the fur buyer that comes looking for fur and hears Brian's radio transmitter.The book starts off that Brian's parents are getting divorce. Then Brian goes to see his Dad in Canada and his pilot has a heart attack so Brian has to fly the plane. Brian fly's the plane until it runs out of gas and crashes. He is ok after the crash but the question is will he make it alone in the wilderness. You will have to read it to find out.I think this is a great book that is not too long or too short. Gary, the author, makes the book feel so real. He makes the reader believe in Brian as a real person. It seemed like I was there with Brian in the Canadian Wilderness.Here's a part that Brian says after the tornado.- \\"I hope the tornado hit the moose.\\"Here's a little more of Gary Paulsen's writing.- \\"It was beautiful and terrible at the same time.\\"- \\"He was whipped against the front wall of the shelter like a rag, felt ripping pain in his ribs again, then was hammered back down into the sand once more while the wind too the whole wall, his bed, the fire, his tools, all of it and threw it out into the lake, gone out of sight, gone forever.\\"So now you see a little preview of this book, now go to your local library and check out the Hatchet by Gary Paulsen."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I got this book for my 27 yo son. It was his favorite story growing up. The 1st book arrived w/ a small tear in the inside. I returned it for a new one and received it in 2days! Very pleased w/ this purchase."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book was written in a style that was easy to read. Probably intended mostly for adolescent boys. However, as a sixty year old female, I can say that I enjoyed this story as an easy, escapest read.The theme of the story seemed to me to be that the basic driving force in the animal kingdom is the search for food. To be able to successfully search for food, you need to have a safe sheltor from the elements and predators, and be able to stay healthy. For example, a human who is lost in the wilderness, and happens to break his leg could die because he would not be able to do the things needed to search successfully for food. This is the same as what happens to animals in the wild if they are injured.In our modern world which is so far removed from the truths of nature, it was enjoyable to read this basic survival story."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"VERY AWSOM! I READ IT VERY FAST VERY SOON A DAY YES! TRUTH IT WAS A GOOD BOOK, I HAD READ IT TWICE AS A YOUTH IN MY TEENAGE, BUT I READ IT AGAIN AM NOW A LOT OLD, I SAY THIS IS STILL VERY GOOD EXAMPLARY BOOK OF CHILD LITERTURE. TAUGHT ME ALOT. I RECOMEND AND HIGHLY. THANK YOU."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"My kids told me I had to read this book. Being an all-knowing adult, I figured I'd humor them, but really thought myself above teen/tween books.Wrong.It's not so much a young person's book as it is a book for all ages. All of Brian's the main character) emotions are palpable to the reader. Everything he goes through is believable. The only issue I had with the book (and with many of Paulsen's writings) is that it was far too short."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Have you ever been in a plane crash? Brian did in the book Hatchet. It's boring in the beginning flying, flying, flying, flying, then KABOOM!! The action comes in. The author Gary Paulson really knows what he is writing. If you want to know what happens to Brian, get this book now!Hatchet is a book with the main character Brian whose parent's are divorced and Brian has to take a plane from his mom to his dad. The pilot had a heart attack and Brian was all alone for about four days in the woods. He had a lot of challenges throughout the book. One is when Brian dug some turtle eggs and a skunk came and dug up the eggs. Brian tried to scare the skunk but it squirted Brian in the eyes before he could retrieve the eggs. After a few days, Brian was saved when a helicopter rescued him.My favorite part of the book is how Brian made his shelter. I mean how he described how he made it. It's clever how he made his shelter by himself. I also liked when he scraped the hatchet with a type of rock and did it again, again, and again until he remembered a commercial that taught him to blow on the wood when it sparked. Then he did the same thing. The book is filled with 195 pages of survival techniques.The most important thing I leaned from the book is how you can make a bow and arrow and a spear to kill fish and eat them.There is another book by the same author and the same series. It's called Brian's Hunt. There's Brian's Return, Brian's Winter, and The River and he has written several more books.I recommend that you read this book because it's like an instruction book of survival. I think it's a great book too. If you want to read this book, come and get it!I rate this book five stars."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Very good middle school book especially for adventurous readers. Completed for reading fair. Great examples to make a beautiful project. 10 yr old son really loves book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The name of this book is Hachet. The author's name is Gary Paulsen. The genre is adventure fiction. I think this book should be for 9-12 year olds but I think grown ups would like it to.This book is about Brian and how he survives in the Canadian wilderness. It started with Brian going to see his dad. Brian's dad and mom are divorced. His mom was taking him to the airport where his plane was waiting. He got on the plane and he was the only one on except for the pilot. The pilot had a heart attack. Brian became alone. Brian took over the plane and tried to land it in the water. He was still alive but he hurt his back. He has to try to survive. See if he survives or not in this great bookMy favorite part was when Brian found the life packet in the plane. I liked it because it was an exciting part. He found packets of food and powder for the drinks. Then somebody landed a plane on the water and he was saved.I recommend this book because it has information about survival and it's an exciting and suspenseful book.Another book like Hatchet is The River which is the sequel to Hatchet."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hachet by Gary Paulsen is a realistic fiction book with a interesting character named Brian Robenseon.This 13 year old boy finds himself in the Canadian wilderness with nothing but his clothes and a hatchet.He was travelling to his father's house in a bushplane when the pilot dies of a heart-attack.Brian amazingly survives the crash.Can he endure porcupine quills, mosquitoes and worst of all tornadoes?I would recommend this book to anyone who likes vivid adventurous stories I would also recommend Brian's Winter, a continuation of Hatchet.I think Hatchet is one of Gary Paulsen's best books."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The Book was great but realy took a while to get started. But after it was great and interesting."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book was magnificent, cliffhanging and best of all unpredictable because no matter what, you never would be able to guess what was going to happen next. I enjoyed this book at a high level and the good thing is that no matter what age you are at you will enjoy this. This adventurous book is recommended by me to everyone that is anyone. Go ahead and read this book so you can either prove me right, or prove me wrong"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Having the opportunity to read this book in 4th grade, I was left with a good impression of Paulsen's books. I enjoyed living through the adventures of Brian Robeson. Although I have had some exciting events in my life, I believe his struggle to survive in the wilderness would be quite an adventure.Paulsen does a good job implementing young adult issues into the adventure, and you can see this through Brian's thoughts throughout the story. After reading Hatchet, I ventured on to read many of Paulsen's books such as The Voyage of the Frog, Dogsong, Canyons, and The Foxman. Many of these stories were similar in nature but with different plots. I was also intrigued to learn of Paulsen's other books regarding slavery and other issues.I would recommend this book to any young adult, and many of Paulsen's other books.-Kevin"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book Is by far the greatest out door survival book i have read. Gary paulsen is from Minnesota making him very known to woodland conditions. Gary did a great job, I highly recomend this book for anyone who likes the woods. I think this book is great for kids, and even adults. I hope Brian can go back and live in the woods someday to be happy again. I hope that Gary makes another part to this story becuase i know it would be as good as &quot; HATCHET &quot;."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"the book was real good. I like the suspense.

A hatchet. Well this boy named Brian Roberson did. He was stranded alone on the shores of a Canadian forest eighth only one thing. Well do you didn't know yet this book is named Hatchet and the authors name is Gary Paulsen.In this book there is a boy named Brian who is on an airplane and the pilot has a heart attack. He has to survive until he gets rescued which trust me would take a long time for anyone who crashed in the forest with only his/her clothing and a hatchet on your belt. He has to go hunting make all types of tools. And then there's some bad that happen along the way. It's a really good book. I can insure you that you will like this book. So you should defiantly get this book.My favorite part of the book is when Brian gets stuck in a huge storm. Its pouring buckets and there was a leak in the roof going drip drop drip drop. And his shelter has little rivers of water going through it. And remember the only clothes he has are the ones on his back. There's thunder booming like one thousand bombs going off at once.This book has taught me that being strong, mentally focused, not panicking will keep you alive in any situation. Including survival in the forest.Some other books written by this author are Brains return, Brains winter, tracker, woods runner and guts. Some other books like hatchet are the Hunger Games series.My recommendation for this book is that anyone aged 9-109 years old will like this book! Because Its so adventures and exciting and a fun but dangerous survival story."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I read this book when my son was young. I thought it was a great book. I bought it for a young boy in my Sunday School class who does not like to read. I thought this excellent book might get him hooked on reading. I hope he likes it as much as my son and I did."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Don't let the fact that this book is written for young adults stop you from reading it. I've read Hatchet several times and I'm always amazed that it is just as good a read for adults as it is for younger readers. His knowledge of nature is extensive. His ability to capture in words the feeling of being in the wilderness is vivid. I always find myself wanting to read more and thankfully Gary Paulsen loves to write so there are 175 books to choose from!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet ReviewHow would you deal with a family fight going on and get lost in a forest? The main topic is about a boy, named Brian, who gets lost in a forest and does not know how to get out. This book does have a very detailed storyline. Its setting is not jumping from place to place and its setting transitions into one another. I mean that the settings always show the boy taking every footstep in the story; it doesn't jump around (for example: chapter 3 Going to die, chapter 4 The memory, and chapter 5 his eyes snapped open).Brian had awful memories of his family the whole time. It helps create the story in your mind by creating vivid pictures. I personally do get pleasure from this book because it was a very unproblematic for me to understand (unlike most chapter books). I recommend this book to those who like adventure, but it does have some disturbing things in it.The main characters in the story are Brian, his mom, and dad. He was in a plane going to his dads and it crashed in the forest. He had to survive and find a way to get help. Using his hatchet his mom gave him to survive out in the forest, he used it for multiple uses. I have to give this book five stars because of its grand description and my ability to understand the story. Will he survive; find out yourself?"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book was basically the kid version of cast away. It was fast paced and kept you on your toes the entire time. I loved this book. I highly recommend this book to all"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Does your pre-or early-teen son hate reading? Mine does. I remember not being that thrilled about reading, especially for recreation, myself until I found the book that caught my attention and swept me into a different world. My son had read this book in school for a report and wanted to have it at home and that told me something. Maybe he had found the book. I got this 20th Anniversary Edition and he plowed right through it again, happily reviewing the events of each chapter with me. As he had shown so much interest in this book, I even ordered the next two in the series to see if we could keep the momentum going and so I can report to you that he is just as interested in what happens to Brian in The River and Brian's Winter.Again, it has been difficult for us to find THE story that would catch his eye, that would garner enough of his attention to show him that reading is not only an assignment at school but entertainment that stimulates the imagination while giving the reader characters to care about and a story to enjoy in a way that movies can't. The tale of Brian's unfortunate adventures in the woods caught something in him. I can't say if it will work for you but The Hatchet has been that book for my son.For me? It was Up Periscope by Robb White. Boys will be boys."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Why did I never read this when I was younger?? I vaguely recall it being a popular book during my middle school years, especially with the boys, so maybe I somehow got the idea that it was a 'boy book.' I'm so glad I decided to finally read it. It was a quick read, and I was absolutely gripped by Paulsen's survival tale right from the very beginning pages. The author so expertly uses Brian's inner monologues as a writing technique, that I nearly didn't realize that the book has no dialogue to speak of. The writing and the story are just so good--definitely an 'unputdownable' book. Without being overly wordy, Paulsen paints a clear picture of 13-year-old Brian's weeks alone in the woods. I loved Brian; he was such a likeable and real character. My one criticism of the book is that the 'Epilogue' didn't seem to 'jibe' with the rest of the book. It was almost as if it had a different voice or style or something. But as a whole, I was hooked by this story. If you're looking for an enthralling survival story, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Gripping story - a little scary at first, but my 10-year old did fine with it and the book really held our attention."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Thirteen year old Brian Robeson is on his way to visit his recently divorced father in a small bush plane cruising over the Canadian woods. Having a sudden heart attack, the pilot falls into a coma and Brian now has to land the plane with a broken radio in the middle of the wilderness. The unprepared teenager is left with only a hatchet and his inexperienced mind to attempt to survive in a place he has never been before. Beautifully written, Hatchet takes readers into Brian's eyes as he tries to overcome physical and mental obstacles. This is one dramatic Newbery Honor book that you certainly won't forget. Gary Paulson, a 3 time Newbery Honor winner, also wrote Brian's Winter, Dogsong, and Tracker. Also, this book is not recommended for children 9 and under."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is about a boy who's parents got a divorce and he was flying over to see his dad.

Trust me, it is ANTI-boring!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This is an awesome book because it tells an epic adventure of a boy who is determined to live in the Canadian wilderness. He is able to do so by learning how to make weapons, kill and cook prey, make shelter, and cherish the memories that he has of his mother and father. When compared to other books this book usually comes out on top with me because it is an action and a thriller all in one. I would get a quote that I could comment on, but there reeally aren't any that are good. In my opinion this book is really for only those who love to read about people who risk their lives just to save thei own."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is a kind of book for people who like adventures.I read this with my partner Garrett.This book teaches you to survive without tools but Brian's only tool he has is his hachet.He makes stuff with it like a spear and a bow and arrow.Surviving and getting hit by a moose,getting poked by a porcipine,and getting real close to a wolf.Read the book to learn more about Brian and his adventure!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatcet is the most adventurous book I've ever read.

I think this book is for 4th grade and up."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"To anyone who enjoys adventure, Hatchet is the book for you. Not only did it keep my attention throughout the entire story, but it made me think. While flying over the Canadian wilderness, Brian's plane crashes. Brian is equipped to survive with nothing more than the clothes on his body and a hatchet. I contemplated what I would do if I was in Brian's situation or how I would react to the same experiences he had. This well-written book by Gary Paulsen took me beyond a superficial level of reading. I delved into a second and even third level of what the author was really portraying and trying to communicate to his reader. What Brian endured, he did so as much physically as mentally. His \\"survival\\", his \\"becoming a new person\\", these are just metaphors as to what we have to face at one time or another. Taken literally, Brian lived in the wilderness and found ways to survive. But on more than one level, he found himself through experience and discovered how to really \\"live\\" and \\"survive\\". I would recommend this book to anyone who believes that something greater awaits him or her. It is an inspiring piece of literature that rests on what we have inside us- toughness, perseverance; we just have to go out and discover that."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is fast moving, easy to read, and the plot is simple to understand. All very good, but sometimes luck is just like another main character. I think that Brian was VERY LUCKY to have had a hatchet- going away present. He was VERY LUCKY that he had found a good place to 'land' the plane. He was VERY LUCKY to have 'landed' the plane. The list goes on and on. There were also some parts that could've been shortened. And this is the main flaw in survival stories: the plot doesn't develop that much: there's no story arc. I agree with some readers that Gary Paulsen could've combined all four Brian books. Then he wouldn't have to worry about the length and just cut out some of the unnecessary parts. On the other hand, the book was pretty realistic. I liked the fact that there weren't any other main characters in the survival part (not the flashbacks or the pilot dying part) besides Brian. It really gave Gary Paulsen a good chance of developing him. I liked Gary Paulsen's style and the way he decribed certain things: especially the fire. Another thing: even though the book was written about a decade or so ago, it took an awfully long time for someone to find Brian. If it were set in present time, it would've only taken a day to find him and rescue him. Overall, Hatchet's a good book. I will keep on reading Gary Paulsen's books because he has a very 'alive' imagination. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read something realistic- something without supernatural stuff."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I bought this book for my 9 year old son to read on an extended road trip last summer.

It is similar to &quot;My Side of the Mountain,&quot; another award winning book about a boy who survives alone in the woods. The original sequel to &quot;Hatchet,&quot; called &quot;The River&quot; was disappointing, but the newer sequel, &quot;Brian's Winter,&quot; is almost as popular as &quot;Hatchet.&quot; This book grabs the attention of young people, including kids who normally don't like to read.

He learned to hunt, catch fish, fool birds, and rabbits. He was faced with many difficulties such as the moose. The moose gave Brian bad rib injuries. A tornado destroyed everything he had worked so hard making. In the end Brian was rescued. I thought this book was good except for Brian repeating himself too much."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The book Hatchet is a book for an older age crowd around seventh or eighth grade. In the beginning of the book they express the pilot of the plane the boy is in has a heart attack and dies while the plane crashes into water. Yet it is detailed some children might find this book interesting because of the survival the boy goes through. Apart from the boys wounds from the crash he must learn how to survive out in the wilderness by himself. There are many helpful hints in this story that children could maybe someday need. I would not suggest this book to any children below the grade of junior high."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The main character is Brian Roberson. He is thirteen years old. His parents were divorced.

He did not know anything about how to live in the wilderness alone. And there were no living people out. He had a lot of challenging things but the most important thing he had was a hatchet it helped him a lot. He learned how to make a fire with the hatchet. He also learned to be careful with this tool since it was a weapon that the coned defend himself with. Brian had changed as a person from this experience he was almost an adult in his thinking. However, I think there could have been more action. It would be more interesting if there was more action. I would give this book 5 point out of 10.

Swore and hissed, \\"Chest! Oh god, my chest is coming apart!\\" Brian knew now. The pilot was having a heart attack.\\"Hatchet is one of the best books I've ever read. It's about a boy named Brian who crashes in a plane and now must live in the wilderness. By himself he has to find food, build a shelter, and more with only a hatchet.Gary Paulsen has written a few of these Brian books. Brian is very brave in this story, but I think in the beginning he was really scared and didn't now what to. Later on in the story he got use to the wilderness and started to like it. Once he was looking for berries and saw a bear. The bear was looking for the same berries that he was looking for so he just stood there until it left. He learned other things about living in the wilderness like how to catch a fish and start a fire.I recommend this book to whoever likes adventure, mystery, realistic fiction, or just books that Gary Paulsen wrote. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet by Gary Paulsen is the best book ever in my opinion. If I could rate it one to five, one being the lowest and five the highest. I would probably rate it a 5 star book. The setting of this book is in the Canadian wilderness. There is only one main character and that is Brian Robeson. The other characters are Brian's mother and father, and the pilot. The whole conflict of the story is that Brian is stranded in the Canadian woods and has to survive with just a hatchet, the woods around him, and the torn windbreaker on his back.This book is a must read for the reason that this 13 year old boy is stranded in the Canadian wilderness after a plane crash. Also most pages left you wondering what was going to happen next so you kept turning the pages. It was almost like I was falling into the book's trap.Not only is the book good but the author is outstanding at writing books. Gary Paulsen is an out doors man. Gary has written almost 200 books. They are mostly outdoors books for example \\"Hatchet\\", \\"Woodsong\\", \\"Dogsong\\", \\"The Winter Room\\", and many more. The only reason I read other authors is that my English teachers make me. Gary Paulsen Books inspire me. I get interested in the book very fast when I read Gary's books. This shows why I liked to read \\"Hatchet\\" and it tells some parts in \\"Hatchet\\" and why I like Gary and some facts about him."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I started injoying this book in the fourth chapter because excitment was wild in my mind.

His parents are divorced. Brian gets stranded in the woods on the way to visit his father in the Canadian forest. The pilot has a heart attack and Brian ends up flying the plane. He flies terrified for a few hours and then the warning light for low fuel comes on. Brian knows he has to land the plane somehow. He manages to land in the middle of a lake. He then finds his way our and makes it to the surface. The cold blank dead face of the pilot haunts him. For 63 days he lives in the large Canadian forest. Happy and sad events take place while living in the forest. For example, he learns how to make fire and a territorial insane moose mauls him over. Over these 63 days, he learns important life lessons.I liked this book a lot. However, its one of those books that you either like it or you don't.

This book shows how a boy (Brian) is living through the Canadian Wilderness after a plane crash. It is an amazing story about how some movies and books about survival are nowhere near real life situations. This book is great for outdoorsy people and people that love the wilderness. But I am not that kind of person so that's why I only gave the book a 4 star rating. But if you want to find out what happens to Brian who is alone in the wilderness then read Hatchet."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"well to start off, the book was really great. I really liked the problems that Brian had like the time he couldn't get a fire started. Plus he ripped up a twenty-dollar bill but he had to use some other materials to give the sparks a ''home''. I can't believe that he would eat pits of berries. You'd have to be crazy to do that. Well I think that when the moose trampled over Brian and hit him about a hundred times, I heard that moose aren't that aggressive like that, cause if you go hunting for moose you can't find that many of them it would only happen about 1 million to 1, and Brain was lucky number 1. In my opinion I would like to be Brian besides when the moose got really mad at him. The reason I like this book is because I like the outdoors, and I do a lot of what Brian did in the book like build a fire. I recommend this book to people that like the outdoors, not like in your yard but in the mountains. I give this book a 4 star rating, if I give you 4 star rating that's a good book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet,by Gary Paulsen is about a 13 year old boy, Brian Robeson.

Either way the story goes on in, &#65533;Brian&#65533;s Winter&#65533; and, &#65533;The River&#65533;.I like how this book shows how complete ignorance can spawn into in depth knowledge of how to survive with only small tools such as the hatchet that Brian has through this series. I thought that this book was realistic as far as how he survived but some of the Problems he faced were not, such as a 40 or so year old pilot having a heart attack, and a tornado in the Canadian Wilderness. I believe that although this book had some unlikely parts, that it all in all was a realistic novel and reading it might be able to help someone if they were ever in that sort of a situation.I would recommend this book to people who like realistic adventure novels, although it had some unrealistic parts to it.

No matter who you are, you're likely to learn some important lessons about yourself.Thirteen year-old Brian is flying to visit his father in the Canadian wilderness. Brian has little time to reflect upon his parents' recent divorce - the pilot suffers a heart attack during the flight and dies. And no one else is aboard the plane. If Brian doesn't find a way to land the plane, he'll die too.To call \`Hatchet' an \\"adventure story\\" would be a gross understatement. It is so much more. In Brian, readers of all ages will see a broad range of emotions: fear, courage, hope, despair. Brian makes several discoveries, but the most important one is an inner discovery. To survive in the wilderness, he must not only find a new way to live, but a new way to think.\`Hatchet' is so well written, I never felt that anything Paulsen wrote was contrived or unbelievable. Everything rings true, which is both rare and welcome. \`Hatchet,' like Lois Lowry's \`Number the Stars,' is one of those books that everyone should read. You might just find a new way to think...and to live."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I was introduced to this book by a special needs child I was tutoring.

These are the things that 13 year old Brian Robeson feels in the northern canadian woods, with only a gift from his mother: A hatchet. The book begins with Brian on a small plane, with a pilot named Jim, or Jake or something (quoted from the book.) Tears try to flow through his eyes, as he remembers The Secret. His mother, in a station-wagon with a blonde man. Kissing him. Brian snaps out of it as he smells something. He looks over to the pilot. He's rubbing his joints and letting gas go. Must be something he ate, Brian thinks. The pilot tries to call someone on a radio, but he stops in the middle. \\"OH MY GOD! MY CHEST! MY CHEST IS COMING APART!!!\\" Brian then knows. The pilot is having a heart attack. The pilot jerks one final time and knocks the plane off course. Brian takes control, and uses the radio to no avail. He finds a lake, crudley shaped like an L.

The reason that the pilot and Brian got in the plane crash was because the pilot lost control of the plane. I think this book is very sad because the pilot dies from a very serious heart attack just like my grandfather did. Brian lived in the wilderness for a while.After about two months the searchers stopped looking for Brian because they thought that he had possibly died but he didn't, he was still alive.

I'm in the 6th grade and I find this book interesting. Not only does it show that it's not easy to live alone, it teaches us to not take the little things for granted. Some of us wake up and bamm, food is there, but if there were only raspberries or turtle eggs to eat we would be looking crazy.This book has also showed me that I shouldn't give up no matter how down it may look. If Brian would have given up and killed himself imagine all the stories he would never get to tell stories he went through or the Secret. I think this is a book everyone should read and comprehend.P.S.- This should be made into a film!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This was one of the few required reading books I actually enjoyed when I was a young student. It had been so long since I first read it (15-20 years?) that the only thing I remembered about it was how much I liked it. When I recently purchased it again to read on my Kindle I was worried that I wouldn't like it as an adult and I'd spoil my memories of it. That didn't even come close to happening, this book is still great. In fact, I'm tempted to read some of the other Brian Robeson book that Paulsen has written. This is a great read for anyone."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Imagine you are a child on a plane flight in a small plane across the Canadian Wilderness, when the pilot suddenly has a massive and extremely lethal heart attack, leaving you alone. Imagine the sum total of your flight experience is the few minutes when you held the plane straight and level earlier in the flight. That is the position Brian finds himself in at the start of this novel. Surviving a crash landing, this city boy, with no survival training and nothing but a hatchet and the clothes he is wearing to help him, must learn how to survive in a wild and unforgiving place.This is a compelling survival story, well written, gritty and realistic. It captivated me despite being well over its target age range, and it will be equally captivating to a young adult audience. Thoroughly recommended."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is about a boy named Brian Robeson. He is 13 and his parents are divorced. He lives with his mom in New York during the school year and is traveling by plane to stay with his dad in Canada for the summer. Brian is the only passenger on the plane and the pilot died of a heart attack. Brian tries to fly the plane and he does. When the plane runs out of gas Brian crashes but manages to survive. All he has with him is a small hatchet his mother gave him. Brian must learn to find his own food, water and shelter to survive the wilderness. He grew stronger mentally and physically.I liked this book because Brian has many adventures to survive in the wilderness. He learn many new skills. He was able to do what it takes to survive. The thing I didn't like was when the plane crashed. That scares me because I travel on planes to see my family.My favorite quoute in the book is, \\"My name is Brian Robeson. Would you like something to eat. I liked it because Brian is rescued.My favorite part of the book is when a tornadoe hits Brian's shelter and it's destroyed. Brian would have to start all over again. Brian is strong and will do anything to survive."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"In the book Hatchet, Brian is a 13 year boy who knows a secret and is dealing with his parents divorce. Brian is going to his dad's when a tragedy accurs and causes the plane to crash. Brian is alone in the woods and battles sickness, injury, hunger,weather, and while he thinks he's the predator hes also looked upon as the prey.What I enjoyed about this Realistic Fiction is that my eyes were glued to the book. This book was very suspensful and kept making me read one more chapter. I was very surprised at this at this because I am definatley not a reader.Also I liked that he comes to the conclusion that he is the best tool that he has and makes use of the stuff he has and makes life very livable. The only thing that I didn't like was that he cut himself in a suicidal attempt, but it actually was great because it let you almost feal the pain that Brian felt and all the stress he delt with.I would give this book a 5 star rating because the plot was great, it didnt get boring to me and had a great story and message to it."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Have you ever wondered what you would do if you were stranded in the woods?In this book Brian survives in the north woods for a year and he finds what he wants to do in life.

Brian was moved by the woods, not only the beauty of them but the fact that if you don't gather food for yourself and make a fire, you die.I think that hatchet is a great book. I think that Hatchet is a great book because it has many different genres like action , adventure and a little bit of mystery because you wonder when brian is going to get rescued.

The events that happen in this story are so real you almost feal like you are there. It is about a boy Brian who is on his way to his father's house when his pilot has a heart attack. He is forced to land the plane when it runs out of gas, so he crashes it in a lake. He sleeps for about a day then sorts out what he must do. His only weapon and tool at the time is his hatchet. It was given to him by his mother before he left. He eats berries at first, then fish and bird, then he finally gets the survival pack from the plane and has afeast.

Every chapter I was waiting for something to happen. Nothing ever did. The story is very predictable. Man gets on island, man makes fire, man gets saved. This story is just like the movie &quot;Cast Away&quot;, except instead of the man talking to a volleyball, Bryan talks to himself. What's the chance of your pilot having a heart attack, then you somehow land on a island, make fire, and survive 45 days in the wilderness? 1/1000. This book got 2 stars from me because the end played in well with all the dullness. This is like Maury, he always plays the same show more that once. But this time, Paulsen's show never got on TV. I suggest this book to old people who like action movies but not the books. I beg your pardon Gary Paulson. You are a great author. What went wrong?"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Meet 13-years-old Brian Robeson. His survival adventures have sparked the imagination of millions of young readers. Following a plane crash, Brian was stranded alone in the Canadian wilderness with nothing but a small hatchet and painful memories of his parents' recent breakup. Facing hunger, wild animals and harsh weather, Brian acquires inspiring survival techniques and on the same time develops as a human being.Brian's adventures in Hatchet were accepted so well by young readers, that author Gary Paulsen continued and published a series of sequels to become his Brian's Saga. The book was also awarded the Newbery Honor prize.For writing a book summary of Hatchet, I came back to reading it again. Although the story hasn't lost its appeal, in today's world and reality TV shows, some of the adventures seem somewhat small in scale. But perhaps this is exactly what makes Hatchet so unique.In my view, Gary Paulsen's Hatchet is a wonderful read for young readers and an excellent idea for a book report, for both elementary school and junior high."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"It was good because it showed how over time Brian made more inprovements in his tools and used them well. Also the story was well written."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book was pretty good. It is a good book if you want to know survive in the woods. Also it is a good book to see everything you can do with just one hatchet. This is also real good because it is very realistic. I would say that this book could be read by ages ten and up. Also what I thought was cool is that the cover says that it sold over 2,000,000 copies.It probably sold that many copies because it was a real godd book.This book is about a thirteen year old boy who gets in a plane crash and is stranded in the woods, but he happens to have a hatchet that his mother gave him. Now he has to try to survive until he is rescued. His hatchet is a big help though. If he didn't have his hatchet who knows what's going to happen to him."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"We read this with our 9 yr old son. He's advanced for his age and was fine with the content. The affair the mother had is brought up several times, but is not more than \\"She kissed him in the car. A real kiss\\". It resulted in the mom and dad's divorce. The suicide attempt comes out of nowhere but is specific to the circumstances and appropriate. The boy in the story is 13 yrs old.Overall the book sparks the imagination of children, and me, to be more prepared with the survival skills our culture has lost. I read the book in two nights. Its an easy read. It is very well written, brings up poignant points about how, if you're stranded in the wild, you must be \\"one\\" in the wild. You don't attack everything, and are at the mercy of quite a bit of nature. I think it is appropriate for our children and maybe that will get our kids to be a little more serious about outdoor skills, and not just the jumping, running skills of the game consoles."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I've been on the biggest reading kick of my life here lately and I've been a bit nostalgic as well, so when I decided to re-read some of the books from my grade school years, I chose \\"Hatchet\\" first based on its inspirational tale of one lone pre-teen boy's survival.Brian Robeson is a 13-year old boy on his way to visit his father up north. At the peak of summer, he boards a Cessna 406 in Hampton, NY bound for oil fields in Canada where his father is working as a mechanical engineer. The Cessa carries with it oil drilling cargo but before they can reach their destination, the pilot unexpectedly has a heart attack and dies at the wheel, leaving Brian to land the plane all by himself. Miraculously surviving the crash, he is now faced with trying to survive in the Canadian wildnerness with what little he has in wits and supplies. He will later realize that his mother, despite his anger toward her for his parents' sudden and vicious divorce, saved his life when she gave him a rubber-handled hatchet just before his departure. It would prove to be one of two preeminant tools that kept him alive for a total of fifty-four days before he was rescued.I can remember reading this book back in elementary school but never really appreciating the story. I am so glad I revisited this tale, for now I truly appreciate the power of the story and the power of Brian's will to survive. During his nearly two-month exile, Brian is subjected to the unmerciful climate, swarms of bloodthirsty mosquitos, dangerous wildlife (moose, black bears) and truly WORKING for his meals. In the process of his survival, he becomes incredibly innovative and learns how to trap swarms of fish at a time for easy meals. He quickly tires of fish and soon moves on to bigger game, figuring out how to trap and kill native grouse through trial and error. Paulsen even has Brian dying a metaphorical death and being reborn, the rigmarole of everyday tasks in order to survive creating in Brian a champion and expert in the hunter-gatherer sense.Most important was Brian's power of positive thinking, a thing drilled into him from a former English teacher named Perpich. As he assesses everything in his possession that he can use toward things like trapping/hunting and shelter, another mantra from Perpich enters his head, that second of his two tools that would ultimately keep him alive: \\"You are your most valuable asset. Don't forget that. You are the most valuable thing you have.\\" (pg. 51)Much of how Brian adapts and excels at his primitive way of life can remind one of the 2000 film \\"Castaway\\" in which the marooned Chuck Noland (played by Tom Hanks) at first clumsily and not without many mistakes learns to survive on his own; by the end he is extremely resourceful, expertly spearing fish, building a raft and making fires with the greatest of ease.Bottom line: \\"Hatchet\\" is a classic coming-of-age tale that teaches perseverence, the power of mind over matter and the irrepressibility of the human spirit. I hope that this book is a part of schools's curriculums for many years to come and I certainly plan to share this story with my children as they come of age."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Of course, like many of the reviewers, I had to read this for school. And it has turned out to be one of my most favorite books of all times! I LOVE this book!If you do not like wilderness, don't read itIf you do not like very vivid detail and description, don't read itIf you do not like to believe that a child at the age of 13-14 could survive on their own, don't read it.......I've read almost all of the 1 star reviews and a lot sound like they came from really immature people, or people who don't like really good descriptions of things (ie the repitition in the book)I for one really appreciated the detail that Gary put into the book.

Also, the boy attempts suicide.My only complaint is that the main character, Brian, is a bit too...what...emotional? The writing is stream-of-consciousness and Brian is afraid of a lot, e.g. bird guts, dead people, he can't quite say \\"threw up\\" - has to say \\"got sick\\"...He comes across as delicate, but he isn't - he survives again and again.

Gary Paulsen gets into a rather decent part in the book and seems to get tired of writing then ends extremely abruptly. He never touched back on the secret between his divorced parents. Gary Paulsen is a great writer, but ending a book is not really his thing. Hatchet is great in detail, and has a surprising plot, but it does not have very many characters, and good information on the main character.

He finds himself fighting for his life in the Canadian wilderness. Brian is faced with many difficulties and surprises.I found his book very exiting and interesting. I felt I really got to know Brian as if I were a creature watching him or was in his head. I could see, feel, taste, hear, and smell everything that he could. Gary Paulsen can think of quite a wild idea and turn it into an amazing novel.In my opinion this book would be a story for, probably, 8+. It's an amazing book but there are some scenes that describe intense pain and some pretty mean animals. I recommend this book for anyone who loves adventure and survival."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen, is a survival book that I would recommend for ages 8 and up because some parts of the book can get a little gory. The main character of the book is Brian Robeson, an average kid with divorced parents and a secret. I would describe the plot as fast paced, exciting, mind blowing and surprising. Most of the setting of the book takes place in the Canadian wilderness.In my opinion, the conclusion of the book starts out very interesting and detailed. Gary Paulsen unexpectedly ends the book, in my opinion. This is a great book for everybody, especially if you love action and detail. I think what is unique about the book is the author's writing style and point of view. They're like a cross between a journal entry and a narrator. Over all, I thought Hatchet was a good book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book was so good, and it has taught me about being thankful for what I have now.

Or he could have meet a friend in the woods. So my conclusion is this the worst and boring book, and I will not tell a friend."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Gary Paulsen's Hatchet is easily one of the worst books I have ever read. Paulsen's style and diction merit a children's book. There is no depth, meaning, complexity, et cetera. The main thing which people who actually like this abomination cling to is Paulsen's ability to make it seem real; Of all the things one could claim, that is one of the most outrageous. This book does not convey any sense of reality at all, it merely explains the main character's illogical or simplistic actions, shallow thoughts, unrealistic emotions, and naive reactions - and moreover it does this sans any insight or purpose. Perhaps this book would be alright for kindergarteners or first-graders; beyond that, I would highly discourage anyone from even giving this book a second glance."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book wouldn't be so bad if it didn't take so long to get into the action.(Other than the plane crash.)If you don't mind waiting you might like it.

THIS IS THE WORST BOOK ON THE MARKET!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"People that praise this book obviously are those that would happily laze about in the field with the other sheep believing if it got an award it must mean it's good.1) Why introduce a Madonna Complex story line that is above the level of the age group you are targeting? It is not necessary to the plot or supposed ultimate lessons since only as an afterthought instead of conflict resolution we get a sentence that basically is apathy. Mom is a adulteress, Brian caught her, Brian is angry and is felt trapped in his guilt over the anger and rage at Mom cut his family apart just like the hatchet cuts the wood. Do we delve into the child becoming a man and learning that even Moms can do horrible things that shake our world? Umm no. Do we resolve and tie into the \\"lessons\\" Brian learns that he is responsible for his actions and mistakes can lead to his physical death and how that could tie in to confronting his Mother about her wrong doing and how her \\"secret\\" is something can destroy but yet she still refuses to take responsibility? Umm no. The main person in this story that needed to grow up and learn about responsibility and looking at how your actions can hurt you and others is Mommy dearest but she only get the conflict moments and not resolution. Did Paulson just get bored? Or did he see oh look got enough pages let me just say he didn't say anything okay yeah lets leave it with secrets are good yeah yeah that's a great life lesson for kids moving into middle school with all the issues they will face there. Yeah you people doing things immoral or illegal yeah suck it up move on whatever you could get trampled by a Moose..2) Does Paulsen think kids are complete morons? I mean why not pull out the Madden play by play drawing board? Foreshadowing?? No this is \\"hello stupid kid that your teachers and parents are utter mindless sheep and make me lots of money forcing you to read this brain death inducing drivel so here is the play by play you are too dumb to follow along or make presumptions and I want to get back to my boat.\\"When I looked up this book as my son's teacher is requiring it for one of the class read along books I threw up a little in my mouth at the mind numbingly simpleton vernacular. Then we have the whole Mommy is a hooch but I will not have that actually have an arch or be meaningful in any way other than to let Paulson I guess say his Mom was a bad person I don't know did he even map the thing out?Attempted suicide definitely see where this is something that to me should be talked about with the parents so that they can get off their \\"duh whatever your teacher seezzz\\" butts and be there to walk through these section and talk about it with their children and could have a purpose and be a important discussion point but as with every other learning growth or movement point in the book you speed through it and it is a poof of whatever..Basically this is garbage it has an award big woop I have a bag of trash I can plop an award on it for you. Parents REALLY start reading what is being given to your kids this kind of drivel is just making kids hate reading and sucking out their brains. I sent my kid to school with Life of Pi which he read in 3 days and told her to use that as her class \\"coming of age in a boy vs. nature\\" story. I doubt there are preprinted tests so she would actually have to read it and know what she is forcing kids to read though."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"My son needed this book for school.

I had already done this once before and received a beautiful perfect condition old library book so I figured I do it again. Mistake. This book turned out to be a very old copy. None of the pages matched up with the newer edition. In a panic the other night I ended up buying the book on my Ipad because I needed to find vocabulary words on specific pages. Bottom line, I tried to save money and it ended up costing more than just buying a normal new book.

It was also fun to watch him eat the wrong berries and throw up, then he drank too much lake water and then he threw up again.Over all i liked this book and i would read it more than the 2 times that i read it. I would recomend this book to a bot more so than a girl and i would recomend this to a person who likes reading adventurous books.I think that you should read this and recomend it to friends"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet by Gary PaulsenDo you like to read adventure/action books? Well, you're in luck because the book I'm discussing is an adventure/action book. It is Hatchet by Gary Paulsen and I thought that it was a wonderful book.One reason why I liked reading this book is the adventure packed setting. The setting takes place in the wilderness, and non-stop action occurs in every chapter. For example, in chapter two the pilot experiences a heart attack while flying his plane.Another reason why I liked this book is because the author included his own real life experiences in his writing. He spent time in the wilderness, and this is evident in the story. In my opinion, only a really creative person could write about being stuck in the wilderness!Finally, I thought the book was interesting. I kept wondering what would happen next every time I read a page. I found it very exciting when the plain crashed. What was Brian going to do? I think it was very interesting how the author Gary Paulsen experienced this too.As you can see I really liked this book and if you read it, you will hopefully like it too. Gary Paulsen is a great author who seems to like adventure and exciting life experiences."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is one of the best I have ever read in my life. I really liked the heart pumping on how he survived in the woods only using the resources he had. I mean a 13 year old kid nothing to lose only his hope and then boom!! His plane came crashing down. I will say that the theme is to never give up hope even if you feel hopeless. I think he wrote \`Hatchet' because he has done a lot of survivor stunts. Whoever likes reading adventure books this one is the right one for you. It's one of the best books he has ever written."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet by Gary Paulsen is the story of a 13 year-old boy, Brian Robison, surviving alone in the Canadian Wilderness. Brian is the only passenger in a small plane on a trip to visit his father who is recently divorced from his mother. The pilot of the plane has a heart attack and dies while the plane crashes into a small lake. Brian survives and swims to shore with only his clothes and a hatchet that was given to him by his mother as a present. Brian survives hordes of mosquitoes on the beach, and, later on in the story, a moose attack. He uses his hatchet to help him survive by using it to help start a fire, hunt for food, and to make his shelter. He also realizes that there is a survival kit in the fuselage of the plane; he almost loses his hatchet while attempting to retrieve the kit.Although Brian grows in character development so he can survive, the sub-plot of Brian's preoccupation with his parents divorce detracts from the main story. Additionally, the family's \\"dirty secret\\" (his mom was seen kissing another man) also preoccupies Paulsen and detracts from a good survival an adventure story."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is about a boy named Brian Robeson. He went down in a plane crash after the pilot had a heart attack. Brian was heading to Canada to see his father because his parents split up. All Brian had when he crashed was his hatchet, which was a gift from his mother. Brian made a shelter under a huge boulder beside the lake. One night a porcupine came into his hut and stuck him with his tail. Brian decided to make a door to keep the animals out, and a fire to keep him warm. Brian used his hatchet to make sparks to start a fire. Brian needed food so he made a bow and a spear to hunt fish and rabbits to eat. One day Brian was down by the lake when a moose attacked him, and in the same night a tornado tore down his hut. His bow and spear where also broken by the tornado. The tornado also pulled the tail of plane out of the water. Brian remembered the survival pack in the plane so he cut open a hole inside of the plane and retrieved to survival pack. The pack had food, fishing hooks, knife, sleeping bag, and other helpful things. The next day Brian heard a strange noise heading towards him so you have to read the book to find out what it is.I thought the book was very good because it was exciting and adventurous. I would recommend this book to people who like adventures or just like a good book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian Robeson, a 13-year-old boy suffering from his parents' divorce, is the only passenger in a bushplane. After the pilot has a heart attack and dies, Brian maneuvers the plane until it crashes in a lake. Brian survives the crash and all he has is a hatchet attached to his belt. In pain and hunger, Brian manages to build a shelter, find turtle eggs, build a fire, and make an arrow and a bow. He learns quickly what berries he can eat and what is the best way to catch a fish or a fool bird. He is determined to use his courage, intelligence, knowledge, and patience to make life in the wilderness possible, although once he felt into despair and wanted to commit suicide. Then a tornado brings his plane to the surface of the lake. Using the hatchet, Brian gets into the plane and retrieves the survival pack. After turning on the emergency transmitter in the survival pack, Brian is rescued on his 54th day in the wilderness.Paulsen's story attracts readers with good pace, suspense, and realistic details. Paulsen successfully shows readers how Brian learns through trial and error. He always watches, listens, thinks, and learns from his mistakes. Brian's preoccupation with his parents' divorce and his mother's secret affects him like an emotional wound. However, as a result of his survival experience, Brian sees life in a different perspective and becomes more mature. Although this story aims at young adult readers, it is also valuable to children and adults. After reading this story, I come to be thankful for all I have. The story also helps me realize that in order to succeed, I must overcome despair, prepare to learn from mistakes, and be determined to achieve my goals patiently.I highly recommend this book to young adults because it helps them realize that they are their most valuable assets and that they should be positive in all circumstances."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is about a boy who goes to visit family but on the way he gets into a plane accident and is forced to survive in the wilderness. He learns the true meaning of hunger and he learns valuable lessons here. He also has a strong urge to survive. This is by far on of the greatest survival books of all time. Through this brutal adventure he learns from mother nature and faces the horrid reality of isolation. You should definatly read it. You won't regret. It is very cleaver how the author uses incidents from his own life and develops a character."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"There is something lacking in Paulsen's style. There was no distinguishable climax, and plot structure was no where to be seen. There was sometihng unrealistic about Brian's survival attempts. It was as if the book droned on for ever, and the end was no where in sight. Things that should have been summarized and made shorter took up pages; things that should have been packed with detail, description, and emphasis took a matter of sentences.

His plane crashes into the Canadian wilderness en route to stay with his father for the summer with a hatchet as his only asset.That's the setup, at least. Brian quickly moves from teenager to existential hero, however, and the story ends up being an allegory for how Paulson believes individuals should deal with their emotions and cope with difficult situations. The problem with this is that wilderness survival skills do not translate well to dealing with complicated emotional problems like divorce. The book comes across as Paulson's wish fulfillment of how he'd prefer teenagers to behave, as opposed to giving teenagers tools to cope within the context of how they actually behave.I found the book well written and a good page-turner. I was only disappointed by the ending (which brushes off having to deal with the central conflict with a nifty little narrative summary). However, though written well, I found its central message disturbing and even destructive. I think it is probably every man's fantasy to be stuck out in the wilderness, left to his own devices, and to see if he can survive. The story from that angle was enjoyable. But to extrapolate that to an ideology is unhelpful, particularly for a teenage male who is actually trying to survive an emotional crisis.&lt;a href=\\"http://www.engenuous.com/blogs/jason/2006/08/book-review-hatchet-gary-pauslon-i.cfm\\">Read full review&lt;/a>"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Nicholas TarriconeEnglish period 6Hatchet is an incredible book. Gary Paulsen wrote the book in a way so you would want to read more. The book Hatchet is a survival story of thirteen year-old Brian Robeson. Brian Robeson was visiting his father up near the Canadian wilderness. During the trip, the pilot had a heart attack. Eventually the plane crashes into an L shaped lake. Now Brian must survive with what he has with him.Brian's parents are divorced which is why he was traveling to visit his father in the first place. Brian's parents were divorced because of a secret that Brian found out. Ever since then the secret has been tearing Brian apart. Before Brian left, his mother gave him a present. The present was a hatchet, and a belt to carry the hatchet. Brian must now survive on his greatest tool, the hatchet.I had a few likes and dislikes about the book. I liked the book because it was a survival story of what Brian encountered in the forest. He overcame many challenges such as finding food, living in the forest, and scaring away animals. I disliked the last chapter because he finds something that could have helped him throughout the entire book. That item could have made living in the forest a lot easier. I liked how the book kept the reader's interest by having interesting things happen to him. It was interesting how he tried to make fire. There was no dry wood and he had nothing that would help make a spark.The book Hatchet is like a television show on the Discovery Channel. The show is named \\"I Shouldn't Be Alive\\". The show is about people who get stranded in uninhabited places. Some of these places are islands, in the middle of the oceans, and forests. The show tells how the people get stranded in these places and how they survive. Some people have their planes crash, or their boats sunk. The book Hatchet is like a book version of the show."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is probably one of the best books I've ever read. I spent about 2 days reading it. While many reviews say that it stinks, it's really good! Brian, the main character, is struggling with his parents' divorce and the Secret. While Brian's traveling in a plane alone to his father living in Canada, the pilot has a heart attack and dies. Brian survives the plane crash into a lake. He finds shelter and food and survives for several months while hoping someone finds him and returns him back to civilization. While he lives in the wilderness Brian's personality changes from a city slicker to a survivor. This book is a good read for anyone who loves survival books or just wants to have a little joy in their life."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Lost. Gone.

He eats everything from \\"gut cherries\\" to \\"foolbirds.\\" His home gets torn down by animals and wind. He is attacked by porcupines, skunks, and even a moose.I thought this book was very good. I thought Gary Paulsen did a very good job including detail. I guess that's why it was awarded the Newbery Award. This is a perfect book for boys in their early teens. It was one of the best books I've ever read. A must-buy for sure."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I had not yet read this classic tale, but, upon the recommendation of a friend, although I am 36 and a college graduate, I bought it. This is a great story, hence the reason for 20th anniversary reissue. But, I can say, the hardcover edition with new drawings by Drew Willis and accompanying notes by the author add so much. One of my favorite things about this book is the author's notes, 20 years after its surprise success, with some truly great pencil drawings. Anyone who is looking at buying this book would do well to buy this particular edition."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is an outstanding book centered around a young boy at the age of 13 named Brian Robeson. His mom had given a gift to Brian on his way to the airport that saves his life. It was a hatchet. He was stranded in the forests of Canada after he had made a crash landing when the pilot died of a heart attack and fell shaking to the floor. He knew he had crashed way off course and he realized that all hope was lost for survival as soon as he watched the plane sink to the lake bottom. He was faced with one of the biggest fears of all, hunger. He also was all bruised up after he had flown through the window of the cockpit. He was forced to drink nothing but the surrounding lake water. Brian encounters many animals on his journey of survival including an enormous black bear. With only a hatchet, he builds a sturdy shelter and weapons to defend himself such as a bow and arrow and spears. He even made traps for food such as fish. He made fire that protected him at night from animals, allowed him to cook meat and fish, and kept him warm. I would definitely recommend this book to everyone who enjoys reading or needs a book for school. I could picture everything in my head from the crash to his rescue. The book is so realistic, I never put it down. Gary Paulson kept the excitement going through out the novel with many surprises. And Brian was such a well-described character. He was smart, brave, and realistic. He wasn't strong so he used his brain to overcome many obstacles. The part that I had enjoyed the most was when Brian encountered a moose that hit him three times before leaving."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This amazing book was really good! It's about a young 13 year old boy who gets in a severe plane crash, so he has to live in the dangerous wilderness alone. I recommend this book to people who enjoy adventure books."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This is about the book by Gary Paulsen, Hatchet. Brian was on his way to see his divorced father up in the Canadian Mountains. All the while he thinks about how the divorce came about. The &quot;secret&quot;, the other man in his mom's life. He is filled with anger and hate. The book is about a 13-year-old boy who is in a plane crash and needs to survive in the wild. All though the pilot doesn't survive, Brian, the boy, survives the crash. He builds a house and figure out how to make fire. His hatchet is the key to his survival. The novel Hatchet explains how he survives and gets food. He encounters wild animals and has a hard time fighting the mosquitoes. He always relates to movies and how the people in the movies would have done everything to survive in the wild. He thinks about how people in the movies got rescued within two or three days. Brian is full of hope to be rescued. READ THE BOOK TO FIND OUT THE REST!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian is a survivor. I don't think I could have survived that long. His courage, determination, and lack of self-pity is a good example for not only the students reading this book, but for the adults as well. Some of the things he had to face (such as a bear) gave me a fright - and I was merely reading it from a book!This book took place outside in the wilderness. It is a book of survival. Brian had to survive the plane (he had to figure out how to land it); he had to survive the wilderness for about two months; and he also has to figure out how to survive his parents' divorce. Perhaps his parents' divorce is a much harder thing to get through than the plane-landing or the wilderness adventure.Gary Paulsen is a marvelous author. Everything I have read by him - both adult and teen - is remarkable."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I read this book when I was in high school and loved it. I couldn't put it down. It was by far the greatest book I ever read. Back then I didn't read so much.I recently reread this book. It's definitely not as good as I remember. First of all, Gary Paulsen's writing style now drives me crazy. In my English classes through high school and college, I'd get marked down for repeating myself. Gary Paulsen makes an art out of repetition.\\"He was alone. In the roaring plane with no pilot he was alone. Alone.\\" Ok I get it, he's alone.\\"And then he knew. Brian Knew... Brian knew now.\\" Great, I know, you know, we all know that Brian now knows. It's almost as if Gary Paulsen wanted a bit of poetic flow in the story, but it came out as repetitious phlegm which nearly choked the storyline. At least for me.Other than that, the book is fairly realistic. Perhaps with age I've become more skeptical. I don't understand why Brian can't make contact with anyone via the radio. And why no one could locate Brian in the vast Canadian wilderness - even though the book never says that the pilot in his death throws threw the plane drastically off course. And the pilot would have had to have made a flight plan prior to the flight. But this would defeat the purpose of the book.For a crash victim, he has it made. For one, he has the hatchet. For two, he has a perfect rock overhang to make a perfect shelter for himself because apparently a tree and\\\\or a lean-to just isn't good enough. For three, just when the story appears to be going nowhere, a wily Canadian tornado spins straight out of fiction and saves the day. If only I was making that up. Apparently, a random tornado is the only idea the author could come up with to bring the plane (and the rescue equipment) to the surface. A tornado that can lift a plane off the bottom of a lake, but yet can't pull Brian out of his shelter seems just a bit far-fetched. I've been unable to continue on past this part.Overall though, this book did get awards for a reason. It is a good book.It's a really good book, with some really annoying, annoying, Flaws. Flaws that are annoying. Flaws. But if you can overcome the repetitive nature of Gary Paulsen's writing style like I can't, you will enjoy the book even more."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"After reading HATCHET, I can understand why it received mixed reviews.I think Paulsen should have started the story with Brian's life in the city, showing how much of a city boy he was with his only understanding of the world around him comming from TV and movies. In that way the reader would have had at least some true sympathy for him. As it was, I thought Brian was a total dim-wit for not knowing the basics of anything. I agree with one of the reviewers -- I was also rooting for the moose.I think Paulsen did not need to have Brian be privy to his mother's infidelity. Paulsen could have built sorrow over his parent's divorce in other ways.I did not appreciate Paulsen having Brian cutting himself with his hatchet during a moment of despair. There are more than enough juvenile suicides going around. Paulsen could have told of and shown Brian's despair in many ways other than attempted suicide.Finally, the novel was more of a diary/documentary than it was a fictional story. But it is next to impossible to have dialog and interactions when there is only one character.I would have liked Paulsen to continue the story after Brian found the emergency supplies. I think Paulsen ended the story too abruptly.All in all, HATCHET was okay. I just can't see it as a 5 or receiving all the awards."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"\\"As I walk slower and pick up my bow I can feel something breathing on my back.\\" These thoughts go through Brian's mind in the book Hatchet by Gary Paulsen as he tries to survive in the wilderness.

Gary Paulsen's vivid language allows readers to feel as though they are with Brian on his adventure in the wilderness. Brian is a very realistic character that struggles in nature in the same way that any teenager would when abandoned in the woods alone. His resourcefulness and intelligent ideas help him to survive the very grimmest of circumstances. This story is told in the third person.

Hatchet is a very descriptive book. This book is about a boy who went on a trip in a pilot plane and crash landed into a lake. Brian is in the wild for almost a year.

This book should be on everybody's bookshelf with other books on surviving.In the beggining of the book Brian is going to his dad's house because their parents got divorced a couple of months ago. Before the flight his mother gives him a hatchet to put on his belt and if his dad makes him go and chop wood or something like that. After he has been flying for a hour or two the pilot ask how he is doing and shows him how to fly the plane . After that the pilot lets Brian fly the plane for a couple of minutes. Then they don't talk for a hour and then the pilot starts making weird noises and starts letting out awful smells. Brian doesn't say anything about it. Then the pilot screams and grabs his chest.

Well brain was but he didn't have any way of contacting anyone either. Do you like exciting survival stories? That's what The Hatchet is. If you do, you will like The Hatchet by Gary Paulsen. It's a great survival story about a boy. He has to learn how to live off the land and find food and shelter on his won. Find out what happens to a boy that lives on his own in the wilderness.Crash boom that's when Brain's plane crashes in the middle of nowhere. His pilot has a heart attack and the plane crashes.

Brain has no way to contact anyone anywhere. He has to find food, water and shelter on his own out in the wild. Find out what problems that happen to Brain and if he gets rescued.I liked the book and thought it was very interesting. But there were a few parts of it I didn't like. Some of the parts were nasty and gross. But otherwise it was a really good book. This book gives you some tips if your plane ever crashes in the middle of nowhere.If you like survival stories, you will like The Hatchet. When you are in about middle school you will probably like it best. It is a good book for boys and girls. The Hatchet has a sequel. It's called The River. It is about what happened to Brian in the winter.Well then this is the book for you if you liked the things I said about it. Even if you don't like reading that much you will get into it and like it. I didn't like reading and I liked this. So when have you been in the wilderness alone?"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I recommend this book to whoever likes survival and adventure books. Another reason is that it has great suspense and action. When the pilot had the heart attack, no one knew what was going to happen next. When the narrator said, \\" The pilot stopped jerking, his legs contracted up into the seat and his eyes rolled back until the whites in his eyes were showing\\". This part of the book gave a suspense that time just stopped because Brian is stuck with a dead pilot and is still in the air. Brian doesn't know how to fly a plane but manages. When Brian eats a raw turtle egg that he finds in the sand, this shows his fight to survive. He is going to survive any way possible. He has to do some brave things like pulling out porcupine quills out of his leg. \\"He grasped one of the quills, held his breath, and jerked.\\" That was brave because they were deep and the pain would so bad that someone could go into shock. I think that the adventure that Brian has is very well put in the book. Everything that happens to him and everything that he does is exciting in some way. So if you want to read a book that has lots of adventure and action in it this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"HatchetBy Gary PaulsenIn the novel Hatchet by Gary Paulsen tells about the survival situation and the thirteen years old boy, named Brian. Brian was going to Canada to visit his father during the summer vocation when the plane crashed in the wilderness. Brian spent a lot of time in wilderness without any help just his mind. In the wilderness, Brian learned how to live by himself, by using survival skills. The most important thing, which Brian had with him, was the hatchet, which his mother gave to him. This hatchet helped Brian do a lot of important things to survive in the wilderness.When Brian woke up from the plane crash, he was afraid and did not know what to eat how to stay alive. At first Brain made a lot of mistakes, because he did not know any animals and what kind of plants he can eat. Brian saw several wild animals such as: porcupine, skunk, turtle, moose, and bear. After some time, which Brian spent in the wilderness he knew already what was safe for him to eat and how he needed to behave with wild animals.Brian first days were horrible. He was afraid of everything and did not know what to do. Brian knew some things about the wilderness and what to do there, but then, when he was alone, he forgot everything. Brian made mistakes at first, however he learned from his mistakes a lot of useful things, which helped Brian to be safe in the wilderness.Time passed, Brian grew smarter with each day and knew more new things. After that time, which he spent in the wilderness Brian changed a lot. He was becoming more independent and could survive by himself. He was a young boy, who I think was brave, because he tried to do something new all the time and did not give up.I liked the novel Hatchet. It was somehow different from other novels, which I had read before. I liked the book, because it was written about the real life, not like science fiction. You can learn a lot of useful things from this story, and if you were in the same situation, this book Hatchet could help you to survive. So it is useful to read. I like the author of this novel, because he writes about events that could actually happen. In the rating scale one through five I would rate this novel a five. I would recommend to read the novel to other students and adults too.The novel Hatchet was about the young thirteen years old boy, who was going to visit his father during the summer break and crashed in the wilderness. This event was the most important in Brian's life. He changed inside and also outside, he became independent and could live by himself. Before those two months, which Brian spent in the wilderness he was just little mother's boy, but now Brian became smarter and had more knowledge. This event gave him a lot of good experiences, which helped him to be independent."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book has lots of action packed into one person. I enjoy reading it and I will recommend it for all book readers. Brian, the main character, crashes in the middle of the forest with no food.

In the middle the book is somewhat boring."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is good for your reading.Also I liked this book because is sad.Because the kid lose his parents.For me this book is nice and good for my reading."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is good for your reading.Also I liked this book because is sad.Because the kid lose his parents.For me this book is nice and good for my reading."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book was very cool i'ts about a 13 year old boy that had.A plane crash in the Canadian oil fields.A needs to sirvive untill rescue comes."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"when i started reading hatchet i knew i was going to like it.

The book is about a boy, Brian, who crashes in a plane. The pilot is dead, so Brian is stranded in the wilderness with his only possession, a hatchet. The genre of the book is survival. A person who would like this book is someone who would like a good adventure or survival story. In the course of my author's life, he has written several fabulous novels. One is The Winter Room, another is Hatchet, or Brian's Winter. Those are only a few. When he wrote these books, he lived in New Mexico. One reason why readers would like this book is it is a book action, adventure story. A really good scene in this book is when the plane is crashing.

Porter - 13 year old student.This book is about a 13 year old kid named Brian. Since Brian's parents are divorced, he was riding on a plane to visit his dad for the summer. Brian rode in a tiny plane with a pilot who was about 40 years old. During the flight, the pilot had a heart attack and died. Brian was in charge of the plane after the pilot died but he didn't have a pilot's license. Brian was very scared because he hardly knew how to drive a plane. He thought he was going to die. The plane then crash landed into a lake. Brian was able to swim a long distance to reach the shore. By the time he reached the shore, he was aching with horrible pains due to the plane crash. The shore was located in the middle of Canada. All around him was a forest with lots and lots of trees. The forest had terrible bugs that Brian had to endure. It was also cold and he did not have any food either. He was so hungry that all he could think about was eating a chocolate malt and a hamburger. Brian knew he had to find a place to sleep even before he found food. After finding a safe place surrounded by rocks, he searched and searched a long time for food. Finally he found bitter tasting berries. He ate the whole berry pit and all. Then he used his torn up wind breaker to carry the berries back to where he set up camp. Another source of food that Brian ate were snapping turtle eggs. Some other animals tried to eat the eggs so he had to shoo them away. Brian had to survive very harsh things. He had to be a very resourceful to survive in the wilderness. For example, he made a bow in order to fish and hunt rabbits. Brian also needed to find a way to make a fire. He knew a fire would keep him warm, cook his food and also keep the bugs away. To start the fire he hit his hatchet against a stone to make a spark. The spark then lit wood shavings he had carved which started a fire. Even though Brian had been very resourceful in the wilderness, he knew he needed the surival kit that was on board the crashed plane. He decided to make a raft and take his hatchet out with him. He dropped his hatchet into the water on his way out to the plane but luckily he was able to recover it. He was extremelly joyful that he was able to get the survival kit. This made his life in the wilderness much easier. Through this extremely difficult time, Brian was able to do so much more than he thought he could. This is a very well written book and I highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"this book is about a boy named brian robeson whose parents are divorced. he is on his way to see his father on a single engine plane . the pilot has a heart attack and his plane goes down somewhere in the canadian wilderness and brian has to survive by himself with only the hatch et his mother gave him to survive.,i think this boook was good and kept me interested throught the whole book"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"this book was about a boy named brian robeson..he was on a single engin plane going to see his father when the pilot had a heart attack.,his plane went down somewhere in the canadian wilderness the only weapn he has is the hatchet is mather gave to him as a presant"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"this book was about a boy named brian robeson..he was on a single engin plane going to see his father when the pilot had a heart attack.,his plane went down somewhere in the canadian wilderness the only weapn he has is the hatchet is mather gave to him as a presant"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This review is made by an 11 year old girl.The main character, Brian goes through many different conflicts in Hatchet. Its amazing how this 13- year old boy survives living in a forest for about two months. In the book Hatchet, Brian experiences a pilot dying, a plane crash, no food, no water, and a fight for survival. Right when he hears a search plane, he thought he would be saved. Unfortunately, that didn't happen. The plane turned around and Brian was stuck there. Right when things were going well, a mini tornado comes. Brian's camp site was all over the place. If you think you have problems, wait until you see how many Brian has!In the beginning of the book Brian rides in a plane to go see his dad. On the trip there, one big problem comes along. The pilot gets a lot of aches in his body. Then, sadly he dies. Brian is so confused. He doesn't know what to do. He doesn't know how to drive a plane! His only solution is to do his best job by landing it. He finds a clear path and try's to land it. Brian thought he was doing a pretty good job landing the plane, until it hit the water and some trees. The plane sunk into the water while Brian was struggling to get out. Finally he gets a way out. \\"pgs. 32-34\\"When Brian finally gets everything he needs to survive in the wilderness, a mini tornado comes Brians way. Brian's camp site got blown away. All the wood from the fire was gone. Everything he used to survive was gone. Luckily he got his hatchet before it could blow away. After the tornado Brian immediately started creating a new camp site. He found interesting planks of wood that he could use to cook his meat. He went on hikes searching for wood to burn. In no time Brian's camp site was back to normal. \\"Pgs. 155-160\\" During the tornado, Brian was very lucky he did not get hurt.Brian did a lot of good problem solving in Hatchet. When Brian needed something he quickly rushed into making something that could complete his task. Usually right away his tool did not do a thing. He studied what he was doing wrong and then he got it right. Overall Brian was a good problem solver.This book to me had some very boring parts to it and it did not come to my interest.

I love how real the story is and once I started it was hard for me to put down. The author is so descriptive with the things Brian is going through. At times I can fell like him in the shelter at sunset. Watching the sun fill the sky with colors. Also I felt it when Brian got the survival bag. I was looking forward to read what Brian was going to do with all that stuff. Well as Perpich said \\"You are your most valuable asset. Don't forget that. You are the best thing you have\\". I think that that is so true. Even though the hatchet saved Brian's life a few times I think he would have some how still lived without it. I know that it would have been much harder but I think he could have lived without it.I think that the theme of Hatchet is to be prepared for the worst. I agree with it 100% because there have been times when I though that things couldn't get any worst but they did.I would so recommend this book like I said it is a masterpiece. The book will bring you right in and time will fly by without you knowing it. It's like a vacuum! Also I would read it because Gary Paulsen is such a good author. I also read \\"The Car\\". Also another great book. But that's another story to tell."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"For these past two weeks, I have been reading the novel,Hatchet, written by Gary Paulsen. Thirteen year-old, Brian Robeson is a very couragic and inspirational character. His Hatchet, that his mother gaev him, also played a heroic role aswell. It ended up basically saving his own life. This novel struck my interests because I really enjoyed the way Brian never gave up: \\"Now I have some food and I can do something about fixing this plane up.\\"(page 64-65). Brian inspired me with his never-ending persistance.The theme of this novel is that humans, when lost or trapped in an environment like tundra, Canada, they will try their hardest and make the best fo the situation that they're in - whether they survive or not. I definately agree with this theme because I have been in situations like Brian's. My friend and I had gotten lost on a camping trip where the temperature there (New England)was ten - fiftheen degrees farenheit outside. Luckly, we found our way back to the campsite within a couple of hours - nothing though, like Brians experiance.I would easily recommend this novel to others; to anyone who enjoys this fction genre, or to those who would like ot learn survivol tactics adn a moral of life. The novel tells a tael of inspiration, couragic behavior, and the shear will to survive adn enjoy and respect life .

Good job Gary Paulson and keep writing those great books."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"...I think that everyone should read Hatchet, a spectacular novel by Gary Paulsen. The foremost reason why I think Hatchet is great is because of the way Paulsen describes all of Brian's situations. He describes them so well that it feels like you're in that situation yourself. Then after some situations you just have to take a little break because they were so real. The next reason why I adore Hatchet is because of how Paulsen puts himself into the story. Almost all of the things thatBrian went through in the book Paulsen had gone through during his life. For example, like Brian, Paulsen had to hunt to survive in the wilderness. My last and favorite reason why I enjoyed Hatchet is because of the way that Paulsen always left you guessing. In the story you would for sure think that something was going to happen, but then there was a sudden turn of events. Sometimes the turn of event would be good then other times bad. As you can tell, Gary Paulsen truly out did himself in the spectacular novel Hatchet."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet was a good book. I realy liked that book. When I was reading the book it made me feel like I was in the book. There was nothing I disliked in the book. The book taught me lots of suvival skills.In the book Hatchet, the best part of the book was the end. If I had to choose one part that I enjoyed the most, it would probably be when Brian got resqued. This was the most exciting part because Brian was out there so long. I wanted the book to end too.One of the most vivid parts of the book Hatchet was the setting. This was when Brian crashed the plane into the lake that was surrounded by land. He described it so well that I had to stop reading for a minute. The vivid conflict of this book was man against nature. Brian was faced with a lot of dangers by being stranded in the mountain. One example was when he got hit by a porcupine.

Although fictional,this is a real story about a real boy. Gary Paulsen takeshis knowledge of the wild obtained by his camping, kyaking,backpacking and such experiences and uses it to the fullestextent. Abstract and artistic, &quot;Hatchet&quot; is just amazing.Reader Beware: Do Not put the book down when Brian getsstranded. This is not a book where the hero &quot;just happens&quot;to have matches and a gun and a clean bubbling brook runningalongside the lean-to he made out of deerskin. I hate suchstories, and was pleasantly surprised that Brian had notbeen a boyscout. I felt as if he truly was a city boy throwninto the wilderness with no idea of it's dangers. He doesn'tfind delightful wild strawberries and when he comes face-to-face with a bear, a moose, and other such animals, he doesnot know how to handle it. On the first night, he suddenlyrealizes that he has no idea how to make a fire, and that thenature specials on PBS don't tell you all there is to knowabout the Canadian wilderness. As I read this book, I thoughtto myself, this is really what he would be thinking. I wouldreact the same way if I were in his shoes. Once again, GaryPaulsen has out done himself. Do yourself a favor- read thebook but do not see the movie. Hatchet has always been myfavorite book, and will be for many years to come."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"From the talented Minnesotan pen of Gary Paulsen comes a story that many a kid living today has been given to read at some point in his or her life. Paulsen is to many people the ideal \\"boy's\\" author. In the stereotypical view of what boys like, Paulsen hits all the right buttons. I don't know how true to life this reputation really is. I don't know any young boys and, if I did, I can't really guarantee they'd enjoy this book. Of course, I enjoyed this book. I enjoyed it very much. Would I have enjoyed this book if it has been crammed down my throat at an early and impressionable age? That's an open ended question, and I like to think that the answer is yes. This book is a lot of fun. In this era of \\"Survivor\\" like tv shows, we the American viewing public like to think we know a lot about survival. Bull hockey. We know jack squat and this book sums that point up beautifully. You're abandoned in the middle of nowhere with a single tool and you must somehow survive on your own in the wilderness. Now.... go. Brian does very well, but I couldn't help but think of Douglas Adams at times. After all, in Douglas Adams' final book in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series the protagonist is dumped on a planet without so much as a hatchet. He realizes that his only real talent is in making sandwiches (which he proceeds to do with great pomp and flair). By comparison (and a comparison is, quite frankly, not fair) \\"Hatchet\\" is a dour novel. This is not to say it isn't enjoyable. And most of Brian's adventures seem utterly believable (with the possible exception of the, goodness me, tornado in his back yard). And Brian himself is a good guy. He seems like a quiet fellow and his actions are utterly understandable from page one. I don't really see the point of \\"the secret\\" (nor can I understand those parents that find it so offensive in today's day and age) in the text. I suppose it's the whole learning-to-be-a-man stuff. Not my particular cup of tea. For those students that suddenly have to learn about \\"Man Vs. Nature\\" (or don't they teach that in schools anymore?) here is the ultimate in such tales. I'd pair it with Sacher's \\"Holes\\" for an interested compare and contrast session of personalities and making-do. On the whole, \\"Hatchet\\" is a great book, and I was surprised, considering its popularity, that it only received the Newberry honor. There is no accounting for taste."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"A riveting, can't-put-it-down story of a boy's survival in the Canadian wilderness for two months, after crash-landing a small plane when the pilot dies of a heart attack. Very well written, this could be a modern Robinson Crusoe story with a protagonist young enough for its target age to identify with. Brian shows courage, resolve, and creativity in facing the dangers and challenges of his situation, and the ending is quite satisfying.Unfortunately, a sub-plot of the story is that Brian's mother is having an affair, which has led to his parents' divorce. Before the divorce, Brian witnesses a scene he calls \\"the Secret,\\" which troubles him repeatedly: his mother kissing another man. This betrayal is not dealt with by forgiveness but rather repression, as Brian decides that crying \\"doesn't work\\" to help him survive. He instead focuses entirely on his physical survival, deciding that \\"food is all\\" (129). At the story's close his parents remain divorced, his mother continues her affair, and Brian never discloses \\"the Secret\\" to his father. This troubling element of the story might introduce suspicion and insecurity to vulnerable readers.Another troubling element is the way in which Brian rather mystically becomes part of the wild landscape. In an encounter with a wolf (121), the author writes that he was not afraid because he \\"knew the wolf for what it was -- another part of the woods, another part of all of it... He knew the wolf now, as the wolf knew him, and he nodded to it, nodded and smiled.\\" In another scene, unpacking a survival pack which he salvaged from the wrecked plane, he experiences uneasiness at holding a gun (186), because he feels it distances him from his surroundings: \\"Without the rifle he had to fit in, to be part of it all, to understand it and use it -- the woods, all of it. With the rifle, suddenly, he didn't have to know; did not have to be afraid or understand... The rifle changed him, the moment he picked it up, and he wasn't sure he liked the change.\\"These two scenes seem to reflect an ideal of human-animal equality, which denies the Biblical command to dominion and stewardship. The assumption is that for a human to really understand the natural world he must descend to the level of the animals. The exercise of power, by this way of thinking, necessarily introduces distance between humanity and the natural world. This ideal is in direct contradiction to the Biblical mandate for humans to care for the earth as its rulers, the crown of God's creation.Although it is memorably well-written, the sub-plot of parental infidelity and the unbiblical perspective on humanity's place in the created order make this a book I don't recommend."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This story might be about a young boy stranded in the wilderness, but it could apply to any neophyte in the same circumstances. It shows the perils that exist out there for the unexperienced, and the resourcesfulness and will to live of the human species. It's simply a good adventure story."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"When I read Hatchet I thought it was quite boring. The ending wasn't really good because Bryan kept looking and drooling at food. During this book, Bryan kept on saying he knew &quot;THE SECRET.&quot; He was always scared of things, so I thought he was a wimp. The book was way too short but it was easy to read. One good thing about the book is that it told you how to survive if you were stranded in the middle of nowhere. The author was Gary Paulsen and some of his books are good, but not this one. I wouldn't read this book if I were you. You will start the book, you'll hear &quot;THE SECRET,&quot; and after that you will put the the book down. Overall this book wasn't worth reading."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"--- WARNING: SPOILERS ---My 9 year old brought this book home and put it down because he felt it was boring at the start. I suspect (because he's a sensitive kid), he found the notion of divorce and the plane crash hard to read about before bed. So, I picked it up and read it in a few days. I enjoyed the book, but a couple events that occur to the main character are implausible:1. A tornado in the Canadian forest? Not likely. Perhaps the main character mistook high winds for a tornado, but the likelihood either would raise a plane out of the water isn't plausible.2.

Brian lives with his mother in New York State, and is allowed to stay with his father, who works in the Canadian oil fields, during the summer. This will be his first summer with his father, and Brian's mother sees him off at the airport, giving him a gift that he feels is a bit silly: a hatchet.Flying in the small plane takes some getting used to; it's very noisy, it's cramped, and at first the pilot doesn't talk very much. After a while, the pilot does begin to talk with Brian and even lets him take control of the plane for a bit. Then the absolute worst possible scenario occurs: the pilot has a massive heart attack and dies, leaving Brian at the controls of an aircraft that he really doesn't know how to fly.Brian survives the crash, and then realizes that the plane has flown so far off course that he probably won't be found any time soon. He now has to survive the Canadian wilderness. He's a kid, and he does wallow in self-pity, but not for long. Brian isn't a typical soft city kid. Somehow he's able to put together bits and pieces of things he's learned in school, and he's able to carve out a place for himself on the shore of a remote lake. He takes pride in each accomplishment, as well he should. But the longer he lived in his lakeside home, the more nervous I got. Summers don't last all that long in Canada.This was a captivating read, and I can understand why it was a Newbery Honor Book in 1988. Paulsen had me on the shore of that lake right at Brian's side. I was slapping mosquitoes and taking pride in Brian's level-headedness and ability to survive. If you're looking for a quick read that's well-written and puts you right in the middle of the action, Hatchet is an excellent choice.Gary Paulsen's life is as interesting as the books he's written.

My boy and I had many great discussions prompted by the question \\"what would YOU do if..\\" after the introduction of each new challenge in the adventure.I highly recommend this book. Especially to be read aloud to boys between 8 and 12."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Gary Paulsen, Hatchet (Aladdin, 1987)In the annals of survival kidlit, there are a few books that we always come back to. Twenty years ago, Gary Paulsen added Hatchet to the list, and it's a book that has cropped up again and again since on recommended reading lists alongside, or sometimes taking the place of, such stalwarts as Robb White's immortal Deathwatch. And I'm willing to admit that my thinking Hatchet doesn't hold up to Deathwatch could very well be because I first read Deathwatch as a fifth-grade reading assignment, and I didn't read Hatchet until I was forty. Who knows? One way or the other, though, while Hatchet is a very good book, I'm not sure it's the immortal classic that I've heard it made out to be many times.The plot is a simple one: Brian Robeson, the only survivor of a deep-woods plane crash, must survive until some chance plane flying overhead discovers him. He has some equipment with him, but most of it is buried in the plane, which is out in the middle of the lake, with all the access points underwater. All he has to work with are his clothes, the things he can find in the world around him, and the hatchet his mother gave him just before he left. How does a coddled city boy learn to survive, alone, in the wild?When your plot is this simple (and I have to say, it takes a writer with some stones to try and write an entire novel from a plot that simple), you have little choice but to focus on the other aspects of writing--character, description, theme (though god help the writer who replaces the Western prejudice towards plot with a similar reliance on theme, for he will almost certainly turn out unreadable dreck). This is one of the reasons that survival literature, that which survives the test of time anyway, is so great: the plot is always that simple, so the parts of novels that normally get short shrift, at least in this country, are forced to come to light. This is magnified in kidlit, which is, in general, so plot-heavy that the books that really work with character (The Giver, e.g.) are pretty much automatic classics. Hatchet is one of those books. Pretty much by default, survival lit is about its main character growing and changing, which makes it perfect for kidlit. Paulsen avoids one of the traps of this sort of thing by making Brian into a well-rounded character beforehand, rather than taking a two-dimensional character and making him into a three-dimensional one. Good choice.Still, from an action perspective (and action is another staple of survival novels, kidlit or otherwise), Hatchet doesn't work as well as other giants in the genre. Again, this comes from a gutsy decision on Paulsen's part; rather than giving Brian an antagonist, the bulk of the book is just Brian and the world around him. Interesting move, and effective to an extent, but the book does lag now and again. Not horribly; the pages keep turning well enough, and the character development here is enough of a reason to keep reading. It could've just used a kick in the seat now and again to get it moving a little faster.Darned good, but if you liked it, check out some of the other books in the genre and you may find you like them even better. ***"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This is a great book.

I was or with the main survivor the whole way through the ordeal and only at the end of he book after finding the plane with the survival bag and gear, all that will help him (and me) in the struggle is here, finally, and then BAM!, the emergency transmitter locates the boy and he's home.

This book not only deals with survival but also the emmotional aspects of the plane crash and Brian's parent's divorce. I like the fact that Gary Paulsen puts so much detail in this book.

Paulsen's writing is exceptional and leaves the reader feeling as though they are in the novel themselves.

I would recommend this book to anyone who likes other Paulsen novels- this one is a keeper!"},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Adventurous, exciting, and suspensful would all be words I would use to describe Gary Paulson's Hatchet. It is a non-stop book of a boy's adventures and will to survive in the Canadian wilderness. It shows the true heart of a thirteen-year-old boy, who has just suffered the divorce of his parents, is now faced with learning how to survive on his own. The only things he had were the clothes on his back and a hatchet that his mother had given him. This book is a fictional yet believeable chronicle of Brian Robeson's adventure of survival and his finding of his real self. The most memorible of Brian's adventure appears in the beginning of the book. Brain's parents' divorce forces him to visit his parents at different times of the year. The summer is the time for him to fly to see his father in Canada. He takes the trip in a small Cessna sky plane with two passengers, the pilot and himself. After several hours the pilot suffers a heartattack and the plane goes down. This marked the beginning of Brain's survival time. Paulson's discription of the plane, the accident and the setting leave a true picture of the events. Because of his style of writing I was able to invision everything in clear detail. Time and again as Brain was faced with a bear attack, finding food, and other obsticles, pictures and scenes from the book appeared vividly in my mind. I am not a true reading fan but I felt like i couldn't put this book down. It is a great story with a good plot and Paulsen's words and desciptions kept me reading. This book flows and keeps a constant push to read. It is one of the best books that I have read and I will be reading it again. I would recomend this book to anyone who loves adventure and suspense. It is a good book for both kids and adults, its easily understood and fun to read. It is an all around a good book and great for anyone."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I think Hachet is one of the best books i've ever read and i've read a few books.

Well neither did Brian Robinson but it happened to him. Imagine having no electricity and not being able to eat anything but fish, berries, birds and turtle eggs, you would probably freak out, I know I would. Well this is what happens in Gary Paulsen's suspenseful book Hatchet.Hatchet is about a city boy named Brian Robinson. Brian's great adventure starts when he's on his way to his dad's house for the summer because his parents broke up. On the way there the pilot has a heart attack and dies so Brian takes the wheel and crash lands and miraculously lives. So Brian has to make shelter and hunt or gather for food. While he's living in the wilderness Brian meets some unwelcome guests. Brian gets to meet thousands of mosquitoes, a skunk, a fox and a moose.There are many exiting parts in Hatchet but here is one you'll never forget. One day Brian turned around and a gigantic moose was charging full speed at him and it hit him so far he landed in the lake. But the moose didn't stop there it kept hitting him again and again. So for the next two weeks Brian was in bad pain.The main theme of Hatchet is loneliness. Loneliness best fits Hatchet because for pretty much the entire book Brian is all alone in the wilderness.I would rate this book a nine out of ten because there was only about two boring parts but the rest of the book was very exiting. So if you love the wilderness, like me, read Hatchet."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The Hatchet is a great book. This book is for people who crave adventure.

It has won the Newbery Honor Award. This is fictional book.

Later, Brian is taking a plane to visit his father when the pilot dies from a heart attack and a crash landing is being prepared. It was perfect and Brian just made it to the surface and survived. As he is stuck in the wilderness he creates tools to catch food and help him survive. As he is there many unsuspected dangers occur out of nowhere. Not all of the dangers are life threatening but have the power to harm him. Will Brian ever get out of the forest and back home?The way Gary Paulson puts the marvelous words he comes up with and the way he uses his words makes this book flow like a fish swimming in the ocean. After you have started the book you can't put it down because it is to good. He shows, not tells, you how you would feel an act if you were in Brian's position.Gary Paulson is one of my favorite authors because in all of his books he is able to drag you into the story by putting fantastic description and marvelous use of words in the story.

How will he survive? Read the book Hatchet to find out. This is a story of adventure and survival that I can guarantee most people will love.In Hatchet, Gary Paulsen is very descriptive and gives a lot of detail. He used lots of description of the forest where Brian crashed near. It sounded very nice. Another time Gary Paulsen used great detail was when Brian made his first shelter and when he added to it. Brian added weeds to hold everything together and he added the other walls to his shelter. Gary Paulsen used lots of detail when describing Brian throughout the adventure.Gary Paulsen made all of the character and animals sound great. He made Brian sound awesome and brave in the clutches of death. He also made the wolf sound unbelievable. Also he made the birds seem very colorful and like a moving rainbow with wings.I truly liked this book. It had lots of description and great characters.

The main character, Brian, is trying to cope with his parent's recent divorce. This aspect of the story relates to the experience of today's youth, since 50% of marriages presently result in divorce. Paulsen uses his troubling childhood experiences to shape Brian's point of view in regard to the drastic changes he must undergo in his current household. Furthermore, the author adds his personal plane crash tragedy to give an accurate portrayal of Brian's near death experience, and his ability to survive overwhelming odds in the wilderness. The author does a wonderful job of demonstrating the importance of surviving, and how surviving develops character. Brain's transformation throughout the text reveals that he is stronger now than he was before. Paulsen is exemplary in bringing attention to certain words. However, some students are not aware that this unique writing style is not normally encouraged in a majority of middle school academic settings."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I rate this five-stars because the author made you feel like you were experiencing the same things that Brian did.

Hatchet is the best book I have read, because its so adventurous. Brian Robeson is a 13-year-old boy who is going to meet his dad for the first time after his parents divorce. He received a hatchet as a parting gift from his mom, which later helped him out. The story gets exciting from the beginning because his plane crashes and he is stuck in the wilderness. He must learn to survive because all he has is clothes on him and a hatchet. He soon starts to adapt to the environment and learns many things on his own. He learned many things to survive he ate berries, made a spear to catch fishes, ate eggs, made his own little shelter, learned how to make fire with his hatchet, and many more. This book is all about Brian adapting to the environment around him, and he does!What I liked about this book was that it was really adventurous and made me read on and on. I love this book because it shows how a teenager could survive in the wilderness on his own. I love the way he gets so happy whenever he finds a new food or a new way to get something. The really interesting part was when Brian gets the survival pack by going down in the lake the plane crashed into. It was like treasure for him it had a sleeping bag, pots and plate, rifle, fishing rod, a first aid kit, knife, compass, lighters, matches, food, and many more things. I like the quote when he just lands into the wilderness and he says, \\"So.So.So here I am.\\" Right after that he says, \\"I am hungry\\"!What I didn't like about this book was that whenever an airplane arrived it always missed him and left him lonely at the forest. Also there aren't many quotes in this book except in the beginning. I think that the book could have been more interesting if he would have not been rescued. I really admired his weapons he made to capture his food. I really loved the way Brian learns to survive, he survived for 54 days before he was rescued! This was a great book and i loved it. This quote was my favorite in the book,\\" right now I'm all I've got to survive. I have do something.\\"My favorite part of the book was in the beginning when Brian is on the co-pilot seat and the pilot starts holding on to his stomach and starts saying,\\" I don't know what I ate but it hurts\\". The pilot soon gets a heart attack. The pilot goes down and tells him to take over, Brian doesn't know much about flying the plane! The plane was now going to crash and Brian only hoped it lands in a lake and always kept on saying, \\"I am going to die\\". Luckily the plane lands in the L shaped lake and he survives. This was my favorite part because it was so funny and scary. I love this book and look forward to read another one of Gary Paulsen's novel."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Chris MulicaESL Reading3/22/04HatchetThe novel Hatchet is a very good book. Sometimes it makes you cry. It shows that every person can do stuff that is hard to imagine. It is a life story that could happen to any one. Main character Brian Robson is going to visit his father who lives in Canada. During the flight pilot has a heart attack and died. Brian landed the plane in the Canadian wilderness. He has nothing with him; nobody to talk to or to share feelings with. The worst part of it is that he has nothing to eat. He is so hungry that he would pay any price to get food. After few days of starving he eats some raspberries but they weren't the good ones so he throws up. He made his own tools and he starts to a new life there. He even made a fire, which helps him a lot. He is getting some new ideas how to get food but he has no idea how is going to get back home. He is there for 54 days and then something happens.When I was reading this book I felt sorry for Brian but I also was proud of him. When he was doing all those things it was hard to believe that he was only 13 years old. Especially when he made a fire, without matches or lighter. He also made his own weapons to get food by using only his hatchet. This book makes me happy because it shows that you just have to believe in yourself and do what you think is good.The best part of this book is that it is very easy to read because it doesn't have a lot of hard words. It is also very interesting with a lot of fast action. This story could happen to any person, which makes it more interesting.I learned from this book that you must trust yourself no matter where you are. Sometimes you can do things that you think are impossible to achieve.There is only one thing that I would change in this novel; I think that it a little too short at the end. I would make it a little more interesting and longer so it would be nicer to read it."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"This book is about a boy named Brian who on the way to his father's house in a single engine plane the pilot has a heart attack.

When the porcupine came he could make fire. He survived on fish and water from the lake and his hatchet to get animals from the forest. Summer is ending while winter is beginning... Will Brian survive or will he get rescued in time? To find out read Hatchet by Gary Paulsen.Hatchet is an awesome story. It has suspense through the entire book. Gary Paulsen makes you want to know what happens to Brian. If you don't you won't find out if he follows through with his ideas!Another thing that Gary Paulsen uses in his book is descriptive language that creates mind pictures. For example on p.180 when Brian went to look for the survival kit the pilots face was described well. And on p.155 when the tornado hit, it created a mental picture in your head. The author's words enable you to hear the sound in your head. This helps the reader understand and enjoy the story better.In addition, I really enjoyed the cause and effect relationships that occurred throughout the book. Everything that happens to Brian happens for a reason. For example, the tornado caused him to get the survival kit. Also, on p.80 when the porcupine attacked him the pain was intense. Brian threw his hatchet at the porcupine however, missed and hit a rock. As a result, sparks were created and he was able to make fire for survival. And also the secret caused all of it to happen.It was a really good book and I never wanted it to end.

After three months by the lake, he is able to turn an emergency transmitter on, and is rescued almost immediately. A short epilogue explains the changes that the ordeal wrought in Brian's character, and explains also that an impending divorce between his parents has occurred notwithstanding his adventure.The Good and the Bad:I liked this book a lot. The writing was clean and realistic, and Brian, existing in a cultural vacuum, seems to be a realistic, three dimensional character. I was reminded several times of the movie Castaway, as Brian and the titular character of the film share many of the same needs, obstacles, and triumphs. Despite the intrusion of the divorce subplot, the story is basically a stripped-down survivalist story and I like the simplicity. Compared to My Side of the Mountain, the story is almost painfully real; however, it may not be real enough to be considered 100% realistic. Brian's interactions with the wildlife are scary enough to keep our attention without being an epic battle ending with a slain wolf, or anything like that. There are also several \\"life lessons\\" woven skillfully into the text, such as the failure of self-pity to solve problems, and the meaningful interactions possible with nature.I guess my main criticism would be that the ending seems abrupt, although I suppose the rescue is done that way on purpose."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Brian is a boy whoes parents are divorced and is only fourteen. I enjoyed this book a fair amount. I would recommend this book to children of divorced parents. I really liked the beginning of the book because there was a lot of action and the last part of the book because I liked the way Brian got saved from an island but I was not so fond of the middle of the book. I found the middle part of the book kind of boring. I liked the thought of all of the dangerous animals in the book. Overall I really liked the book. I give this book 3 stars."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen, is a great adventure book. When his parents divorce, thirteen-year old Brian Robeson is sent to visit his father in Canada for the summer. While flying in a small plane over the Canadian Forest, the pilot has a heart attack and dies. The plane eventually crashes into a lake and Brian is left to survive in the wilderness on his own. Using the hatchet his mother gave him, he makes fire and a bow and arrow for food. He encounters many wild animals that threaten his safety. This story is about how Brian learns how to fend for himself, deal with his parents' divorce on his own, and become a stronger person internally as well as externally.Overall, this book was very interesting. I liked it because of the way Brian had the strength and courage to make it own his own in the Canadian Wilderness. Every time Brian would just get settled in, another disaster would strike. I recommend everyone read Hatchet, a Newbery Honor Book by Gary Paulsen."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"WOW!!! This book is great! I am a student in fifth grade, and we read this book recently. Normally, I hate reading books as a class, but this was different. WAYYYYYYY DIFFERENT! I highly reccomend this book, along with Brian's Winter, The River, and Brian's Return."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"A Review by KevinOne evening, Brian Robinson was on a small, 2 person aircraft on it's way to Canada from New York, when all of a sudden the pilot has a heart attack and dies with 13 year old Brian all along over Canadian Wilderness. Brian crash lands the plane in an \\"L\\" shaped lake. Will Brian be rescued or will he be out there for a lot longer than first thought? Either way the story goes on in, \\"Brian's Winter\\" and, \\"The River\\".I like how this book shows how complete ignorance can spawn into in depth knowledge of how to survive with only small tools such as the hatchet that Brian has through this series. I thought that this book was realistic as far as how he survived but some of the Problems he faced were not, such as a 40 or so year old pilot having a heart attack, and a tornado in the Canadian Wilderness. I believe that although this book had some unlikely parts, that it all in all was a realistic novel and reading it might be able to help someone if they were ever in that sort of a situation.I would recommend this book to people who like realistic adventure novels, although it had some unrealistic parts to it. It is an addictive story and not hard to follow, it keeps you in the book and ready to read more."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The book Hatchet is about a 13 year old boy named Brian who went on a plane to see his dad and the plane crashed in Northern Canada. After the plane crashed in the water Brian got on land, he had a lot of bumps and bruises and he keeped passing out. One day after he woke up he remembered that he had his hatchet with him, he used his hatchet to hunt and cut his wood for the fire. A few days later Brian found some berries, and water. He thought someone would find him. He met some animals like a bear, porcupine, and a turtle. Did Brian get saved? Did he survive?I thought the book was ok, but i really dont like the type of story that Hatchet is. I liked how the author had a lot of interesting information. I didnt like how there were to many details. The people that i think would like this book is boys that are 11 or 12 years old."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"Hatchet is a realistic fiction story. Gary Paulsen's vivid language allows readers to feel as though they are with Brian on his adventure in the wilderness. Brian is a very realistic character that struggles in nature in the same way that any teenager would when abandoned in the woods alone. His resourcefulness and intelligent ideas help him to survive the very grimmest of circumstances. This story is told in the third person. This allows Paulsen to explain what Brian is doing, and yet he still shares what Brian is thinking as he lives through this experience."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"There is something lacking in Paulsen's style. There was no distinguishable climax, and plot structure was no where to be seen. There was sometihng unrealistic about Brian's survival attempts. It was as if the book droned on for ever, and the end was no where in sight. Things that should have been summarized and made shorter took up pages; things that should have been packed with detail, description, and emphasis took a matter of sentences. I was itching in my seat for the book to be over. It's keeps you on the edge of your seat because you really want to get up and put the book down."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I thought Hatchet was an okay book. It was exciting at some parts of the book, but really boring, too. The author repeated things a lot when I already got the point. One thing I liked was that he described the setting very well, and I could get a crystal clear picture of what everything looked like. He also left you wondering about certain things, like Brian's mom's secret, and what really happened to the pilot."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"The novel Hatchet is about a thirteen-year-old boy who lived in New York City.

The way he talks is like a 13-year-old also. \\"I'm hungry.\\" He said it aloud. In normal tones at first, then louder and louder until he was yelling it. \\"I'm hungry, I'm hungry, I'm hungry!\\" He is just like any other 13-year-old and the book proves this and helps the reader relate to Brian.The book is very simple to understand and has many facts about animals and plants.

If he didn't have that he would have died the first day in the wilderness. This book will keep you reading cover to cover, turning page after page, just wondering what will happen next to Brian. So do your self a favor and read this great book."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"A thirteen-year-old boy named Brian is forced to spend fifty-four days in the Canadian wilderness after the plane is on crashes. He is on his way to his fathers new home, when the pilot has a heart attack and dies, leaving Brian alone to land the plane the best he can. Once he has landed, he has to find food, shelter, and protection for himself with his only possession, his hatchet. Brian is plunged into an unfamiliar environment, which inevitably causes him to grow from a boy into a young man, and helps him develop mentally. During Brian's adventure to survive, he grows from the boy he was into a young man, who doesn't need anyone's approval. In the beginning, he is upset about the divorce that his parent's have just gone through, but he eventually realizes that there are more important things in life to worry about. At one point he thinks that he will be rescued soon, but he begins to evolve into someone who doesn't need to be rescued, he figures out that he will be just fine on his own. Campbell's article entitled \\"The Young Adult Perplex\\" states, \\"Adolescents are both fascinated and repelled by the idea of being an \\"outsider,\\" one who is not part of the center of social power\\"(Campbell 75). Brian feels that he has to have someone take care of him, just as many children feel they have to be part of the in group, but he realizes he does not need anyone, so he grows from the boy he started the trip as into the young man who was eventually rescued on the island. Brian begins to realize how he has grown mentally, and he is proud of who he becomes, but when he makes mistakes and lapses back into his old self, he hates himself. In the novel, Brian tries to scare a skunk away and ends up getting sprayed. When he gets over the smell, he becomes angry for being the scared little boy that he was when he came to the island. Campbell's article states, \\"But to embrace that \\"outsider ness\\" and accept one's own uniqueness is a shortcut to maturity denied to the in-crowd-and the subject of many young adult novels\\" (Campbell 75). Hatchet is a novel dealing with survival, and mental development that exemplifies this statement through and through. When children are maturing into adulthood, peer reassurance is very important to them. In the novel Hatchet, Brian has no one to prove himself to and becomes a more grown up person for it."},{"Title":"Hatchet","review":"I just finished what I think to be one of the best books I've ever read, Hatchet.
