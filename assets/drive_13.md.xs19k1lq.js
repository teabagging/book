It is supposed that there had existed at Eglinton Castle an account of the Montgomery family in Scotland, which was destroyed when that old pile was burnt by the Cunninghams in 1528. Therefore the work of William Montgomery, written between 1698 and 1704, is the earliest existing attempt to illustrate the family history, and it is especially valuable because treating of persons who came within the reach of his personal knowledge and events that had occurred during the period of his own life.

On the eve of July 21, 1861, one Northerner wrote:  The sky is perfectly clear, the moon is full and bright, and the air was still as if it were not within a few hours to be disturbed by the roar of cannon and the shouts of contending men.  So optimistic were the people in Washington that a crowd of civilians came from the city with picnic hampers to witness the crushing defeat of the upstart  rebels.  It was, says William C. Davis,  the twilight of America s innocence,  and the following day the mood would shatter in a battle that confounded the expectations of both sides the first Battle at Bull Run. William C. Davis has written a compelling and complete account of this landmark conflict. The Battle at Bull Run (or Manassas) is notable for many reasons. It was a surprise victory for the Confederacy, a humiliating defeat for the Union, and the first ominous indication that a long and bloody war was inevitable. It marked the first strategic use of railroads in history, and the first time the horrors of the battle were photographed for the folks back home. It was also a training ground for some of America s most colorful military figures: P.G.T. Beauregard, Joe Johnston, Irvin McDowell and  Stonewall  Jackson. Drawing from a wealth of material old letters, journals, memoirs and military records Davis brings to life a vivid and vital chapter in American history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RGU0zK6dB6IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lone Crazed Gunman?

Lois Gibbs, Luella Kenny, and other mothers loved their neighborhood on the east side of Niagara Falls. It had an elementary school, a playground, and rows of affordable homes. But in the spring of 1977, pungent odors began to seep into these little houses, and it didn t take long for worried mothers to identify the curious scent. It was the sickly sweet smell of chemicals. In this propulsive work of narrative storytelling, NYT journalist Keith O Brien uncovers how Gibbs and Kenny exposed the poisonous secrets buried in their neighborhood. The school and playground had been built atop an old canal Love Canal, it was called that Hooker Chemical, the city s largest employer, had quietly filled with twenty thousand tons of toxic waste in the 1940s and 1950s. This waste was now leaching to the surface, causing a public health crisis the likes of which America had never seen before and sparking new and specific fears. Luella Kenny believed the chemicals were making her son sick. O Brien braids together previously unknown stories of Hooker Chemical s deeds; the local newspaperman, scientist, and congressional staffer who tried to help; the city and state officials who didn t; and the heroic women who stood up to corporate and governmental indifference to save their families and their children. They would take their fight all the way to the top, winning support from the EPA, the White House, and even President Jimmy Carter. By the time it was over, they would capture America s imagination. Sweeping and electrifying, Paradise Falls brings to life a defining story from our past, laying bare the dauntless efforts of a few women who years before Erin Brockovich took up the mantle  fought to rescue their community and their lives from the effects of corporate pollution and laid foundation for the modern environmental movement as we know it today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FxIxEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"George Moore, 1852-1933","description":"\\"Frazier records the relationships between Moore and his well-known friends - Yeats, Joyce, Archer, Shaw, Frank Harris, Sickert, Whistler and others - and with the many women in his life, including his greatest love, Lady Cunard.\\"--BOOK JACKET.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gPAkzQEACAAJ&dq=George+Moore,+1852-1933&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Getting Through What You're Going Through","description":"Robert A.

Initially when learning she was to visit Kosovo the author, searched for information about the land and the inhabitants... \\"to find out what it was like\\". Admitting ignorance of the land other than knowledge of the conflict in 1999 when NATO conducted an air offensive on humanitarian grounds to halt what was termed as the ethnic cleansing of the Albanian population of Kosovo. Much has been written about the war period but despite extensive investigation she came across very little on the domestic front. The book is an attempt to remedy this. The personal dialogue draws a sensitive picture of this small part of the world - not much larger than the county of Yorkshire - now a UN protectorate, and still an 'active posting' for the NATO military forces after 5 years of 'nation building'. With the aid of her camera and a quirky sense of humour that saw Kosovo becoming 'curiouser and curiouser', aspects of living in Kosovo today are revealed. First seeing Kosovo from the comparative safety of one of the myriad of white 4x4 vehicles she falls irrationally in love with the land, the people and the fascinating history. With her camera ever ready she portrays a land of often violent contrasts. Written looking at Kosovo briefly from history - the day before; the war years - yesterday; the author takes to her heart the Kosovo of today. Determined to attempt to analysis her attraction 60-year-old Kristina returns... alone. To find her affinity, interest, intensifying. She has since been back yet again on her own, to stay in the capital Pristina just prior to the recent elections; feeling her way in this unsettled land; 'to test the water' as the frustrations of the population continue to simmer.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cX1TAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Go Up and Seek God: 12-Strand DNA Technique for Healing and Enlightenment","description":"Joy Brisbaneknew at the age of seven that she could communicate with spirit beings.

Midway . . . the battle for the Philippines. In each of these critical conflicts, intelligence played a crucial role in bringing about an Allied victory. General MacArthur's brilliant Pacific campaign was designed around espionage and guerrilla warfare. This is the story of his undercover war. Praise for William B. Breuer's Previous Works... \\"An exciting narrative presented by a first-rate story teller.\\"  Publishers Weekly on The Great Raid on Cabanatuan \\"A first-class historian.\\"  The Wall Street Journal \\"Another smasher by Breuer, who specializes in thrilling reports of WWII spycraft and warfare.\\"  Kirkus Reviews on Race to the Moon \\"Fast-paced, detailed, and satisfyingly dramatic.\\"  World War II magazine on Devil Boats \\"Vivid . . . skillfully written.\\"  Los Angeles Times on Retaking the Philippines \\"Brings to life how airborne soldiers survived, how the human will prevails . . . against overwhelming enemies, tactical failures, and even death.\\"  The New York Times on Geronimo: American Paratroopers in World War II MACARTHUR'S UNDERCOVER WAR The covert war General Douglas MacArthur waged against Japanese forces in the Pacific arena was the largest undercover operation ever undertaken. Here, for the first time, is the complete story of the legendary exploits and heroism of the thousands of courageous individuals who fought as spies, guerrillas, propagandists, and saboteurs behind enemy lines. When the Japanese war juggernaut overran the Philippines, it took a near miraculous PT-boat escape for MacArthur to make his way to safety in Australia. He left behind a force of seventy thousand American and Philippine troops marooned on the Bataan Peninsula. To these brave men the general vowed, \\"I shall return.\\" Against overwhelming odds, MacArthur succeeded. Crucial to his success was his massive covert war effort. MacArthur created his own undercover warfare agency, the super-secret Allied Intelligence Bureau (AIB), to organize the many far-flung resistance groups. They were the coast watchers jungle-wise miners, traders and planters, missionaries, and telegraph operators who occupied remote Pacific islands, living in the most primitive conditions while keeping a constant vigil for Japanese movement. They were American soldiers who escaped the Bataan Peninsula and were commanding guerrilla armies in the interior mountain and jungle locations of the Philippines. And they were double agents operating right under the noses of the Japanese in Manila, occupying positions close to the Imperial Army and in the collaborationist Philippine government. The phenomenal success of MacArthur's island-hopping \\"hit-'em-where-they-ain't\\" campaign was built on the accuracy of the intelligence gathered by the AIB. Early in the conflict, the Americans cracked the secret Japanese naval code and established a chain of intelligence radio-monitoring posts circling the Japanese empire from Alaska to Australia. The information garnered from their interceptions of Japanese transmissions and from operatives on the ground allowed MacArthur to pick soft targets islands the Japanese had left relatively unguarded for invasion. It was the steel nerves and unbounded resourcefulness of those who fought the secret war that paved the way for MacArthur's \\"Great Return\\" to the Philippines and saved the lives of countless American soldiers. In an action-packed narrative, MacArthur's Undercover War tells of thrilling feats of valor and derring-do impossible missions to blow up harbors, kidnap heads of state, undermine currency, and arrange prison escapes, all deep within enemy territory. Firsthand interviews with veterans and information from previously unpublished documents reveal a riveting tale of World War II that has never been fully told.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8BJnAAAAMAAJ&dq=MacArthur%27s+Undercover+War:+Spies,+Saboteurs,+Guerrillas,+and+Secret+Missions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tuntun De Pasa Y Griferia","description":"Esta obra es la tercera colecci n de poemas ?publicada por primera vez en 1937? del gran poeta puertorrique?o y re ne sus creaciones m s conocidas y celebradas.

Cyril wordt geboren als bastaardzoon van een verstoten tienermeisje.

The attraction comes from the fact that static mixers do not require an external input of energy and do not have moving parts. Static mixers consist of mixing elements fixed on the inside of a pipe of channel. The elements do not move. Chemicals, added just upstream of the mixers, mix with the bulk fluid because of the complex, three-dimensional fluid motion generated by the elements. The goal of this project is to explore the use of static mixers in two of the key processes in drinking water treatment: for the mixing of coagulants for destabilization and the mixing of disinfectants for the inactivation of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts in disinfection. The role of mixing in both of these processes is not well understood. But for each process experimental and theoretical evidence suggests that, at least in some circumstances, the mixing environment provided when chemicals are introduced into the flow will affect the resulting destabilization or inactivation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=wZJUuI_L8goC&dq=Static&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Readings in Multimedia Computing and Networking (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Multimedia Information and Systems)","description":"Compiled for professionals working in designing, building and implementing multimedia-related hardware and applications, this volume examines media and content processing, systems-based solutions and networking suport for multimedia data types.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=awR5SDq__XEC&dq=Readings+in+Multimedia+Computing+and+Networking+(The+Morgan+Kaufmann+Series+in+Multimedia+Information+and+Systems)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Junie B.

Although the mathematical theory of Kolmogorov complexity contains sophisticated mathematics, the amount of math one needs to know to apply the notions in widely divergent areas, is very little. The authors' purpose is to develop the theory in detail and outline a wide range of illustrative applications. This book is an attempt to grasp the mass of fragmented knowledge of this fascinating theory. Chapter 1 is a compilation of material on the diverse notations and disciplines we draw upon in order to make the book self-contained. The mathematical theory of Kolmogorov complexity is treated in chapters 2-4; the applications are treated in chapters 4-8.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JvXiBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tim Holt","description":"In this gun-slinging issue of Tim Holt Western Adventures Dick Ayers' Ghost Rider makes a another appearance in addition to these other action packed stories...

Between bloody wars against the Italians in the north and famine raging in the south, Ukhayyad rides for the remote rock caves of Jebel Hasawna.

Alone in the desert, haunted by the prophetic cave paintings of ancient hunting scenes and the cries of jinn in the night, Ukhayyad awaits the arrival of his pursuers and their insatiable hunger for blood and gold. Gold Dust is a classic story of the brotherhood between man and beast, the thread of companionship that is all the difference between life and death in the desert.

Born in Valencia, this Spanish painter was active mainly in his native town and in Madrid. He was a prolific and popular artist, working on a wide range of subjects - genre, portraits and landscapes - and his bravura style marked by luminous coloring and vigorous brushwork earned him a considerable reputation throughout Europe and America. He was also a highly sought after portraitist.\\" \\"Early in the career Sorolla mainly portrayed history and social scenes before developing his own plein-air painting from the 1900s onwards, painting townscapes, garden scenes, nature studies, seascapes and beach scenes with an extraordinary ability of capturing light. From 1901 to 1905 he created 500 works adhering to his ideal of 'natural painting'. From these paintings came the body of work shown in a series of shows in Paris, Berlin, London, New York, Saint Louis and Chicago. Sorolla was then commissioned to create a multi-panelled work entitled Visions of Spain for the Hispanic Society in New York. He laboured on this from 1912-19 after which time he painted very little.

Kennedy: Stunning Evidence in the Assassination of the President","description":"The Radical Right and the Murder of John F. Kennedy: Stunning Evidence in the Assassination of the President Harrison E. Livingstone's major new book, the fifth of his works on the death of JFK, brings together for the first time all of the central evidence demonstrating a domestic Right Wing conspiracy rooted in Texas which assassinated the President on November 22, 1963. The book represents forty years of work. The book discusses in great detail the actual medical evidence and the forgery of the autopsy photographs and X-rays, which Mr. Livingstone first exposed, the alteration of the autopsy report, the framing of the designated patsy, Lee Harvey Oswald, and the substitution and fabrication of every single piece of evidence. It discusses the role played in the murder by some of the most powerful men in the country: Lyndon Johnson, J. Edgar Hoover, and Richard Nixon, as well as the rich oil men and companies who backed them. It then describes the cover-ups by the media, the major investigations over the years, the FBI, and the mind-control cooperation at work in the case to misdirect researchers and the public. The book describes in great detail the people and companies in Texas who planned and carried out the assassination. It names names. One recent investigation in the 90s followed Mr. Livingstone's preceeding work and reinvestigated with the witnesses both he and the official investigations had talked to, but this time took into consideration their documentation and what they had actually said, and in a chapter this is his stunning new evidence from the U.S. government under President Clinton that is blowing the lid off the case. Mr. Livingstone first revealed to the Washington press corps in 1998 that there has been such a secret investigation, and spoke for fifty minutes when the Assassination Records Review Board gave their final press conference. As a result, Mr. Livingstone was on all major TV networks and on the \\"Today\\" show (NBC) with Katie Couric the next morning. The book also contains the story of Dallas doctor Charles Crenshaw's law suit and the depositions of the editor and writer of the Journal of American Medical Association who libeled him in articles in 1992. Dr. Crenshaw's book about trying to save Kennedy at Parkland Hospital shortly after the shooting came out on the same day as Mr. Livingstone's major work on the medical evidence, High Treason 2, were JAMA's targets, and the depositions contain much discussion of Mr. Livingstone's major impact on the JFK case. This new book is to be followed closely by a sixth book entirely about the Zapruder film, called The Hoax of the Century: Decoding the Forgery of the Zapruder Film.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LD8TUAGSuMoC&dq=The+Radical+Right+and+the+Murder+of+John+F.+Kennedy:+Stunning+Evidence+in+the+Assassination+of+the+President&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dropped from the Clouds","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_xmFtAEACAAJ&dq=Dropped+from+the+Clouds&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tensor analysis for physicists","description":"This rigorous and advanced mathematical explanation of classic tensor analysis was written by one of the founders of tensor calculus.

Without the support of John Peel, it's unlikely that innumerable artists - from David Bowie to Dizzee Rascal, Jethro Tull to Joy Division - would have received national radio exposure. But Peel's influence goes much deeper than this. Whether he was championing punk, reggae, jungle or grime, he had a unique relationship with his audience that was part taste-maker, part trusted friend. The book focuses on some 300 shows between 1967 and 2004, giving a thorough overview of Peel's broadcasting career and placing it in its cultural and social contexts. Peel comes alive for the reader, as do the key developments that kept him at the cutting edge - the changes in his tastes; the changes in his thinking.

The Parallax View is Slavoj ?i?ek's most substantial theoretical work to appear in many years; ?i?ek himself describes it as his magnum opus. Parallax can be defined as the apparent displacement of an object, caused by a change in observational position. ?i?ek is interested in the \\"parallax gap\\" separating two points between which no synthesis or mediation is possible, linked by an \\"impossible short circuit\\" of levels that can never meet. From this consideration of parallax, ?i?ek begins a rehabilitation of dialectical materialism. Modes of parallax can be seen in different domains of today's theory, from the wave-particle duality in quantum physics to the parallax of the unconscious in Freudian psychoanalysis between interpretations of the formation of the unconscious and theories of drives. In The Parallax View, ?i?ek, with his usual astonishing erudition, focuses on three main modes of parallax: the ontological difference, the ultimate parallax that conditions our very access to reality; the scientific parallax, the irreducible gap between the phenomenal experience of reality and its scientific explanation, which reaches its apogee in today's brain sciences (according to which \\"nobody is home\\" in the skull, just stacks of brain meat a condition ?i?ek calls \\"the unbearable lightness of being no one\\"); and the political parallax, the social antagonism that allows for no common ground. Between his discussions of these three modes, ?i?ek offers interludes that deal with more specific topics including an ethical act in a novel by Henry James and anti-anti-Semitism. The Parallax View not only expands ?i?ek's Lacanian-Hegelian approach to new domains (notably cognitive brain sciences) but also provides the systematic exposition of the conceptual framework that underlies his entire work. Philosophical and theological analysis, detailed readings of literature, cinema, and music coexist with lively anecdotes and obscene jokes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4bT4DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+parallax+view&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rose Street: A Family Story 2nd Ed.","description":"Closing Chapters attempts to explain the disintegration of urban parochial schools in Youngstown, Ohio, a onetime industrial center that lost all but one of its eighteen Catholic parochial elementary schools between 1960 and 2006.

If you want a brief but thorough education in numeric thinking about many of the fundamental forces that shape human life, this is the book to read. It's a tour de force' BILL GATES __________ We have never had so much information at our fingertips and yet most of us don't know how the world really works. This book explains seven of the most fundamental realities governing our survival and prosperity. From energy and food production, through our material world and its globalization, to risks, our environment and its future, How the World Really Works offers a much-needed reality check - because before we can tackle problems effectively, we must understand the facts. In this ambitious and thought-provoking book we see, for example, that globalization isn't inevitable - the perils of allowing 70 per cent of the world's rubber gloves to be made in just one factory became glaringly obvious in 2020 - and that our societies have been steadily increasing their dependence on fossil fuels, making their complete and rapid elimination unlikely. For example, each greenhouse-grown supermarket-bought tomato requires the equivalent of five tablespoons of diesel oil for its production; and we still lack any commercially viable ways of making steel, ammonia, cement or plastics on the scale required globally without fossil fuels. Vaclav Smil is neither a pessimist nor an optimist, he is a scientist; he is the world-leading expert on energy and an astonishing polymath. This is his magnum opus and a continuation of his quest to make facts matter. Drawing on the latest science, including his own fascinating research, and tackling sources of misinformation head on - from Yuval Noah Harari to Noam Chomsky - ultimately Smil answers the most profound question of our age: are we irrevocably doomed or is a brighter utopia ahead? Compelling, data-rich and revisionist, this wonderfully broad, interdisciplinary masterpiece finds faults with both extremes. Looking at the world through this quantitative lens reveals hidden truths that change the way we see our past, present and uncertain future. __________ 'Very informative and eye-opening in many ways' Ha-Joon Chang, author of 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism 'If you are anxious about the future, and infuriated that we aren't doing enough about it, please read this book' Paul Collier, author of The Future of Capitalism","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t7cSEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of Japanese Art","description":"Published jointly by Prentice Hall and Harry N.

Life just isn't that way. Immorality is a habit one develops that usually ends in headlines. In Slipping to Normal, author Bill Arthur applies an adage, \\"Every society normalizes its own moral sickness,\\" to show why we make bad choices. Slipping to Normal is about the leader whose bad choice is simply to look the other way and rationalize misconduct with attitudes such as: Everybody does it, so why bother trying to change it, As long as subordinates do their work, I don't worry about how. It is hard enough for corporate executives just to sustain focus on business objectives deep into the organization without trying to make people good. Financial reward is the only goal in business is a frequent complaint about business, but this doesn't reach the deep-seeded motivations down in the trenches. The declining influence of the church is also a factor, but it is still a player in our society. Slipping to Normal draws upon Biblical teachings to offer some ideas to regain our moral backbone.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0l8OAAAACAAJ&dq=Slipping+to+Normal:+A+Matter+of+Leadership&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THX 1138","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ybeWtgAACAAJ&dq=THX+1138&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Channels to Children Early Childhood Activity Guide for Holidays and Seasons","description":"Comprehensive activity manual designed to reinforce educational concepts using art and crafts, language development, cooking, creative dramatics and movement, fingerplays and poems, music, science, social skills, and math games.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YdSQpwAACAAJ&dq=Channels+to+Children+Early+Childhood+Activity+Guide+for+Holidays+and+Seasons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Losing Your Executive Director Without Losing Your Way: The Nonprofit's Guide to Executive Turnover","description":"Publisher Description","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=olruAAAAMAAJ&dq=Losing+Your+Executive+Director+Without+Losing+Your+Way:+The+Nonprofit%27s+Guide+to+Executive+Turnover&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AutoCAD 2000 Manual completo del Usuario con CD-ROM: Manuales Users, en Espanol / Spanish (PC Users; La Computacion Que Entienden Todos) (Spanish Edition)","description":"Inleiding in het programmeren, bestemd voor programmeurs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lafkAAAACAAJ&dq=AutoCAD+2000+Manual+completo+del+Usuario+con+CD-ROM:+Manuales+Users,+en+Espanol+/+Spanish+(PC+Users%3B+La+Computacion+Que+Entienden+Todos)+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pillar of the Sky","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rftAPwAACAAJ&dq=Pillar+of+the+Sky&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Northridge Wheelers","description":"Doug and Lydia Wheeler are excited about the birth of their first child in 1923, who arrives six weeks early following a violent storm that ravages their small community.

This is followed by the history of how the thermodynamic (1876) and quantum (1905) revolutions modernized chemistry such that affinity (the 'force' of reaction) is now viewed as a function of thermodynamic 'free energy' (reaction spontaneity) and quantum 'valency' (bond stabilities). The composition, energetic state, dynamics, and evolution of the human chemical bond A?B is the centerpiece of this process. The human bond is what gives (yields) and takes (absorbs) energy in life. The coupling of this bond energy, driven by periodic inputs of solar photons, thus triggering activation energies and entropies, connected to the dynamical work of life, is what quantifies the human reaction process. This is followed by topics including mental crystallization, template theory, LGBT chemistry, chemical potential, Le Chatelier's principle, Muller dispersion forces, and human thermodynamics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KGaghraz8AUC&dq=Human+chemistry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Coincidence of Memory","description":"A collection of photography, poetry and art.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=20oISwAACAAJ&dq=Coincidence+of+Memory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aging: today's research and you: Lecture series II","description":"This publication is the first to cover the entire field of teaching psychology, and includes teaching methods, advising, and curriculum planning as well as special problems in teaching laboratory and statistics courses.

Isah got behind the wheel of the Toyota Liteace minibus while the others scrambled in. As the vehicle screeched out of its parking space, volleys from the concerted fire of the anti riot policemen hit it repeatedly, shattering all the glass windows, wind shields, and deflating its tires.

In this story of an era in American life, the figure of Calvin Coolidge, a curious reversion to an old type, stands out in contrast to the vivid color of a gorgeous epoch. The history of the Coolidge bull market in detail from 1921, when Coolidge came to Washington as Vice President, until 1929, when he left Washington and public life, had not been written before. As that market boomed, Calvin Coolidge as President, having all the virtues needed for another day, moved through the turmoil of the times earnestly, honestly, courageously trying to understand his country s economic development and to act upon his understanding of a movement that baffled him and left him futile. Mr. White talked to hundreds of people who knew and were associated with President Coolidge in those days. Cabinet members, friends, White House associates, reporters, business men, big and little; and his story throws a new light upon the inside of the White House, and upon the President through the years.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kNamDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Introduction to the Study of Experimental Medicine (The Classics of Medicine Library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XOoQHQAACAAJ&dq=An+Introduction+to+the+Study+of+Experimental+Medicine+(The+Classics+of+Medicine+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Liderando la revolucin","description":"Primero le quitar n sus clientes.

An author whose works have appeared in many languages, Eco is also the translator of G rard de Nerval's Sylvie and Raymond Queneau's Exercices de style from French into Italian. In Experiences in Translation he draws on his substantial practical experience to identify and discuss some central problems of translation. As he convincingly demonstrates, a translation can express an evident deep sense of a text even when violating both lexical and referential faithfulness. Depicting translation as a semiotic task, he uses a wide range of source materials as illustration: the translations of his own and other novels, translations of the dialogue of American films into Italian, and various versions of the Bible. In the second part of his study he deals with translation theories proposed by Jakobson, Steiner, Peirce, and others. Overall, Eco identifies the different types of interpretive acts that count as translation. An enticing new typology emerges, based on his insistence on a common-sense approach and the necessity of taking a critical stance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0dVYaP9VukIC&dq=Experiences+in+Translation+(Toronto+Italian+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Fish Cookery","description":"Om zout zijn oorlogen gevochten.

If a business can operate without human intervention, it will minimize its operational cost. If Uber can remove the expense of a driver with an autonomous vehicle, it will provide its service cheaper than a competitor who can t. If an artificially intelligent trading company can search, find, and take advantage of some arbitrage opportunity, then it can profit where its competitors cannot. A business that can analyze and execute in real-time without needing to wait for a human to act, is a business that will be able to take advantage of brief inefficiencies from other markets or businesses. This trend following a thesis that is based on 100 years of proven economic theory. Short-wave economic cycles, those 5- to 10-year cycles, are driven by credit but the long-wave economic cycles, those 50- to 60-year cycles, are driven by technological revolution. We ve had 5 cycles over the past 200 years with the last wave, the Age of Information & Telecommunications. We ve seen evidence that a new cycle has begun. Technological revolutions come by way of a cluster of new innovations. About a decade ago, you started to see AI, robotics and IoT (sensors) delivering on automation. That s been powerful, but not transformational. It does not force businesses to fundamentally change how they do business. The last piece of the puzzle was cryptocurrency because it allows us to process and transfer economic value without human intervention. Soon, there will be a global race to build autonomous operations. Businesses and organizations without autonomous operations simply will not be able to compete with those that do because   autonomy is the ultimate competitive advantage. Crypto is the mechanism that will accrue value from being the infrastructure for the next digital financial revolution. Crypto Asset Investing lays out a case that we ve begun a new technological revolution similar to the Internet Age of the 1990 s. Artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, robotics and cryptocurrency are converging to deliver on a new age, what I call the Age of Autonomy. Understanding the transformation that s taken place before anyone else can yield enormous investment opportunity. In this book, you ll learn how and why to invest in crypto assets.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vdIHEAAAQBAJ&dq=Asset&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Negroes with guns","description":"A southern black community's struggle to defend itself against racist groups.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=i4YiA0jWz4EC&dq=Negroes+with+guns&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Male Matters: Masculinity, Anxiety, and the Male Body on the Line","description":"Calvin Thomas's Male Matters reveals the act and production of writing as a bodily, material process that transgresses the boundaries of gender.

But each political event, each war, each clash in the streets or at the picket lines, is experienced by individuals. It is this profound bond between public history and personal struggle, Alessandro Portelli contends, that gives oral history its significance and its power. In The Battle of Valle Giulia--the title comes from an Italian student protest of the 1960s--Portelli reflects on how to connect personal memories with history, how to fittingly collect and represent the complexity of memory. Crossing cultures, classes, and generations, he records the private and singular experiences of Italian steelworkers and Kentucky coal miners, veterans and refugees of World War II, soldiers who fought in Vietnam, Italian resistance fighters and Nazis, and members of student movements from Berkeley to Rome. By listening to those whom others presume are \\"without historical memory\\"--such as youthful protesters, or the rural Tuscan women who saw every father, son, and brother killed by Nazi soldiers--Portelli clarifies the process by which narratives come into being as oral history, and he illustrates the differences and distances between story-telling and history-telling. Portelli's articulate discussion of dialogue, representation, narrative and genre link historical analysis with literary and linguistic theory and with the concerns of contemporary anthropology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1aBmAAAAMAAJ&dq=Battle+of+Valle+Giulia:+Oral+History+and+the+Art+of+Dialogue&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Puritans in America: A Narrative Anthology","description":"Exiled from England, the Puritans settled in what Cromwell called \\"a poor, cold, and useless\\" place--where they created a body of ideas and aspirations that were essential in the shaping of American religion, politics, and culture.

An outstanding athlete with a stubborn and competitive spirit, he lost his leg to cancer at 19, but said  nobody is ever going to call me a quitter.  On April 12, 1980, Terry Fox set out from St. John s, Newfoundland to begin the run across Canada that he named the Marathon of Hope. His ambition was to raise a million dollars for cancer research. It wasn t easy. Initial support from communities varied from terrific to nothing at all. His prosthetic leg was painful to run on, and there were always traffic and extreme weather conditions to deal with. But, by the time he reached Ontario  a journey of more than 3,000 kilometres  word of his achievement had spread, and thousands cheered him and followed his progress. Terry s spirits soared, and now he hoped to raise $22 million dollars  one dollar for every Canadian. He succeeded in this ambition, but the Marathon of Hope ended near Thunder Bay, Ontario on September 1, 1980. The cancer had spread to his lungs, and, after running 24 miles in one day, on the next he could run no further. When cancer finally claimed his life in 1981, Canada mourned the loss of a hero, but the Terry Fox Marathon of Hope lives on. The Terry Fox Foundation raised more than $17 million in 1999, and support for the event nationally and around the world is growing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rdel1p9KahQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jane Fonda's Fitness Walkout","description":"Object Lessons is a series of short, beautifully designed books about the hidden lives of ordinary things.

A Grammy Award for \\"Karma Chameleon\\" sealed Boy George's pop-icon status as the avant-garde star whose beguiling melodies and impertinent one-liners seduced an unsuspecting public.

Soon came the pill, the end of censorship, the advent of feminism, and the rise of commercial pornography. Our daily lives changed in an unprecedented time of sexual openness and experimentation. Make Love, Not Waris the first serious treatment of the complicated events, ideas, and personalities that drove the sexual revolution forward. Based on first-hand accounts, diaries, interviews, and period research, it traces changes in private lives and public discourse from the fearful fifties to the first tremors of rebellion in the early sixties to the heady heyday of the revolution. Bringing a fresh perspective to the turbulence of these decades, David Allyn argues that the sexual revolutionaries of the '60s and '70s, by telling the truth about their own histories and desires, forced all Americans to re-examine the very meaning of freedom. Written with a historian's attention to nuance and a novelist's narrative drive, Make Love, Not Waris a provocative, vivid, and thoughtful account of one of the most captivating episodes in American history.

In this book, the hymn writer herself writes for us her thoughts on this famous hymn. She brings us through each phrase of the song, and reveals some personal God-fearing thoughts concerning them. Thus we are able to hear from the writer herself, with the thoughts that inspired each line of this traditional favorite. Kept for the Master's use is more than just a wonderful piece of classic literature. It is a personal testament to what is means to live a life fully submitted and devoted to Jesus Christ. Even if that life is filled with chronic pain in which the author Francis Havergal was. She loved her Master and found real life (in spite of suffering) in a life lived in consecration. This book is strongly recommended to all as a short, sweet devotional; small and handy that can be carried around wherever you go!","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1Pf0ngEACAAJ&dq=Kept+for+the+Master%27s+Use&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Workbook of Cuneiform Signs (Aids and research tools in ancient Near Eastern studies)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=txqFQgAACAAJ&dq=Workbook+of+Cuneiform+Signs+(Aids+and+research+tools+in+ancient+Near+Eastern+studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Be Still and Know: Reflections from Living Buddha, Living Christ","description":"In his acclaimed national bestseller, Living Buddha, Living Christ, renowned thinker and scholar Thich Nhat Hanh explored the deep connections between Christianity and Buddhism.

The Saxons were one of these tribes, and several others who were near neighbors joined them on their settlementin Britain. The Angles, who were probably the most numerous of the confederates, gave their name to the island, and the Saxons on the other hand gave their name to the race, and the names of both were merged into the double compound anglo-saxon. At that time Germany consisted of many nationalities that were known under the general terms of Saxons, Goths, Germans, and Teutons. We therefore speak of our forefathers' speech as Saxon, Gothic, Ger manic, and Teutonic. These, however, mean the same people and the same language, and in speaking of the-english it is understood by any one or all of these names, and in that sense I use them inter changeably in the present volume.

His personal philosophy of religious tolerance can be summed up from an address made in 1790 to the Hebrew Congregation in Newport, Rhode Island, where he said \\"May the Children of the Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the good will of the other inhabitants, while every one shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree, and there shall be none to make him afraid.\\" Was it Washington's respect for the wisdom of the ancient Prophets or the participation of the patriotic Jews in the struggle for independence that motivated Washington to direct his most significant and profound statement on religious freedom at a Jewish audience?

He had a failed stint as a professional wrestler, and participated in a fumbled (but famous) diamond heist. He was deported but managed to return with the assistance of the Mafia. Then Nick opened a pizza joint in what would be the centre of Tokyo's nightlife and became \\"the king of Roppongi and Mafia boss of Tokyo,\\" and the intimate of some of Japan's most notorious underworld figures as well as many of its political and business leaders. Following Zappetti's rising and falling fortunes, and his love-hate relationship with his adopted country, Robert Whiting show us the sinister (and sometimes ridiculous) goings-on among Tokyo's traditional criminal gangs as they developed from local racketeers and gamblers into lynchpins of international finance, politics and corruption. Here is a fresh perspective on postwar Japan and how it went from being a defeated nation to an economic player, with a little help from some less than diplomatic friends.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=11qeBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cause and Correlation in Biology: A User's Guide to Path Analysis, Structural Equations and Causal Inference","description":"A complete user's guide to structural equations explaining the underlying principals and practical implementation of these methods.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fCb-CwAAQBAJ&dq=Cause+and+Correlation+in+Biology:+A+User%27s+Guide+to+Path+Analysis,+Structural+Equations+and+Causal+Inference&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Music Box: Piano, Vocal, Guitar","description":"(Piano/Vocal/Guitar Artist Songbook).

How they experienced the realities of America s abundant food its meat and white bread, its butter and cheese, fruits and vegetables, coffee and beer reflected their earlier deprivations and shaped their ethnic practices in the new land. Hungering for America tells the stories of three distinctive groups and their unique culinary dramas. Italian immigrants transformed the food of their upper classes and of sacred days into a generic  Italian  food that inspired community pride and cohesion. Irish immigrants, in contrast, loath to mimic the foodways of the Protestant British elite, diminished food as a marker of ethnicity. And East European Jews, who venerated food as the vital center around which family and religious practice gathered, found that dietary restrictions jarred with America s boundless choices. These tales, of immigrants in their old worlds and in the new, demonstrate the role of hunger in driving migration and the significance of food in cementing ethnic identity and community.

Clearly, humanity has lost touch with Nature. We are, every second, committing appalling damage to the environment, to ourselves, to other species and to the home we share. The answers to environmental decline will not come by trying to persuade politicians and industrialists that urgent and fundamental changes are required. They are motivated by the need to get elected and by self-interest. Neither scientists nor the church seem to know what needs to be done either. What can WE do to heal the world? Former television personality turned world visionary, David Icke gives positive suggestions about how to discover our path and recognise that we are part of a larger consciousness, connecting with others and learning how to heal the Earth. He says we have to begin at home. Healing others and healing the world has to start with self-healing, rediscovering self-respect and love in one's own life. Freedom starts with learning and overcoming fear and guilt and releasing our social conditioning. Judging others can become listening and understanding. We need to rediscover Earth's energies and the special places where we can best connect with these energies, and balance the negative and positive. Formerly best-known as a TV sports commentator and leading spokesman for the British Green party, David Icke has gained increasing authority as a tireless campaigner for truth. His widely publicised spiritual transformation has given him the courage to speak out fearlessly against lies and deceit. David's engaging, readable style allows complex ideas to be easily understood. He travels extensively, offering public talks and discussions around the UK and USA about the world transformation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QfX4AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Planned Deception The Staging of a New Age \\"Messiah\\"","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0iUNAQAACAAJ&dq=A+Planned+Deception+The+Staging+of+a+New+Age+%22Messiah%22&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BOHICA (Negation, Book 1)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=x4NYAAAAYAAJ&dq=BOHICA+(Negation,+Book+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Afghanistan: The First Faultline War","description":"The Afghan Conflict Has The Most Serious Ramifications For Indian, South Asian And Central Asian Security.

Whether emigr s, exiles, expatriates, refugees, or nomads, these people all experience a distance from their homes and often their native languages. Exile and Creativity brings together the widely varied perspectives of nineteen distinguished European and American scholars and cultural critics to ask: Is exile a falling away from a source of creativity associated with the wholeness of home and one's own language, or is it a spur to creativity? In essays that range chronologically from the Renaissance to the 1990s, geographically from the Danube to the Andes, and historically from the Inquisition to the Holocaust, the complexities and tensions of exile and the diversity of its experiences are examined. Recognizing exile as an interior experience as much as a physical displacement, this collection discusses such varied topics as intellectual exile and seventeenth-century French literature; different versions of home and of the novel in the writings of Bakhtin and Luk cs; the displacement of James Joyce and Clarice Lispector; a young journalist's meeting with James Baldwin in the south of France; Jean Renoir's Hollywood years; and reflections by the descendents of European emigr s. Strikingly, many of the essays are themselves the work of exiles, bearing out once more the power of the personal voice in scholarship. With the exception of the contribution by Henry Louis Gates Jr., these essays were originally published in a special double issue of Poetics Today in 1996. Exile and Creativity will engage a range of readers from those whose specific interests include the problems of displacement and diaspora and the European Holocaust to those whose broad interests include art, literary and cultural studies, history, film, and the nature of human creativity.

When such machinery is in operation, often at very high speeds of thousands of revs per minute, any imbalance will set up vibration and often noise. In addition, such imbalance will cause extra wear and loss of efficiency in the machine. The answer is to balance the affected parts of the machine so that it operates smoothly and efficiently. This book is a practical account of such balancing techniques e.g how to balance a rotor, how to set up and verify performance of a balancing machine, and procedures for on-site balancing. In addition, other common causes of vibration will be covered e.g. misalignment, bad bearings and looseness. This book is the distillation of a successful course run by the author and developed over 20 years. University engineering departments do not teach balancing techniques beyond the very basic, and there is a need for educators and engineers to have a practical book available on the topic.   A practical book which will help the reader understand the importance of balance in today's high technology world   Outlines the history of dynamic balancing and other vibration reduction techniques   Profusely illustrated throughout","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W21tRy_nR-8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Forward to Freedom: From Exodus to Easter","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YMM-qKraaLMC&dq=Forward+to+Freedom:+From+Exodus+to+Easter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rolling Stones - Exile on Main Street (Guitar Recorded Versions)","description":"(Guitar Recorded Versions). 18-song matching folio to the classic Stones album features transcriptions of: Rocks Off * Tumbling Dice * Let It Loose * All Down The Line * Stop Breaking Down * Casino Boogie * Torn & Frayed * Black Angel * Loving Cup * Happy * Soul Survivor * Shake Your Hips * Rip This Joint * and more.

Ask the question of anyone who has experienced the full sensation of being obliterated by the moon's shadow, and they will reply \\"yes\\"--without hesitation--and continue with a monologue describing the overwhelming experiences and unique phenomena that ensued. On 21 August 2017 millions of people across the United States witnessed \\"The Great American Eclipse\\" of the Sun. The moment it was over, people around the world were asking questions: what caused the weird shadows and colors in the build up to totality? Were those ephemeral bands of shadows gliding across the ground in the seconds before totality real or an optical illusion? Why this, what that, but above all: where and when can I see a total solar eclipse again? Eclipses: What Everyone Needs to Know helps explain the profound differences between a 99.99% partial eclipse and true totality, and inform readers how to experience this most beautiful natural phenomenon successfully. It covers eclipses of sun, moon, and other astronomical objects, and their applications in science, as well as their role in history, literature, and myth. It describes the phenomena to expect at a solar eclipse and the best ways to record them--by camera, video, or by simple handmade experiments. The book covers the timetable of upcoming eclipses, where the best locations will be to see them, and the opportunities for using them as vehicles for inspiration and education. As a veteran of seven total solar eclipses, physicist Frank Close is an expert both on the theory and practice of eclipses. Eclipses: What Everyone Needs to Know is a popular source of information on the physics of eclipses.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=u5ugDwAAQBAJ&dq=PARTIAL+ECLIPSE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A basic course in modern Turkish","description":"A comprehensive overview of the Kurmanji Kurdish language.

Works of Arthur Conan Doyle)","description":"The White Company, with Illustrations by N. C. Wyeth, is a historical adventure by Arthur Conan Doyle set during the Hundred Years' War. The story is set in England, France, and Spain, in the years 1366 and 1367, against the background of the campaign of Edward, the Black Prince to restore Peter of Castile to the throne of the Kingdom of Castile. The climax of the book occurs before the Battle of Najera. The \\"White Company\\" of the title is a free company of archers, led by one of the main characters. The name is taken from a real-life 14th-Century Italian mercenary company, led by John Hawkwood. At the age of twenty, young Alleyne, son of Edric, leaves the Catholic abbey where he has been raised-intelligent, skilled, and well-liked, though sheltered and naive-and goes out to see the world, in accordance with the terms of his father's will. The same day, the abbot banishes John of Hordle for worldly behavior: great appetite, teasing, and flirting. At the Pied Merlin inn, they make friends with veteran archer Sam Aylward who has returned to England from France to recruit for the White Company of mercenaries. Aylward has brought a request for Sir Nigel Loring of Christchurch to take command of the company. Aylward and John continue to Christchurch, while Alleyne detours to visit his older brother, the socman or landlord of Minstead, whose fierce reputation has grown to wickedness. The brothers meet for the first time since Alleyne was an infant and Alleyne finds that his brother is still furious their father gave three hides of land (80-120 acres) to the monastery for the boy's support. The socman threatens a lovely maiden, Maude, who escapes with Alleyne's aid and they flee on foot to find her horse. Maude makes a striking impression on the abbey-raised young man. When she hears that Alleyne intends to rejoin his friends to approach Sir Nigel Loring, Maude laughs. Alleyne meets up again with Aylward and Hordle John, and the three friends meet Sir Nigel and his formidable wife Mary. Alleyne is taken on as squire to Sir Nigel and as tutor to his daughter, who Alleyne discovers is the same Maude he saved from his evil brother. When the men eventually depart for France, the young couple admit their love, but only to each other. En route to Gascony, our heroes destroy pirates, then report to the court of the Prince of Wales in Bordeaux. After adventures fearful and funny, the valiant fighters lead the White Company to join the Prince. The Spanish and French attack them in a narrow ravine, where the mighty warriors are almost all destroyed and the Company must disband. John and Alleyne, badly wounded, survive, but Sir Nigel and Aylward are missing and presumed dead. The English go on to win the Battle of Najera, fulfilling the mission. The Prince knights Alleyne in his sick bed and, as the former socman has died, Sir Alleyne Edricson becomes the new socman of Minstead. He returns victorious with John as his squire, to snatch Maude from the doors of the nunnery and marry her. En route back to rescue their friends, all reunite for a happy ever after.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZAWhAQAACAAJ&dq=The+white+company,+(Author%27s+edition.+Works+of+Arthur+Conan+Doyle)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Quest for Corvo","description":"One day in 1925 a friend asked A.

Suku is the practice of confessing individual suffering in a political context and in a collective public forum. By interpreting Suku from the joint perspectives of political identity and subjective psychological identity, the aim of the book is to postulate a new paradigm for discussing social suffering and collective confession in a political context that represents the radical transformation in China's modern history. This book presents an analysis of the transformation of identity from the traditional to the modern, both for the individual peasant and for the state of China.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cXu6CgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Revolutionary%27s+Confession&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dutch Treat: 196 Applique Blocks Inspired by Delft Designs","description":"A huge library of 196 appliqu  blocks allows quilt makers to create their own unique project by mixing and matching their way to an inspired original design, and includes directions and tips for creating full-size quilts as well as smaller projects.

The volume upon the towns of the South brought closely to view the cosmopolitan character of the population which has settled our continent to the South and Southwest of the Appalachian wall. The stories of Baltimore, Washington, Richmond, Charleston, Savannah, and St. Augustine bring into view widely-different origins, experiences, and interests along a single stretch of coast; while Mobile and New Orleans, Knoxville, Nashville, and Louisville, Vicksburg and Little Rock, are groups representing chapters in our history which appear to have but slight connection save in the view of those who have closely studied the mainsprings of American development. The present volume represents even a wider range of historical interest. The attentive reader will, however, discover that although these towns of the far-stretching trans-Alleghany region have sprung from curiously divergent beginnings, and are apparently incongruous in composition and in aims, there really is and has been much in common among them. In order to understand Western history, one must first have knowledge of the details of the titanic struggle for settlement in North America, made respectively by Spain, France, and England. The early decline of Spanish power north of the Red and the Arkansas, save for the later temporary holding of Louisiana; the protracted tragedy which ended on the Plains of Abraham in the Fall of New France; the Revolution of the English colonists, and its portentous results; the Louisiana Purchase of 1803; the Mexican War, the episode of California, the story of Texas, with their consequent ousting of Spain from lands north of the Rio Grande and the Gila all these are factors bearing the closest relation to the history of the West, and consequently of many of the historic towns whose stories have been grouped within these covers. With these episodes of national rivalry, and consequent diplomacy and war, were intimately concerned the French fur-trade outposts of Detroit, Mackinac, Vincennes, and St. Louis, links in the forted chain which bound Canada and Louisiana, and by means of which it was sought to form a barrier against the Westward growth of the English colonies; also the Spanish stations of San Francisco, Monterey, Los Angeles, and Santa F , which were at once political vantage points and mission seats, for the spread of Spanish power and civilization from Mexico, among the brown barbarians of the North. St. Louis experienced both French and Spanish r gimes, while Mackinac, Detroit, and Vincennes were much affected by the period of English occupancy. As settlement grew upon the Atlantic coast, the English frontier was inevitably pushed farther and farther from tidewater. The hunter followed his game westward; so the forest trader, seeking the ever-receding camps of the aborigines, and, in due course, the raiser of cattle, horses, and swine who needed fresh pastures for his herds as tillage steadily encroached upon the wild lands of the border. At first timorously occupying the valleys and foothills of the eastern slopes, hunter, trader, and grazier, each in his turn, cautiously followed buffalo traces and Indian war-paths over the crest of the great range, and hailed with glee waters descending into the mysterious West. Not less formidable than the barriers reared by nature were those interposed by the savage, who with dismay saw his hunting grounds fast dwindling under the sway of the land-grabbing English; and by the jealous machinations of the military agents and fur traders of New France, who brooked no rivalry in their commercial exploitation of the forest.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=I0g0AueXMPoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bountiful Women: Large Women's Secrets for Living the Life They Desire","description":"Offers helpful advice on how larger women can overcome the modern prejudices about weight and beauty to live a fulfilling, satisfying life, presenting strategies for handling such challenges as tight seating on an airline, judgmental comments about one's size, and more.

These secret places are kept a secret because there are groups or organizations that do not feel you, the reader of this very book, can be trusted with these secrets.In his beginnings, Death Valley Jim was a lot like those who read his books. He combed through piles of research, many of which lead to dead ends and poorly documented sites. He also encountered outright refusal from rangers and other \\"protectors\\" when asked about these secret places. This frustration and secrecy is what has motivated him to continue the Secret Places in the Mojave Desert series - to help others like him with a genuine love and interest in the desert and the many treasures that lie within it find them and enjoy them.Our National Parks, Preserves, Monuments, and Forests were created with the intent of preserving the special natural wonders they behold. They were created for all of us to enjoy and explore! But how can these places be truly enjoyed if some of their greatest wonders are being kept a secret from the public? Every American pays taxes - and a portion of those taxes is used to preserve our national lands. And every American should be allowed to enjoy every square foot of them.This book focuses on the \\"secret\\" places within Death Valley National Park, and surrounding areas. You will not be able to find many of these locations in any other publication because they have been so fiercely protected by the powers that be. It is expected this book will be met with much criticism and resistance from many, but it is Jim's hope that just as the lovers of the desert and its history always have, they will continue to respect these natural and anthropological wonders. \\"Take only pictures and memories, leave only footprints.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1sTCrQEACAAJ&dq=Desert:+The+Mojave+and+Death+Valley&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spider-Man Vs.

It's August 1984, and paperboy Christopher Stewart has gone missing. Hours later, twelve-year-old Sammy Cox hurries home from his own paper route, red-faced and out of breath, hiding a terrible secret. Crystal, Sammy's seventeen-year-old sister, is worried by the disappearance but she also sees opportunity: the Stewart case has echoes of an earlier unsolved disappearance of another boy, one town over. Crystal senses the makings of an award winning essay, one that could win her a scholarship - and a ticket out of their small Iowa town. Officer Dale Goodkind can't believe his bad luck: another town and another paperboy kidnapping. But this time he vows that it won't go unsolved. As the abductions set in motion an unpredictable chain of violent, devastating events touching each life in unexpected ways, Dale is forced to face his own demons. Told through interwoven perspectives--and based on the real-life Des Moines Register paperboy kidnappings in the early 1980's--The Monsters We Make deftly explores the effects of one crime exposing another and the secrets people keep hidden from friends, families, and sometimes, even themselves.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yXe5DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Harley-Davidson: A Love Affair","description":"In the two world wars and beyond, the technical brilliance of Harley-Davidson has won admiration throughout the world.

Contingent faculty now constitutes the majority of faculty at U.S. colleges and universities. Analyzing the changing composition of the academic workforce, assessing the strength of new organizing initiatives among adjuncts, and weighing up their strategic options, this is the most comprehensive and engaged account to date of an issue that will become increasingly important for the future of higher education in the United States and in the global context.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OR-dAAAAMAAJ&dq=Reclaiming+the+Ivory+Tower:+Organizing+Adjuncts+to+Change+Higher+Education&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PIC in Practice, Second Edition: A Project -based Approach","description":"Updated to reflect the Project Management Institute s (PMI s) Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK?

Weinstein originally published in 1948 by the MacMillan Company in hardback. It was also republished in 1965 by Lancer in paperback. From 1948-1965 there were eight printings. It was a selection for the popular Book of the Month Club. In October 2013, BARBED-WIRE SURGEON will be republished once more by Deeds Publishing after being out of print for almost 50 years. A description of the book is best told by Dr. Weinstein himself from the Prologue.... This is a story of G.I. Joe in prison: how he lived, how he adjusted himself to life under the Nips, what he thought about and what he dreamed about. They were a motley, ragged, hungry throng. Under an ugly patina of filth and starvation, their basic individualities continued to glow feebly and occasionally to break forth into flame. Some were rugged, some were weak. As the months faded into years, the feeble faded out of the picture. In the witch's caldron of a Jap prison, G.I. Joe fought for his life with all the breaks against him. Against a somber tapestry of chronic hunger, starvation, and disease, a thin golden thread of the love of a man and woman weaves back and forth. It disappears for months and years, but is ever present. It snaps and breaks, but reappears more vibrant and glowing. Can a woman's love for her man be responsible for the survival of individuality in the face of pestilence and torture? In its broader aspects this is a tale of mankind with his veneer of civilization stripped away.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_9AYngEACAAJ&dq=Memoirs+of+a+Barbed+Wire+Surgeon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sun Came Down: The History of the World as My Blackfeet Elders Told It","description":"At the age of sixty-seven, Percy Bullchild (1915?1986), a Blackfeet Indian from Browning, Montana, with little formal education in English, set out to put the oral traditions and history of his people into a permanent written record.

Bullchild culled this remarkable collection of historical legends from his memory of the oral history as it was passed down to him by his elders and by seeking out the oral traditions of other tribes.

He stayed for ten years, first as a student and later as a correspondent for Time magazine. By the time he left, Karnow knew Paris so intimately that his French colleagues dubbed him \\"le plus parisien des Am ricains\\" --the most Parisian American. Now, Karnow returns to the France of his youth, perceptively and wittily illuminating a time and place like none other. Karnow came to France at a time when the French were striving to return to the life they had enjoyed before the devastation of World War II. Yet even during food shortages, political upheavals, and the struggle to come to terms with a world in which France was no longer the mighty power it had been, Paris remained a city of style, passion, and romance. Paris in the Fifties transports us to Latin Quarter caf s and basement jazz clubs, to unheated apartments and glorious ballrooms. We meet such prominent political figures as Charles de Gaulle and Pierre Mend s-France, as well as Communist hacks and the demagogic tax rebel Pierre Poujade. We get to know illustrious intellectuals, among them Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, Albert Camus, and Andr  Malraux, and visit the glittering salons where aristocrats with exquisite manners mingled with trendy novelists, poets, critics, artists, composers, playwrights, and actors. We meet Christian Dior, who taught Karnow the secrets of haute couture, and Prince Curnonsky, France's leading gourmet, who taught the young reporter to appreciate the complexities of haute cuisine. Karnow takes us to marathon murder trials in musty courtrooms, accompanies a group of tipsy wine connoisseurs on a tour of the Beaujolais vineyards, and recalls the famous automobile race at Le Mans when a catastrophic accident killed more than eighty spectators. Back in Paris, Karnow hung out with visiting celebrities like Ernest Hemingway, Orson Welles, and Audrey Hepburn, and in Paris in the Fifties we meet them too. A veteran reporter and historian, Karnow has written a vivid and delightful history of a charmed decade in the greatest city in the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vQlVP9jRTCIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diet Analysis Plus 7.0.1 Windows/Mac","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=sAAimFr12GYC&dq=Diet+Analysis+Plus+7.0.1+Windows/Mac&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death of a fool","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=s4pYngEACAAJ&dq=Death+of+a+fool&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vectorial mechanics","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=v8sEAAAAMAAJ&dq=Vectorial+mechanics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Epic of Gilgamesh (Classics (Prebound))","description":"In Noorse goden combineert bestsellerauteur Neil Gaiman de oude verhalen uit de mythologie van de Vikingen met de stijl van de 21e eeuw.

In his controversial study of America's giving habits, Arthur C. Brooks shatters stereotypes about charity in America-including the myth that the political Left is more compassionate than the Right. Brooks, a preeminent public policy expert, spent years researching giving trends in America, and even he was surprised by what he found. In Who Really Cares, he identifies the forces behind American charity: strong families, church attendance, earning one's own income (as opposed to receiving welfare), and the belief that individuals-not government-offer the best solution to social ills. But beyond just showing us who the givers and non-givers in America really are today, Brooks shows that giving is crucial to our economic prosperity, as well as to our happiness, health, and our ability to govern ourselves as a free people.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RkE4DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Object-Oriented Software Construction (Prentice-Hall International series in computer science)","description":"This volume aims to study how practicing software developers, in industrial as well as academic environments, can use object technology to improve the quality of the software they produce.

Recent debate continues to engage issues of energy authoritarianism, focusing on the contest between energy-driven globalization (the spread of energy deregulation and the simultaneous consolidation of the oil, coal, and gas industries) and the so-called \\"sustainable energy\\" strategy that celebrates the local and community scale characteristics of renewable energy. Including theoretical inquiries and case studies by distinguished writers, Transforming Power is divided into three parts: Energy, Environment, and Society; The Politics of Conventional Energy; and The Politics of Sustainable Energy. It interrogates current contemporary energy assumptions, exploring the reflexive relationship between energy, environment, and society, and examining energy as a social project. Some of these have promised a prosperous future founded upon technological advances that further modernize the modern energy system, such as \\"inherently safe\\" nuclear power, environmentally friendly coal gasification, and the advent of a wealthier, cleaner world powered by fuel cells; and the \\"green technologies,\\" said by advocates to prefigure a revival of human scale development, local self-determination, and a commitment to ecological balance. br This volume offers a timely engagement of the social issues surrounding energy conflicts and contradictions. It will be of interest to policymakers, energy and environmental experts, sociologists, and historians of technology.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gqs0DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Beginnings of English Law (Toronto Medieval Texts and Translations)","description":"Annotated edition of 7th century Kentish laws, with facing page translation and commentary.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=d0tfz9IqtxoC&dq=The+Beginnings+of+English+Law+(Toronto+Medieval+Texts+and+Translations)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Metaphor and Emotion: Language, Culture, and Body in Human Feeling (Studies in Emotion and Social Interaction)","description":"Are human emotions best characterized as biological, psychological, or cultural entities?

The view proposed here demonstrates how cultural aspects of emotions, metaphorical language about the emotions, and human physiology in emotion are all part of an intergrated system and shows how this system points to the reconciliation of the seemingly contradictory views of biological reductionism and social constructionism in contemporary debates about human emotion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dnRKu0WAn4sC&dq=Metaphor+and+Emotion:+Language,+Culture,+and+Body+in+Human+Feeling+(Studies+in+Emotion+and+Social+Interaction)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Medieval people,","description":"An exciting, hands-on collection of ideas and activities designed to introduce your students to life in Western Europe between 476 AD and 1500 AD.

In writing about the books which belong to this literature, Prof. Burkitt says very pointedly that \\"they are the most characteristic survival of what I will venture to call, with all its narrowness and its incoherence, the heroic age of Jewish history, the age when the nation attempted to realize in action the part of the peculiar people of God. It ended in catastrophe, but the nation left two successors, the Christian Church and the Rabbinical Schools, each of which carried on some of the old national aims. And of the two it was the Christian Church that was most faithful to the ideas enshrined in the Apocalypses, and it did consider itself, not without some reason, the fulfilment of those ideas. What is wanted, therefore, in studying the Apocalypses is, above all, sympathy with the ideas that underlie them, and especially with the belief in the New Age. And those who believe that in Christianity a new Era really did dawn for us ought, I think, to have that sympathy. . . . We study the Apocalypses to learn how our spiritual ancestors hoped again that God would make all right in the end; and that we, their children, are here today studying them is an indication that their hope was not wholly unfounded.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jVM3EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Power of the Machine: Global Inequalities of Economy, Technology, and Environment","description":"Hornborg argues that we are caught in a collective illusion about the nature of modern technology that prevents us from imagining solutions to our economic and environmental crises other than technocratic fixes. He demonstrates how the power of the machine generates increasingly asymmetrical exchanges and distribution of resources and risks between distant populations and ecosystems, and thus an increasingly polarized world order. The author challenges us to reconceptualize the machine-\\"industrial technomass\\"-as a species of power and a problem of culture. He shows how economic anthropology has the tools to deconstruct the concepts of production, money capital, and market exchange, and to analyze capital accumulation as a problem at the very interface of the natural and social sciences. His analysis provides an alternative understanding of economic growth and technological development. Hornborg's work is essential for researchers in anthropology, human ecology, economics, political economy, world-systems theory, environmental justice, and science and technology studies.

Terwijl de schappen en magazijnen uitpuilen, de inboxen en servers volstromen en de kiezer steeds meer te kiezen heeft, rijst de vraag: wat moet je doen om eruit te springen? Hoe val je duurzaam op in een wereld die steeds drukker wordt? En hoe zorg je ervoor dat mensen dan voor jou kiezen? Het antwoord blijkt even simpel als doeltreffend. In dit boek laat topstrateeg en ondernemer Roland van der Vorst zien hoe mensen, merken, systemen en idee?n boven komen drijven door hun concurrenten \`weg te camoufleren . Luchtig geschreven en met veel voorbeelden, maar minstens zoveel diepgang beschrijft hij de unieke principes van het duurzame opvallen. Het camouflage-effect is een must-have als je wilt begrijpen hoe je boven het maaiveld uit kunt komen.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VX5gBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grantville Gazette II","description":"A continuation of the saga that began in 1632 describes life for the inhabitants of Grantville, an American town from West Virginia that finds itself hurtled back in time and into the middle of the Thirty Years War, as they struggle to bring their advanced technology to seventeenth-century Germany, in an anthology featuring works by Mike Spehar and Danita Ewing, among others","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ASljN73vkWMC&dq=Grantville+Gazette+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Movements of Magic: The Spirit of T'Ai-Chi-Ch'Uan","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hDgDOAAACAAJ&dq=Movements+of+Magic:+The+Spirit+of+T%27Ai-Chi-Ch%27Uan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spanning Washington: Historic Highway Bridges Of The Evergreen State","description":"Designed first and foremost to be practical, bridges nevertheless are often breathtaking in their construction, combining function and aesthetics. The historic structures that span the Evergreen State's highways are no exception. These technological wonders are extraordinary by any measure, yet their stories have remained largely unknown. Conceived by visionary engineers and built by anonymous workmen, Washington's highway bridges are triumphs of skill, and played a significant role in the state's history. Several, at the time of their completion, attracted worldwide attention and the praise of professional engineers, influencing the course of bridge construction. In their quest to compile the first comprehensive history of the state's highway bridges, the authors poured through the extensive records at the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), collecting definitive documentation and photographs from across the state.

Sharing new insights from her landmark research on grit, MacArthur \\"genius\\" Angela Duckworth explains why talent is hardly a guarantor of success. Rather, other factors can be even more crucial such as identifying our passions and following through on our commitments. Drawing on her own powerful story as the daughter of a scientist who frequently bemoaned her lack of smarts, Duckworth describes her winding path through teaching, business consulting, and neuroscience, which led to the hypothesis that what really drives success is not \\"genius\\" but a special blend of passion and long-term perseverance. As a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, Duckworth created her own \\"character lab\\" and set out to test her theory. Here, she takes readers into the field to visit teachers working in some of the toughest schools, cadets struggling through their first days at West Point, and young finalists in the National Spelling Bee. She also mines fascinating insights from history and shows what can be gleaned from modern experiments in peak performance. Finally, she shares what she's learned from interviewing dozens of high achievers--from JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon to the cartoon editor of The New Yorker to Seattle Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll.

Longtime yacht broker and marine surveyor Henry Mustin has seen it all: the slow acceptance of those early, heavy boats; the market boom of the lighter boats of the 1970s; the \\"boat pox\\" scare of the 1980s; and the continued lack of industry standards that makes buying and owning a fiberglass boat an adventure. In Surveying Fiberglass Sailboats Mustin explains what to watch for in a used sailboat from each era, and how to ferret out the hidden defects in any boat. He shows how to estimate the cost of repairs and the value of a boat. And he addresses the question: When is a fiberglass boat too used up to save? Mustin's part-by-part look at hull, deck, rig, and machinery is both a minicourse for transforming used-boat shopping from a game of craps to a science, and the first step in a holistic boat maintenance program. His discussion of the significance of cracks found in aging hulls and decks is the most thorough in print. He is not shy in assessing the lack of regulation of professional surveyors, nor does he shrink from pointing a finger at shoddy building practices. Having a used boat surveyed is a critical prelude to buying it. Yet a professional survey is expensive--several hundred dollars. Surveying Fiberglass Sailboats will enable you to conduct your own surveys while narrowing the field, then monitor a professional surveyor's performance when selecting your target boat. The inside story on surveying fiberglass boats. No sailor should be without it. Praise for Surveying Fiberglass Sailboats: \\"A concisely written primer for sailors considering purchasing a used boat, preparing for extended cruising, or seeking guidelines for an ongoing maintenance program. . . .

She explained that, for almost a year, she had felt a pulling sensation in these areas. Although her doctor had assured her many times that it was nothing, probably just an after effect of the radiation treatment she had after her lumpectomy seven and a half years earlier, she still had a nagging concern about that odd tight feeling in her chest. When the technician took the films, it was five times more painful than when she did the routine compression shots of the breast. Tears were running down Lorraine s face, but she not dare move. Four days later, her doctor called. Lorraine, this is Dr. V. How long have you had that mass in your chest? You have to see a surgeon immediately. Lorraine asked herself why Dr. V had ignored her concerns all those times. She reprimanded herself for not seeking a second opinion when she first experienced that pulling sensation and did not feel comfortable with his lack of response to her concern. So many things went through her mind, yet memories of her own lumpectomy were just the tip of the iceberg. She relived the horror of more than thirty years earlier when, as a mother of three small children at age 22, she heard those terrible words from Dr. DeVillers about her 26-year old husband s cancer condition & four to six weeks the doctor had said. All of this flashed through her mind at speed warp ten ... literally in just a few seconds. Her life path had taken her through quite a few coaster rides throughout her 57 years, but all those were kiddy rides compared to this one. And so, the mother-of-all-roller coaster rides of life began with that fateful phone call from Dr. V. Lorraine Dube beat the odds. She beat that aggressive Stage 3 sarcoma lodged in her chest wall. But the battle was not without many, many scars. In the process, she lost five ribs, all her lymph nodes in the right arm area, a piece of her clavicle, most of the use of her right arm and hand \\"and nearly her life. After seven surgeries, chemotherapy treatments, experimental brachytherapy and countless battles with infection, including a flesh eating bacteria inside her chest wall, Lorraine Dube was cancer free but left suffering from chronic, debilitating pain, a souvenir from her ordeal that she would carry for the rest of her life. Lorraine was a survivor, always had been. But this time it was different. Why had God spared her from the terrible cancer and its aftermath of surgery, infections and lost body parts \\" only to leave her suffering from such unimaginable pain? The cancer was gone, but at what cost? What the heck was she supposed to do with the rest of her life? On her way to figuring it out, her daughter suggested that she write a book about her life. Don t worry about writing a best seller, Mom. Just write it from the heart. Write it for your grandsons. Five years later, Ms. Dube began writing this book, the story of her life. She tells the story of her life from the earliest recollections of childhood, through the sometimes rough years of adulthood all with a few purposes in mind. She wants to tell her grandsons about her history, their history, and to relate all her adult experiences some good, some bad, some easy, some tough, all with the purpose of showing them that they, too, are survivors like their Memere. Her message: Life may, indeed, be a roller coaster, but nothing is impossible. Somewhere along the line, writing this book became Lorraine s therapy. She began to make peace with, and sense of, the chronic pain that gripped her and kept her from leading the life she wanted, the life she expected. After all, her golden years were supposed to be her happiest.

When, how, and why we are here are questions that have caused countless generations of thinkers and laymen alike to intuitively seek at the very least the semblance of an answer to questions that have become more of an outlook than a science, and in turn spring up among the problems of modern life as opposed to allowing for a resolution to that which was intended to clarify instead of further complicate. Free from the shackles and bias imposed by the various schools of religious, scientific and philosophical thought, the examinations offered herein are rooted in systematic analyses of the scientific, philosophical, ethical, social and finally the religious; which in turn allows for the explanation and justification of concepts that enable the reader to adopt a perspective relevant to the distinctions of absolute truth and relativistic assumptions. Our age is accurately referred to as the age of advancement and technology and for good reason. The rapid pace of progression over the last century in the life sciences has contributed to a broadened understanding of knowledge itself and its relation to the psychological and sociological aspects of our existence. As a result of the significant expansion of the sciences, the desire for an understanding of self and simply of why has in many ways been diluted, thus negating the never ending questions that once tugged at man's conscious in the middle of the night for thousands of years. Today's amazing achievements have laid the foundation for a whole series of newer problems and questions that threaten mankind as never before. The medical and biological sciences have enabled us to have a life expectancy beyond that of prior generations, however coupled with that are the problems of population explosion, which in the not too distant future will give rise to serious concerns. We have the ability to harness the power of the atom, yet along with it comes the ability to destroy all that we hold sacred. Taking into consideration the advanced age we live in, how does one account for the remarkable complexity extant throughout the known universe? Is one to assume that our consciousness coupled with our overwhelming sense of purpose can be attributed solely to random chance alone? The law of causation deals with the need for a preceding event leading to the outcome, and despite the fact that this scientific age has left its handprint on every facet of life today, it has failed to satisfy the innate question of simply,.................................. why?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vHLU7hJboKoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Torpedo Run (Great railway adventure)","description":"The adventures of brother and sister Tuck and Billie Holden as they travel with their dog by train cross-country to join their parents at the 1939 World's Fair in New York.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yabW1bzdVrMC&dq=The+Torpedo+Run+(Great+railway+adventure)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clinical Imaging: An Atlas of Differential Diagnosis (Clinical Imaging: An Atlas of Diff Diag ( Eisenberg))","description":"Dr. Eisenberg's best seller is now in its Fifth Edition with brand-new material on PET and PET/CT imaging and expanded coverage of MRI and CT.

(Political Humor)","description":" A delightful and entertaining book about one of America s greatest humorists.  Seth Meyers This  absorbing, illuminating  (Jon Meacham) biography of the legendary political humorist reveals the life behind his must-read Washington Post columns, featuring never-before-published photos, documents, and interviews. Before Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Trevor Noah, and Doonesbury, there was Art Buchwald. For more than fifty years, from 1949 to 2006, Art Buchwald s Pulitzer Prizewinning column of political satire and biting wit made him one of the most widely read American humorists and a popular player in the Washington world of Ethel and Ted Kennedy, Ben Bradlee, and Katharine Graham. Dean Acheson, former U.S. Secretary of State, called Buchwald the  greatest satirist in the English language since Pope and Swift.  Drawing on Buchwald s most memorable columns and unpublished correspondence with other famous people, Funny Business shows how Art Buchwald became an American original. Like Mark Twain, Dorothy Parker, and James Thurber, he satirized political scoundrels, lampooned the powerful, and  worshipped the quicksand  that ten presidents walked on, as Buchwald joked.  The key to Buchwald s style of humor, he once stated, was to  treat light subjects seriously and serious subjects lightly.  But there was a darker, more serious side to Art Buchwald. A childhood spent in foster homes taught him to see comedy as a refuge. Buchwald also struggled with depression, a secret he kept from the public for nearly thirty years. This revealing book is studded with stories of Buchwald s friendships with Humphrey Bogart, John Steinbeck, Irwin Shaw, William Styron, Erma Bombeck, Frank Sinatra, Adam West (\\"Batman\\"), Robert Frost, and others. Throughout his career, Buchwald wrote about such historical events as the Vietnam War, the assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy, Watergate, and the 9/11 terrorist attack. Featured here are stories of Buchwald s nonstop one-liners, known in his day as  Buchshots.  Entertaining and absorbing, Funny Business looks back on Buchwald s brilliant gift for humor and satire, which will once again bring readers a comedic respite from troublesome times.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eLlBEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Raw Energy","description":"Presents recipes made with raw foods for trail mixes, parfaits, energy bars, juice blends, smoothies, soups, veggie chips, dips, candies, and cookies that contain less than 250 calories per serving.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qfAgn6i2Bf8C&dq=Raw+Energy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Waddesdon Manor: The Heritage of a Rothschild House","description":"Waddesdon Manor is one of the most extraordinary houses in England.

They're the natural relationship builders, master negotiators and persuaders, and agile and strategic thinkers.The good news for the rest of us is that those abilities can be developed. In The Leader's Brain: Enhance Your Leadership, Build Stronger Teams, Make Better Decisions, and Inspire Greater Innovation with Neuroscience, Wharton Neuroscience Initiative director Michael Platt explains how. Over two decades as a professor and practitioner in neuroscience, psychology, and marketing, Platt's pioneering research has deepened our understanding of how key areas of the brain work--and how that understanding can be applied in business settings. Neuroscience is providing answers to many of leadership's most vexing challenges. In The Leader's Brain, Platt explains: Why two managers, when presented with the same set of information, make very different decisions; Why some companies (Apple) build strong social and emotional connections with their customers and others do not (Samsung); How some of the most significant events in sports history, like the \\"Miracle on Ice,\\" contain insights for how to build a team; Why even some of the most visionary business leaders can make disastrous decisions, and how to fix that. The Leader's Brain relates findings like these, and many more, to help enhance leadership in an ever-shifting world entering a \\"new normal.\\" In this fast-reading and engaging guide, you'll gain actionable insights you can put into practice as a leader.

Marjorie Daw is a librarian, and takes her job  and indeed the truth of words  very seriously. She doesn t know it, but her world and ours  Roundworld  is in big trouble. On Discworld, a colossal row is brewing... The Wizards of Unseen University feel responsible for Roundworld (as one would for a pet gerbil). After all, they brought it into existence by bungling an experiment in Quantum ThaumoDynamics. But legal action is being brought against them by Omnians, who say that the Wizards  god-like actions make a mockery of their noble religion. As the finest legal brains in Discworld (a zombie and a priest) gird their loins to do battle  and when the Great Big Thing in the High Energy Magic Laboratory is switched on  Marjorie Daw finds herself thrown across the multiverse and right in the middle of the whole explosive affair. As God, the Universe and, frankly, Everything Else is investigated by the trio, you can expect world-bearing elephants, quantum gravity in the Escher-verse, evolutionary design, eternal inflation, dark matter, disbelief systems  and an in-depth study of how to invent a better mousetrap.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rIUUbB8g9O4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Why I Am a Christian Scientist","description":"A personal interpretation of the doctrines and practices of Christian Science, with extensive comment on the writings of Mary Baker Eddy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NHkJAQAAIAAJ&dq=Why+I+Am+a+Christian+Scientist&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pilgrim Thanksgiving","description":"Describes the Pilgrim's first year in the New World and first Thanksgiving.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zFg2DI3mxQgC&dq=Pilgrim+Thanksgiving&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bobby and His Cat","description":"Bobby and His Cat is an account of one man's life and death struggle against the debilitating effects of all but unspeakable childhood abuse.

Gordon Campbell, expert in Renaissance literatures, tells the fascinating and complex story of how this translation came to be commissioned, of who the translators were, and of how the translation was accomplished. The story does not end with the printing of that first edition, but introduces the subsequent generations who edited and interacted with the text. The present text of the King James Version differs in thousands of small details from the original edition. Campbell traces the textual history from 1611 to the establishment of the modern text by Oxford University Press in 1769. Attitudes to the King James Version have shifted through time and territory, ranging from adulation to deprecation and attracting the attention of a wide variety of adherents. It is more widely read in America today than in any other country, and its particular history in there is given due attention. Generously illustrated with reproductions taken from early editions, this volume helps to explain the enduring popularity of the King James Version throughout the world today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=05mIWA1BqrAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Mouse Among Us: and other critters","description":"The author's second collection of stories involving his alter ego Chester.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5GoAAAAACAAJ&dq=A+Mouse+Among+Us:+and+other+critters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thanksgiving Night","description":"This is the eleventh book in a 12-book Bedside Story Collection Series spanning across the 12 months of the year.

Each monthly story is unique and illustrated by the original drawings of children whose interpretation of the words can only be seen through their eyes. This November bedside story is entitled 'Twas the Night Before Thanksgiving.  It is a Thanksgiving story that unfolds in rhyme and introduces the great Ninja turkey. This November bedside story and all the stories are written to further the imagination of children and to strengthen the parent and child bond through the sharing of heartwarming, silly, absurd and believably impossible tales. Watch for December's bedside collection story The Magical Cane to Christmas' Journey that celebrates the warmth of the holiday season with a family whose children share the Christmas' past of their parents through the magic and wonder of a special candy cane. About the Author As a doctorate level practitioner serving school children for more than 35 years, Edward Galluzzi became keenly aware that children and their parents often had in short supply what families needed the most: open communication and sharing time together.  The Bedside Story Collection Series was written to provide families a moment here and a moment there to come together and share heart warming, silly and believably unbelievable tales. The stories are tied typically to the main holiday or theme of each month, more or less.  The characters in the stories are based on what children relate to the most ... animals and other children. There are also over 100 colored drawings sketched by children ranging from 7 months to 12 years of age.  The stories from Mr. Galluzzi's imagination and the drawings from theirs come together to stimulate the imaginations of children and open a whole new world for parents and their children to share. That is his gift to your family. Time for sharing ... time for laughing ... time for talking ... time for each other.

Representing academics, independent scholars, community organizers, and antiracist activists, the contributors are all leaders in the  second wave  of whiteness studies who collectively aim to combat the historical legacies of white supremacy and to inform those who seek to understand the changing nature of white identity, both in the United States and abroad. With essays devoted to theories of racial domination, comparative global racisms, and transnational white identity, the geographical reach of the volume is significant and broad. Dalton Conley writes on  How I Learned to Be White.  Allan B rub  discusses the intersection of gay identity and whiteness, and Mab Segrest describes the spiritual price white people pay for living in a system of white supremacy. Other pieces examine the utility of whiteness as a critical term for social analysis and contextualize different attempts at antiracist activism. In a razor-sharp introduction, the editors not only raise provocative questions about the intellectual, social, and political goals of those interested in the study of whiteness but assess several of the topic s major recurrent themes: the visibility of whiteness (or the lack thereof); the  emptiness  of whiteness as a category of identification; and conceptions of whiteness as a structural privilege, a harbinger of violence, or an institutionalization of European imperialism.

CBS radio broadcaster William L.

First, it allows compilers to be generated automatically. The compilers are realistic in the sense that they compile programs as efficiently as hand crafted compilers do, and the object programs they produce run as efficiently as the object programs produced by hand crafted compilers. The second advantage is that it makes it easier to comprehend and write the semantics than other methods.The book demonstrates a working compiler generator called MESS which is used to generate a realistic compiler for a Pascal-like language. The generated compiler is then compared with several hand crafted compilers and shown to have at least comparable, and in some cases superior, performance.Peter Lee is Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University.

For years, Cale is forced to endure life as a slave, sold and shuffled from one group of brutish thugs to another until a trader recognizes a glimmer of promise in Cale s eyes, and frees him. Cale travels far and wide, but he never forgets what happened long ago, in the desert wastes . . . when, in a strange, ancient temple, he found a book with pages made of a strange metal, and writings he could not identify. When he finally reaches Morningstar, he comes to realize that the book is a key to understanding a language never heard by mankind, an alien dialect. It also holds a secret that some people want to learn, a treasure that some want for themselves, and a revelation that some will do anything to control.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qrdj1God1MUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Poachin\\\\' Parson: Tall Tales and Short Stories from a Circuit Riding Preacher","description":"A preacher wrote this collection of absolutely essential nonsense. It is guaranteed that every word you read will be the purely fabricated and well-garnished truth based on solid and verifiable fiction. By necessity, the names of some of the folk on these pages have been changed in order to protect their guilt. The preacher is a sometime fisherman and an every-chance-I-get hunter. He holds charter membership in one of the most notorious and exclusive sporting clubs in all of North America. And it is because of his frequent association with fellow members that he sometimes has difficulty handling the truth without taking some awful liberties with it. You would too, if you hung around with the likes of this crew. He has traveled over a lot of the real estate of our wonderful globe. He has seen the beauty of Galilee's sea and Australia's great coral reefs, Hawaii's silver sand and Canada's magnificent Rockies. He has traveled by dugout log canoe to headwaters of the mighty Amazon and gazed on Niagara Falls. He's been from the bottom of the Grand Canyon to the top of the Sears Tower. But the most beautiful sights in this world, he declares, are seen from the top of Pole Creek ridge, Marble Creek pass, the knob on Greenhorn Mountain and an elk stand in Eastern Oregon.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6YEBN-GsYaIC&dq=Confessions+of+a+Poachin%5C%27+Parson:+Tall+Tales+and+Short+Stories+from+a+Circuit+Riding+Preacher&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lost Flying Boat","description":"A post-WWII adventure from the bestselling author of The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner. A top-secret mission sends a crew of Royal Air Force veterans from South Africa to the subarctic Kerguelen Islands in this suspense-packed tale of lawlessness, piracy, obsession, and greed. At the helm of the Aldebaran, a huge flying boat, sits the monomaniacal Captain Bennett, a man hell-bent on unearthing a treasure buried by the Germans in the final days of World War II. And on the seaplane s radio is the young wireless operator Adcock, a man who listens to everything and tries to make sense of it all. The rest of the ex-soldiers on board seek either riches or adventure but all are fleeing the frustrations and disappointments of their postwar lives. As the voyage takes dangerous turns toward natural and manmade threats, it becomes clear that Captain Bennett is keeping secrets and the Aldebaran is not alone on her quest. Adcock s morals are soon put to the test, machine guns are mounted on the flying boat s turrets, and the thirst for gold may cost the crew their lives.

Focusing on the See America First slogan and idea employed at different times by railroads, guidebook publishers, Western boosters, and Good Roads advocates, she describes both the modern marketing strategies used to promote tourism and the messages of patriotism and loyalty embedded in the tourist experience. She shows how tourists as consumers participated in the search for a national identity that could assuage their anxieties about American society and culture. Generously illustrated with images from advertisements, guidebooks, and travelogues, See America First demonstrates that the promotion of tourist landscapes and the consumption of tourist experiences were central to the development of an American identity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=V6FfBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Night Before Kindergarten","description":"In the narrative tradition of \\"The Night Before Christmas,\\" shows children from all over town preparing for their first day of kindergarten, imagining what wonders they will see.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K4coEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Night+Before+Kindergarten&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Become Totally Positive Auto-Matically (While-U Drive)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7dMSAQAAMAAJ&dq=Become+Totally+Positive+Auto-Matically+(While-U+Drive)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Stitch in Time (Quilt Trilogy, Volume 1)","description":"Trying to hold the family together after her mother's death, Hannah worries about her sense of purpose when her father returns to the sea and her younger siblings become self-sufficient, and Hannah decides to make a wonderful quilt.

Looks at animal telepathy and the ability of pigeons to home. ? Proves the point that \\"big questions don't need big science\\". ? Noted scientist Rupert Sheldrake is a former research fellow of the Royal Society. ? New Edition with an Update on Results. How does your pet \\"know\\" when you are coming home? How do pigeons \\"home\\"? Can people really feel a \\"phantom\\" amputated arm? These questions and more form the basis of Sheldrake's look at the world of contemporary science as he puts some of the most cherished assumptions of established science to the test. What Sheldrake discovers is that certain scientific beliefs are so widely taken for granted that they are no longer regarded as theories but are seen as scientific common sense. In the true spirit of science, Sheldrake examines seven of these beliefs. Refusing to let intellectual dogmatism influence his search for the truth, Sheldrake presents simple experiments that allow the curious and the skeptical to join in his journey of discovery. His experiments look at how scientific research is often biased against unexpected patterns that emerge and how a researcher's expectations can influence the results. He also examines the taboo of taking pets seriously and explores the question of human extrasensory perception. Perhaps most important, he questions the notion that science must be expensive in order to achieve important results, showing that inexpensive methods can indeed shake the very foundations of science as we know it. In this compelling and intelligent book, Sheldrake offers no preconceived wisdom or easy answers--just an open invitation to explore the unknown, create new science, and perhaps, even change the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u14oDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Michelangelo: Painter - Sculptor - Architect","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9HIkAQAAMAAJ&dq=Michelangelo:+Painter+-+Sculptor+-+Architect&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Two Spirit People: American Indian Lesbian Women and Gay Men (Monograph Published Simultaneously As the Gay & Lesbian Social Services , Vol 6, No 2)","description":"Two Spirit People is the first-ever look at social science research exploration into the lives of American Indian lesbian women and gay men. Editor Lester B. Brown posits six gender styles in traditional American Indian culture: men and women, not-men and not-women (persons of one biological sex assuming the identity of the opposite sex in some form), and gays and lesbians. He brings together chapters that emphasize American Indian spirituality, present new perspectives, and provide readers with a beginning understanding of the place of lesbian, gay, and bisexual Indians within American Indian culture and within American society. This beginning will help you understand these unique people and the special challenges and multiple prejudices they face. Traditionally, American Indian cultures showed great respect and honor for alternative gender styles, since these were believed to be part of the sacred web of life. If the Great Spirit chose to create alternative sexualities or gender roles, who was bold enough to oppose such power? If one s spiritual quest revealed one s identity to be that of not-woman, not-man, gay, or lesbian, who should defy their calling? The interpretation of contemporary American Indian religions that gay American Indians retain sacred rights within Indian cultures, and that they can share this gift with others, have implications for therapy, identity formation, social movements, and general human relations. Social workers and other human service professionals, American Indian studies students, sociologists, anthropologists, and lesbian and gay scholars will find Two Spirit People enlightening and a significant contribution to the development of professional interventions for oppressed groups that is ethnically and culturally sensitive. Only by understanding the belief systems from which these oppressed groups come will you begin to really help them achieve positive change. You will become better equipped to specifically help gay and lesbian American Indians as you gain insight into: American Indian alternative gender styles social service issues for American Indian lesbians and gay men American Indian not-men and not-women and their choosing ceremonies American Indian lesbian and gay identity development American Indian lesbian and gay literature AIDS and American Indians Two Spirit People helps you see that family and community acceptance of lesbians and gays is possible. The families of American Indian lesbians and gays do not usually abandon them, thus helping them face a generally unaccepting American milieu.

The book challenges the usual interpretation of statues, reliefs and figurines as passive things to be looked at or worshipped, and reveals them instead as active artefacts designed to be used, handled and broken. It is made clear that the placing of images in temples or graves may not have been the only episode in their biographies, and a single image may have gone through several existences before its working life was over. Miranda Aldhouse Green examines a wide range of other issues, from gender and identity to foreignness, enmity and captivity, as well as the significance of the materials used to make the images. The result is a comprehensive survey of the multifarious functions and experiences of images in the communities that produced and consumed them. Challenging many previously held assumptions about the meaning and significance of Celtic and Roman art, An Archaeology of Images will be controversial yet essential reading for anyone interested in this area.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g9SAAgAAQBAJ&dq=An+Archaeology+of+Images:+Iconology+and+Cosmology+in+Iron+Age+and+Roman+Europe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Randolph Scott: A Film Biography","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CU11QgAACAAJ&dq=Randolph+Scott:+A+Film+Biography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Solve Word Problems in Arithmetic","description":"Most 9th grade math, or \\"Algebra 1,\\" textbooks are structured in such a way that students find it extremely difficult to apply pertinent mathematical concepts and skills to the solving of word problems.

But the expedition was a failure, and half of the party  nineteen men, women and children of different nationalitieswere cast adrift on an ice floe off the coast of Ellesmere Island, where they endured six desperate months of starvation, bloodshed and other horrors. Afterlands, a profoundly moving and gripping book, takes characters drawn from history and transforms their experiences into an absorbing tale of unrequited love, unsettled scores and the high cost of loyalty. The novel begins in 1876, when three of the survivors  George Tyson, Tukulito and Roland Krugerare uneasily reunited four years after they were rescued from the ice. They are still inextricably connected by their ordealand Tyson has recently published an account of their shattering experiences which casts Kruger as a spy and villain, and disgraces Tukulito as well. What happened on the ice, as Afterlands explores, was far more complex. The heart of the book moves between Tyson s diaries and a riveting narrative of Arctic survival. From the moment they are set adrift, and even before, Kruger and Tyson seem destined to clash: Kruger is an intelligent individualist, an outsider who refuses to be loyal to any one country; Tyson, meanwhile, is a flawed but sometimes brilliant leader, a man who needs to constantly be testing himself against the world. Brave but also insecure, he is unable to stop the German contingent of his party from banding together under their national flag in an armed near-mutiny on the drifting ice. The third key character in this book, Tukulito, was the Arctic s first professional interpreter. Known also as Hannah, she moves between two worlds: expert at gutting a seal, she has also had tea with Queen Victoria. Her different roles  translator, mother, mender, marksman  keep the party from disaster, as suspicion and violence increase. And the quiet, impossible passion Kruger feels for her almost redeems their lives in a frozen hell. But Afterlands is also a novel about what follows the life-changing event: the long shadow it casts, as well as the conflicting stories that compete to become historical record. Back in the world, the protagonists will experience various degrees of tragedy. Tukulito s is perhaps the most personal, while Tyson, who sought only to gain the world s esteem, is disgraced by later failure. Kruger, meanwhile, attempts to disappear into Mexico, again seeking a place beyond  the colonels of the world   but he finds himself, perhaps inevitably, drawn once more into the unending conflicts between nations, between peoples. This novel is a triumph of storytelling from one of Canada s most acclaimed writers. Gripping and beautiful, it is a scintillating exploration of the extremes of human experience. Afterlands brilliantly examines both a devastating encounter with the natural world and the unrelenting demands of the human heart.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zquXJ28dfb8C&dq=Afterlands:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"W.

Engaging, opinionated, inspiring, and occasionally irreverent, Hunting for Frogs on Elston pays tribute to Chicago's natural history while celebrating one of its greatest champions. Published in association with the Chicago Wilderness coalition, Hunting for Frogs on Elston comprehensively chronicles Chicagoland's unique urban ecology, from its indigenous prairie and oft-delayed seasons to its urban coyotes and passenger pigeons. In witty, informed prose, Sullivan evokes his adventures netting dog-faced butterflies, hunting rattlesnakes, and watching fireflies mate. Inspired by regional flora and fauna, Sullivan ventures throughout the metropolis and its environs in search of sludge worms, gyrfalcons, and wild onions. In reporting his findings to otherwise oblivious urbanites, Sullivan endeavors to make \\"alienated, atomized, postmodern people feel at home, connected to something beyond ourselves.\\" In the sprawling Chicagoland region, where an urban ecosystem teeming with remarkable life evolves between skyscrapers and train tracks, no writer chronicled the delicate balance of nature and industry more vividly than Jerry Sullivan. An homage to the urban ecology Sullivan loved so dearly, Hunting for Frogs on Elston is his fitting legacy as well as a lasting gift to the urban naturalist in us all.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kQ-sNcgHMaYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Turn of the Tide","description":"After a devastating tsunami in Japan, cousins Jet and Kai spend the summer together in Astoria, Oregon, training for the Young's Bay Treasure Island sailboat race and become close friends in the process.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kYzmDQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Turn+of+the+Tide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bureaucracy","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Masters of the Modern Short Story","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BA8jAAAAMAAJ&dq=Masters+of+the+Modern+Short+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"While The Rivers Run","description":"Traveling to more than thirty countries to define the scientific, economic, and historical dimensions of the water crisis, offers a solution based on managing the water cycle for the maximum social good, rather than pure self-interest.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=C0_q-90H1aAC&dq=While+The+Rivers+Run&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Expert Web Services Security in the .NET Platform","description":"* Only up to date book for the latest version of .NET * Concentrates on Web services not general .NET security * Describes the key aspects of Windows Operating System security, Internet Information Services security, and ASP.NET Security, laying the foundation for a complete discussion of Web Services security in the .NET Platform. * Shows how to use the WS-Security W3C specifications for industry  standard authentication, encryption, authorization, Xml signature, attachments and routing with Web Services. * Teaches the reader how to use the new WSE (Web Services Software Development Kit) from Microsoft. * Shows how to integrate Web Services security into the applications developers write with specific working code examples and explanations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tcY-K2XHutIC&dq=Expert+Web+Services+Security+in+the+.NET+Platform&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Master Techniques in Podiatric Surgery: The Foot and Ankle","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z61PYgEACAAJ&dq=Master+Techniques+in+Podiatric+Surgery:+The+Foot+and+Ankle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Granny's Chips","description":"April 2003.

From the movemen'ts dawn-song or prelude in Granny's Wonderful Chair to such contemporary tales as Watership Down, fantasy writers have thrown open 'magic casements' on worlds filled with marvels, fresh insights, and a very special joy.

Renaissance of Wonder begins with a study of the achievement of George MacDonald, one of the key figures in this movement. Marion Lochhead then traces the development of the genre through the writings of Juliana Ewing, Mrs. Molesworth, Mary de Morgan ('Mrs. Oakchest'), E.

Beautiful Symmetry is a coloring book about math, inviting us to engage with mathematical concepts visually through coloring challenges and visual puzzles. We can explore symmetry and the beauty of mathematics playfully, coloring through ideas usually reserved for advanced courses. The book is for children and adults, for math nerds and math avoiders, for educators, students, and coloring enthusiasts. Through illustration, language that is visual, and words that are jargon-free, the book introduces group theory as the mathematical foundation for discussions of symmetry, covering symmetry groups that include the cyclic groups, frieze groups, and wallpaper groups. The illustrations are drawn by algorithms, following the symmetry rules for each given group. The coloring challenges can be completed and fully realized only on the page; solutions are provided. Online, in a complementary digital edition, the illustrations come to life with animated interactions that show the symmetries that generated them. Traditional math curricula focus on arithmetic and the manipulation of numbers, and may make some learners feel that math is not for them. By offering a more visual and tactile approach, this book shows how math can be for everyone. Combining the playful and the pedagogical, Beautiful Symmetry offers both relaxing entertainment for recreational colorers and a resource for math-curious readers, students, and educators.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6r34DwAAQBAJ&dq=Symmetry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rogues Island Memoir (Folk Literature Sixties Series)","description":"\\"Bracing and beautiful . . .

In Racial Revolutions the first book-length study of racial formation in Brazil that centers on Indianness Jonathan W. Warren draws on extensive fieldwork and numerous interviews to illuminate the discursive and material forces responsible for this resurgence in the population. The growing number of pardos who claim Indian identity represents a radical shift in the direction of Brazilian racial formation. For centuries, the predominant trend had been for Indians to shed tribal identities in favor of non-Indian ones. Warren argues that many factors including the reduction of state-sponsored anti-Indian violence, intervention from the Catholic church, and shifts in anthropological thinking about ethnicity have prompted a reversal of racial aspirations and reimaginings of Indianness. Challenging the current emphasis on blackness in Brazilian antiracist scholarship and activism, Warren demonstrates that Indians in Brazil recognize and oppose racism far more than any other ethnic group. Racial Revolutions fills a number of voids in Latin American scholarship on the politics of race, cultural geography, ethnography, social movements, nation building, and state violence.

It is an extensive and comprehensive work about the life of Howard Robert Hughes. It is biographical in nature and is thought to contain the most complete, in-depth, far-reaching, and extensive first-hand personal information available about him. As such, it promises to provide the reader with numerous additional insights into this man. Under normal circumstances this book about Howard Hughes would normally have been written years ago. Despite this, the mystery and intrigue attributed to him has only partially mellowed with the passing of time. The \\"wall of reclusiveness\\" that he created to isolate himself from the media produced a shortage of information about him that still \\"begs\\" to be satisfied. The content of this book accomplishes what most people want to know about him--what he thought, what he said, what he felt, what he did, and what he was about, in his everyday business and private-time activities. Much of the basic information in The Mysterious Howard Hughes Revealed comes from a confidential employee to Howard Hughes named Chuck Waldron, who shares, in a very respectful and forthright manner, some of the very human characteristics that Howard Hughes possessed. It is through this \\"confidential employee,\\" and many other sources of information, that the reader is allowed to see the strengths, weaknesses, and even the oddities of Howard Hughes. By design, the thrust of this story begins on January 1, 1970, and tells of the last seven years, three months, and four days in his life, until his death on April 5, 1976 (Howard Hughes' most reclusive years). Against this frameword there is much more information included and inserted in the numerous \\"flashbacks\\" about his personal life found in records, recordings, stories, and historical events that parallel his entire life and adds significantly to the Howard Hughes story. Because of his reclusiveness it was difficult for people to really get to know him. As a result of this book, those who read it will come away with the feeling that they know Howard Hughes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YY7lL12CcyYC&dq=The+Mysterious+Howard+Hughes+Revealed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Webster's New Encyclopedia of Dictionaries: 30 Reference Sections","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FhGmtwAACAAJ&dq=Webster%27s+New+Encyclopedia+of+Dictionaries:+30+Reference+Sections&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Donavan (Silhouette Romance)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=01MvJbyAINkC&dq=Donavan+(Silhouette+Romance)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When the Earth Nearly Died: Compelling Evidence of a World Cataclysm 11,500 Years Ago","description":"Historical geography.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sm1NAQAAIAAJ&dq=When+the+Earth+Nearly+Died:+Compelling+Evidence+of+a+World+Cataclysm+11,500+Years+Ago&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Importance of Being Earnest and Other Plays","description":"Offers newly edited texts of five of the British playwright's works, including the great farcial comedy \\"The Importance of Being Earnest.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a53An7aoEAYC&dq=The+Importance+of+Being+Earnest+and+Other+Plays&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Closed My Eyes","description":"Award-winning journalist and author Michele Weldon offers a distinctly honest and articulate portrayal of the domestic violence she experienced in a nine-year marriage to a man many considered to be the perfect husband.

Alexander Calder is one of the most beloved and widely admired artists of the twentieth century. Anybody who has ever set foot in a museum knows him as the inventor of the mobile, America's unique contribution to modern art. But only now, forty years after the artist's death, is the full story of his life being told in this biography, which is based on unprecedented access to Calder's letters and papers as well as scores of interviews. Jed Perl shows us why Calder was--and remains--a barrier breaker, an avant-garde artist with mass appeal. This beautifully written, deeply researched book opens with Calder's wonderfully peripatetic upbringing in Philadelphia, California, and New York. Born in 1898 into a family of artists--his father was a well-known sculptor, his mother a painter and a pioneering feminist--Calder went on as an adult to forge important friendships with a who's who of twentieth-century artists, including Joan Mir , Marcel Duchamp, Georges Braque, and Piet Mondrian. We move through Calder's early years studying engineering to his first artistic triumphs in Paris in the late 1920s, and to his emergence as a leader in the international abstract avant-garde. His marriage in 1931 to the free-spirited Louisa James--she was a great-niece of Henry James--is a richly romantic story, related here with a wealth of detail and nuance. Calder's life takes on a transatlantic richness, from New York's Greenwich Village in the Roaring Twenties, to the Left Bank of Paris during the Depression, and then back to the United States, where the Calders bought a run-down old farmhouse in western Connecticut. New light is shed on Calder's lifelong interest in dance, theater, and performance, ranging from the Cirque Calder, the theatrical event that became his calling card in bohemian Paris to collaborations with the choreographer Martha Graham and the composer Virgil Thomson. More than 350 illustrations in color and black-and-white--including little-known works and many archival photographs that have never before been seen--further enrich the story.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0Q8cDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cybercounseling and Cyberlearning: Strategies and Resources for the Millennium","description":"Twenty-seven contributions exploring issues involved in on-line counseling are presented by Bloom (education, Butler U.) and Walz (director, Educational Resources Information Center's Counseling and Student Services Clearinghouse (ERIC/CASS), U. of North Carolina).

Lawyer, philosopher, statesman and defender of Rome's Republic, Cicero was a master of eloquence, and his pure literary and oratorical style and strict sense of morality have been a powerful influence on European literature and thought for over two thousand years in matters of politics, philosophy, and faith. This selection demonstrates the diversity of his writings, and includes letters to friends and statesmen on Roman life and politics; the vitriolic Second Philippic Against Antony; and his two most famous philosophical treatises, On Duties and On Old Age - a celebration of his own declining years. Written at a time of brutal political and social change, Cicero's lucid ethical writings formed the foundation of the Western liberal tradition in political and moral thought that continues to this day. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

Owing to its forthright dealing with God s wrath and His intense hatred of sin and the sinner, it is also one of the most controversial. Indeed, for more than three-quarters of the sermon Edwards lays down a relentless stream of the most vivid and horrifying descriptions of the danger facing unregenerate men. While it is difficult to read such graphic language, there is abundant hope in the sermon s conclusion. Edwards puts it this way,  And now you have an extraordinary opportunity, a day wherein Christ has thrown the door of mercy wide open and stands calling and crying with a loud voice to poor sinners.  While those who would rather ignore God s justice in favor of His mercy condemn Edwards and his sermon, those who were present and actually heard him preach that day reacted in a decidedly different manner. According to the diary of Reverend Stephen Williams who attended the sermon,  Before the sermon was done there was a great moaning and crying through the whole House,  what shall I do to be saved; oh, I am going to hell, etc.   The diary goes on to indicate that Edwards had to interrupt his sermon and come down to minister to those who were under such awful conviction. And so, in spite of what the scoffers might think or say,  the amazing and astonishing power of God  was manifested among the people that day with many falling not into the hands of an angry God, but into the arms of a mighty Savior.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BGGpDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Palestine","description":"Uses a comic book format to shed light on the complex and emotionally-charged situation of Palestinian Arabs, exploring the lives of Israeli soldiers, Palestinian refugees, and children in the Occupied Territories.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_wAW5RgyxPcC&dq=Palestine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mathematics Core Course for a Level","description":"Written for the Edexcel Syllabus B and similar schemes offered by the Awarding Bodies, this book incorporates modern approaches to mathematical understanding.

Krishnamurti results in the understanding of the important differences there are between conscious awareness and awareness which is not consciousness, perception with a perceiver and perceiverless perception, abstract truth and living truth, and most importantly between a partially functioning and a totally functioning, that is, a truly silent, meditative mind. The truly silent, meditative mind is mind that is completely silent, but not merely made silent by partial mind functioning. In Beyond Metaphysics Revisited, J. Richard Wingerter examines past philosophy, specifically metaphysics, to show that though metaphysicians asked important and highly significant questions, the answers they provided to these questions were meaningless or nonsensical because they unduly limited the mind to conscious awareness and to its partial functioning. These same limitations are present in contemporary philosophy and thus there is need not only to go beyond past metaphysical aspects of philosophy but also beyond the restrictions that are there in contemporary philosophy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j7EDAAAACAAJ&dq=Beyond+Metaphysics+Revisited:+Krishnamurti+and+Western+Philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bungalow Mystery/The Mystery at Lilac Inn (Nancy Drew, Book 3-4)","description":"More information to be announced soon on this forthcoming title from Penguin USA","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y71WIS5jdfUC&dq=The+Bungalow+Mystery/The+Mystery+at+Lilac+Inn+(Nancy+Drew,+Book+3-4)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Birthright: The Book of Man","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RsBVPwAACAAJ&dq=Birthright:+The+Book+of+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of the Norwegian people in America","description":"Background history of Norway, immigration, organizations and people in Norweigna-America.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nPLUAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Last Four Days","description":"A dark and unexpected novel about a Dublin undertaker who finds himself on the wrong side of the Irish mob.

One night driving home after an unexpected encounter with a client, Paddy hits a pedestrian crossing the street. He pulls over and gets out of his car, intending to do the right thing. As he bends over to help the man, he recognizes him. It's Donal Cullen, brother of one of the most notorious mobsters in Dublin. And he's dead. Shocked and scared, Paddy jumps back in his car and drives away before anyone notices what's happened. The next morning, the Cullen family calls Gallagher's to oversee the funeral arrangements.

In this study, Burrows draws on social psychological research into the cognitive and socio-motivational components of stereotyping to explore the forces underlying the creation and development of the fabliau priest. Through an assessment of the constituent elements of the figure against a background of a range of literary and historical sources, Burrows demonstrates that the literary figure is the product of the specific socio-historical context of contemporaneous changes in relationships between Church and laity in which anticlerical stereotyping, in a manner comparable to other instances of outgroup derogation, can be attributed to a quest for positive social identity and ingroup solidarity on the part of an inscribed lay audience.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aRkGj2gGe3kC&dq=The+Stereotype+of+the+Priest+in+the+Old+French+Fabliaux:+Anticlerical+Satire+And+Lay+Identity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Brief Guide to Beliefs: Ideas, Theologies, Mysteries, and Movements","description":"Coves the major faiths including alternative movements, neo-paganism, and New Age, offering a comprehensive introduction to each that covers contemporary issues regarding God and the supernatural.

Professor Wickham surveys the foundations on which this dramatic art was built: the architecture, costumes and ceremonial of the imperial court at Byzantium, the liturgies of countires in the Eastern and Western Empires and the triumph of the Roman rite and the Romanesque style in Western art. Within this context Professor Wickham describes three major influences upon the drama: religion, recreation and commerce. The first produced the liturgical music drama rooted in praise of Christ the King, vernacular Corpus Christi drama, Saint Plays and Moralities centred on the humanity of Christ. The second gave rise to the secular theatres of social recreation based on the games and dances of village communities ad the more sophisticated sex and war games of the nobility. The section on commerce shows how the development of the drama was intimately related to questions of funding and management which led, during the sixteenth century, to the substitution of a professional for an amateur theatre, and to a growing emphasis on stage spectacle. For this third edition the author has added a substantial section on monastic reform and its effect on Biblical translation and the use of allegory; a final chapter charts the transition in different European countries from this medieval Gothic theatre to the neoclassical methods of play construction and representation which flourished for the next two hundred years. The book gorges a coherent pattern through a very large and complicated subject. It is an excellent introduction to medieval theatre for undergraduates and to the growing number of theatregoers who enjoy contemporary revivals of medieval plays. A large plate section gives a pictorial version of the story, using photographs of contemporary manuscript illuminations, mosaics, frescoes, paintings and sculptures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hkg6Cd-WhgcC&dq=The+Medieval+Theatre&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Systems and Transforms With Applications in Optics","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gqoeAQAAIAAJ&dq=Systems+and+Transforms+With+Applications+in+Optics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sayings of Buddha","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Nyt3AAAACAAJ&dq=Sayings+of+Buddha&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Intruders","description":"Assigned to a Marine unit on an aircraft carrier, Navy Lt.

He also scored top grades, excelled in sports and shared his money and toys with the children who ridiculed him. From the second grade on, he was subjected to psychiatric examination, regularly confounding the experts. Years later, while serving in Vietnam, Arthur John Shawcross wrote bloodcurdling letters about his battlefield ordeals, then returned to Watertown to commit a string of arsons and burglaries. He served two years in prison, was paroled to his respectable parents - and murdered a boy and a girl. Back in the penitentiary, he proved as enigmatic as ever. Some counselors saw him as a Frankenstein monster, beyond hope, irredeemable. To others he was a troubled young man who could be saved. No two psychiatrists seemed to agree. Shawcross served fifteen years, then conned a parole board into an early release. He settled in Binghamton, but angry citizens learned of his bloody history and ran him out of town. After two smaller communities turned him away, desperate parole authorities finally smuggled the child-killer into Rochester in the dead of night - neglecting to alert the local police. Soon the corpses started turning up, locked in winter ice, covered by reeds in swamps, floating in streams. The homicidal pedophile had changed his M.O., this time murdering diminutive women. As the body count grew, Rochester streets swarmed with police, and still the serial killer managed to snare his tenth victim, then his eleventh. Amazon.com Accounts of more famous serial killers like Ted Bundy or Jeffrey Dahmer may have ghoulish entertainment value, but I agree with writer Darcy O'Brien that this meticulously factual study of child sex-murderer Arthur Shawcross \\"comes closer to capturing the psychology of a serial killer than anything else I've ever read.\\" The strength of this book (semi-finalist for a 1994 Edgar Award) comes first from the quality of the materials--including first-person interviews with the killer's wives, girlfriends, co-workers, police officers, therapists, and even a prostitute who \\"played dead\\" for Shawcross--and second, from Olsen's ability to weave the information into a highly readable story that reveals, above all, the ineffectiveness of our system of rehabilitation and parole. From Publishers Weekly An experienced and skilled writer, Olsen ( Predator ) proves himself equal to the formidable task of studying serial killer Arthur Shawcross. Born in 1945 in upstate New York, Shawcross was perceived as different even in childhood (his classmates dubbed him \\"Oddie,\\" and elementary school officials called for mental health evaluations). In the early '70s he murdered two children and was sentenced to up to 25 years in prison; he served less than 15 years before he was paroled in 1987. He was difficult to place--townspeople drove him out as soon as his past became known. After three such episodes, parole officials sent him surreptitiously to Rochester, N.Y., where he killed at least 11 prostitutes. He was arrested in 1990 and eventually sentenced to 250 years in prison. During the trial, he claimed that he had been physically and sexually abused by his mother (untrue, the authorities concluded) and that he had committed horrible atrocities in Vietnam (probably untrue). He did not fit the classic pattern of the sociopath, nor did he seem either schizophrenic or paranoid. It remained for psychiatrist Richard Kraus to hypothesize that physiology was the basis for Shawcross's behavior--he diagnosed Shawcross as suffering from a metabolic ailment known as pyroluria and an abnormal genetic constitution. Told by Olsen with contributions from others affected by Shawcross's crimes, the story is a triumph of true-crime writing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DcnnDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To Serve and Collect: Chicago Politics and Police Corruption from the Lager Beer Riot to the Summerdale Scandal","description":"Crooked politicians, gangsters, madams, and cops on the take: To Serve and Collect tells the story of Chicago during its formative years through the history of its legendary police department.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eZWxYHslbQEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lightly Laundered Limericks","description":"Lightly Laundered Limericks is a book containing about 420 limericks, most of them altogether new.

Building on the history of medical terminology, he reveals that as late as 1923, the term  heterosexuality  referred to a \\"morbid sexual passion,\\" and that its current usage emerged to legitimate men and women having sex for pleasure. Drawing on the works of Sigmund Freud, James Baldwin, Betty Friedan, and Michel Foucault, The Invention of Heterosexuality considers the effects of heterosexuality s recently forged primacy on both scientific literature and popular culture.

I wiped away a tear with which the north wind blowing over the quay had obscured my vision. A bright fire was leaping in the chimney of my study. Ice-crystals, shaped like fern-leaves, were sprouting over the windowpanes and concealed from me the Seine with its bridges and the Louvre of the Valois. I drew up my easy-chair to the hearth, and my table-volante, and took up so much of my place by the fire as Hamilcar deigned to allow me. Hamilcar was lying in front of the andirons, curled up on a cushion, with his nose between his paws. His think find fur rose and fell with his regular breathing. At my coming, he slowly slipped a glance of his agate eyes at me from between his half-opened lids, which he closed again almost at once, thinking to himself, \\"It is nothing; it is only my friend.\\" \\"Hamilcar,\\" I said to him, as I stretched my legs?\\"Hamilcar, somnolent Prince of the City of Books?thou guardian nocturnal! Like that Divine Cat who combated the impious in Heliopolis?in the night of the great combat?thou dost defend from vile nibblers those books which the old savant acquired at the cost of his slender savings and indefatigable zeal. Sleep, Hamilcar, softly as a sultana, in this library, that shelters thy military virtues; for verily in thy person are united the formidable aspect of a Tatar warrior and the slumbrous grace of a woman of the Orient. Sleep, thou heroic and voluptuous Hamilcar, while awaiting the moonlight hour in which the mice will come forth to dance before the Acta Sanctorum of the learned Bolandists!\\" The beginning of this discourse pleased Hamilcar, who accompanied it with a throat-sound like the song of a kettle on the fire. But as my voice waxed louder, Hamilcar notified me by lowering his ears and by wrinkling the striped skin of his brow that it was bad taste on my part so to declaim. \\"This old-book man,\\" evidently thought Hamilcar, \\"talks to no purpose at all while our housekeeper never utters a word which is not full of good sense, full of significance?containing either the announcement of a meal or the promise of a whipping. One knows what she says. But this old man puts together a lot of sounds signifying nothing.\\" So thought Hamilcar to himself. Leaving him to his reflections, I opened a book, which I began to read with interest; for it was a catalogue of manuscripts. I do not know any reading more easy, more fascinating, more delightful than that of a catalogue. The one which I was reading?edited in 1824 by Mr. Thompson, librarian to Sir Thomas Raleigh?sins, it is true, by excess of brevity, and does not offer that character of exactitude which the archivists of my own generation were the first to introduce into works upon diplomatics and paleography. It leaves a good deal to be desired and to be divined. This is perhaps why I find myself aware, while reading it, of a state of mind which in nature more imaginative than mine might be called reverie. I had allowed myself to drift away this gently upon the current of my thoughts, when my housekeeper announced, in a tone of ill-humor, that Monsieur Coccoz desired to speak with me.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iIHOCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"We Like Kindergarten (A Little Golden Book)","description":"Little Carol introduces you to her full-range of activities in kindergarten.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LtShzgEACAAJ&dq=We+Like+Kindergarten+(A+Little+Golden+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Transpersonal Psychology","description":"The Wiley Blackwell Handbook of Transpersonal Psychology presents the most inclusive resource yet published on this topic - which seeks to benefit humanity by integrating ancient wisdom and modern knowledge.

It will cover all important aspects of a data warehouse while giving the necessary examples to make the reading a lively experience. - Tim Donar, Author and Systems Architect for Enterprise Data Warehouses Tuning a data warehouse database focuses on large transactions, mostly requiring what is known as throughput. Throughput is the passing of large amounts of information through a server, network and Internet environment, backwards and forwards, constantly! The ultimate objective of a data warehouse is the production of meaningful and useful reporting, from historical and archived data. The trick is to make the reports print within an acceptable time frame. A data model contains tables and relationships between tables. Tuning a data model involves Normalization and Denormalization. Different approaches are required depending on the application, such as OLTP or a Data Warehouse. Inappropriate database design can make SQL code impossible to tune. Poor data modeling can have a most profound effect on database performance since all SQL code is constructed from the data model. * Takes users beyond basics to critical issues in running most efficient data warehouse applications * Illustrates how to keep data going in and out in the most productive way possible * Focus is placed on Data Warehouse performance tuning","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=w7_sEal658UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cambio de Piel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=or4LMwEACAAJ&dq=Cambio+de+Piel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ten Most Wanted Men","description":"Presented in chronological order, offers profiles of each criminal on the FBI's most wanted list from 1950 to August 2003, including such facts as crimes committed, date placed on the list, and vital statistics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_-liQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Ten+Most+Wanted+Men&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Victorious Woman!

Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming  unstuck in time.  An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut s writing the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. Authors as wide-ranging as Norman Mailer, John Irving, Michael Crichton, Tim O Brien, Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Strout, David Sedaris, Jennifer Egan, and J. K. Rowling have all found inspiration in Vonnegut s words. Jonathan Safran Foer has described Vonnegut as  the kind of writer who made people young people especially want to write.  George Saunders has declared Vonnegut to be  the great, urgent, passionate American writer of our century, who offers us . . . a model of the kind of compassionate thinking that might yet save us from ourselves.  Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era s uncertainties.  Poignant and hilarious, threaded with compassion and, behind everything, the cataract of a thundering moral statement.

Enough of the pendulum politics of left and right and paralysis in the political center. We require an unprecedented form of radical renewal. In this book Henry Mintzberg offers a new understanding of the root of our current crisis and a strategy for restoring the balance so vital to the survival of our progeny and our planet. With the collapse of the communist regimes of Eastern Europe, Western pundits declared that capitalism had triumphed. They were wrong balance triumphed. A healthy society balances a public sector of respected governments, a private sector of responsible businesses, and a plural sector of robust communities. Communism collapsed under the weight of its overbearing public sector. Now the  liberal democracies  are threatened socially, politically, even economically by the unchecked excesses of the private sector. Radical renewal will have to begin in the plural sector, which alone has the inclination and the independence to challenge unacceptable practices and develop better ones. Too many governments have been co-opted by the private sector. And corporate social responsibility can't compensate for the corporate social irresponsibility we see around us  They  won't do it. We shall have to do it, each of us and all of us, not as passive  human resources,  but as resourceful human beings. Tom Paine wrote in 1776,  We have it in our power to begin the world over again.

A cat is content to be a cat. A cat is not owned by anybody. A cat imagines things about you, nothing you can know for sure. A cat reminds us that much in this world remains unknown. In his novels, stories, and essays, Leonard Michaels proved himself to be one of the most incisive observers of human behavior, but few know that he was every bit as perspicacious a chronicler of America s favorite pet: the domestic cat. Elusive, elegant, and often humorous much like his subject Michaels gives us this unfathomable animal as we have never quite seen it before, and yet as we have always known it to be.

So why do so many businesses crash and burn when it comes to launching successful e-business strategies? Why do flashy web sites send customers to a 1800 number that can be accessed only during \\"normal\\" business hours? Why do executives who market toys and games refuse to listen to their own children? According to IBM's Internet guru, John Patrick, it's all about attitude. Our inability to harness the full power of the Internet has much less to do with the technology itself than with the cultural and psychological barriers that straitjacket our thinking about it. In Net Attitude he reveals the strategies, and more important, the mindset, that will allow you and your company to flourish in the age of connectivity. Drawing from a wide range of examples from the worlds of business, technology, politics, education, and popular culture, Patrick explores the profound implications of adopting an Internet attitude and how it will transform you and your business.Net Attitude emanates from the grassroots thinking that was part of the evolution of the Internet itself. It is hard to describe but you will know it when you see it. Young people tend to have it but it is not really an age thing. An increasing number of seniors have it too. The masses of people in the middle layers of large organizations often don't have it.

Starting on the neglected concept of world society and bringing together the international society tradition and the Wendtian mode of constructivism, Buzan offers a new theoretical framework that can be used to address globalisation as a complex political interplay among state and non-state actors. This approach forces English school theory to confront neglected questions about both its basic concepts and assumptions, and about the constitution of society in terms of what values are shared, how and why they are shared, and by whom. Buzan highlights the idea of primary institutions as the central contribution of English school theory and shows how this both differentiates English school theory from realism and neoliberal institutionalism, and how it can be used to generate distinctive comparative and historical accounts of international society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=244_sIuLohQC&dq=From+International+to+World+Society%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eunoia: The CD","description":"Dani Spinosa takes up anarchism s power as a cultural and artistic ideology, rather than as a political philosophy, with a persistent emphasis on the common.

Shakespeare presents Timon as a figure who suffers such profound disillusionment that he becomes a misanthrope, or man-hater. This makes him a more interesting character than the caricature he had become to Shakespeare s contemporaries, for whom  Timonist  was a slang term for an unsociable man. Shakespeare s play includes the wealthy, magnificent, and extravagantly generous figure of Timon before his transformation. Timon expects that, having received as gifts all that he owned, his friends will be equally generous to him. Once his creditors clamor for repayment, Timon finds that his idealization of friendship is an illusion. He repudiates his friends, abandons Athens, and retreats to the woods. Yet his misanthropy arises from the destruction of an admirable illusion, from which his subsequent hatred can never be entirely disentangled. The authoritative edition of Timon of Athens from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes: -The exact text of the printed book for easy cross-reference -Hundreds of hypertext links for instant navigation -Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play -Full explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play -Scene-by-scene plot summaries -A key to the play s famous lines and phrases -An introduction to reading Shakespeare s language -An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play -Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library s vast holdings of rare books -An annotated guide to further reading Essay by Copp lia Kahn The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is home to the world s largest collection of Shakespeare s printed works, and a magnet for Shakespeare scholars from around the globe.

H. Carr wrote, \\"study the historian before you begin to study the facts.\\" This book approaches the life, work, ideas, debates, and the context of key 20th- and 21st-century historians through an analysis of their life writing projects viewed as historiographical sources. Merging literary studies on autobiography with theories of history, it provides a systematic and detailed analysis of the autobiographies of the most outstanding historians, from the classic texts by Giambattista Vico, Edward Gibbon and Henry Adams, to the Annales historians such as Fernand Braudel, Philippe Ari s and Georges Duby, to Marxist historians such as Eric Hobsbawm and Annie Kriegel, to postmodern historians such as Carolyn Steedman, Robert A. Rosenstone, Carlos Eire, Luisa Passerini, Elisabeth Roudinesco, Gerda Lerner and Sheila Fitzpatrick, and to \\"interventional\\" historians such as Geoff Eley, Jill Ker Conway, Natalie Davis and Gabrielle Spiegel. Using a comparative approach to these texts, this book identifies six historical-autobiographical styles: humanistic, biographic, ego-historical, monographic, postmodern, and interventional. By privileging historians' autobiographies, this book proposes a renewed history of historiography, one that engages the theoretical evolution of the discipline, the way history has been interpreted by historians, and the currents of thought and ideologies that have dominated and influenced its writing in the 20th and 21st centuries.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Chk-CgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Makes Pornography \\"Sexy\\"?

He and his fellow chaplains made ceaseless efforts to care for the spiritual and physical needs of the men in their charge. He was frequently called upon to tend to the sick and wounded, he attested to the tremendous courage displayed by the GIs of his unit as they grappled with the veteran Afrika Korps in North Africa. As alluded to in the title many of his charges faced their religious decisions differently under the fired of the deadly German 88 anti-tank gun; he assiduously noted that  there are no atheists in foxholes.  Also in charge of the burial parties sent to ensure the proper respect for the fallen, he describes this lesser known part of the US military effort.

Often called \\"Accident Park,\\" \\"Class Action Park,\\" or \\"Traction Park,\\" Action Park was an American icon. Entertaining more than a million people a year in the 1980s, the New Jersey-based amusement playland placed no limits on danger or fun, a monument to the anything-goes spirit of the era that left guests in control of their own adventures--sometimes with tragic results. Though it closed its doors in 1996 after nearly twenty years, it has remained a subject of constant fascination ever since, an establishment completely anathema to our modern culture of rules and safety. Action Park is the first-ever unvarnished look at the history of this DIY Disneyland, as seen through the eyes of Andy Mulvihill, the son of the park's idiosyncratic founder, Gene Mulvihill. From his early days testing precarious rides to working his way up to chief lifeguard of the infamous Wave Pool to later helping run the whole park, Andy's story is equal parts hilarious and moving, chronicling the life and death of a uniquely American attraction, a wet and wild 1980s adolescence, and a son's struggle to understand his father's quixotic quest to become the Walt Disney of New Jersey. Packing in all of the excitement of a day at Action Park, this is destined to be one of the most unforgettable memoirs of the year.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6PnoDwAAQBAJ&dq=A+Dangerous+Ride&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Old Man and Mr. Smith","description":"\\"Actor-author Ustinov's fable about God and Satan on an inspection tour of planet Earth is offbeat, witty, touching, profound and frequently hilarious\\".-- Publishers Weekly.

In a time when women could not vote, hold public office, or teach outside the home, the charismatic Hutchinson wielded remarkable political power. Her unconventional ideas had attracted a following of prominent citizens eager for social reform. Hutchinson defended herself brilliantly, but the judges, faced with a perceived threat to public order, banished her for behaving in a manner \\"not comely for [her] sex.\\" Written by one of Hutchinson's direct descendants, American Jezebel brings both balance and perspective to Hutchinson's story. It captures this American heroine's life in all its complexity, presenting her not as a religious fanatic, a cardboard feminist, or a raging crank as some have portrayed her but as a flesh-and-blood wife, mother, theologian, and political leader. The book narrates her dramatic expulsion from Massachusetts, after which her judges, still threatened by her challenges, promptly built Harvard College to enforce religious and social orthodoxies making her the mid-wife to the nation's first college. In exile, she settled Rhode Island, becoming the only woman ever to co-found an American colony. The seeds of the American struggle for women's and human rights can be found in the story of this one woman's courageous life. American Jezebel illuminates the origins of our modern concepts of religious freedom, equal rights, and free speech, and showcases an extraordinary woman whose achievements are astonishing by the standards of any era.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=E2wG961upfQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Good House Is Never Done","description":"Designer John Wheatman has narrowed his design philosophy into 21 ideas you can incorporate in your own home whatever the size or budget.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TfpE2mRXtzcC&dq=A+Good+House+Is+Never+Done&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The God I Love: A Lifetime of Walking with Jesus","description":" The God I Love is the book that captures my heart and thoughts in the events, dialogues, memories, images, and scenes of my life my walk with God.

Divorced soon after, Leigh was encouraged by a boyfriend to pose for photos, which led to a successful and glamorous modeling career.

The subject is whiplash, and some of the brightest minds on the topic gathered in Banff, Alberta, Canada, for the Eighth International Symposium by the Physical Medicine Research Foundation. Editor Dr. Murray E. Allen, Chairman of the Symposium, has collected the findings in Musculoskeletal Pain Emanating From the Head and Neck: Current Concepts in Diagnosis, Management, and Cost Containment to help physicians, physical therapists, chiropractors, and researchers better understand  the new whiplash,  make reliable clinical assessments, and provide more effective treatment. This thorough collection includes bump studies with human volunteers, research into safer automobile seat backs and head restraints, postmortem cervical spine examinations, reviews of the literature, and other investigations from around the world. Readers of Musculoskeletal Pain Emanating From the Head and Neck will learn specifically about: injury mechanisms, threshold for injury, and impact severity long-term outcomes of whiplash injury psychological aspects of chronic pain and disability dizziness, imbalance, and chronic incapacity intervertebral joint injuries and cervical synovial joint injuries the Neck Disability Index manipulation and mobilization therapies temporomandibular disorders/temporomandibular pain and dysfunction syndrome (TMPDS) Musculoskeletal Pain Emanating From the Head and Neck is not simply a collection of studies presenting data and findings--rather, it is a compilation of knowledge that illuminates the challenges of treating whiplash and makes some strong and straightforward recommendations for improvement. The contributors and the editor stress to the reader that in order to provide the best possible care, providers must be alert to the many secondary manifestations of whiplash, test for the perception of dysfunction, and be reassuring whenever possible. They must foster an atmosphere of confidence, encourage very early activation, and help persons maintain the momentum of their lives. Furthermore, Dr. Allen calls for caregivers to stop most (if not all) drug treatments, avoid passive failure-mode treatments, and avoid prolonged medicalization of any form of treatment. By studying the findings and following the recommendations of the international experts contributing to Musculoskeletal Pain Emanating From the Head and Neck, physicians, chiropractors, and physical therapists will foster self-reliance in their patients and improve diagnosis, treatment, and cost containment of whiplash.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GMnKAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Graphic Works of Max Klinger (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)","description":"Reproduced directly from original portfolio editions, these 74 etchings by a precursor of the Surrealist movement portray fantasies about love and death, sexual psychoses, fetish obsessions, and bizarre nightmares.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mV68AQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A tale from the rainforest (Caribbean poetry series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3EhaAAAAMAAJ&dq=A+tale+from+the+rainforest+(Caribbean+poetry+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Family devotions for every day in the church year: Gathered from the writings of Dr. Martin Luther","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZiowFx_wXN4C&dq=Family+devotions+for+every+day+in+the+church+year:+Gathered+from+the+writings+of+Dr.+Martin+Luther&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Management Innovators: The People and Ideas that Have Shaped Modern Business","description":"Studies the lives and work of influential inventors, communicators, financiers, sellers, organizers, motivators, and leaders","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cFjnCwAAQBAJ&dq=Management+Innovators:+The+People+and+Ideas+that+Have+Shaped+Modern+Business&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sojourn v. 2: The Dragon's Tale","description":"Includes categorical listings of collectible comic books, arranged by type of comic, with issue titles, current prices, dates, and cross-references","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EINrbVMVVlsC&dq=Sojourn+v.+2:+The+Dragon%27s+Tale&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good News Bible the Bible in Today's English Version","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=goepkQEACAAJ&dq=Good+News+Bible+the+Bible+in+Today%27s+English+Version&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Creation of the Media","description":"America's leading role in today's information revolution may seem simply to reflect its position as the world's dominant economy and most powerful state. But by the early nineteenth century, when the United States was neither a world power nor a primary center of scientific discovery, it was already a leader in communications-in postal service and newspaper publishing, then in development of the telegraph and telephone networks, later in the whole repertoire of mass communications.In this wide-ranging social history of American media, from the first printing press to the early days of radio, Paul Starr shows that the creation of modern communications was as much the result of political choices as of technological invention. With his original historical analysis, Starr examines how the decisions that led to a state-run post office and private monopolies on the telegraph and telephone systems affected a developing society. He illuminates contemporary controversies over freedom of information by exploring such crucial formative issues as freedom of the press, intellectual property, privacy, public access to information, and the shaping of specific technologies and institutions. America's critical choices in these areas, Starr argues, affect the long-run path of development in a society and have had wide social, economic, and even military ramifications. The Creation of the Media not only tells the history of the media in a new way; it puts America and its global influence into a new perspective.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4rhWtAEACAAJ&dq=The+Creation+of+the+Media&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Organizing Successful Tournaments-2nd Edition","description":"Create great schedules in minutes!

Dedicating a chapter to each of these nine drivers, this book is the most far-reaching and insightful vision ever presented of the principles and step-by-step actions that continuously bring success to life in a company.

It should be read by everyone who still retains the capacity to feel anything  (The New York Times). Stunningly written and fiercely observed, a new edition of a classic work of nature writing about a year on an Ohio farm, by Pulitzer Prizewinning author Josephine Johnson. Originally published in 1969, The Inland Island is Josephine W. Johnson s startling and brilliant chronicle of nature and the seasons at her rambling thirty-seven-acre farm in Ohio, which she and her husband reverted to wilderness with the help of a state forester. Over the course of twelve months, she observes the changing landscape with a naturalist s precision and a poet s evocative language. Readers will marvel at the way she brings to life flashes of beauty, the inexorable cycle of growth and decay, and the creatures who live alongside her, great and small. A forerunner of iconic American women nature writers and a champion of civil rights who marched in Washington against the Vietnam war, Johnson intersperses these  delicate marvels  (The New York Times) with profound reflections about racial inequality, urbanization, social justice, and environmental destruction that speak powerfully to our time. Ready to be rediscovered by a new generation, The Inland Island is a vital and relevant meditation on nature and time, capturing the wonder, beauty, hope and flaws of our turbulent world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=geIYEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"the Picture of Dorian Gray","description":"The Picture of Dorian Gray was first published as a serial in Lippencott s Monthly Magazine, and the publishers thought it would so offend readers that they removed nearly 500 words without Wilde s approval.

Even though his contemporaries considered it so offensive that some argued for his prosecution, Dorian Gray today survives as a classic philosophical novel that explores themes of aestheticism and double lives. Couched in Wilde s trademark cutting wit, Dorian Gray is still being adapted today, with Dorian and his moldering portrait remaining cultural touchstones.

August 1931. An ocean liner bound for Germany sets out from the Mexican port city of Veracruz. The ship s first-class passengers include an idealistic young American painter and her lover; a Spanish dance troupe with a sideline in larceny; an elderly German couple and their fat, seasick bulldog; and a boisterous band of Cuban medical students. As the Vera journeys across the Atlantic, the incidents and intrigues of several dozen passengers and crew members come into razor-sharp focus. The result is a richly drawn portrait of the human condition in all its complexity and a mesmerizing snapshot of a world drifting toward disaster. Written over a span of twenty years and based on the diary Katherine Anne Porter kept during a similar ocean voyage, Ship of Fools was the bestselling novel of 1962 and the inspiration for an Academy Awardwinning film starring Vivien Leigh.

Sometimes known by other names especially master plan or general plan the type of plan described here is the predominant form of general governmental planning in the U.S. Although many government agencies make plans for their own programs or facilities, the comprehensive plan is the only planning document that considers multiple programs and that accounts for activities on all land located within the planning area, including both public and private property. Written by a former president of the American Planning Association, Community Planning is thorough, specific, and timely. It addresses such important contemporary issues as sustainability, walkable communities, the role of urban design in public safety, changes in housing needs for a changing population, and multi-modal transportation planning. Unlike competing books, it addresses all of these topics in the context of the local comprehensive plan. There is a broad audience for this book: planning students, practicing planners, and individual citizens who want to better understand local planning and land use controls. Boxes at the end of each chapter explain how professional planners and individual citizens, respectively, typically engage the issues addressed in the chapter.

During the early twentieth century, transatlantic travel was the province of the great ocean liners. It was an extraordinary undertaking made by many women, whose lives were changed forever by their journeys between the Old World and the New. Some traveled for leisure, some for work; others to reinvent themselves or find new opportunities. They were celebrities, migrants and millionaires, refugees, aristocrats and crew members whose stories have mostly remained untold until now. Maiden Voyages is a fascinating portrait of the era, the ships themselves, and these women as they crossed the Atlantic. The ocean liner was a microcosm of contemporary society, divided by class: from the luxury of the upper deck, playground for the rich and famous, to the cramped conditions of steerage or third class travel. In first class you ll meet A-listers like Marlene Dietrich, Wallis Simpson, and Josephine Baker; the second class carried a new generation of professional and independent women, like pioneering interior designer Sibyl Colefax. Down in steerage, you ll follow the journey of  migr  Maria Riffelmacher as she escapes poverty in Europe. Bustling between decks is a crew of female workers, including Violet  The Unsinkable Stewardess  Jessop, who survived the Titanic disaster. Entertaining and informative, Maiden Voyages captures the golden age of ocean liners through the stories of the women whose transatlantic journeys changed the shape of society on both sides of the globe.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=18D3DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Easy True Stories: A Picture-Based Beginning Reader","description":"A couple feels something moving inside their mattress.

Between plays, Stoppard the craftsman does translations, screenplays, light entertainments, and work for hire. Delaney's book is the first to focus on the major plays. Spanning Stoppard's career from Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead (1967) to Hapgood (1988), this study shows the figure which Stoppard from the first has been weaving in his theatrical tapestry. That there is development in Stoppard is clear but - as Delaney demonstrates - the development is from moral affirmation to moral application, from the assertion of moral principles to the enactment of moral practice. Such development from precept to praxis demonstrates organic growth rather than radical metamorphosis. Using Stoppard's words in a number of little-known interviews as a starting-point, Delaney shows how the major plays bear out Stoppard's contention that he 'tries to be consistent about morality'. The volume contains the most extensive bibliography and discography of Stoppard interviews (over 200 including print and broadcast sources) ever compiled.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4PC-DAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Radicalism and the Origins of the Vietnamese Revolution","description":"This work looks at the influence of radicalism on a crucial point in Vietnamese history.

Hubert Dreyfus's commentary opens the way for a new appreciation of this difficult philosopher, revealing a rigorous and illuminating vocabulary that is indispensable for talking about the phenomenon of world. The publication of Being and Time in 1927 turned the academic world on its head. Since then it has become a touchstone for philosophers as diverse as Marcuse, Sartre, Foucault, and Derrida who seek an alternative to the rationalist Cartesian tradition of western philosophy. But Heidegger's text is notoriously dense, and his language seems to consist of unnecessarily barbaric neologisms; to the neophyte and even to those schooled in Heidegger thought, the result is often incomprehensible. Dreyfus's approach to this daunting book is straightforward and pragmatic. He explains the text by frequent examples drawn from everyday life, and he skillfully relates Heidegger's ideas to the questions about being and mind that have preoccupied a generation of cognitive scientists and philosophers of mind.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ACIxwxBq2ZgC&dq=Being-in-the-World:+A+Commentary+on+Heidegger%27s+Being+and+Time,+Division+I&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"101 Defensive Line Drills","description":"Consists of 101 proven drills designed to develop the basic skills attendant to defensive line play.

At nineteen, she was the first female solo rapper to have a major record deal. Four years later she had become a top television actress and movie star. She earned a Grammy, started a record label, and became the president of her own company. Today she is rap music's most enduring female force. But how did Dana Owens, a young girl from Newark, New Jersey, become Queen Latifah and make it to the top of the charts? The most powerful voice in rap has always been quiet about her life. Until now. At once autobiographical and inspirational, Ladies First is the story of a young woman, making tough decisions and terrible mistakes -- about sex and drugs and about who was real and who wasn't -- before she was old enough to drive. It is about the reign of depression that descended on her after her brother's tragic death and how she found a sustaining love in God when it seemed the world was trying to break her. Ladies First is about being confident and sensual in a big, strong body and about blocking out the junk to let in the good. It is about how anyone -- whether from the poorest means or the richest -- can hold her head high in a world full of attitude. In a queen's universe, each experience is a lesson. Keeping it real and making no excuses, Queen Latifah shares her truth about what's important in life. Full of wisdom and revelations, Ladies First will instill in you the same self-esteem, respect, and courage that brought Queen Latifah peace and her independent edge. Allow her to guide you to discover who you are -- inside and out-as you discover who she is. Ladies First is one woman's journey to find the riches that were in her life all along, and it is a message of majesty for everyone.With Ladies First, the queen who lives within all of us will rise.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MSrSGwAACAAJ&dq=Ladies+First:+Revelations+of+a+Strong+Woman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On Different Shores","description":"In an extraordinary blend of narrative history, personal recollection, & oral testimony, the author presents a sweeping history of Asian Americans.

The reign of Richard III, the last Yorkist king and the final monarch of the Plantagenet dynasty, marked a turning point in British history. But despite his lasting legacy, Richard only ruled as king for the final two years of his life. While much attention has been given to his short reign, Michael Hicks explores the whole of Richard's fascinating life and traces the unfolding of his character and career from his early years as the son of a duke to his violent death at the battle of Bosworth. Hicks explores how Richard-villainized for his imprisonment and probable killing of the princes-applied his experience to overcome numerous setbacks and adversaries. Richard proves a complex, conflicted individual whose Machiavellian tact and strategic foresight won him a kingdom. He was a reformer who planned big changes, but lost the opportunity to fulfill them and to retain his crown.\\"--Provided by publisher.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CCm7DwAAQBAJ&dq=Bosworth+1485:+Psychology+of+a+Battle+(Revealing+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Psychology, Sixth Edition in Modules","description":"The success of the modular version of David Myers's bestselling brief text, Exploring Psychology, proves the author's longheld belief (supported by independent research) that for a number of students, a text comprised of 45 15-page chapters is more effective than one of 15 45-page chapters.

This is the testament of Paul B?umer, who enlists with his classmates in the German army during World War I. They become soldiers with youthful enthusiasm. But the world of duty, culture, and progress they had been taught breaks in pieces under the first bombardment in the trenches. Through years of vivid horror, Paul holds fast to a single vow: to fight against the principle of hate that meaninglessly pits young men of the same generation but different uniforms against one another . . . if only he can come out of the war alive.

Volume II, meanwhile, turns to the basics of Japanese syntax. The book is by no means only about grammar, however. Rather, it is designed to help learners consolidate their understanding of syntactical structure through lessons that focus on how to talk about topics relevant to daily life. In addition to serving learners continuing from Volume I, Volume II will benefit those who have already studied beginning Japanese to some extent but wish to brush up on syntax. Major Features of Japanese for Busy People II, Revised 3rd Edition Japanese for Busy People II, Revised 3rd Edition will enable learners to progress smoothly through the equivalent of the latter half of a typical first-year Japanese course while gradually building speaking and listening skills. Learners approaching mid-beginner status often find themselves suddenly faced with syntax and vocabulary much more complex than what they have studied before. Such grammar and vocabulary do not appear as frequently in everyday conversation as those words and structures they have learned up to this point, necessitating that they spend ample time on review. Moreover, learners at this stage are expected to become familiar with verb tense and aspect, time expressions, conditional clauses, and other topics that require them to have a solid grasp of context and speaker intent if they are to fully understand the differences in meaning conveyed by each. Such points cannot be mastered by reading through grammatical explanations alone. In short, the mid-beginner level is a difficult one for many adult learners who, unlike students in school, have neither time nor opportunities to take repeated tests or to otherwise gauge their progress. Japanese for Busy People II, Revised 3rd Edition helps overcome the above obstacles through grammar and content topics carefully selected to be appropriate to learners at this level of Japanese proficiency. The book is designed so that by practicing talking about each topic, learners will gradually and effectively acquire sentence patterns and vocabulary related to that topic. Like Volume I, Volume II is organized into several large units, each covering topics grouped under a particular theme. In this way, the book enables learners to achieve a well-balanced understanding of grammar, sentence structure, and context. Themes and lesson objectives of the five units in Volume II are as follows. Unit 1: Souvenir Shopping Following up on Volume I, Unit 1 presents survival Japanese related to shopping, thus providing learners with a thorough review of simple clauses. The unit also goes beyond what was covered in Volume I by showing ways of asking someone s opinion while shopping, making comparisons between items, and describing an item s characteristics. The overall theme is \\"picking souvenirs,\\" a subject that should be relevant to learners both in Japan and abroad. The verbal skills and dialogue patterns studied here may be applied not only to shopping but also more broadly to any situation that involves choosing between options. Unit 2: Building Rapport with Colleagues This unit introduces the plain forms of verbs   a crucial component of Japanese compound sentences   along with several sentence-final elements that make use of these forms. Topics are selected from among those that typically come up when interacting with people from work. Covered are constructions for indicating interest in another s actions, inviting someone to do something outside of work, asking for help or offering advice, and otherwise interacting with people in ways that help build relationships of trust and understanding. Unit 3: Returning to Japan for Work This unit explains how to build sentences using temporal clauses, direct and indirect quotation, and attributive modifiers. Through talking about factual events in one s life history or in that of a particular neighborhood, learners will study how to relate an event in chronological sequence, compare the way something is now to how it was in the past, and describe facilities and other things around them. Unit 4: Planning a Vacation Along with sentences with clauses for stating reasons or reporting questions, this unit covers sentence-final elements used to express indefiniteness, for example wish or probability. Topics deal with verbal skills necessary for planning and carrying out activities in cooperation with others, including explaining reasons or circumstances, expressing probability, and indicating desire. The overall theme is that of planning and going on a trip to a unique place in Japan. Unit 5: Solving Problems The focus of this unit is on forming conditional clauses. Topics include preparing for earthquakes or other disasters, discussing dreams for the future, solving problems, helping someone who is lost, and other situations that call on learners to talk about what might happen in the future, discuss options for solving problems, and give instructions or explain steps for doing something.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vZ1NEAAAQBAJ&dq=Japanese+for+Busy+People+II:+Workbook+(Vol+2)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Image in the Water","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DZspSlKvOgAC&dq=Image+in+the+Water&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Science in Translation: Movements of Knowledge through Cultures and Time","description":"Montgomery explores the roles that translation has played in the development of Western science from antiquity to the end of the 20th century.

Mandelbrot advocated modeling of real-life signals by fractal or multifractal functions. One example is fractional Brownian motion, where large-scale behavior is related to a corresponding infrared divergence. Self-similarities and scaling laws play a key role in this new area. There is a widely accepted belief that wavelet analysis should provide the best available tool to unveil such scaling laws. And orthonormal wavelet bases are the only existing bases which are structurally invariant through dyadic dilations. This book discusses the relevance of wavelet analysis to problems in which self-similarities are important. Among the conclusions drawn are the following: 1) A weak form of self-similarity can be given a simple characterization through size estimates on wavelet coefficients, and 2) Wavelet bases can be tuned in order to provide a sharper characterization of this self-similarity. A pioneer of the wavelet \`\`saga'', Meyer gives new and as yet unpublished results throughout the book. It is recommended to scientists wishing to apply wavelet analysis to multifractal signal processing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Cz7iDgAAQBAJ&dq=Wavelets,+Vibrations+and+Scalings+(Crm+Monograph+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ducati Superbikes: 851, 888, 916","description":"The full story of the awesome 4-valve, V-twin cylinder Ducati.

In succeeding years he distilled his mathematical notations from dozens of journal notebooks into the first accurate maps of the entire northwest quadrant of North America. The writings in those same journals reveal a complex man who was headstrong, curious, and resourceful in ways that reflected both his London education and his fur trade apprenticeship on the Canadian Shield. In The Mapmaker's Eye: David Thompson on the Columbia Plateau, Jack Nisbet utilizes fresh research to convey how Thompson experienced the sweep of human and natural history etched across the Columbia drainage. He places Thompson's movements within the larger contexts of the European Enlightenment, the British fur trade economy, and American expansion as represented by the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Nisbet courses through journal notebooks to assemble and comment on Thompson's bird and mammal lists, the explorer's surprisingly detailed Salish vocabulary, the music Thompson and his crew listened to on a barrel organ, and the woodcraft techniques they used to maintain themselves under shelter or while on the move. Visual elements bring Thompson's written daybooks to life. Watercolor landscapes and tribal portraits drawn by the first artists to travel along his trade routes illuminate what the explorer actually saw. Tribal and fur trade artifacts reveal intimate details of two cultures at the moment of contact. The Mapmaker's Eye also depicts the surveying instruments that Thompson used, and displays the series of remarkable maps that grew out of his patient, persistent years of work. In addition to these visual aspects of Thomson's journeys through the Columbia country, Nisbet taps into oral memories kept by the Kootenai and Salish bands who guided the agent and his party along their way.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0vARAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Mapmaker%27s+Eye:+David+Thompson+on+the+Columbia+Plateau&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Revelation Revealed","description":"Centuries before anyone could make sense of these fantastic warnings, the prophets declared that the mysteries of Revelation would not be understood until the Last Days.

The book's title, taken from the first chapter, may sound esoteric but it reflects a common-sense outlook on the world, applied in a methodical way. That approach, known as realism, consists in emphasizing the fact that what is real precedes our concepts about it. In contrast to realism stands idealism, which refers to the philosophical outlook that begins with ideas and tries to move from them to things. Gilson shows how the common-sense notion of realism, though denied by many thinkers, is indispensible for a correct understanding of things--of what is and how we know what is. He shows the flaws of idealism and he critiques efforts to introduce elements of idealism into realist philosophy (immediate realism). At the same time, the author criticizes failures of certain realist philosophers--including Aristotle--to be consistent in their own principles and to begin from sound starting points. To these problems, Gilson traces medieval philosophy's failure in the realm of science, which led early modern scientific thinkers of the 17th century unnecessarily to reject even the best of medieval scholastic philosophy. He concludes with The Realist Beginner's Handbook, a summary of key points for thinking clearly about reality and about the knowledge of it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2sT-cH2K49AC&dq=Methodical+Realism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Circus Is in Town, The","description":"Contributions by Lisa Doris Alexander, Matthew H. Barton, Andrew C. Billings, Carlton Brick, Ted M. Butryn, Brian Carroll, Arthur T. Challis, Roxane Coche, Curtis M. Harris, Jay Johnson, Melvin Lewis, Jack Lule, Rory Magrath, Matthew A. Masucci, Andrew McIntosh, Jorge E. Moraga, Leigh M. Moscowitz, David C. Ogden, Joel Nathan Rosen, Kevin A. Stein, and Henry Yu In this fifth book on sport and the nature of reputation, editors Lisa Doris Alexander and Joel Nathan Rosen have tasked their contributors with examining reputation from the perspective of celebrity and spectacle, which in some cases can be better defined as scandal. The subjects chronicled in this volume have all proven themselves to exist somewhere on the spectacular spectrum the spotlight seemed always to gravitate toward them. All have displayed phenomenal feats of athletic prowess and artistry, and all have faced a controversy or been thrust into a situation that grows from age-old notions of the spectacle. Some handled the hoopla like the champions they are, or were, while others struggled and even faded amid the hustle and flow of their runaway celebrity. While their individual narratives are engrossing, these stories collectively paint a portrait of sport and spectacle that offers context and clarity. Written by a range of scholarly contributors from multiple disciplines, The Circus Is in Town: Sport, Celebrity, and Spectacle contains careful analysis of such megastars as LeBron James, Tonya Harding, David Beckham, Shaquille O Neal, Maria Sharapova, and Colin Kaepernick. This final volume of a project that has spanned the first three decades of the twenty-first century looks to sharpen questions regarding how it is that reputations of celebrity athletes are forged, maintained, transformed, repurposed, destroyed, and at times rehabilitated. The subjects in this collection have been driven by this notion of the spectacle in ways that offer interesting and entertaining inquiry into the arc of athletic reputations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y9dSEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Positioning in radiography","description":"U.S. Government Counterterrorism: A Guide to Who Does What is the first readily available, unclassified guide to the many U.S. government agencies, bureau offices, and programs involved in all aspects of countering terrorism domestically and overseas. The authors, veterans of the U.S. government s counterterrorism efforts, present a rare insider s view of the counterterrorism effort, addressing such topics as government training initiatives, weapons of mass destruction, interagency coordination, research and development, and the congressional role in policy and budget issues. Includes a Foreword by Brian Michael Jenkins, Senior Advisor RAND Corporation Individual chapters describe the various agencies, their bureaus, and offices that develop and implement the counterterrorism policies and programs, providing a useful unclassified guide to government officials at all levels as well as students and others interested in how the U.S. counters terrorism. The book also discusses the challenges involved in coordinating the counterterrorism efforts at federal, state, and local levels and explains how key terror events influenced the development of programs, agencies, and counterterrorism legislation. The legislative underpinnings and tools of the U.S. counterterrorism efforts are covered as are the oft-debated issues of defining terrorism itself and efforts to counter violent extremism. In addition to outlining the specific agencies and programs, the authors provide unique insights into the broader context of counterterrorism efforts and developments in the last 10-plus years since 9/11 and they raise future considerations given recent landscape-altering global events.

Beginning by addressing the idea of a 'paradox of desire', whereby we must desire to end desire, the varieties of desire that are articulated in the Pali texts are examined. A range of views of desire, as found in Western thought, are presented as well as Hindu and Jain approaches. An exploration of the concept of ditthi(view or opinion) is also provided, exploring the way in which 'holding views' can be seen as analogous to the process of desiring. Other subjects investigated include the mind-body relationship, the range of Pali terms for desire, and desire's positive spiritual value.

Within the ancient city there were many natural wells or cenotes. One, within the ceremonial heart of the city, is an impressive natural feature with vertical limestone walls enclosing a deep pool of jade green water some eighty feet below ground level. This cenote, which gave the city its name, became a sacred shrine of Maya pilgrimage, described by one post-Conquest observer as similar to Jerusalem and Rome. Here, during the city's ascendancy and for centuries after its decline, the peoples of Yucat n consulted their gods and made ritual offerings of precious objects and living victims who were thought to receive prophecies. Although the well was described by Bishop Diego de Landa in the late sixteenth century, its contents were not known until the early 1900s when revealed by the work of Edward H. Thompson. Conducting excavations for the Peabody Museum of Harvard University, Thompson recovered almost thirty thousand artifacts, most ceremonially broken and many beautifully preserved by burial in the deep silt at the bottom of the well. The materials were sent to the Peabody Museum, where they remained, unexhibited, for over seventy years. In 1984, for the first time, nearly three hundred objects of gold, jade, copper, pottery, wood, copal, textile, and other materials from the collection were gathered into a traveling interpretive exhibition. No other archaeological exhibition had previously given this glimpse into Maya ritual life because no other collection had objects such as those found in the Sacred Cenote. Moreover, the objects from the Cenote come from throughout Mesoamerica and lower Central America, representing many artistic traditions. The exhibit and this, its accompanying catalog, marked the first time all of the different kinds of offerings have ever been displayed together, and the first time many have been published. Essays by Gordon R. Willey and Linnea H. Wren place the Cenote of Sacrifice and the great Maya city of Chich n Itz  within the larger context of Maya archaeology and history. The catalog entries, written by Clemency Chase Coggins, describe the objects displayed in the traveling exhibition. Some entries are brief descriptive statements; others develop short scholarly themes bearing on the function and interpretation of specific objects. Coggins' introductory essay describes how the objects were collected by Thompson and how the exhibition collection has been studied to reveal the periods of Cenote ritual and the changing practices of offering to the Sacred Cenote.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SWrUBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tomatoes: A Country Garden Cookbook","description":"Bay Area chef Jesse Cool explores over 20 varieties of tomatoes and shares her best recipes from fresh Bloody Marys and grilled chicken with charred tomato barbecue sauce to a tart tomato-ginger upside-down cake. 40 recipes. 48 photos.

Reveals the life and teachings of one of the greatest female artists and intellectuals of the Western Mystical Tradition. ? Contains 24 full-color illustrations by Hildegard of Bingen. ? Includes commentary by Matthew Fox, author of Original Blessing (250,000 sold). Hildegard of Bingen (1098-1179) was an extraordinary woman living in the Rhineland valley during most of the twelfth century. Besides being the abbess of a large and influential Benedictine abbey, she was a prominent preacher, healer, scientist, and artist. She also was a composer and theologian, writing nine books on theology, medicine, science, and physiology, as well as 70 poems and an opera. At the age of 42, she began to have visions; these were captured as 36 illuminations--24 of which are recorded in this book along with her commentaries on them. She also wrote a text describing these visions entitled Scivias (Know the Ways), now published as Hildegard of Bingen's Mystical Visions. Author Matthew Fox has stated, \\"If Hildegard had been a man, she would be well known as one of the greatest artists and intellectuals the world has ever seen.\\" It is a credit to the power of the women's movement and our times that this towering genius of Western thought is being rediscovered in her full grandeur and autonomy. Virtually unknown for more than 800 years in Western history, Hildegard was featured as one of the women in Judy Chicago's Dinner Party in the early 1980s and published for the first time in English by Bear & Company in 1982. In addition to her mystical teachings, Hildegard's music has been performed and recorded for a new and growing audience.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UFkoDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Midlife Awakenings: Discovering the Gifts Life Has Given Us","description":"Barbara Bartocci, a fifty-something professional speaker and writer, writes on spiritual growth in the years of midlife, assuring readers that God is there to guide all of us through midlife and beyond.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0DHlq4eg75IC&dq=Midlife+Awakenings:+Discovering+the+Gifts+Life+Has+Given+Us&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Journal of an exploring tour beyond the Rocky mountains,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_4AFAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Phantom of the Opera (A Stepping Stone Book(TM))","description":"A disfigured musical genius who lives beneath the Paris Opera House falls in love with a beautiful soprano and, in his desperation to have his love returned, embarks on some terrifying means towards that end.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ggq0zgEACAAJ&dq=The+Phantom+of+the+Opera+(A+Stepping+Stone+Book(TM))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Great Lakes Diving Guide","description":"What lies beneath the fresh, cold waters of the Great Lakes?

Catholic sisters lived on the edge, serving sick and poor immigrants as well as those racially and religiously unlike themselves, such as the uneducated black migrants from the South. At all times, the sisters emphasized the importance of education to social mobility and equality. Hoy makes extensive use of primary documents, secondary sources, and personal interviews, as well as a series of revealing photographs to document their work and show that while almost always hidden, never-ending, and regularly ignored by male church leaders, the sisters' contributions were unique and generous, often saving those most at risk in a growing city.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4T24Zqp0SlUC&dq=Good+Hearts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"City of Bones","description":"Suddenly able to see demons and the Darkhunters who are dedicated to returning them to their own dimension, fifteen-year-old Clary Fray is drawn into this bizarre world when her mother disappears and Clary herself is almost killed by a monster.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Gf5wCgAAQBAJ&dq=City+of+Bones&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Digging in Yucatan (Travel and adventure library for young folks)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OIvbnQEACAAJ&dq=Digging+in+Yucatan+(Travel+and+adventure+library+for+young+folks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Plum in the Golden Vase or, Chin P'ing Mei: Volume Three: The Aphrodisiac (Princeton Library of Asian Translations)","description":"A five-volume translation of the classic sixteenth-century Chinese novel on the domestic life of a corrupt merchant.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PyTRwD-e5mgC&dq=The+Plum+in+the+Golden+Vase+or,+Chin+P%27ing+Mei:+Volume+Three:+The+Aphrodisiac+(Princeton+Library+of+Asian+Translations)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Market Math: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Grades 3-6 (Real Life Math Series)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NyCzjKgrBZcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fundamental problems of Marxism,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EuZWAAAAYAAJ&dq=Fundamental+problems+of+Marxism,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black Beauty (Troll Illustrated Classics)","description":"A horse in nineteenth-century England recounts his experiences with both good and bad masters.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3BCGPwAACAAJ&dq=Black+Beauty+(Troll+Illustrated+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black Tents of Arabia (My Life Among the Bedouins)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l5MwAAAAMAAJ&dq=Black+Tents+of+Arabia+(My+Life+Among+the+Bedouins)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Carl's Masquerade","description":"To Carl and his young charge, a masquerade party proves an irresistible invitation to fun.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K2BCHQAACAAJ&dq=Carl%27s+Masquerade&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vladimir Solov'ev: Reconciler and Polemicist (Eastern Christian Studies)","description":"Vladimir Solov'ev (1853-1900- is regarded as the most original and systematic of the Russian philosophers in the 19th century.

The scope of this conference was wide-ranging, dealing with theological, metaphysical, philosophical and historical themes. Though Solov'ev's broad intellectual activity defies any strict attempt at categorisation, the editors have classified its major themes under the dual characteristic of reconciliation and polemics. Solov'ev was passionately committed to the reconciliation of all beings under the idea of all-unity, which he attemted to achieve by engaging in uncompromising polemics with his contemporaries, The thirty contributors to this volume are specialists from Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Western Europe and the United States. The volume makes a significant contribution to the intellectual reassesment of Vladimir Solov'ev since the rediscovery of his philosophical heritage in his own homeland in the 1980s.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s-BjLJRxY14C&dq=Vladimir+Solov%27ev:+Reconciler+and+Polemicist+(Eastern+Christian+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Assignment in Utopia","description":"This is a story of belief, disillusionment and atonement. Long identified with leftist causes, the journalist Eugene Lyons was by background and sentiment predisposed to early support of the Russian Revolution. A \\"friendly correspondent,\\" he was one of a coterie of foreign journalists permitted into the Soviet Union during the Stalinist era because their desire to serve the revolution was thought to outweigh their desire to serve the truth. Lyons first went to the Soviet Union in 1927, and spent six years there. He was there as Stalin consolidated his power, through collectivization and its consequences, as the cultural and technical intelligentsia succumbed to the secret police, and as the mechanisms of terror were honed. As Ellen Frankel Paul notes in her major new introduction to this edition, \\"It was this murderous reality that Stalin's censors worked so assiduously to camouflage, corralling foreign correspondents as their often willing allies.\\" Lyons was one of those allies. Assignment in \\"Utopia \\"describes why he refused to see the obvious, the forces that kept him from writing the truth, and the tortuous path he traveled in liberating himself. His story helps us understand how so many who were in a position to know were so silent for so long. In addition, it is a document, by an on-the-scene journalist, of major events in the critical period of the first Five-Year Plan. As Ellen Frankel Paul notes in her major new introduction to this new edition, Assignment in \\"Utopia \\"is particularly timely. The system it dissects in such devastating detail is in the process of being rejected throughout Eastern Europe and is under challenge in the Soviet Union itself. The book lends insight into the \\"political pilgrim\\" phenomenon described by Paul Hollander, in which visitors celebrate terrorist regimes, seemingly oblivious to their destructive force. The book is valuable for those interested in the Stalinist era in the Soviet Union, those interested in radical regimes and political change, as well as those interested in better understanding current events in Europe. It will also be useful for the tough questions it poses about journalistic ethics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZXLhwVJvfXMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Human Resource Policies and Procedures for Nonprofit Organizations","description":"Get the tools you need to build a successfulhuman resource management system!

Nearly every important development in the modern architectural movement began with the proclamation of these convictions in the form of a program or manifesto. The most influential of these are collected here in chronological order from 1903 to 1963. Taken together, they constitute a subjective history of modern architecture; compared with one another, their great diversity of style reveals in many cases the basic differences of attitude and temperament that produced a corresponding divergence in architectural style. In point of view, the book covers the aesthetic spectrum from right to left; from programs that rigidly generate designs down to the smallest detail to revolutionary manifestoes that call for anarchy in building form and town plan. The documents, placed in context by the editor, are also international in their range: among them are the seminal and prophetic statements of Henry van de Velde, Adolf Loos, and Bruno Taut from the early years of the century; Frank Lloyd Wright's 1910 annunciation of Organic Architecture; Gropius's original program for the Bauhaus, founded in Weimar in 1919; \\"Towards a New Architecture, Guiding Principles\\" by Le Corbusier; the formulation by Naum Gabo and Antoine Pevsner of the basic principles of Constructivism; and articles by R. Buckminster Fuller on universal architecture and the architect as world planner. Other pronouncements, some in flamboyant style, including those of Erich Mendelsohn, Hannes Meyer, Theo van Doesburg, Oskar Schlemmer, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, El Lissitzky, and Louis I. Kahn. There are also a number of collective or group statements, issued in the name of movements such as CIAM, De Stijl, ABC, the Situationists, and GEAM. Since the dramatic effectiveness of the manifesto form is usually heightened by brevity and conciseness, it has been possible to reproduce most of the documents in their entirety; only a few have been excerpted.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lXSg6NMDAN0C&dq=20th-Century+Architecture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CONVERSATIONS WITH MAX.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0eesGwAACAAJ&dq=CONVERSATIONS+WITH+MAX.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adventure Guide Paris & lle-de-France (Adventure Guides Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IuOEtAEACAAJ&dq=Adventure+Guide+Paris&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Father's War Stories: Mt.

But the federal mandate of \\"no child left behind\\" has come to mean curriculums driven by preparation for standardized tests and quantifiable learning results. Even for very young children, unstructured creative time in the classroom is waning as teachers and administrators are under growing pressures to measure school readiness through rote learning and increased homework. In her new book, Vivian Gussin Paley decries this rapid disappearance of creative time and makes the case for the critical role of fantasy play in the psychological, intellectual, and social development of young children. A Child's Work goes inside classrooms around the globe to explore the stunningly original language of children in their role-playing and storytelling. Drawing from their own words, Paley examines how this natural mode of learning allows children to construct meaning in their worlds, meaning that carries through into their adult lives. Proof that play is the work of children, this compelling and enchanting book will inspire and instruct teachers and parents as well as point to a fundamental misdirection in today's educational programs and strategies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hpO72LmvC1YC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yellow Lies: A Ben Pecos Mystery (Ben Pecos Mysteries)","description":"Salvador Zuni is a master carver of traditional Native American fetishes.

When Ben Pecos, the new resident Indian Health Services psychologist, arrives at the pueblo, he finds himself caught up in the investigation of the murder of a trader in native artifacts and fetishes. Someone is willing to kill and use the spirits of the tribes to drive Salvador out of his mind and into prison for the crime.

Such a boost came in the first half of the twentieth century, when an obscure Belgian priest put his mind to deciphering the nature of the cosmos. Is the universe evolving to some unforeseen end, or is it static, as the Greeks believed? The debate has preoccupied thinkers from Heraclitus to the author of the Upanishads, from the Mayans to Einstein. The Day Without Yesterday covers the modern history of an evolving universe, and how Georges Lemaitre convinced a generation of thinkers to embrace the notion of cosmic expansion and the theory that this expansion could be traced backward to the cosmic origins, a starting point for space and time that Lemaitre called \\"the day without yesterday.\\" Lemaitre's skill with mathematics and the equations of relativity enabled him to think much more broadly about cosmology than anyone else at the time, including Einstein. Lemaitre proposed the expanding model of the universe to Einstein, who rejected it. Had Einstein followed Lemaitre's thinking, he could have predicted the expansion of the universe more than a decade before it was actually discovered.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=X61yswEACAAJ&dq=The+Day+Without+Yesterday:+Lemaitre,+Einstein,+and+the+Birth+of+Modern+Cosmology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The domestic life of Thomas Jefferson","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i3ZizgEACAAJ&dq=The+domestic+life+of+Thomas+Jefferson&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PERDITA'S PRINCE (Georgian Saga)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-nXAzgEACAAJ&dq=PERDITA%27S+PRINCE+(Georgian+Saga)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hidden Wisdom in the Holy Bible (Quest Books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=E8RzuwEACAAJ&dq=Hidden+Wisdom+in+the+Holy+Bible+(Quest+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love On the Run (Arabesque)","description":"In her eighth Arabesque novel, best-selling author Angela Winters blends romance and suspense in the story of a free-spirited young woman living in New York City, who becomes involved with the hunky college professor her family has hired to bring her home.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7CFQyzB2ct4C&dq=Love+On+the+Run+(Arabesque)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Through Russian snows;: A story of Napoleon's retreat from Moscow","description":"An illustrated historical adventure novel by G.A.

Sarah Sumner thinks there is. Avoiding the pitfalls of both radical feminism and reactionary conservatism, she traces a new path through the issues--biblical, theological, psychological and practical--to establish and affirm common ground. Arguing that men and women are both equal and distinct, Sumner encourages us to find ways to honor and benefit from the leadership gifts of both.

Unlike a lot of people, Matt Beckford is actually looking forward to turning thirty. His twenties really weren't so great...and now he has his love life, his career, his finances -- even his record collection -- pretty much in order, like any good grown-up should. But when, out of the blue, Elaine announces she \\"can't do this anymore,\\" Matt is left with the prospect of facing the big three-oh alone. Compounding his misery is the fact that he has to move back in with his parents. What's it all about, Alfie? Mum and Dad immediately start driving Matt up the wall, and emails from Elaine and nights out with his old school chum Gershwin aren't enough to snap Matt out of his existential funk. So he decides to track down more old schoolmates and see how they're handling this thirty thing. One by one, he gets in touch with the rest of the magnificent seven -- Pete, Bev, Katrina, Elliot, and Ginny, his former on-off girlfriend -- and soon the old gang is back together. But they're a lot older and a lot has changed and, even if he and Ginny still seem attracted to each other, you can't have an on-off girlfriend when you're thirty.

So begins David Keiper's story of how he designed and built the 31-foot sailing yacht WILLIWAW, then logged almost 20,000 miles of cruising around the Pacific.Keiper tells his own story, and the precision of his telling - he seems to have logged every wave, squall, and leak - pulls you into the adventure. Read, and you are there, thrilled as the hull surges up to sprint on its foils; impatient as the sea goes flat in a dying wind; resourceful as yet another life-threatening crisis arises hundreds of miles from the nearest land. How was it done? The answers are here.Design and construction details are not the end of useful information in this book. The author (with readers in tow) faces infectious diseases on remote islands, creates ways to pay for extended voyages, and solves the thorny problem of recruiting female crew (yachting doesn't have to be a predominantly male sport, nor should it be). Oh... and there are recipes for tasty cooking at sea.Hydrofoil Voyager is rich with hard-earned insight on how to design, build, and sail your own hydrofoil sailboat. By \\"living\\" through trials by sea, you absorb the lessons as they come. You confront the problems along with the author and nail down solutions... or you tough it out and hope.In this new 2012 edition, a color cover, additional maps, annotations and an appendix are added with a prequel short story written by the author prior to the publishing of the original book. A note that since this has been published posthumously the quality of the images lifted from the original book does not match that of the original publishing but since it has been out of print for a number of years this re-publishing is primarily to allow a new generation of hydrofoil enthusiasts to enjoy the story of Dave Keiper's WILLIWAW.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iKGjMAEACAAJ&dq=Hydrofoil+Voyager+:+Williwaw,+from+Dream+to+Reality,+and+Toward+the+Sailing+Yacht+of+the+Future&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DSM-IV Diagnosis in the Schools, Revised Edition (Guilford School Practitioner)","description":"This clearly written guide provides a succinct and well-organized overview of the principles of diagnostic classification used by the DSM-IV.

The Shadow of Ulysses follows the evolution of the sign through the ages, returning continuously as it does so to problems of intertextuality, interpretation, and reading. The sign appears as a 'shadow' both because by means of it, poetry describes humanity's journey to the other world of death, and because, in a figural connotation, Ulysses 'foreshadows' Columbus's and Vespucci's historical voyages to the New World.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TfGEAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Shadow+of+Ulysses&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life and times in Hopkinton, N.H","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=E6fIpwxDTswC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Until the Final Hour","description":"Offering an insider's perspective on the final days of the Third Reich, the recollections of a woman who became Hitler's secretary in 1942 sheds new light on his day-to-day life, character, and habits.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ie1FsnzQkfUC&dq=Until+the+Final+Hour&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cole Porter Years","description":"In his life and in his music, Cole Porter was the top the pinnacle of wit and sophistication. From the 1910s through the  50s, from Yale pep rallies through the Broadway triumphs of Anything Goes and Kiss Me, Kate, he delighted audiences with a glittering torrent of song:  I Get a Kick Out of You.   Night and Day,   Love for Sale,  and  Just One of Those Things.  The bright surface of these gems their catchy melodies and ingenious lyrics made them instant pop hits. Their more subtle qualities and their musical and emotional depth have made them lasting standards, among the greatest glories of the American songbook. In Cole Porter, William McBrien has thoroughly captured the creator of these songs, whose life was one not only of wealth and privilege but also of tragedy, secrecy, and courage. A prodigal young man, Porter found his aesthetic and emotional anchor in a long, loving, if sexless marriage, while continuing to maintain many discreet affairs with men. In 1937, at the height of his success, he suffered a near-fatal riding accident; his last eighteen years were marked by pain, drugs, and repeated operations on his legs, years of physical agony but unstinting artistic achievement. Here is the book that Porter s fans have long hoped for a life that informs the great music and lyrics though illuminating glimpses of the hidden, complicated, private man.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=c_626l6Hj_4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"John Coltrane's Giant Steps (Richard Jackson Books)","description":"You may be surprised at the tricky music a box, a snowflake, some raindrops, and a kitten can make.

It is designed for educators and students in education who want to go beyond the numerical values of the WISC-III intelligence quotients and understand the implications of the scores for the assessment and instruction of individual students. Chapter 1 discusses the use of intelligence tests and the WISC-III. The organization and administration of the WISC-III are addressed in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 describes each subtest as to the task involved, what purportedly is being measured, method of scoring, possible implications of high and low scores, and suggested relationships to reading. Chapter 4 presents procedures for analyzing WISC-III scores as a means of generating hypotheses about students' cognitive strengths and weaknesses that may affect reading ability. The final chapter discusses the research base by providing an overview of the research literature on the WISC series and reading/learning disabilities. Appendices include a WISC-III record form, a WISC-III data sheet, and an evaluation form that includes abilities measured by two or more WISC-III subtests. (Contains 74 references.)

When such machinery is in operation, often at very high speeds of thousands of revs per minute, any imbalance will set up vibration and often noise. In addition, such imbalance will cause extra wear and loss of efficiency in the machine. The answer is to balance the affected parts of the machine so that it operates smoothly and efficiently. This book is a practical account of such balancing techniques e.g how to balance a rotor, how to set up and verify performance of a balancing machine, and procedures for on-site balancing. In addition, other common causes of vibration will be covered e.g. misalignment, bad bearings and looseness. This book is the distillation of a successful course run by the author and developed over 20 years. University engineering departments do not teach balancing techniques beyond the very basic, and there is a need for educators and engineers to have a practical book available on the topic.   A practical book which will help the reader understand the importance of balance in today's high technology world   Outlines the history of dynamic balancing and other vibration reduction techniques   Profusely illustrated throughout","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W21tRy_nR-8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fingerpicking Paul Simon","description":"Includes 17 of Paul Simon's greatest hits specially arranged for fingerstyle guitarists at all levels.

Kennedy and the Struggle for Black Equality","description":"In the summer of 1963, in the wake of the Birmingham riots and hundreds of other protests across the country, John F. Kennedy advanced the most far-reaching civil rights bill ever put before Congress. Why had he waited so long? Kennedy had been acutely aware of the issue of race--both its political perils and opportunities--since his first Congressional campaign in Boston in 1946. In this, the first comprehensive history of Kennedy's civil rights record over the course of his entire political career, Nick Bryant shows that Kennedy's shrewd handling of the race issue in his early congressional campaigns blinded him as President to the intractability of the simmering racial crisis in America. By focusing on purely symbolic gestures, Kennedy missed crucial opportunities to confront the obstructionist Southern bloc and to enact genuine reform. Kennedy's inertia emboldened white supremacists, and forced discouraged black activists to adopt increasingly militant tactics. At the outset of his presidency, Kennedy squandered the chance to forge a national consensus on race. For many of his thousand days in office, he remained a bystander as the civil rights battle flared in the streets of America. In the final months of his life, Kennedy could no longer control the rage he had fueled with his erratic handling of this explosive issue.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=itNCswEACAAJ&dq=The+Bystander:+John+F.+Kennedy+and+the+Struggle+for+Black+Equality&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Loci Communes 1543","description":"This English translation represents the first \\"evangelical\\" statement of theology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RNcPAQAAIAAJ&dq=Loci+Communes+1543&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CHAMPION OF THE DEAD","description":"Champion of the Dead by Patrick Hatten is a mystery set in Athens during the city state's pending war with Sparta.
