This book offers some very helpful practices for involving the mind in your workouts.Mr. Whitmarsh's book centers on the idea that tremendous gains in size and durability can be made through an active mind-muscle connection. Through the use of various assessment exercises, the program is designed to teach you training strengths and weaknesses, and how to use mental tools to increase your effectiveness in goal setting and strength gains.If you spend any time in a weight room, its clear that most people go about their lifting as a passive participant, especially from a mental standpoint. While involving mental tools is a slow learning process (as Whitmarsh admits), when incorporated into your program, the benefits are substantial. Using some of his methods, I've increased my bench presses over 20 pounds in the last month. I also have an increased desire to excel.My trainer is big on the idea that &quot;Intensity + Intelligence = Results&quot;.

Over the course of just a few days though, without really knowing anything about her captor(not even his name),other than he has extreme mood swings, Doris learns things she never knew she could. She also develops a liking for this man, Leonard, who teaches her about poetry,and life, and makes her feel special.While the search by the law goes on, Doris sets up housekeeping in the little cabin and he begins to feel at home with her as well. They each find something in each other that they have lacked in their lives.Doris Mae actually prefers this situation to her home life, but Leonard's problems are deep rooted and it may be too late for him.Much of how we learn about Doris and Leonard is told in flashbacks through their own thoughts.

Taking the form of numerous applications in finance, network engineering, robot toys, and games, it is clear that his learning paradigm shows even greater promise for future developments. The authors summarize the foundations of reinforcement learning, some of this coming from their own work over the last decade.The authors define reinforcement learning as learning how to map situations to actions so as to maximize a numerical reward. The machine that is indulging in reinforcement learning discovers on its own which actions will optimize the reward by trying out these actions. It is the ability of such a machine to learn from experience that distinguishes it from one that is indulging in supervised learning, for in the latter examples are needed to guide the machine to the proper concept or knowledge. The authors emphasize the \\"exploration-exploitation\\" tradeoffs that reinforcement-learning machines have to deal with as they interact with the environment.For the authors, a reinforcement learning system consists of a \`policy', a \`reward function', a \`value function', and a \`model' of the environment. A policy is a mapping from the states of the environment that are perceived by the machine to the actions that are to be taken by the machine when in those states. The reward function maps each perceived state of the environment to a number (the reward). A value function specifies what is the good for the machine over the long run. A model, as the name implies, is a representation of the behavior of the environment. The authors emphasize that all of the reinforcement learning methods that are discussed in the book are concerned with the estimation of value functions, but they point out that other techniques are available for solving reinforcement learning problems, such as genetic algorithms and simulated annealing.The authors use dynamic programming, Monte Carlo simulation, and temporal-difference learning to solve the reinforcement learning problem, but they emphasize that each of these methods will not give a free-lunch. An entire chapter is devoted to each of these methods however, giving the reader a good overview of the weaknesses and strengths of each of these approaches. The differences between them usual boil down to issues of performance rather than accuracy in the generated solutions. Temporal difference learning in fact is viewed in the book as a combination of Monte Carlo and dynamic programming techniques, and in the opinion of this reviewer, has resulted in some of the most impressive successes for applications based on reinforcement learning. One of these is TD-Gammon, developed to play backgammon, and which is also discussed in the book.The authors emphasize that these three main strategies for solving reinforcement learning problems are not mutually exclusive. Instead each of them could be used simultaneously with the others, and they devote a few chapters in the book illustrating how this \\"unified\\" approach can be advantageous for reinforcement learning problems. They do this by using explicit algorithms and not just philosophical discussion. These discussions are very interesting and illustrate beautifully the idea that there is no \\"free lunch\\" in any of the different algorithms involved in reinforcement learning.In the last chapter of the book the authors overview some of the more successful applications of reinforcement learning, one of them already mentioned. Another one discussed is the \`acrobot', which is a two-link, underactuated robot, which models to some extent the motion of a gymnast on a high bar. The motion of the acrobot is to be controlled by swinging its tip above the first joint, with appropriate rewards given until this goal is reached. The authors use the \`Sarsa' learning algorithm, developed earlier in the book, for solving this reinforcement learning problem. The acrobot is an example of the current intense interest in machine learning of physical motion and intelligent control theory.Another example discussed in this chapter deals with the problem of elevator dispatching, which the authors include as an example of a problem that cannot be dealt with efficiently by dynamic programming. This problem is studied with Q-learning and via the use of a neural network trained by back propagation.The authors also treat a problem of great importance in the cellular phone industry, namely that of dynamic channel allocation. This problem is formulated as a semi-Markov decision problem, and reinforcement learning techniques were used to minimize the probability of blocking a call. Reinforcement learning has become very important in the communications industry of late, as well as in queuing networks."},{"Title":"Reinforcement Learning an Introduction","review":"This book was a great help at writing and programming for my thesis.

With incisive reasoning and documented historical fact, McGoldrick provides a long-overdue response to Carroll's shoddy scholarship intellectual dishonesty.McGoldrick's book is a must-read for anyone interested in Baptist Successionism. It is also a useful reference for those interested in the history of Christianity- particularly 19th century American &quot;restoration&quot; religions.Dan Laird, MD"},{"Title":"Baptist Successionism: A Crucial Question in Baptist History (Atla Monograph Series)","review":"When fundamentalist Christians are faced with the relative novelty of many of their cherished beliefs and practices within the context of Church history, they could react in one of three ways: first, they could acknowledge the facts of history but dismiss the importance of any historical support for their ecclesial tradition as irrelevant; second, they could acknowledge the historical evidence and adjust their beliefs to be more in accordance with historical Christianity (often leading to a move to Rome, Anglicanism, or Orthodoxy); third, they could dismiss the evidence as biased and construct a rival Church history more to their own liking.Even though the extensive research into Church history of the last century should render the latter choice as a hopeless one, it is unfortunately all too common within a subculture where conspiracy theories are taken seriously as historical evidence. Through numerous error filled volumes (e.g., J. M. Carroll's Trail of Blood), revisionist histories have been constructed wherein a supposed alternate strain of Christianity conforming to the faith of the Baptists, Seventh Day Adventists, Oneness Pentecostals, etc. (according to whomever is doing the reconstruction) is traced in opposition to the known Church of history. This \\"other\\" church supposedly can be followed through dissident groups who were persecuted by the Church as heretics but who were in actuality the \\"true Christians\\".James Edward McGoldrick deals with the claims of the \\"Landmark Baptist\\" movement (where many heretical movements are considered persecuted historical Baptists) in Baptist Successionism. As a former adherent of the movement, McGoldrick understands the appeal of the revisionist product - after all, how can one claim to follow the true Christian faith when history shows your beliefs to have their roots a millennia and a half after the Resurrection? Has the grace of God not been operating all these centuries? Has God taken a vacation?Revisionism claims to solve this by placing a rival Church of God alongside the corrupted so-called Church (whose \\"apostasy\\" is usually blamed on the Emperor Constantine). Of course, one cannot argue from silence and so candidates for the \\"true Church\\" are needed and found in various known dissident (and frequently heretical) sects throughout history. The effort has been so persuasive in some circles that some Baptists now believe they are not actually Protestants but can in fact trace their history back to the Apostolic Church in an unbroken succession.McGoldrick, a professor of history at Cedarville College, was swept up by such views as an undergraduate but in his later investigations into Church history discovered them to be historically untenable. Such revisionism usually centers on one or two beliefs wherein a certain dissident group might agree with them as opposed to the historic Church, but ignores the greater picture whereby such groups by and large do not resemble Baptists or any other Protestants at all and their motivations for agreeing upon certain issues has nothing to do with Baptist principles. His analysis is comprehensive, impressive, and irrefutable - there were no Baptists prior to the Protestant Reformation and efforts to project Baptist beliefs upon the groups commonly cited are based on wishful thinking.Dissident group after dissident group are placed under the historical microscope: Montanists, Novations, Paulicans, Bogomils, Petrobrusians, Arnoldists, Henricians, Albigenses, and Waldenses. Each group is shown to have no basic affinity to standard Baptist doctrine. Some were in schism on certain issues from the larger Church but had far more in common with them than anything we would consider Baptist. Others were so tainted by dualism as to only be \\"Christian\\" in a nominal sense. In no case is any group even remotely attached to Baptist beliefs and practices. McGoldrick also includes a refutation of the claim that St. Patrick was a Baptist. This contention is ridiculous but it shows how revisionists argue from silence (St. Patrick wrote very little and so they argue since he never endorsed certain Catholic doctrines in writing, he must be a Baptist) to produce Baptists ex nihilo. He then considers the claim that the Anabaptists were in the Baptist succession. That one could make such claims for a movement known to have sprung from the radical end of the Protestant Reformation is a mystery to all but those with successionist blinders, but McGoldrick patiently examines the claim and easily refutes it. Endings with a careful review of the true history of the Baptist movement, he concludes the obvious - Baptists are Protestants.One might consider it unfortunate that a book needed to be written to demonstrate such a well established fact. However, given the trusting nature of many Christians and the ignorance of Church history within much of Protestantism, McGoldrick is to be commended for taking the time to answer these claims and perhaps inoculating others from their allure. Although aimed at the Baptist successionist movement, it also answers similar claims from any group purporting to be the \\"other Church\\". McGoldrick's unanswerable reply is \\"What other church?\\""},{"Title":"Baptist Successionism: A Crucial Question in Baptist History (Atla Monograph Series)","review":"This book to me was a breath of fresh air. While I am not a Baptist (but at one time was affiliated with a non-landmark Baptist Church), my interest in this book was not so much for the purpose of refuting landmarkism, but to examine the various Christian or quasi-Christian bodies deemed heretical by the Catholic Church, and heralded as heroes of &quot;true christianity&quot; by Foxe's book of Martyrs, Dave Hunt, and the others who, denying that the Catholic Church is a Christian body, have to stay faithful to the words of Christ in Matthew 16:18 (and in doing so, label gross heresies and anti-Christian groups as &quot;true Christians&quot;, calling that which is evil good).The scholarship is excellent, as McGoldrick is careful to use original sources when possible, and when not, he honestly addresses the credibility of his secondary sources and is careful to extensively footnote everything.For this purpose I am greatly indebted, as the book is useful to this end as well.

IMO, McGoldrick's work deals a death knell to all forms of Baptist Successionsim. He is not afraid to point out the shoddy scholarship of many Baptist *historians.* Many Baptist historians are known for quoting baptist historians who are known for quoting baptist historians who are known for ... They are also known for quoting paedobaptists who support their position. However, many Baptist historians of the successionist mentality rarely quote primary source documents and when they do they are very selective. McGoldrick goes ad fontes (to the sources) and shows that all forms of successionsim are misguided."},{"Title":"Baptist Successionism: A Crucial Question in Baptist History (Atla Monograph Series)","review":"Brother James E. McGoldrick has written an interesting work on a controversial subject. It is admirable that he freely admits the fact that he is a former Landmark Baptist who has abandoned Landmark Baptist ecclesiology in favor of Protestant ecclesiology. He performs a valuable service by pointing out some of the historiographical weaknesses and errors found in a lot of pro-Landmark Baptist literature and provides some excellent primary sources deserving of further investigation.The major weakness of this book, as I see it, is that he paints the churches in the free church tradition (e.g., the Novatians, Donatists, Albigenses, Waldenses, and Anabaptists) with too broad a brush instead of acknowledging that there were many doctrinal and practical differences within each of these groups and between these groups. They were not nearly as monolithic as he portrays them. Landmark Baptists do not contend that all of the churches in the free church tradition subscribed to all of the things Landmark Baptists believe and practice today, but one might get this impression from reading this book. Their major contention is that there have been, ever since the time of Christ's earthly ministry, Bible-believing New Testament churches on earth that have preached the true way of salvation and practiced the true way of baptism. These New Testament churches have been neither Catholic nor Protestant, but they have been bitterly opposed by both of these groups at times.The sine qua non of Landmark Baptist ecclesiology is not the denial of any and all forms of a universal church, as this book might suggest, for a large percentage of the 19th century SBC Landmarkers believed in either the present or future existence of a church larger than the local, visible assembly or congregation. The essence of Landmark Baptist ecclesiology is ecclesiastical separation from churches that do not qualify as true New Testament assemblies. A rejection of alien baptisms, open communion, and pulpit affiliation lies at the heart of Old Landmarkism, and this is not brought out clearly enough in this volume. In effect, then, Brother McGoldrick often builds Landmark Baptist straw-men, then proceeds to tear them down.William Whitsitt's modernistic theory of Baptist church history is too readily accepted by the author of this book. He would do himself and the rest of us a great favor if he would approach the study of Baptist history without these liberal presuppositions, and he has the training and expertise to write some really valuable books on this subject from a more objective viewpoint. As it stands, he has overreacted to some of the excessive subjectivity one finds in some Landmark Baptist writings by being overly subjective himself and biased against Landmark Baptist ecclesiology."},{"Title":"Baptist Successionism: A Crucial Question in Baptist History (Atla Monograph Series)","review":"Probably, that isn't the title one expected of a scholarly and Christian publication, but McGoldrick's book deserves an enthusiastic review. Many people are confused about their Christian history. The history of Baptists can be especially confusing, and many people don't really care enough to do the research themselves. McGoldrick has saved them a lot of work and has, in his characteristically lucid yet thorough style, provided an efficient reply to those who perpetuate myths about Baptist history."},{"Title":"Baptist Successionism: A Crucial Question in Baptist History (Atla Monograph Series)","review":"This is a valuable refutation of a ludicrous but popular error, &quot;Baptist Successionism&quot; in its various forms. McGoldrick should be commended for using as many primary sources as were available.This book, like Ralph Woodrow's _The Babylon Connection?_, is definitely part of a positive trend in Fundamentalist Christian histories."},{"Title":"Baptist Successionism: A Crucial Question in Baptist History (Atla Monograph Series)","review":"McGoldrick's arguments are less than satisfying. In his chapter on the Albigenses, he admits the bias of his Roman Catholic sources and then proceeds as though it is of no consequence. Reading Catholic accussations of Albigenses that label them &quot;dualists&quot; is like taking HUAC reports as evidence that Civil Rights groups were Communists. This is a terrible error of historiography. In the chapter on Anabaptists, he provides many samples of Anabaptist belief that are supposedly inconsistent with modern Baptist belief: the trinity of man, the primacy of the New Testament, the refusal to swear oaths, and the free will of man. His assertion that baptists do not hold these beliefs is inaccurate. The majority of baptists may not hold these beliefs(especially the Southern Baptist Convention), but significant numbers of them do. His reasoning would be like pointing out that since ancient Roman Catholics did not believe in Papal infallibilty or the immaculate conception of Mary, the modern Catholic Church is not descended from them. Also in the chapter on Anabaptists, Mcgoldrick claims that the anabaptists did not believe in the primacy of scripture, and then provides a quote in which an anabaptist challenges a &quot;scribe&quot; to a debate saying he will recant if proven wrong by scripture. He ignores his own data when convenient. These sorts of errors occurr throughout the book. McGoldrick makes Carroll's error all over again by eagerly interpreting facts to fit his bias."},{"Title":"Baptist Successionism: A Crucial Question in Baptist History (Atla Monograph Series)","review":"McGoldrick in the introduction of his book,on page 5,sums it all with his statement &quot;The author of this book is thoughly convinced that the New Testament affirms the doctrine of the universal church, and he therefore feels no oblication to reconstruct the past in such away as to find ancient and medieval sects that might be called Baptists.&quot; As McGoldrick should know the Baptist name comes from Believer's Baptism, which separated them from most Anabaptist. This distinction put salvation in Jesus not &quot;the church&quot;. Baptist have always put scripture above tradition. Most baptist today would say many of the early fathers held many baptist tenets. We see many ancient heretics we would call brother. Cheif among those tenets are the authority of the holy scriptures only. Next to this the independance of the local church from alll man made authorities. McGoldrick's in error when he tries to define Cathari, Albigensed, Waldenses, and Anabaptist. These groups had many and veried tenets many of which could be claimed by baptist today. Todays baptist hold many and varied beliefs. What makes us baptist is believers baptism and local authority."},{"Title":"Database Marketing: The Ultimate Marketing Tool","review":"This books offers a nice overview of the various possibilities of database marketing and how it can be applied to get and retain customers. The chapters on analyses and database building have been written by others than Nash and turned out to be the least usefull in the book since they don't really explain 'how' to use the various concepts and their writing style is very different from Nash'. The rest of the book is an enthusiastic guide into Databasew Marketing with lots of short case studies for B-to-B, B-to-C and financial marketing. The book is already 6 years old and needs a bit of an update really since some of the technologies and trends which are discussed are already out of date. Still a very pleasant and informative book for people who just entered the field of DBM."},{"Title":"Database Marketing: The Ultimate Marketing Tool","review":"I work as a mrktg database consultant, and I find that this is a good introductory book on database marketing, the very next big trend in relationship marketing.

There are a few nice lofts in here though. Most are residential but there are a few commercial lofts that have been transformed into restaurants and offices. I didn't pay much for this one so I had no regrets, but there are better loft books on the market."},{"Title":"Yr Prsnl Vitamin Pfl","review":"I have been following the guidelines in Dr. Colgan's book since it came out in 1982. I think the information in this book is as valuable now as it was when the book was introduced. About every 5 years, I review the profile to make sure that I am still on track with my vitamin and mineral intake.I am 62 years old, have a lousy diet (lots of junk food), don't get nearly enough exercise and I am as healthy as a horse (I suppose I should knock on wood). I attribute this in large part to the fact that I am getting enough vitamins and minerals into my system thanks to Dr. Colgan.I have not had a cold or flu since I started taking vitamins and minerals regularly; as far as I'm concerned they work. And Dr. Colgan's book will help you figure out the amounts that are right for you. It is the only vitamin book I know of that helps you establish the correct amounts; the only book that takes you and your lifestyle into consideration.I highly recommend this book to anyone who will listen. I also highly recommend the religiously regular use of vitamins and minerals. If you don't take them regularly, they won't work for you.Leland Sheppard"},{"Title":"Yr Prsnl Vitamin Pfl","review":"Five Stars would not have been out of line as a rating, except for the fact that the book was written so long ago(1982). The author cannot be faulted for &quot;telling a story&quot; that needed to be told at the time, or for the fact that scientific knowledge has advanced and so some of the information is now outdated. For its time, it was a phenomenally informative and useful book for anyone looking for both a scientifically valid rationale for individualized and complete vitamin and mineral supplementation and a practical guide to proper individual dosages. Its worksheets for computing individualized dosages are worth their weight in gold. I have been supplementing my family's diet according to Dr. Colgan's formulations for 15 years, (with modifications as new information became available or on the advice of a nutritionally knowledgeable M.D.) and have often recommended the book to others or given it as a gift. I am delighted to learn that it is still available."},{"Title":"Yr Prsnl Vitamin Pfl","review":"I had purchased this book after I bought Optimum Sports Nutrition, the difference between this book and OSN is startling. I find it hard to belive that the same person wrote both books. This is book is an early attempt to get the readers to realize that the vitamins and minerals and other essential nutrients that we need to maintain a healthy lifestyle are seriously lacking in todays (yesterdays?) foods. The book was written in 1982 and unfortunatly provides nothing more than rhetorical information, it reads too much like a story. I'm glad I bought Optimum Sports Nutrition before this otherwise I probably wouldnt have bothered to look at that book having seen this one. I hate to be the one to give Dr Colgan a bad review because I already have two of his other books (OSN and Nutrition for the Millenium both excellent books) but I hope some of you use this review as a heads up than as something to gauge all of his work. So to reiterate this shouldnt be the book that you first expose yourself to Micheal Colgans otherwise excellent work."},{"Title":"Yr Prsnl Vitamin Pfl","review":"I worked up my vitamin program according to the questionnaire, and I was surprised to find my headaches and brain fog disappear, along with some other symptoms that I had been experiencing because of a chronic illness; so there is still a great wealth of information in this book even though it was written many years ago. It would be awesome if Dr. Colgan would publish an up to date version with all of the new scientific advances in nutrition, but I had read quite of few of his other books before this one, and I would still recommend this one to everyone, all of his books complement each other in my opinion, as far as gaining new knowledge and advances in nutritional science."},{"Title":"Comparative Youth Culture: The Sociology of Youth Cultures and Youth Subcultures in America, Britain and Canada","review":"Brake is the best, the most analytical and most interesting book I have read about subcultures.

This book is beautifully designed from a book production point-of-view and is a handy guide for sexually curious people.It seems like more of a guy's book, but there are lots of contributions from women in this fascinating collection of sexy ideas. While topless bars may not be of interest or value to most women and even some guys, I found the &quot;Rules of the Lap Dance: Do's &amp; don'ts from a private dancer&quot; to be a good read. There's also information of hotspots in not-to-far San Francisco, Las Vegas, Tijuana, and Palm Springs.It's also like a restaurant guide or tour book except that the establishments serve up a different kind of menu. That menu includes strip clubs, porn shops, adult toy stores, lingerie shops, spas/massage parlors, some kinky history, porn star interviews, singles bars, escort services, late-night pick-up joints, stories of rock star groupies, celebrity clubs, nude beaches, happening hotels, and even places to &quot;make out.&quot; (Is this high school again?)The publisher promises new editions for New York, San Francisco, Chicago, and Las Vegas in the near future. That New York edition should give new meaning to &quot;Sex and the City.&quot;I give this a 5 star rating for the ideas it triggers and for the excellent formatting. But the real question is whether this information is really a benefit or just something interesting to read about. As a travel-tour book it's price of $18.95 may be in line. As something interesting to read, however, the price of the book is $4 too high.In the meantime, this book should probably sell a ton regardless."},{"Title":"Horny?

More than just listings, this reference offers up extensive overviews of the treaties: their history, their contents, and their implications to tribal authority patterns. Any serious Native American collection needs this reference.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"Treaties with American Indians: An Encyclopedia of Rights, Conflicts, and Sovereignty (3 volume set)","review":"I have not read the 3 volume set yet except for the Introduction, Resources, Biobliography, and Index. These 4 headings can be found in every volume, i.e. a waste of about 200 pages. I sorely miss maps because treaties are mostly about ceding land which could be perfectly shown with maps. Furthermore, I miss some important treaties in the Primary Source Documents (e.g. Fort McIntosh, Hopewell, Fort Harmar, Greenville, Fort Laramie 1868). These would have needed about 100 pages more but we already saved 200 pages. There are some very grave mistakes and incredibly bad editing in the Resources section titled \\"Alternate Tribal Names and Spellings\\". As a starter: what do Aztec, Hohokam, Cora, Huichol, Lancandon, Mixtec, Tarahumara, Tequistlatecos, Toltec, Winik, Zapotec, and Yaqui have to do with U.S. and Canadian treaties? Moreover, Arapaho # Atsina = Gros Ventres); Delaware # Abnaki or Wampanoag; Gros Ventres # Hidatsa = Minitaree; Mohawk # Abenaki; Eskimo # Alutiiq = Aleut; Lumbee # Cheraw; Nanticoke # Unalachtgo = Delaware; Tututni # Tolowa; Yazoo # Chakchiuma. The editor (Fixico) and the press (ABC-CLIO) that claim to have made such a good book should employ somebody who knows at least something about the topic (my source: Carl Waldman's Atlas of The North American Indian). Since treaties are not exactly my strongest field of knowledge (I am simply very interested in Native Americans and read a book or two every once in a while), I will not be able to judge the text. I sure hope that there are NO mistakes there, and I can believe what has been written. As for the maps: I inquired the editor and the press about them some time ago, but - no surprise here - never got an answer.

In mathematics distance concepts arise in a variety of applications for example, in probability theory inducing a topology on the space of probability measures, eg Prokhorov metric, or in communications theory assessing how far apart two sequences of symbols are, Hamming distance, which is also used to determine how different two DNA sequences are.

When followed properly, the methods are estimated to give 80/20 odds of the desired gender, rather than the usual 50/50. The key to the methods lies in the differences between X-sperm and Y-sperm; X-sperm live longer but Y-sperm are faster, so methods for female conception involved sexual congress a few days before ovulation (giving the Y-sperm time to die off) and making the woman's interior more hostile to sperm, while the methods for male conception are the opposite. The techniques in How To Make A Baby Girl Or Baby Boy do not cost money, or require a doctor's supervision beyond the expenses or necessary medical supervision of any pregnancy.

Working hard. Being honest. Loving his parents. Fighting for his country in a time of war. Allie Nelson is a beautiful southern belle who has a tender, loving heart and who comes from a family that is as much concerned with social status as anything else. Noah and Allie have little in common except for a few weeks they spent together during one magic summer a decade and a half earlier.Now, after the end of fighting the European and Pacific theatres, Allie is engaged to a socialite lawyer and Noah has purchased and restored an old house that holds his memories of the one woman he has ever truly loved. By chance only a few weeks before she is to be married, Allie sees a newspaper story about Noah who has returned to New Bern, North Carolina. At the moment she sees the feature, she knows that she must see Noah just one more time either to exorcise the ghosts from her past or to restore the love that she and Noah once briefly shared.Framed around the memories of a mysterious retirement home resident who tells a story to another resident of the home of love found, lost, and found from a notebook, \`The Notebook' is not short on salubrious emotion. Occasionally a little campy, \`The Notebook' is a cross between well-conceived, well-written contemporary fiction and a sentimental romance novel. The results are enchanting.Nicholas Sparks paints with words wonderfully descriptive characters who not only include Allie and Noah, but also Allie's big-hearted and ill-fated fianc&eacute;, Lon, Noah's wise and warm deceased father, Allie's manipulative but in the end likeable mother, and even Noah's former employer, the late Morris Goldman who Sparks uses as a sort of literary device but who is not actually an active participant in this love story. There is just enough suspense to coax even the most jaded of readers to hope that the star-crossed lovers reunite. Then like a patient lover, Sparks' framing of \`The Notebook' postpones the resolution just enough to make the story just a little more special than most.Ultimately, \`The Notebook' is a very nice, simple, and romantic read, perfect for any \\"book club for two.\\" Fellas, a suggestion: ask your special lady to read and talk about this book together. You just might be surprised about how you feel about the experience and, more importantly, how your special lady feels about it, too."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book is responsible for Nicholas Sparks becoming my favorite author! I know of no one who can write such good love novels as he does. Sparks has written some killer love stories folks! Something else he is great at is using the elements of heartbreak and suspense.

One summer in New Bern, their lives take a turn that will forever change each! They met and fell in love, forming a bond that would test the waters of time. No good love story comes along easily, none do, and such is the case with this one. Allie's parents disapprove of Noah all along and move her away, forcing the happy couple to break apart. 14 years later Allie is happily engaged to Lon and is soon to be married. But no matter how much she loves Lon she is unable to erase Noah's memory from her mind. You'll have to read the book to find out who she chooses!

The only thing that I do not understand about the movie is the portrayal of Allie and Noah's fighting. There was not all the fighting in the book. Overall, I would like to say I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a truly touching love story. The book makes you think about what is really important in life. Life passes you by so quickly and one day you turn around and wonder where it all went......"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book tells the story of Noah and Allie. It is set in the early 1930s. They fall in love, but it is forbidden. The rest of the book is pretty predictable, but it is also a quick, fun read. Sparks did a great job with writing the plot, and detailing the characters, but the book was a little to predictable."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks is sure to captivate you. Right from the first sentence, (\\"Who am I? And how, I wonder, will this story end?\\"), you are drawn in and feel that you need to keep reading. This romance novel is very well written and organized, and easily takes you into the minds of the main characters, Noah Calhoun and Allie Nelson.The Notebook is a tale of true love leading Allie back to Noah after fourteen years of absolutely no contact. One day Allie sees a newspaper article, and in it is Noah, her lost love she had spent a summer with when she was a teenager. It shows Noah in front of a recently fixed up house, and she remembered the summer the shared, and his vow to repair the old house. Allie, now engaged to a lawyer named Lon, and only a few weeks before the wedding, goes back to New Bern. She claims she is going to New Bern to do a little sopping and take her mind off the hectic planning. When she checks in to the hotel, though, she knows she has to go see Noah again.She goes to Noah's house and after an awkward reunion they spend the night catching up on each others lives and sometime in the night Allie falls back in love with Noah. From there Allie struggles between Lon and Noah, and things keep popping up that make her decision more complicated.I think this is a great book with a brilliant plot. This story of unbreakable love is a must read for any young adult or older that enjoys love stories.Danielle G"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was fortunate to have a short lived experience such as Noah and Allie back in the '70's. Unfortunately, my husband passed away leaving me with a wonderful gift - our son. I have remarried and again found love and have a daughter. I felt every emotion possible when I read this book. I truly believe that if you meet that special person - you will know - that he/she is the one for you."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"My wife loved this book and wanted me to put in a few comments for her and I quote: &quot;I got very angry at some of the comments that these people said. Who could rate this book a 1. I guess these people don't really know what real love is. It is a shame there can't be more relationships in real life like the one described in the book. This was the greatest book I have ever read. I have the same special feeling about my relationship. I really hope it remains the same as I grow old.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I bought the book for one reason, the author had my last name. I decided to take the book to work one day to read on my slow time. Fortunately, the entire day wsa slow, I read the book in just six hours. I laughed, I cried, I felt the emotions that the characters were feeling. I can honestly say that this book is the best book I have ever read in my entire life. I could not put it down!! I would HIGHLY recommend it for people of all ages!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Reading this novel reminded me of the love I lost when I was 16 years old, and found again at 27 years old. I think everyone wants an unending love like Noah and Allie's. If you are a believer in true love, this novel is for you."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Yes, it is touching but I did not cry the whole novel like I did with Bridges.. But it's a novel that will stay with me forever . I like the simplicity. fluidity of his style of writing, the bluntness of words used to describe feeling and emotions made the right impact. This is a tale about love that endures a lifetime and I love it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A truly moving book - I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"My son ran into an old girl friend of his in a small AP in Ft. Myers, Fla. this summer and the last time they had gone together was 1971.He's from MD and she's from Wis. and this was her first love. When she got on the plane she was in tears and the man next to her asked her why and she revealed everything to him and he then proceeded to tell her his story and she said we should write a book and he told her I did and for her to get The Notebook. She sent the book to my son and that is how I came to read it and I devoured it in one sitting and the ending really makes you see what we are coming into and believe me it's scarry, but it gave you a lot to think about."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"My late husband and myself shared the rare and wonderful love expressed by Mr. Sparks in 'The Notebook'. If a person has an inkling of hope that the reality might exist that a love such as expressed in 'The Notebook' could ever happen, then reading this story will reaffirm that hope. I've had the good fortune to experience what Noah and Allie had. It really does happen."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I recommend this for anyone who has ever lost a loved one emotionally/mentally before death occurs. This is a story of commitment and its true meaning."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was wonderful to read and to reflect upon. Better than Bridges of Madison County because it was based on a real life love. We should all be so lucky."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks' \\"The Notebook\\" is a wonderful story of never ending love and passion between two people. It is a story of two teenagers who fall in love one summer and how that summer changes them forever. As the reader, I related to this story because of the desire to have a love like these two people share. Their companionship, friendship, and loyalty is evident throughout the entire book and nothing is able to destroy it; not time, not distance, not even tragedy. This book is written for people of all ages, from teenagers to seniors. It is a very easy read and the story just flows from one page to the next, making it a very pleasant read. Make sure to have a box of Kleenex near by, however, because this book touched my heart like no other book I have read, and will probably do the same to you! If you are looking for a quick read and a true love story, this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is the fourth book I've read by Nicholas Sparks and it is one of the best. This book has all the emotion that sparks is known for plus the little twist that will make you reach for the tissue. In this story we have two young lovers that cannot live with out each other, however they don't discover this until later on in their lives when they both have to make a decision of which path to take. A true classic, I can't wait until the movie comes out in June!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Awesome book, romantic, and very realistic. I laughed and cried. Excellent choice and easy reading."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A quick read, of wonderful words that tell of a true love. The Notebook stays as one of my favorite books read, but a very experianced dedicated writer. Everyone should read this book, if haven't already."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is my favorite book of all time. I worked in a nursing home for years and have seen so much of what Sparks describes here. The book brought tears to my eyes more than once. He does a wonderful job of bringing these characters to life. This books speaks volumes about love and life in a limited amount of pages. I recommend this book with all my heart. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I loved the book and found it very inspirational. The way it starts off in the present, and then goes back into time and leads up to the future in the form of story was creative and helped the mystery of the book. Sparks shows Noah's passion and love for Allie by letting us know everything though Noah is feeling or thinking. It makes one feel like they are there actually witnessing the love story and feeling what Noah and Allie are. Once you start the book, you can't put it down. It's addicting! It makes you want to know what is really going to happen between Allie and Noah. You just want them to be together so bad that you keep telling Allie to tell Noah that she still loves him.The first two quarters lead you up to the climax of Noah and Allie making love. You can actually feel what they are feeling because they pour their hearts out to one another and release all the feelings they have been building up in the first half of the book. It is such a passionate scene, that it makes you step back and wonder how to people can be so profoundly in love after so many years. You get all happy because you think they will be the perfect couple for forever, and then the story takes you for another surprise.This book is just so powerful and heart wrenching, that you can not help but love it. There is never a dull moment; it's full of passion, heart ache, depression and love. All these combined make the book mysterious and great. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves love stories because this is one of the all time greatest love stories.This is the second Nicholas Sparks book I have read and it won't be the last. All his books are worth reading, trust me, you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Since first novels only introduce us to the writing abilities of their authors, it is no surprise that this novel propelled Sparks onto a prolific writing career, with much better novels.The Notebook will tear at your heart strings, despite its slow pace and failure to touch upon the events that shaped the characters...these teens appear to have never grown up, even though Noah was shipped off to war. Such harrowing experiences should have hardened his character, but there is no evidence of that in his reunion with Allie, which disappointed this reader, since it is unrealistic that the experience had no bearing on his future character or his relations with others.Though it is a first novel with many trite plot lines, I will recommend it for those seeking romance and happy endings."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"One of my favorite books, especially the audio version using narrators with soothing southern accents. Sparks proves all over again that love can be enduring and exciting at the same time. Bittersweet story that'll stay in my memory for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"No, this book is not for people who love violence, [physical activity], and fast action. This book is for the tender hearted. It is about loyalty, something sorely lacking in this world today. Loyal-love. Nicholas Sparks has a problem with going on and on sometimes in his books - finish the book, it's already been said! But you excuse that with the Notebook. You really don't want it to end. And you leave the book wishing that there were more such stories in the real world..........To really appreciate this book you should listen to it on tape or CD. The readers do a great job and make it come alive more...like having someone read to you.I loved this book..."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Such a great book! Makes you cry and laugh! MUST READ!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Our daughter, an Enlish major and aspiring novelist, gave my wife and I a copy of this book. In turn we both read it quickly with a similar reaction: putting it down with a lump in our throat, a tear in our eye, and remarking to each other what a sad yet delightful story. Sparks is a master at convey human emotions of love, hope, frustration and resignation so they touch the reader without seeming contrived or simplistic"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"For 200 pages, let's ignore the criticisms about how this book is written and enjoy the wonderful (happy &amp; sad) story. Sparks makes you realize what is important in life.."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I've read through quite a few of these reviews, and yes this is a love story. But what most people fail to see is the devistation that a disease can do to our lives. The beginning of this story was beautiful, but the second half is the reality of Alzheimer's. He is now the only one to remember these moments. To watch your soul mate torn from your reality and dumped into a world of confusion and loss is something I wish never to experience. I read this story a month after Alzheimer's took my dad from my mom at the age of 52. Don't just read this book solely as a love story. Read it as a testiment to what this disease steals from us"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was very sensitive and exact as to the feelings that people have when they loose the deepest love that they have. I lost my husband last year and still mourn his loss because we were so connected emotionally. Not many people experience that true love and cannot appreciate it unless they experience that feeling. The less than complimentary reviews of this book make me believe that they have not experienced that feeling. This book may not be a classic literary find (I have read the Grapes of Wrath, Moby Dick and most of the other classics, but it is worth the time to get to your deeper soul and ability to love someone else unconditionally"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I bought this book based on the glowing reviews I read at Amazon.com but I must tell you, I hated this book. First I must clarify that I am NOT a snob or a hard-hearted romance hating person. In fact, I LOVED the Bridges of Madison County!!!! But this book was terrible. It was poorly written, and so overly simplistic and sentamental that I felt like I was reading a novel excerpt from Redbook magazine. Please, please, if you like fine books, do not even consider buying this book. I beseach you"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Having first identified with the main characters and also seeing my own parents married for 60 years and struggling with this very disease in the end of their lives . What else could I do but read and shed tears? What a beautiful well written story. Thank you Nicholas Sparks.mrseg"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I reluctantly read this book, mainly because it was perceived by others recommending it to me to be an &quot;older&quot; persons book. I bought the hard back copy and took it home to read at some point because of its best seller recommendation. I started reading it (I think there might have been an excerpt in Good Housekeeping or some magazine because it seemed quite familiar). I read the book from cover to cover in one afternoon, and cried more than I did over &quot;Bridges.&quot; It takes some writing to win me over. The Notebook has because it delivers more than just a fleeting romance....it is about a romance between two people that is real, truly real. It is an understanding between two people, their love for one another, and their undying care for one another. Wouldn't we all be better off to have this kind of enduring love"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I found the beginning of this book to be a little wishy washy but it had a interesting twist to the story. The 2nd half of the book was more meaningful and in my opinion this is what true and unconditional love is all about. I wouldn't say it was the best book I ever read but it was an easy read. But all in all it was a good book. Not a great book but a good book"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I did not even think of reading The Bridges of Madison County -- too syrupy for my taste and this novel is definitely in that vein. But, as a native of coastal North Carolina (the novel's locale) I was intrigued enough to read it. The writing is not the best -- some descriptions are too florid, some dialogue a bit contrived -- but it is a sweet, sentimental little story. Definitely something to read as a treat, like a piece of rich candy; a guilty pleasure and you know you shouldn't indulge because it isn't very (intellectualy) filling, but it leaves you with a taste in your mouth as pleasing as pralines or your Mama's best pecan pie"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"To see such pure love. Not since Segal has there been so touching a love story.The story is so real - even if you haven't experienced these scenes, you most definitely can feel them. The raindrops. The warm fire. The tears. Holding hands. It is all so vivid and real.I'd recommend this to anyone and especially to those who've been married quite awhile. You'll come away with a lot more love to give. And, you'll recommend it to the first person you see afterwards! This is not a romance novel, it is a story of never-ending love"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"What a waste of time. My wife and I just read The Notebook and were disappointed by almost every facet of it. Most of the dialogue was contrived and totally unreal. I don't care how romantic Noah is drawn up to be, no man speaks like that; unbelievable (in a bad way). One reviewer said the ending was creepy, and I would say that is putting it nicely. Another thing that was really stupid was that Sparks tries to give Allie virtue, yet she cheat's on her fianc&eacute; without remorse. Total character flaw, again unbelievable.Did I mention the writing was horrid? Sparks jumps between perspectives way to much. Third person is good, but he puts us in the mind of Allie and Noah in the same scene on more than one occasion. It surprises me Warner bought the rights in the first place. Not only that but the editor should be fired.I paid a mere 5.95 for the paperback and trust me that was too much."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The moment I picked up this book I knew it was going to be good....I am hooked on Sparks and I find this to be his best ever book....I am very thrilled that there is going to be a movie to put a face on the characters in the book. I only wish to live my life the same as Noah and Allie lived their's...IN LOVE! The book is a great expamle of how everyone should follow thier heart and when you meet the person that you can't live without, never let go....I recommend this book and all his others, for they will make you laugh and cry, but most of all they will teach you a lesson in love!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It's a &quot;must read&quot;. It was very touching and heartfelt. A book you want to share with everyone. The story made me think of my Grandparents true love for each other. Nothing can be better than that!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"There should be a warning on this book informing the reader that tissue and the probability of reading the book in one sitting would be required. Through flashback, Sparks keeps the reader guessing until the end. The love cherished by Noah and Allie became tangible, a love that many have or want to experience. Share the book with others, because the love captured is similar to watching a couple in real life."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was the best book that I have ever read. It is a wonderful love story. After reading it I completely fell in love with both Allie and Noah. (but mostly Noah) I also cried a lot while reading it, but a good cry though. I would definitly recommend this book to anyone who is craving a good book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook was the most inspirational love story I have read in a long time. As a first time reader of Spark's literature, I am completely excited about reading more of his works and discovering his techniques. The story depicts the life of two lovers, Allie and Noah, separated fourteen years beyond their control. Later in life, the star crossed lovers meet again, rekindling the flame from their past. Through many obstacles, the two realize the world is not complete without the other despite the hardships and consequences of their love affair... As readers, we are drawn heavily into their life stories full of deceit, happiness and pain actually told in the form of foreshadowing. Later, we realize that the protagonist, Noah is reading to us the actual \\"notebook\\" which represents the struggle of finding true love, discovering that love can happen at any age, and showing that \\"miracles\\" do come true. I would highly recommend this novel to anyone that is willing to have an open heart and shed a few tears. The writing style of Sparks is amazing; he gives out just enough imagery, yet he leaves the reader constantly wanting more. The simultaneous thoughts of Allie and Noah add to the suspense Spark uses to evoke the climax of his story. Constantly, you will wonder what's next and only hope for the best in this twisting love triangle. The Notebook is an excellent novel for anyone, man or woman who is willing to discover the possibilities of life and romance and just to appreciate an outstanding piece of fiction."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks is a bit of a different spin on a sweet love story. By starting it off at the end and making the whole thing a reflection of past events, it places a different spin on what is definitely not just another love story. While the main focus, obviously, is romantic love, Sparks touches on other topics such as loss, the value of dreams, and the power of emotion. Sparks beautifully crafts this novel into a remarkable tapestry of the feelings and thoughts of the characters. When a high school summer sweetheart haunts Noah Calhoun's thoughts since the day she left, he probably never expected to be reunited with that very ghost from his past. The girl from his past, Allie, is a beautiful woman... with a fianc&eacute;e. Through the whole reunion and the later ordeals, the reader is allowed in the world of the characters; their emotions and thoughts help build the story.Having only read one other book by Nicholas Sparks, I was unsure what to expect. I had read A Walk to Remember earlier and did not particularly enjoy the style of that particular novel. The story itself was good, but I did not like the way Sparks told it. I know that many did enjoy the novel, so I decided to read another book by Sparks to see if I had missed something. Apparently I had because The Notebook is heartfelt novel that I genuinely enjoyed."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks, fantastic book!! I would advise anyone to read it. It starts off in a nursing home, a little strange for a romance story. Then the end of the book returns to the nursing home which explains it all. This is the story of a man and woman who experience something so powerful, so real they never forget it. All throughout their daily lives they looked for that certain aspect in every individual they dated, but sadly they could not find it. Until one day Allie spots where Noah is and she heads off in his direction. They meet and sparks fly. Who does Allie chose? her fianc&eacute; or her one true love. You'll have to read and see!! Great book!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks weaves a wonderful tale in this book of powerful, everlasting love. It is so romantic !! I loved it, and couldn't put it down. The end was so touching !"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I think &quot;serious&quot; readers might dismiss this book as yet another trashy, self-indulged, semi-romantic, unoriginal story but that seems like a great injustice. There is something genuinely touching about the characters, their vulnerability,and their humanity. Sparks writes them (the characters) directly from his heart, I think, and in doing so creates a picture of love that is pure and idealistic. There are some twists and turns to the plot that are unexpected to some, but in the end the real strenght of the book lies in the emotions it manages to evoke within us. It is easy to say that cliches and run of the mill situations make up the book, but underneath all of that is a deep message that says something important about love. While that message might be different for everyone, it is a message nonetheless and I think that's a significant acomplishment for any book. This book spoke to me. It had a deep meaning that caused me to question and to wonder about what love is, its strenght, its power, its significance. For anyone who has asked those questions this book might be surprinsgily enjoyable and deeply touching."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Love of two older people. What women wouldn't want a man like Noah with his dedication and endearing love until the very end. What happened to the years? Love and life, they passed so fast. The ending was amazing. What a concept.I cried for a good ten minutes and realised how sentimental I am. But really super writing with how its told from a nursing home, with Noah reading a book of their life to his sweetheart on his visits. She has dimentia and doesn't know who Noah is, but for brief moments as he reads to her the story from a notebook. The scenes from their youth for the most part takes over in flash-back. The ending was amazing, and is what made this book great. This was a story that made you think about lifes journey. Stick with it until the very end, you will be glad you did."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I always thought that this was a romance between young people and so it sat on my shelf until I was in the right mood for that kind of book. It sat there for quite some time until, recently, I felt the need for a change in genre and decided to pick it up. I couldn't put it down--it mesmerized me. The story is a romance between young people, but it's so much more than that. It's a true love story--not just a story about true love, but a story that defines love, clarifies it and shows the enduring power of it. This book is about love, faith, trust, hope and miracles. I loved it.I don't know that there is anyone out there who hasn't already read this book, but, just in case, I'm going to try and avoid any spoilers. This story touched me so deeply that I'm more inclined to write about my emotions than the substance of the book itself. In some places, I felt my heart warm and happiness bloom inside me. In others, I cried so hard I had to stop reading because I couldn't read the words anymore. I didn't expect to feel this way over a story--not many stories have touched me this deeply--but I can't say enough about how much I loved it.The Notebook was, in short, amazing. It made me feel and believe and wish and hope and dream. I realize now that I have this love in my life and I can only hope it continues to grow and sustain. Love won't be denied and it can create miracles.Follow me as readerbarbara at blogspot dot com"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book is one of Nicholas Sparks' worst to this date. I can't understand how anyone could like this thin story line? I normally enjoy his work, but this was a disappointment. I wouldn't waste time on it again neither would I recommend anyone else to waste their time on this.The composition was boring and nothing came as a surprise.The only possible good thing about this book is that it is written by Nicholas Sparks. The one I read was translated to danish, and if everybody really think this book was a good as they says it is without they're being a typical girl, the blame is on the translator."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I can't review this book because I never recieved it.

First time this has happened to me on Amazon."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Noah Calhoun and Alli (Allison) Nelson come from two completely different worlds. Noah is the small-town heart throb just getting by day by day; Alli is the rich and innocent girl with big dreams who is only in town for the summers. The Notebook is set in the present: Noah reads to a patient in the same boarding house everyday. The story he reads is about a young couple who fell in love but were separated by social and economic forces. However, despite this separation they find themselves coming back to each other. The woman Noah reads to everyday is Alli herself, she just doesn't know it for Alli has Alzheimer.While most of the book is set in the present, we are given glimpses into this past, into Noah's and Alli's past. However, there is not much given beyond these glimpses into their past. Despite this, the book is still pretty good. Like many, I did see the movie but I waited until after I read at least half of the book. While the movie is different from the book in a lot of ways, the book still is able to stand on its own. Frankly, this book is about love, and how love can surpass time and hardships. A recommended read for those looking for a very quick read."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I'm about 100 pages into this book,and I don't think that I'll be able to finish. Was Sparks paid by the word? There are so many! There is so much trivial detail (I really didn't need him to explain how to make a cup of tea) and yet Sparks drops many sub-plots that might be interesting. I'd seen the movie and enjoyed it, but the screenplay, while not especially good, was universes better than the book. And the love scenes -- really. They're just awful and embarrassing. They read like they were written by an adolescent boy. I haven't read a Harlequin book since I was a teenager, but this is on a par with what I remember."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Spark's writing captures my heart every time!

I heard The Notebook was a really good book and it's from a genre I normally don't read so I decided to try another type of book. I started the book on a monday and finished it in a week! I'm a slow reader also, but this book didn't stop me! I couldn't put it down. I was so good to the point where I was reading it during lunch and carried it around everywhere with me.The Notebook was a really touching book, because how it's based on the love life with Allie and Noah. It's from where they first met at the carnival as teenagers to when they are in the nursing home as old people. The Notebook is cute because it shows the struggles they had through there life, but it never stopped them from loving each other.The book shows what true love is. How they go through fights, but still love each other. They are different people, but still love each other. They go there separate ways, but they find each other and fall back in love. Allie was engaged, but not even that could break them up. Altimerzers didn't keep them from their memories.I recommend this book to someone who loves a classic love story, and is looking for a great read."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I purchased the DVD movie, \\"The Notebook\\" at the recommendation of a friend.

It was a little different from the movie which I'd already seen but still a great book!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The feeling I gathered upon completing this novel is analogous to the natural warmth of a homespun blanket or a soft-glowing fire on a winter's night. A tale of everlasting love never loses its appeal to a reading audience, and this novel certainly showcases a gem. As the novel follows the growing love of Allie and Noah in post-World War II North Carolina, I was given a rare and captivating glance at true love and its virtues. Such examples include the tenacity of Noah's love for Allie and his commitment to stay with her while Alzheimer's seizes her mind. Author, Nicholas Sparks utilizes simplicity and honesty in his writing and never seeks to clutter it with unessecary prose. In descriptions of the two lovers' feelings, he uses a direct approach without intermingling superfluous descriptions. Additionally, I found &quot;The Notebook&quot; to be refreshing, optimistic, and uplifting. The story ribbons weave together a tale of sweet harmony and romance that is greatly needed to shine loving light into our &quot;troubled society.&quot; This book will assuredly become a well-worn fixture in your home for years to come."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book stunk to high heaven.Please!

I guess, simply, I hated it. And I like my share of sap. I cry at movies, I bawled at Titanic (all 12 times I saw it). So, believe me, I love a good, sappy story. This book, to echo the sentiments of many others, IS a glorified Harlequin Romance. The only difference is, there's no embarrassing cover to hide when you're reading it. Nicholas Sparks is a god-awful writer, and I think that's my most basic problem with this story. I think it IS a beautiful love story (if a bit far-removed from reality. I mean, you know they had to have some big fights, adjustments to make after marriage, etc.), especially at the end when they've grown old together and he's still with her and in love. But Nicholas Sparks can't write. AT ALL. He uses trite descriptions, banal dialogue and generally overly simplistic language. There are better love stories out there, and better written as well. Go find them. Skip this one."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book has a horrible plot. If you are looking for a book that is cliche, and unorignal, then this is the book for you. The only positive aspect of this book is that it is an easy read."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I'm new to reading. I read The Notebook because of the RAVE reviews.I was disappointed, none the less. Yes, the story is written with AWESOME detailed descriptions, a great poets view of love. However, I had to read through all the descriptions, just to read some dialogue. The story dragged on and on, when I was finished, I was glad to be finished! I was bored and wanted it to be over, and was actually over pleased that it was only a day's read, rather than a weekend's read. Other wise, it would have been a waste of my time.About the plot. I found it odd, that Noah had moved on, after the summer love he had with Allie, he went on to have been intimate with other females, had his own life, but for 15 years, he struggled to let go of his true love. If he REALLY LOVED Allie, he would have fought for her, when he became a young adult. He could have found her before going to war, or leaving his small town. Yet, Allie had been faithful to her love for him. She fell in love with another man, of wealth and satisfaction for her family, but mere contentment for herself. She forced herself to open her heart and mind to her own decisions, and found Noah, her long lost summer love. I thought it was sad that she had done this to her fianc&eacute;. More sad than anything in the story. I didn't like allot of the story layout. It was written in pieces, from the past, and the present. I thought allot of history had been left out. Only focusing on how they rekindled their love, and now as an elder couple in a nursing home. It was unfulfilling for the readers pleasure.Overall, I am giving two stars, only because the story was written with greatness. Nicholas Sparks can write very beautifully. His techniques are simple and easy to read. You won't get confused with his writing, no big words to skip over, for beginner readers, like myself. And because of this, I've picked up a second book of his, A Bend in the Road."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I decided to read another Nicholas Sparks novel since A Walk To Remember was so good. I agree with other reviewers who say this story seems too similar to the Bridges Of Madison County movie with Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood. The premise is good romantic escape, but in the end, the reader is not satisfied.The Notebook is about two people who went out in adolesence, move away to do other things, and then meet in town years later, only to find that the love between them never left. The story could have been great if we knew why they were in love and if we knew the charaters better. I read this on a long car trip, and I'd only read this to cure boredom."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have not voluntarily read a Romance novel since I was ten, and I was rather appalled when I found that's exactly what I had gotten with this book. The writing has the plain nature of an attempted parable, however there was no parable-like point. The characters have, as far as I can tell, no real flaws at all. Not only the main characters (the rugged, deep, yet simple Noah and the beautiful, creative, and privileged Allie) are perfect, but even the antagonists in the piece seem to lack flaws. (Allie's mother keeps Noah's letters from her, but she only did it out of deep belief in what was right, etc.) In all this respect and perfection, there's one *huge* missing element, and that's tension. Even though there's a supposed choice involved in the book, I never felt a moment's doubt about what Allie would do.I am giving it two stars because the section in the nursing home had some genuinely interesting moments, but unfortunately they tended to get lost in the book's Hallmark Cards aesthetic. I just don't have the taste for all the sugar."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was completely dissatified with this purchase as amazon didn't send the correct version of the book. I ordered the book with the characters from the movie on the cover and i was sent and older version that is nothing like what i wanted. I don't give amazon a good review on this one, they didn't get it right at all."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"...this could have been a good book. as it it is: ugh. there's just no personality to it. his writing is so white bread and that sucks any life out of what otherwise could have been a heart twister. there were sparks (no pun intended) of brilliance, but its almost as if it scares him to veer off the straight and narrow and he slams right back into the predictable and banal."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I think everyone can relate to falling in love, facing the loss of someone you love, growing old with that love, and facing death as you watch life. I think everyone who reads this will become a better person, because it explains what it takes to maintain it through the greatest trials that one can face."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"It was a surprise. Wen i first began to read this book, i thought it would be boring. As soon as i got involved with the story, all the magic , love and desire, i couldn't stop.

The worst book I've ever read"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"If I bothered to write a thoughtful review, I would be expending more effort and thought than the book's author. Was this a high school English homework assignment?"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book because it was this month's selection for a literature group that I belong to. It was a simple, quick read, but it left an emotional imprint on my soul. I enjoyed the fact that this story was based on a real couple's life experience. I also liked the idea that it was written by a male, obviously a very sensitive male. The author is in touch with the simple pleasures of life - love of nature, love of a soul mate, love of a family. The southern setting is perfect, and the way the author tied nature into the daily rituals, was wonderful. It was heart wrenching to read the last twenty or so pages. The reality of growing old and the feeling of being so alone in this world, common emotional experiences we will all face, really hit me as I read the final pages. The story forced me to reflect on my own life and the emotional commitments that I have chosen in my lifetime. Overlook the cliches and get beyond the 'Bridges' comparisons, and read the book as a tool for personal reflection and emotional satisfaction."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I couldn't help but notice a couple of the less than positive reviews here. I concede that any of the books they list might be considered more of a literary masterpiece than the Notebook. But this is a sincere and thoughtful story with honest characters. It's a story that could happen to anyone of us (if we're lucky). I can't remember when I read a book so fast (Nicholas Sparks - you short changed my librarian who has come to expect my traditional 10 cent overdue penalty!). All of us can live in a Lon-type relationship - comfortable and safe but void of anything meaningful. The end of the book? That's what most of us only dream of. This story is a reminder of how we get so few chances in life to find that one person who is truly meant for us. It might take a lifetime of searching but when you find that person - let's just say it's why I appreciated this book. I know I WILL look at the pouring rain a little differently from now on. Will you"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Every now and then a story surprises you with a jolt to your heart. \\"The Notebook\\" does this and more. Nicholas Sparks did a wonderful job describing what real love is and what \\"till death do us part\\" really means in a marriage. So many love stories just focus on lust and passion so one can get the impression this is the goal in a relationship. While \\"The Notebook\\" has this, it delves deeper to reveal that love is what is left when the passion eventually fades and the author shows this in the most tender and loving way.This might be the best book you can give your daughter before she starts dating, something that can show love's full range and not just the fantasy so many people attach themselves to."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was told about this book from numerous friends who bragged that they read it in one sitting and then proceeded to ball their eyes out. I, not a big romance reader was intrigued. It is a classic story of Allie and Noah who fell in love when they were young and then were forced to seperate. The love they shared haunted them for years thereafter until they were reunited. The first part of the book is a typical, predictable love story but the second half of the book is well worth waiting for, an incredible illustration of how love grows with years and adversities. I would highly recommend reading the book, be patient and hang in there till the second hundred pages. It really struck a cord because of its realistic circumstances of love. Sparks shows that things don't always happen in a cinematic fashion when you are in love, but that the value of love does not have to be based on aescetic qualities. It will touch you and is not a typical romance. Give it a shot!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The romantic and heart-wrenching story of enduring love is intriguingly brought to life in The Notebook, the best-selling masterpiece written by Nicholas Sparks. Sparks' novel captures the true essence of love as it leads readers on an emotional roller coaster, allowing them to experience life's ups and downs right along with the characters. Once involved in the lives of the novel's main characters, any reader will be challenged to put The Notebook down. Through his use of historiography and methodology; style; and point of view, Sparks has written a classic romance novel that will capture the reader and let him or her escape only when the last page is turned. The author's historiography and methodology contribute to the novel's overall quality. Through two believable and compassionate characters, Noah Calhoun and Allie Nelson, Sparks expresses a major theme of the novel: the power of undying love. Successfully overcoming the most trying of obstacles, such as separation and the grief of a terminal illness, Noah and Allie share a special bond that cannot be broken. Noah and Allie initially meet as teenagers and share a passionate summer together before being separated by Allie's disapproving parents. Noah and Allie are reunited shortly after World War II, and the lapse of fourteen years has not extinguished the fire that burns between them. The two easily fall in love all over again, proving that the undying love shared between true soul mates can withstand all bounds. The story is told mainly through Noah's point of view, but makes apparent exactly what the author values in his own life. Obviously, Sparks believes that true love serves as the greatest gift that anyone can be blessed with. Through the relationship of Noah and Allie, Sparks personifies his true definition of love. He instills within each of his readers the sense that love emerges from a deeper side of human nature and that it means honestly wanting what is best for someone. Sparks' novel will undoubtedly provide a lasting value in the romance genre for the simple fact that it conveys the true meaning of love, forcing its readers to examine their own perceptions of love. Because Sparks bases the novel on the true love story of his wife's grandparents, the reader finds it extremely believable and inspiring. The novel leaves its reader believing in the power of true love and with the hope that miracles really can happen. The style Sparks exercises throughout his novel adds to its charismatic magnitude. Sparks employs simple diction consisting of clear and concise word choices, making the novel accessible to an array of readers. The simplicity of the language mirrors the common and basically uncomplicated lives led by the two main characters. Sparks supplies the novel with vivid descriptions depicting beautiful scenery, especially that of the areas surrounding Noah's ranch. The author illustrates such scenes with intense clarity, allowing the reader to almost picture Noah and Allie taking a stroll around the picturesque property. Most of the story is told through flashbacks and reminiscence as an old man reads the poignant love story to a woman in a nursing home. In addition, some of the major plot developments are revealed through letters between the main characters. Sparks' utilization of various methods to relay the his story keeps the reader interested while it proves his accomplishment as a successful story teller. Sparks' implementation of point of view in connection with the characterization of Noah Calhoun seems to be the novel's greatest strength. Because the majority of the novel is conveyed through Noah's point of view, the reader can completely identify with his character. Every thought Noah has regarding his beloved Allie helps reveal to the reader the extent of his tenderness, compassion, and giving human nature. Because the reader knows exactly what Noah thinks and feels, he or she cannot help but empathize with Noah and experience with him joy, loneliness, grief, and triumph. In his novel The Notebook, Nicholas Sparks has captured a love story with everlasting effects. It teaches that with patience and hope, love can endure through even the most strenuous of situations. In Noah and Allie, Sparks has created two characters who epitomize the meaning of true love and who inspire readers to love as well."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I had never read anything by Nicholas Sparks but was intrigued by a preview for the movie version of &quot;The Notebook.&quot; I eagerly read and read, hoping for some semblance of characterization and some sort of plot beyond the tired cliche of (1) Summer of Love, (2) Circumstances Intervene, and (3) True Love Prevails. In better hands, the cliche can be mindless, innocuous fluff - beach reading. In these, it left me worried for the dumbing down of my own language skills. I don't know that I've ever read writing more hokey, and I am including Hallmark cards in that group. This book offers *nothing* - the plot is color-by-numbers, the characters undeveloped and unclear (who are these people? and why do they talk like the diaries of 12-year-old girls?), and it doesn't even provide you with the standard &quot;colorful Southern characters&quot; that could have made this lifeless journey at least a little more entertaining.I do think there could have been more to this story in different hands, especially the treatment of the current day storyline about a relationship dealing with Alzheimer's. However, &quot;The Notebook&quot; took a situation that could have added real depth and nuance to the characters and instead, ended it pat, simple, and trite. If I could, I would return this book for a refund, but then that would mean that someone else could buy it. Better to throw it out and hope it goes out of print."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I very much enjoyed the movie of \\"The Notebook\\" - although it isn't great cinema it was a sweet and endearing movie, though the true heart of the movie was due more to the stellar acting of Gena Rowlands and James Garner. I therefore decided to read the book.What a waste of my time. Hands down the worst book I've ever read. And I read. A lot. But this was painfully bad. I was somewhat ashamed that I had bothered to read it. It is one of the few books I've ever thrown away in my life.Nicholas Sparks is a Hallmark card writer. He writes with the characterization skills of a drunk monkey. His plotting is plodding and choppy.Please, please save your money. Read Hemingway. Read McMurtry. Read Chabon or Hornby. Heck, read Danielle Steel if you must read utter trash, but do not waste your precious brain cells on Nicolas Sparks.It is sad to think of the money this cheesemonger has made while Michael Chabon, a Pulitzer Prize winning author is considered unknown by the simpering females who swallow Sparks' tripe and beg for more. That is sad, scary and terribly unjust."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have just finished reading The Notebook and the reviews posted on this site. Generally books do not greatly move me emotionally, but this one did. It is important to note that the characters and story are based on the lives of factual characters of that era. Having lived in that era, I know it is not as overly simplistic as some reviewers have stated. It really was a simpler time, even emotionally. I would say to the very negative reviewer: No undue focus was placed on the aging process; it is more likely that that is where your major focus was and, as a result, you resented the reality brought to those facts of aging.I found the book to be the best I have read in a very long time and to be true to the era about which it was written. It reminded me very much of my own parents' story. During World War II, it was not uncommon for people to be separated for years, particularly if the individuals lived in a country that was occupied during the war. It was not uncommon for the man of the house to go to another country for years just to support his family. We just don't know today all the elements that KEPT other aspects of that era a simpler time, particularly emotionally."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I admit to a reluctance to reading novels that are as popular with the general public as The Notebook has been, trying most often to remain off the beaten path. I was drawn toward the promise of a \\"heartwarming romance\\" however and decided to give this book a fair try. It was abysmally disappointing,in writing skill, style and in plot. I was promised from the book's self-professed success a tear-jerker that would touch my heart. What I got was a night of turning pages, waiting for something spectacular to happen that would change my mind about this story and Nicholas Sparks as a writer. As I turned the pages, those that remained became fewer and more obviously not enough to make a good story. The promised triumphal ending never came. I did not cry, but threw the book on my office floor and finally crawled into bed. Reading The Notebook, however, was not a waste of my time: it was a lesson. If upon opening a book you see that the author has completed at least two former novels that have been turned into motion pictures that failed miserably at the box office with good reason, put the book down and walk away.Many are devoted fans of The Notebook, and my review will not change this. I write now only for those of you who, like me, are considering reading the famous bestseller because it has become almost too popular to ignore. I implore you to have the taste and strength of spirit to find yourself a far better novel and lose yourself in its pages."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I am a devoted reader with an open mind. I know how hard it is to write and I would never attack a book or a writer just because I didn't like reading the book. But this is really, really something else. The characters in this book are so phoney, so flat and so unreal they sometimes made me laugh; at other times they made me want to throw up. The storyline just seems to be made of sticky sweet syrup; reading the book virtually gave me a toothache. I can't help pitying those poor trees that were felled to produce the paper on which this book was printed. My advice is: buy and read ANY book but this one: for I am sure ANY book will be better written and will give you more insight into human nature than this one."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"... otherwise, I would have been mad at myself for reading such drivel.I admit that the premise of this book is touching and heartfelt, but the execution of it fails miserably. I hope that Sparks's writing gets better through time, but I certainly won't be the one to waste my precious reading moments giving him another chance.This is a story about two overly sentimental horny teenagers who are separated by fate and class but who meet up later, I guess proving that love conquers all. In the twilight of their years, the man looks back on their beginnings while reading to his ailing wife.Unfortunately for Sparks, he doesn't realize that actual humans have problems and arguments and issues beyond the realms of make-believe romance. This novel reads like a movie without a conflict. There is not a single amount of wisdom in its tiresome pages to make up for its maudlin mix of poor prose and boring characters.Even worse were the inane, insipid conversations that this couple had while professing their love for each other. Sparks bowls over what could have been actual conversations by writing transitions that say: &quot;Then he told her about his time in the war.&quot;After plowing through all the remember whens, I am left having spent an otherwise pleasant afternoon at the beach wondering who actually thinks this is romance."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The notebook is a romantic novel that will fulfill a woman's dreams, if her idea of the perfect guy is someone poetic, devoted, empathetic, and passionate. Noah, the main character, and narrator of a fraction of the story, is hardworking, considerate, and sensitive to a woman's desires and feelings. Even though Noah and his wife were young at heart when they met, they grow to be mature adults in two separate parts of the world. Mutual contact is not made over any of those years of separation, but one day the flame of young love burns down their paths again and severs their lives forever. Nicholas Sparks, the author of the Notebook, gives the reader a false sense of hope; that a guy as wonderful as Noah actually exists. At times I found myself wanting to meet Noah, and just talk to him. When I finished The Notebook and dried my tears, I wished I had not read it, just so I could read it again for the first time."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook was Nicholas Sparks debut novel. It remains my favorite novel of 6 books Sparks has written to date.The Notebook is a story of everlasting love and true love. It gives us all hope that love exists in this world.

He has a book tucked under his arm and is going to see his wife in hopes today will be the day she remembers their story.This book is a must read for all those hopeless romantics out there. If you enjoy Sparks and haven't read The Notebook, you must pick it up."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is definitely \\"romance\\" from a man's point of view. The hero, Noah, is \\"romantic\\" because he reads poetry, takes his girl canoeing on the river, and fixes dinner. But that's all window dressing. The bottom line is sex. They're great together. And Allie is the perfect heroine from a man's point of view. She has a great body. She thinks he's sexy. She hasn't gone to bed with anyone else in the last fourteen years, because he was so great. Yep, this is true love, from a guy's point of view.

The story was very sappy, and the writing was uninspired. It did have one redeeming feature, however, and that was the description of how Noah copes with his wife's dementia. I don't know if this approach really works with Alzheimer's patients, but it seemed reasonable to me."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook, a \\"tragic\\" love story by Nicholas Sparks may tug at the heartstrings of some, but I frankly believe it left much to be desired. The tale begins at a nursing home, where readers are introduced to elderly, rheumy-fingered Noah who reads aloud a story from his \\"notebook,\\" to another occupant of the hospital, a girl he cares deeply for... (it can be gathered that he does this quite often) As the story unfolds, it is clear that the notebook is more of a diary than anything, giving insight into Noah's background and flashbacks to life as a younger man, most notably his relationship with Allie, and the sentiments that followed her absence. Shortly after, the novel flips perspectives to Allie, as she decides to pay a spur of the moment visit to Noah, her first real (not to mention \\"forbidden\\") love, hoping it will give her more confidence that she is making the right decision in marrying her fiance Lon, the wedding of which will take place in a matter of days. However, seeing Noah brings back many unresolved feelings, and the two quickly realize that they are falling for each other all over again. Things become even more suspenseful when Lon catches on... Will Allie stay true to her heart or remain faithful to the man she is engaged to marry? C'mon it's Nicholas Sparks, you tell me.The Notebook deserves three stars because honestly, I expected more. It was the most contrived piece of literature I've ever laid eyes upon and as idealistic as can bee, but it possessed this strange addictive quality that sucked you in regardless of your intentions. The fairytale vibe was reminiscent of Taylor Swift, and I can definitely see the appeal it has for the people who half-believe this could actually happen, but man could it get anymore sugar-coated? Depsite all of this, the uncanny desire to keep you reading in addition to my curiosity behind all of the hype is really what made The Notebook worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Excellent book, couldn't put it down!

I fell in love with Noah from the start, I could imagine sitting on his porch and smell the musky scent of his skin. I can only dream of a love like they shared and this book described the perfect storybook romance. When the story ended, I was sad to leave my new friends, but glad they had made the right decisions and followed their hearts."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Sparks is an incredibly writer who draws you into the story with simple emotions. This book has you holding onto treasured ones of the past without giving up the hope of the future with them. Further, it shows the value of true love now and forever. The best part is that while writing of the great times, Sparks brings the reality that life isn't always simple, that you must endure hardships as a part of life. He makes you appreciate what you have and value it forever. I have given this to all my friends and even those who don't read as a hobby have fallen in love with this book!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I consider this the best of his three books thus far. I read it after Message in a Bottle and found it much better. I became emotionally attached with the story and the characters (a sign of a really great book), much more so that in his other books. This is a very touching story of love, really heartwarming."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"First of all let me say that I think everyone should read &quot;The Notebook.&quot; It was a wonderful feel good book. I think Nicholas Sparks really brought the main characters (Allison and Noah) to life. This was a light hearted, warm, touching read. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It made me believe in happy endings. It took me a total of 2 days to read this book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks is a wonderful writer. This being his first book, he shows signs of a great mind and beautiful passion.... that only grows in his next two novels. The precious story in The Notebook displays the unconditional love that is still possible in this world of ours. This book is one of the best books I've ever read and will continue to be a favorite of mine throughout my life."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book is one of the most touching and romantic books I have ever read. I was sitting in my class at school with tears streaming down my face as I was reading the end of the book. I would certainly recommend this book to any teenage girl who loves romance!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A story simple as breathe, wonderful as a sunset and eternal as the ocean. A story that tell us the things wich are really important and worth shearching and fighting for."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is my all time favorite book, and after reading Nicholas Sparks' other two books, also my favorite author! Everyone should read this book---men and women. This kind of love does exist---I know. If you haven't read it, please do so. It will warm your heart, and make you smile."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I recently purchased this book and the day that it came, I began the journey that this novel takes you on. A day later, I was in tears with a closed book on my lap. The Notebook is the most heartwrenching and touching story I have ever read and positively the best book that I will ever own. Nothing has ever compared to this wonderfully timeless piece... I fell in love after a few pages. Definitely recommended for anyone seeking a touching love story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A heartwarming story guaranteed to tug at heartstrings. I believe that true love is a decision and not just pure emotion as it lasts through periods when the embers of romance and passion has burned out. Still, it is touching to see a couple's love and romance not only surviving but thriving after so many years. Truly gives a new dimension to the subject of love. It makes me truly wonder in the power of love to change impossible situations. 4 stars for the story, 5 hankies."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was wonderful. A joy to read. From the moment I picked up the book I was unable to put it down. You'll fall in love with this book.For another great book find Secret Waters by Linda C. Brown. You can find it here on Amazon. They're both great books. Get them both!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is by far the best book I have ever read. But be forewarned, if you don't have a lot of time and a full box of tissues, don't start because once you do, you won't stop. This book was so wonderful. To be loved like Allie was would be absolutely wonderful. It is a rare thing today to see the older generation so in love with each other that you can almost believe anything is possible, even beating a terrible illness. I wish that my husband and I are still in love like Noah and Allie after we have been married for 50 years. With so much out there to read, it was such a pleasure to read something that is so &quot;real life&quot; and truly wonderful. I cried all the way through the book. So have plenty of tissues on hand.

The book takes you immediately into the character's lives, in a charming plot that brings the lovers together-- taking you through their journey. The book is pure entertainment, and it will leave you with a glow of hope--a hope that ensures love does exist and draws people together. It is a heart-warming book that leaves the reader smiling from the soul outward."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"ive read a few of the more recent reviews and was surprised to discover that it was possible for someone *not* to enjoy this book. i do read for entertainment value, and when im reading a &quot;romance&quot; im also looking for it to be realistic. this story has both. i dont believe these two to be perfect. in fact, it is because allie is not perfect, that the whole story is able to take place. i loved how it was told; in the memory of an old man...sitting, reading to his one and only...hoping to catch just a glimmer of recongnition in her eye...this is fantastic stuff! ::smile"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A story of how true love is, I have reflected after reading this and relate it to the beautiful marriage and relationship my vary own parents have shared over their six decades together. This is how true love is...enduring all, deep and constant never fading. I would indeed recommend this."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Is this a literary masterpiece? No. It's popular fiction. But it has heart, and although small it was able to elicit more than a few tears from me. The funny thing is this, I cried harder the second time I read it. It's sappy, sentamental and not that complicated but it's lovely all the same. I look at this book with a kind of fondness that grows each year I reread it. It's just, simply, a sweet story and sometimes that's all one needs. I'm not a big fan of sappy books, but this is one I love and recommend to anyoone."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is such a beautiful book. Some people are way too critical. I could read this book over and over and it always has the same effect on me. It's a simple book that is easy to understand and warms your heart. This book really draws you in to Noah and Allie's story. It's not a book for someone who wants a complex read that's for sure but that doesn't make it a bad book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Just had to read it again after seeing the movie over the holiday.

The romance was just... ugh. I don't even know how to describe it. There was nothing new and intriguing about this story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I can see why this was on the NY Bestseller list for as long as it was. It's beautifully written for Sparks' first book, and is one of my favorites. It's terribly sad though, so keep a box of tissues handy. I would say if you're a fan of Sparks and haven't read this one yet, it is definitely worth your time."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"&quot;The Notebook vividly paints a true picture of love.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is the most powerful love story I have ever read. From the moment I picked it up I could't put it down until I was finished. I ended up finishing it at 1:00 in the morning, I told all of my friends about it, they read it, and loved it. I will never forget this book and the emotion of the life like characters. It has beed 2 years since I read this book and I can't forget about it. I met the author and had him autograph it for me."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book after reading the author's other romance 'A Walk to Remember', and I was a tad disappointed.First, let me tell you that I am a 24-year-old male, not your typical romance reader. Yet, I always like a romance that pulls hard at my heart strings, but 'The Notebook' just didn't do it for me.Don't get me wrong. The story is beautiful, the telling even more so. I would give an arm and a leg to be in love the way Noah and Allison were. I love poetry, and it was my very first true love who introduced me to that beautiful world of words. Then I had to be away from her, in a different country, in a different continent, for a long time. And I did try to go back and find her, and I did succeed. The relit flame, though, was soon put out by a cruel wind. So, yes, the story does appeal to me very deeply.Yet, there's something missing. I didn't cry much. But worst of all, the ending was a major let down. I don't want to spoil it for you by telling you what the ending is, but I can tell you that it is quite disappointing. It really does spoil the mood.Overall, the book is a good read if you are in the mood for an old fashioned tale of love, parting, re-union, agony and bliss. If the ending was different, I would have given it 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This has got to be one of the best books I have ever read. I can see Paul Newman and his wife doing this as a movie. I read it in one sitting and then gave it to my mom. I have hope this story could really happen and it will really warm your heart."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was an absolutely beautiful story that shows that love can and will transcend all time.....separated for years these two young lovers rediscover each other right before it is too late. Then the \\"notebook\\" documents their special love and I defy anyone to read the last two chapters without weeping!!! A tragedy??? No, indeed not......a REAL love story....everlasting.....unexplainable.........unequaled."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have just finished the book, The Notebook, by the author, Nicholas Sparks. The Notebook is a book about Noah's life and the love of his life that he lost in his teen years. This book was, for the most part, enjoyable. I liked how there was some type of mystery, like who Allie chooses in the end, Noah, her first love or Lon, her fianc&eacute;. I like the fact that you don't know exactly if Noah and Allie stay together. I like the way the author describes Allie's emotions, especially in the passage on page 85, \\"She hadn't slept well, waking after every dream, and she remembered seeing the hands of the clock in different positions during the night, as if verifying the passage of time.\\" The part of the book which I don't like is at the end. It talks a lot about when they are older and about to die. It is really depressing. \\"We do not foresee the future, but then who can? I do not live now as I expected to. And what did I expect? ... I thought that perhaps I would start a hobby, what I did not know, but possibly shipbuilding. In bottles. Small, detailed, impossible to consider now with my hands. But I am not bitter.\\"To me, the theme was about if you love someone so much that you can barely survive without them, then, no matter how much you fight it your will end up with them. For the most part, I agree with it, but I don't believe that life is always going to have a happy ending like The Notebook does. I have never had a tragic love affair, like Allie and Noah, so the book doesn't really relate to my life at all.I would recommend this book, but mostly to girls or people who like love stories. The Notebook can be, at times depressing, but, all in all, it's a good book.327"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"It's hard for me to pick up a Nicholas Sparks book and put it back down. The stories are so sweet, but just so normal. The characters are always multi-faceted women and men who are looking for that person to complete them.The love that Noah and Allie share in this novel is the kind of love we all want. They are two people who fall in love and let their hearts arrange what their minds cannot. I'm now on to my next Sparks novel. They always warm my heart."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this story and I couldn't put it down. I love this book, I cried at the end. Though when Nicholas sparks switched to the hospital sence I got a little mixed up thinking the story had ended. But other than that I would recommend this book to anyone who is a true romantic at heart. It's very touching and heart felt."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The book actually deserves more than 5 stars, I associate it with all the stars in the sky, both those we see and do not see. The Notebook enriched my world and showed me that beauty is endless. The story is not at all perfect and still is the perfect for me...Not the story itself is of the greatest importance but the way it leaves you after you have been in the world of it. The Notebook is not a book for some special taste of books, it's for everyone...."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I like Nicholas Sparks. He is unpretentious, yet is amaster when it comes to manipulating the emotional stateof the reader. It is very refreshing to find a book whichlets the reader wander through a time of innocence andindulge in the longings for true love.

Allie's parents didn't think Noah was good enough for their daughter and after that summer made sure that Allie never received any of Noah's correspondence.Noah, thinking Allie had went on with her life and forgot about him after that summer, left New Bern in hopes of forgetting Allie and the summer they spent together. He return to New Bern after World War II only to realize he would never forget his first love and had only the memories to sustain him.Upon returning to New Bern, Noah buys and restores the old plantation-style house he and Allie had dreamed would be theirs one day, never thinking that it would be a newspaper article about the house that would bring them back together.Sparks talent for weaving the past with the present is intrigal to the telling of this story and he pulls it off with a style and flair all his own. This isn't just another tale of two lovers it is the story of two lives made whole by love gone right."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book is a good read for all romance lovers out there. All who read this book will be renewed with knowing there really is such a thing called &quot;true love&quot;."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is a book that really gets to ya. I thought, because of the title, it would be something about school or something dull. My friend recommended this book to me and when I read the first chapter I didn't really think that I would like it. The I kept reading and reading and I was very surprised by everything that had happened. It's fun to picture the events happening and what you think that the characters look like and all.I think that the end is the best part in the book. I won't say what happens of course but I highly reccomend that you read it to find out! Hey, it almost makes ya believe that there is true love! Make sure to get those tissues!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is my all time favorite book. In fact, it's probably the only book I've read more than once. About once a year I find myself re-reading excepts from this book, just to remind myself that true love can exist. The was the first Nicholas Sparks book I read, and since then I've gone on to read every single book he's written. While all of his books are entertaining, quick reads, the Notebook truly shines. Reward yourself by spending a day curled up with this book. You won't regret it. Just have tissues nearby!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The title of this book might throw you off. It could have been more eye catching if it was thought upon more. The same with the first chapter. When I first began reading, I regretted choosing it to read. BUT once you get into the second chapter you'll be hooked. Sparks makes the reader believe in true love.At times it might make you a bit sappy and all mushy inside but its an enjoyable book to read if you like romance.Now, the down side. Sparks should have finished the book sooner. The end just seemed to drag on and on. I thought it would never end. The book took me five days to read. I read most of the book in two days, and the last two chapters in three days. I didn't even want to finish reading but I had to for an assignment. I figured out the ending on my own, so it wasn't really a mystery. There was no point of going on.Overall, I would read another book similar to this one. It was very touching and heart warming."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"\`The Notebook' is apparently a worthwhile read for those that enjoy simple love stories, but for the rest of us it possesses not a single redeeming feature to warrant tolerating its plodding and boring storyline."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is a good example of how a good writer can breathe life into an overused story line and capture the hearts of millions in the process. \\"The Notebook\\" is the quintessential love story. The novel centers on the love shared between its primary characters Noah and Allie. The two fall in love after meeting during summer vacation. It's the 1930's. They are teenagers. Noah, a strong quiet local boy from New Bern, reads Allie poetry and shares sunrises with her. Allie, a beautiful wealthy southern aristocrat has a gift for painting and is able to capture on canvas the love that is shared between them (I'm trying not to puke now). Allie's parents do not approve of the courtship so when summer vacation is over, so is the love between Allie and Noah . . . or so you think? Needless to say, after may years of separation - Noah going to war, Allie going to college - the two meet again and discover that their love has never faded. The only problem is that Allie is engage to be married in a few weeks.What separates this novel from the heap of lesser works put forth with the same story line is Spark's writing style. The language is simple, allowing for a speedy read although at times the simplicity under serves the story. On more than one occasion I wanted more descriptive language, especially since the characters were so artistic. The first person account of the story by Noah provides an element of intimacy that kept me reading when I wanted to toss the book. Overall, \\"The Notebook\\" is a good read. It may be an even better movie."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Fantastic account of that never-ending first love that stays with us all forever. The Notebook has a romantic setting, with genuine characters, that are inspired by the real-life love story of the grandparents of the author's wife. It will make your heart swell with happiness, and your eyes fill with tears. Everyone needs a little bit of Noah and Allie in their lives."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A cousin gave this book to my dad, a 78 year old, who cares for my mother with alzheimers disease. After he cried through the end, he remembered the long and loving relationship he had for 50 years with my mom. It makes it a little easier for him to cope. Anyone caring for a family member who has this horrible disease, should read this book. I'm online to order it for more of my family members."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I am not a reader of romance novels, but this book is by far the most romantic book I've ever read without being sappy. Nicholas Sparks has an incredible way of getting the reader inside of the characters. It is the kind of book you can read a million times and it will feel like the first time."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"There is nothing I can say to give this book the credit it deserves...I read it in 7 hours, I could not wait to read the next page and it broke my heart in a way that I cannot describe.

Overall, it is a good book but definitely not exceptional. For a debut novel, Sparks writes with sheer simplicity -- simple language, simple plot. Sparks' knack for writing love letters is the only saving grace for his work. The final chapter almost moved me to tears, but not quite. It lacked the emotional intensity of &quot;The Bridges in Madison County.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was given this book while in summer canoe camp last July in Widjiwagan (Minnesota). Girls of my group said it was great, but I didn't really trusted them until I started reading. It is a moving story written by a very gifted storyteller. One feels like reading a poem all along... The characters are very deep and authentic and one is completely involved in their story. A feeling of happiness grows until the end. I warmly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Most romantic books do not appeal to men in general. I wouldn't have picked up this book had it not been for a friend who suggested it. Soon did I realize what a gem this little book was. I never considered myself a &quot;book reader&quot;, but once I got through a couple chapters, it was really hard to put down. I read it every chance I got -- bathroon, bedroom, evening (with the TV off). I couldn't believe how absorbed I was into this book. Sparks creates wonderful magic about that thing we call love. Highly recommended for anyone who has ever experienced love, or THOUGHT they did. Even guys will enjoy this one."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Most romantic books do not appeal to men in general.

The love shared in this book was a little unreal, but that's what makes it so good. The real world is filled with such bitterness and cruelty; I thoroughly enjoyed a love story so perfect that it couldn't possibly be true. Believable or not, this book made me feel something good. More than I can say for the news."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I loved the characters, the story line, and the outcome. This story is for anyone who had that special love and lost them. We all want that someone to come back to us. Noah was the lucky one. The devotion to Alle is heroic. I would want my mate to do the same. Noah and Alle are two strong, but yet, lovestruck characters. I love both qualities. I would recommend a few tissues while reading. The ending is worth waiting hoping for."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I met Nicholas Sparks once and was intrigued by his sense of humor. So I decided to give his book a try. I am usually an action-adventure with a twist of sci-fi reader. This was more a book of mushy stuff. It is romantic and if you enjoy romance it is a nice short novel. However everyone of the characters seem to be awfully perfect in the book. Even the supposed villians in the end are nice. More like a Disney love story. It is a good summer read if you are looking for a short romance novel."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is true love without boundries, and dedication to one another. one of the best books i have ever read, my emotions went along with every word nicholas sparks wrote on those pages. this is a true love story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"As a lot of novels tend to be, this one is better than the movie! Though I saw the movie first, I still was able to vividly picture the story in my head and it was even better than the movie."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I had never heard of this book and just grabbed the audio book from the library. I am not a big fan of romance novels and I don't think I ever would have sat down and spent time reading this.However I drive a lot and the audio book helped me to pass many miles very quickly. I add that the actor, Barry Bostwick, who read the book did an amazing job. I think the reader can add or detract a lot to an audio book. Bostwick's voice grabbed me immediately. He became the fine young man, Noah Calhoun, who relates this story. I was immediately drawn into the story. At the most poignant moments, which would be easy to spoil, Bostwick did a superb job.To give the bare facts of the plot, as the Amazon reviewer has done is to miss the value of this novel. It's like saying of life, \\"You're born, you do stuff and then you die.\\" It's how the doing stuff is described here that grabs your heart, if you have one to grab.It's easy to discount this work but the author has obviously managed to do something to touch so many people so deeply. Bring kleenex and enjoy a story of what may be the kind of love we all long for.The only thing I disliked on the audio book was the interview with the author at the end. Actually the first part, in which he discussed the writing of the book was very good. But then we are subject to a self-portrait of the author that brought the whole listening experience down to something terribly banal. Do yourself a favor and shut the CD off before that, so that the wonderful magic of the novel can linger."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I started reading this book at bedtime and found myself closing the cover well into the wee hours of the morning, unable to put it down. The story of Noah and Allie is a testament to love. Spanning a decades long relationship, The Notebook is about a love affair which has stood the test of time and is as deeply seated in love at the end of this couple's journey as it was in the beginning. As Alzheimer's exacts its toll on Allie's mind, wiping away the memories of love and family and joy, she is left with the story of her love affair with Noah, as described in his notebook. Through the story's telling by Noah, as he reads the notebook to Allie, we learn of the stormy beginning and the relationship that almost wasn't. We feel the passion and fire of first love and the trials and tribulations they endure when it comes to an end. But though having spent years apart, neither are able to forget the other and when good fortune tosses these two back together, the chemistry between these characters is as alive and vibrant as in the beginning.Allie and Noah's love endures and they live their happily ever after. But the true gift of this story is that the reader gets to move beyond the fairytale end experience the peaks and valleys of \\"ever after\\". Heart-wrenching and hopeful, this book has earned a permanent place on my bookshelf. Sparks clearly is a wonderful storyteller with a tremendous grasp on the complex nature of love and human nature."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is one of those books I read over and over, from the very first page, the very first line I am still moved beyond anything I've ever known. It is very possibly the best book I've ever read. To know a love like this, ever how brief cannot be described by mere mortals in our feeble words, but Nicholas Sparks does so beautifully."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I absolutely LOVE this movie and this book. I cry every time no matter how many times I watch or read. Nicholas Sparks never disappoints me. He writes with so much love and feeling it is almost as if he has lived every story he writes.

This was a powerful and a moving novel, and I'm glad I read it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Love this short novel. Read it in an afternoon, all in one sitting. So touching and romantic.

I have found a hidden treasure!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook was by far one of the best books i've ever curled up to.

If you had ever said, &quot;i will love you forever&quot; and you really meant it.... then this book is for you. It will make you laugh, cry, and look at your loved ones with even more love...."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is a good book on the themes of lost love---and wasted loves. It reminded me of Silent Bell, the new book by Gary Drake, in the way it dealt with letting the obvious love of our life get away, and then wonder years later. I recomend this. I recommend both Sparks and Drake!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A beautifully written story of love, truth and beauty. This short love story grabbed my heartstrings on the first page and continued pulling until the last chapter ... where I could barely read through my sobs and tears. A must-read for anyone with a sensitive heart."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is what a friend told me after I recommended this book to her. Although I read the book in two evenings, I felt so connected to Noah &amp; Allie, that I continued to feel their joys and sorrows for days. This is how love should be. Unforgettable."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I fell in love with this book. I couldn't put it down. The story was told with great charm and gave me a feeling of the old days when not so much was enough. When marriages lasted through good times and bad. Somewhere along the way we have lost that. I feel sad to think that children of today will more than likely miss this, I'm so glad I haven't."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I couldn't put this book down.. It really touched my heart. It gives you hope for true love."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I loved this book. I could just picture what I was reading in my mind. It was one of those books that once you start reading it you just can't stop. I have loaned it out to friends and they all loved it. My sister-in-law bought the audio book and she had to wear her sun glasses when she was listening to it in the car, people driving by her thought something was wrong because in places she cried so hard."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I just recently read &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot; and this was just as well written. I was actually crying while reading the book on the train on the way to work. I just recently got married and was amazed to feel that the love these two people shared keep the torch lit for so long. It is a great feeling to have someone love you that much and just reminded me how much I love my husband."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks is obviously a good writer which is why he has sold so many books. But I expected this book to be better considering how good his other books are. I have read the Last Song and Walk to Remember which both were at least three times as good as this. I think it is because this was one of the first books he ever wrote. Don't get me wrong it wasn't bad but I wouldn't reccomend this book for those who have never read Nicholas Sparks books. His other books are much better."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have seen this movie many times already but still loved the book. It is still a great love story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was ok. I had high expectations for the novel as I'd heard so many positive reviews. It seemed underdeveloped with the characters lacking great depth. Noah was better developed than Allie and I did have a bit of a soft spot for the guy, but I was still underwhelmed. And the last chapter was just plain depressing. Hasn't this guy had enough heartache? I don't think this author is for me."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"In love with the love these characters share... the story is beautiful and takes you to a different world and time"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was a good read. the story line was captivating and showed a range of emotional states expressed by the main characters."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"great book and fast delivery . i would recommend this product for people to read. love to read his books :)"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Such a beautiful love story!

If you have a significant other, you must read this book. The characters are so vivid. I cried constantly at the tenderness at the swirl of emotions that the book evokes. This is my NUMBER ONE book of all time. I love the back cover when it talks about being simple and living a simple life. No matter who you are you can make a difference by loving another person completely. My catchline is true. I used to pay friends $5 to read the book becasue I think it's subject is so important.

I have recently moved from Dallas to North Carolina where this story took place. He described everything about this state perfectly.I myself fell in love with Noah Calhoun. I have never identified with a character in a book like I did with Allie. Allie faced choices that almost anyone can identify with. This book tugged at my heart, made me weep, and taught me that you always have a choice and no one but yourself can draw out your life for you."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I myself fell in love with Noah Calhoun, and I have never been able to identify with any character like I did with Allie.

Who liked it that much? I read it because it was recommended to me by a friend, but I hated it. I couldn't wait for it to be done. The writing was horrible.

It is a wonderful tale of life and love that made me laugh and cry. I have been watching my mother in law deal with the &quot;loss&quot; of her mother due to Alzheimers. I thought twice about passing it along to her, but fianlly did. Although we may be missing a piece of a lovely lady bit by bit, this story gave us some hope. There may be a way to beat this disease. It may not be a medical cure, but this book finds a way past the termoil.

Some may call &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; and &quot;The Notebook&quot; a little on the &quot;sentimental sappy side&quot; but the message contained in both these books is unforgettable. Sparks has a writing style which is unbelievably pure and refreshing. He has that rare ability of making the reader feel raw emotion, as if the reader where actually a part of the story.It is often said, we find only one true love in our lifetime and when that happens, it lasts for all eternity. In this novel, the youthful love of Noah and Allie outstands the test of time. Though the couple go their separate ways, they are reunited in later years but only after Allie becomes engaged to a successful lawyer by the name of Lon. With sparks of love still flaring, Allie listens to her head, rather than her heart and returns to Lon. Their time together is brief and she finally tells Lon of her feelings for Noah. Lon, with heavy heart, accepts her decision to return to Noah. Noah and Allie marry and spend 49 beautiful years together before tragedy strikes. Growing old and with failing health, Noah and Allie must both come to terms with life-threatening illnesses.This is a story of amazing love and the power love has to overcome all obstacles. &quot;The Notebook&quot; is based on the story of Nicholas Sparks' wife's parents. The book will bring tears to your eyes, and warmth to your heart as this incredible story proves that the power of love, and fate, can truly conquer all life's trials and tribulations."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I thought that the book was excelent! It was the type of book you couldn't put down once you got into it. This book is so much like real life and not made up/fanticy life. It was very interesting, and I was always in suspence. It is a great book and would recomend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"It's been a while since I was deeply touched and drawn into a story, that is until I read &quot;The Notebook&quot;. I can only hope that I can find a love as true as Noah and Allie had for each other in my own lifetime. Sparks writing is amazing and I look forward to his next work! Bravo!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I loved this little book. The tone is bittersweet, but ultimately, joy prevails. If you want to understand the pain of growing old or becoming ill, this book can tell you a lot and bring tears to your eyes as well. An unforgettable little gem."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"If you have trouble understanding the pain of dealing with alzheimers, read this book. If you want to read a great love story, read this book. If you want to read a great book, period, read this book. It is an emotional rollercoaster that allows you to understand so much more that it is both enlightening, and terribly upsetting, in a positive way if possible."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is a beautiful story about how timeless, ageless and wonderful love is (if only it was that true). The book made me cry because I wanted to believe that something so wonderful could actually exist between two people. I found it a little to much though. Allie returns after 14 years and Noah just opens his heart and his arms to her, I know he loves her but its a little too unrealistic. I also wish the book concentrated more on their time together once they reunited. I would recommend this book it's very touching and will grab hold of you emotions. Keep a box of kleenex handy cause you will need them."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"If you love romance, you will love this book! It just takes you into the pages and you become part of it all. Keep some tissues near by, you will shed tears! Definitely five stars!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"If you feel the need for a good cry, read tales of true human drama in the newspaper. If you want a good book, look elsewhere. This &quot;novel&quot; is embarrassingly thin, superficial, and poorly written. Mr. Sparks shows so liitle insight and use of descriptive language, it is a wonder that he could drag this sad story on for 195-odd pages. Many children's books tell simple stories with pure simple words and are things of literary beauty. Mr. Sparks would do well to study them if he aspires to a short, simple tale of any substance or worth."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I love great stories, but this is not one of them. I am sorry I wasted a few hours, but at least I didn't spend a dime on it. This is a &quot;Bridges....&quot; wanna be but clearly isn't. Just too too mushy for words with no real substance. It may be awhile before I try another of his novels. Too many other great ones out there!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Aw, this book was such a fairytale. It was not only a beautiful love story of two soul-mates, it was inspirational! Just reading this book, really taught me that TRUE love will never die. It withstands anything.The two main characters met over the summer. They fell in love hard & fast. The love that they had for ONE summer-- never withered. They spent years & years apart. Finally when they met again, they found themselves different people with different stories but the same intense connection.Their love leaps off the page & into your heart.Beautiful book.I don't reccommend this to just anyone! It's definetely for girls. In other words, it's a tear-jerker.

They spend the whole summer together becoming really attached to each other. At the end of the summer Ally has to move. They say their goodbyes hoping to see each other again. Noah is drafted in the war. He writes many letters to Ally trying to communicate with her and find out where she moved to but none were returned. Then Ally shows up at Noah's house after fourteen years and he didn't know what to think, especially when she informs him that she is engaged. They both find the love they had for each other fourteen years ago was still strong. Ally is then forced to choose between her fianc&eacute; and her first true love when her fianc&eacute; tracks her down and finds her at Noah's. This is a book that is not easy to put down when you get started. It shows how strongly people hold on to the memories of their first true love. I would recommend this book to all ages that enjoy romance novels. I would definitely give this book five stars."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"If you like Romances then you should read the book The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks. Nicholas Sparks has written a lot of great love stories. I have read most of his books but The Notebook has to my favorite.The main characters in this book are Allie and Noah. Allie was rich and had high expectations, she had everyday planed out, and she was organized and almost perfect. Noah was carefree and fun to be around. He didn't have a lot of money and he was far from perfect. One summer Allie and Noah met. Noah fell in love with Allie at the first glance. He knew he wanted to spend his whole life with her. On the other hand Allie didn't seem so fond about Noah; she thought he wasn't her type. They met again and then Allie realized that Noah wasn't what she thought. Every since that day they were inseparable. Allies parents didn't approve of Noah they thought he wasn't good enough for her, just because he didn't have money like them. So Allie was broken hearted when her parents made her leave the town and never see Noah again. Allie was miserable she didn't even get to say goodbye. Noah wrote Allie 360 letters telling her that he loved her and that if she would write back he would find her no matter where she was. About twelve years later they met again then..... Read the book to find out what happens next."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The book the notebook was about a girl Allie nelson she has a summer love that turns out to be true love with noah Calhoun. In the book it has a lot of flashbacks to the past. I recommend this book if u like love stories."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"If you like romance books you should read the fictional novel The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks. Nicholas Sparks also wrote The Wedding , A Walk To Remember, The Guardian and many more. The main characters in this book are Noah and Allie. Noah was a very caring person and very passionate. Allie was a very kind and was very considerate of other people. One summer Noah and Allie fell in love. Then Allie had to leave and Noah was very sad. Then about 12 years later, Allie went to go and find Noah. They spent a couple of days together. Allie left because her fianc&eacute; was at the hotel she was supposed to be staying at. I recommend this book because it leaves you hanging in some chapters and I really like how the author describes the characters in the book. I wouldn't recommend this book to people who don't like romance because you won't be interested and the book might be boring. In conclusion, I would definitely read more books by Nicholas Sparks because I like his style of writing.- Dana"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was one of those books you really can't put down. It makes you want to find your true love and I suggest it to anyone who loves romantic love stories with a very detailed author.GW"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I would give this book close to an infinite amount of stars. Yeah I know, call me crazy!First of all, if you saw the movie before reading the book, I am soooooo terribly sorry. Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie but the book is just completely out of this world!I read this book the first time when I was 19 and I've read it atleast 6 times eversince. I keep re-buying it because I give it away to friends. I miss the original cover!This is the book that taught me what real love is supposed to be like, SIMPLE and SMOOTH! (at least in my opinion)It is definitely an Epic. The first sentence just grabs you and takes you to a cloud to fall in LOVE. No, I will not tell you 1 detail of the story.The only thing I can say is that Allie is completely different in the book than what she was in the movie and it just changes everything. Not for better or worse, just for a different feeling. This is the BEST book that Nicholas Sparks has written up to now. There is just nothing out there to compare it. It is my favorite book ever, so far...."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Have you ever been in a relationship so strong that when you broke apart, that some how love guided you back? No? The Notebook is so romantic, (yes romantic, this is a LOVE story) that you need a box of tissue just to get threw the first few chapters. Well that's my opinion. This book is one of the best well played out stories I have ever read. Its like watching a movie.There is this young \\"country boy\\" named Noah. Well Noah meets this girl, Allie. Allie's daddy owns a tobacco farm in the town that Noah lives in. The young peoples meet up and pretty soon fall in love. But the tobacco season ends just like everything else, and this tears Allie and Noah apart. After 14 years, Allie see's in a newspaper a picture of Noah in her old town. She wants to go see him again but there's only one problem she engaged. Allie has to tell a couple little white lies to go and see Noah again, but she does and Noah and Allie fall in love once more!

Or anyone who dreams of it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"&quot;The Notebook&quot; by Nicholas Sparks was by far the best book I have ever read in my life. I am not an avid reader, I don't pick-up books in my spare time. This book however, captured my heart like no other book. For me, it wasn't so much about Allie and Noah and whether she'd leave Lon, but it was about the unconditional love between two people, who grow old together and love each other. All of us will one day be old, and be the caregiver to the other spouse. I only hope when that time comes that my love will endure like Allie and Noah's. Read this book!!!!! It is an absolute must!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book on a train from Hamburg, Germany to Prague, Czech Republic and I sobbed through the last 50 pages. It is such a remarkable story of love and patience and dedication. Nicolas Sparks in an incredible author and I look forward to reading anything else by him."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"After seeing the reviews from readers in Philidephia and Boston I had to take the time to send in my opinion. I can't believe that a man wrote this book. He has a way of evoking tears. I can see my parents and my wife and I on every page of this very romantic novel. I have to admit that I cried at the end. Yes, it was a bit to sweet but sometimes it is good to slip into a world of fiction and enjoy a good cry. Mr.Sparks you are a fine writer and I am sure you are a fine person to know. You do have a talent for writing a romantic novel that even a man could enjoy. Your other novel &quot;A Message In A Bottle&quot; is just as good. I read it first then searched for this book and you didn't fail me. Both are just the thing for a rainy afternoon. I have spoken to a number of people about both books and all have thoroughly enjoyed these books, and I think any reader with a heart will do the same."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is, by far, the most touching love story I have ever read. To have your lover say all the wonderful, meaningful things that a woman needs and loves to hear. I will have to admit, I cried from the very first chapter.My husband also read The Notebook. After finishing the last page, he walked over to me, picked me up in his arms, hugged me tightly and said, &quot;I only wish I could say half the things he said.&quot; That, I will never forget.This book will definitely make you want to be a better person, wife, and lover. Sometimes we take everything for granted.I will definitely be waiting for Sparks' books in the future."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks delivers yet again another heart warming story, that is not only going to get your complete and utter attention, but it will hook you.It teaches that no matter how many people or places you come across with in life, there will always be that one place that you can always go back to. That place that not only represents your innocence, but your first love. That love that is timeless. It gives you love, loss, lust, love again and, most importantly, hope. Hope that one day you will find true love even if you have been distant from it for so long."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I hate romance novels-really, but this book was a little slice of heaven. It was a great story that, I must admit, had me in tears by the end. I am not a fan of Sparks' other books, but I highly recommend this book to anyone who has a few hours and wants to experience a pure love story (without all the smut)."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"i picked up this book and began reading it last saturday... i finished it last saturday, too! it was so good i couldn't put it down. do not start reading this book unless you have some time to dedicate to it.if you look to the end of the book to see how many pages you have left, make sure you're not counting the preview from his next book. i was disappointed when i thought i had more pages left than i really did have."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"So cute and romantic! Recommend it to EVERYONE! and it is a quick read!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was so amazing. I read the entire thing in one night (stayed up until 5:30 a.m. finishing it and then got up and went to work 3 hours later--yes, it was that good). I was disappointed to read another review that stated Mr. Sparks is not a great writer but presents a good story. I think what the reader was trying to convey was that while the story is not written in elegant prose, it's simplistic language wraps you up so tightly in the story and doesn't let go until the last page (which then leaves you running to find the sequel, The Wedding). It is so well written and in such a casual easy-read manner that you can't help but feel a part of these characters in your soul. My heart ached for them as I turned page after page. A longing to be one with the story enraptured me almost as if I were telling my own story. There were several times I cried audibly while reading, tears streaming down my face. Never has a book touched me so deeply! I can't wait to see the movie! If you love love stories and have ever known the real true kiss of love (as Mr. Sparks surely must have) you will LOVE this book! I think I will read it again and again over the years to come."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A quick easy read. But as other reviews state, it drags on with the &quot;love&quot; stuff. If you are looking for a sappy book that is very easy to read this is the book. You can read it in one sitting (about 3 hours) and it seems as though he wrote this book in the same amount of time."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is one of the best love stories I have ever read. It will make you cry and touch your soul. I absolutely could not put this book down until I finished reading every word. This is the kind of book you read and pass on to a friend to read, just so you can talk about it. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have actually owned this book for quite a while, but just got around to reading it. What an emotional journey it took me on! After reading it, I couldn't help but feel more love and passion in my own relationship.It was an easy read and I never found myself distracted while reading it. Sparks does a good job of keeping out the &quot;filler&quot;.I have not seen the movie yet and I am a little reluctant. The book was just so wonderful that I am afraid the movie won't measure up.I have been telling all of my girl friends that this one is a must read, even if they aren't in a relationship. A true love story, I recommend reading it with a box of tissues!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Very nice story...much better than the movie. It keeps your interest and if hard to put down. You feel for the characters and it is an emotional experience."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I really loved this book. I think for me it was a cathartic experience. I literally cried my eyes out for the last 60 pages. It is certainly a book you want to be at home to read. I would definitely recommend this book to my girlfriends."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A cute love story but prepared to cry. See the movie, it is a good representation with a few changes that still work."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I recently read this book after I saw the movie, and I wish I had done it in reverse, I think I would have enjoyed the book more. I liked the movie better than the book, which is something that doesn't happen to me very often. I really did like the book, it is a wonderful, classic love story that I find most would enjoy. But I think that the characters in the movie are more realistic than in the book. They are one-dimensional, they have no flaws. In the movie, however, they are shown bickering with each other all the time, and I think that's something people can relate to more. Although, the book draws away from that in the love story itself.Don't get me wrong, I really loved this story. Sparks handles every scene very well, and you can feel all the emotion that's there, every thought, the sexual tension that building throughout the story until they finally are together again. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone, I read it in maybe about 3 hours, so it's for anyone looking for an easy read.

It's a very romantic love story. It's not like all other love stories where two people fall in love and live happily ever after. It's much more detailed.Noah and Allie have a summer romance and fall in love. Allie's parents don't approve because Noah isn't up to their standards. He comes from a poor family and doesn't have much education. Noah and Allie get spilt apart because Allie's parents decided it's time to cut the summer short and return home. They said they would write each other but Allie's mother hid the letters Noah would send. So after years went by Allie stopped writing. Noah and Allie moved on with their lives. Noah severed in the War and Allie was engaged to be married. After Noah returned home he inheritted money which he used to build the house Allie had dreamed of. When Allie read about it in the paper she went to visit Noah. Would they fall in love all over again or would Allie marry this other man?"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"If you have a hankering for a book about endless, boundless love, you won't be disappointed with \\"The Notebook.\\" It's a short read that can be finished in one setting, but its theme is universal and timeless. The characters, Noah and Allie, evoke images of hope, passion, commitment and dedication.Nicholas Sparks' works feature touching, emotional plots, and his sensitivity shines throughout this book.The scenery descriptions are captivating. For example, \\"Tundra swan and geese literally surrounded them. Thousands of them. Birds floating so close together that she couldn't see the water. From a distance, the groups of swans looked almost like icebergs.\\"The best, soul-touching portions of the book detail the passion between Noah and Allie. The lovemaking scene allows readers to imagine the sights, sounds, smells, and most important, touch. The deepness of that moment is almost overwhelming, and Sparks writes in such a natural, delicate way that many writers cannot do.Sparks also employs a few stream-of-consciousness techniques that set a nice tone for upcoming scenes, as in \\"The rockers moved in quiet rhythm. Bats again, on the river. Moths kissing the porch light. Somewhere, he knew, there were people making love.\\"The book alternates from flashbacks of the couple's young love story to the present, when Noah is taking care of Allie, who has a brain disorder that affects memory. He takes her for walks and reads the notebook that is their love story. She drifts in and out of reality, but sometimes recalls who she and Noah are, and what their life together was like. The dedication that Noah has for his wife shows the power and strength of love.After reading the book three times, I still can't put down the tissues. Sparks manages to stir a person's innermost feelings. You feel connected to the story and leave dreaming of a love like Noah and Allie shared, knowing that love can conquer the impossible."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook was one of those easy reading and hard to put down books. I thought the way it was written was meant for you to relax and to pretend that you actually knew the people because you would read their thoughts about the other person and encourage them in a way to make their thoughts into actions. A little like gossping about a friend and her soon to be boyfriend but you know both sides of the story. I think it was one of the fastest book i've read because it kept me so interested. I didn't expect the story to take the turn that it did in the end, and it made it more bittersweet. It was the type of romance that a girl would want to experience and be able tell her grandchildren the story when she was eight years old. I like the style that Nicholas Sparks writes The Notebook because it has a reflection part in the beginning that ties in again in the end. Like a frame story...a story within a story. It makes it make a little more sense. I prefer the book over the movie and i would read it again...which i probably will."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book is about the fairty tail love story. It goes deep into their thoughts at all times of their love. This book showed me that there can be many problems with love but in the end no matter what happens you will always have that one person.

They go through many other relationships until they realize that they are perfect for eachother. In this quest they risk hurting their friends who don't believe in their love and their family. But to pass that barrier means that there is only love."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I really enjoyed this novel.

Noah Calhoun and Allie Nelson haven't seen each other for fourteen years. This page-turner takes you through a paper escapade of their relationship and lives. Even though there are many clich&eacute;s, Nicholas Sparks uses clich&eacute;s to create a modern day fairy tale, allowing readers to escape into a perfect world. The past haunts Noah's future, the intensity of their relationship makes this an emotional novel.The Notebook starts out in a nursing home with 80 year-old Noah. \\"I am a common man with common thoughts, and I've led a common life\\" (2). He reads to others in the nursing home, he cares and helps others. However in reality, he is lonely, thinking about his past, it haunts him ever day. He starts reading about a love story from a notebook; his notebook. In 1946, Noah returned from World War II, and tries to forget the summer long ago when he first met Allie. Allie, an engaged woman seeks out to find Noah after 14 years, trying to re-enter his life. Allie's fianc&eacute;, Lon Hammond is a successful and high-class lawyer. This book takes readers into a modern day fairy tale, in search of true love. Over the dinner table, they talk about their past, and how they have missed each other all these years. By the end of dinner, they both knew they are deeply in love again. \\"You are the answer to every prayer I've offered. You are a song, a dream, a whisper, and I don't know how I could have lived without you for as long as I have.\\" (134). This love story ends and it goes back to the present. Where Noah, is still lonely.Allie and Noah are meant to be together, they were each other's first and true love. They fill the missing pieces in each other's heart. Noah understands and encourages Allie to pursue her interest and talent in art. By using Noah and Allie's relationship, Sparks shows that even in this sad and lonely world, love still exists, and miracles can happen. It makes readers cherish the love from others around them, reminds others what is really important, and reminds readers that this world is not lonely.Like many fairy tale stories, Sparks uses clich&eacute;s to create a modern day fairy tale-like setting, creating this illusion of \\"Once upon a time, and happily ever after.\\" The over-use of clich&eacute; is continued throughout the book to emphasize the word \\"Love\\" and the love between Noah and Allie. Every fairy tale has some sort of problems or evil presence; some might involve a poison apple or a witch. However, In The Notebook it is Allie's decision to whether to leave Lon for Noah, and the problems they face later in life.The Notebook can be perceived as a romantic story or a fairy tale. It can make readers cry, jealous, feel embraced by love or you might dislike it. Teenagers, adults or even elders can read this book, and escape to another world. By creating a modern day fairy tale, Sparks succeeds his purpose of proving that even though in this sad and lonely world, love still exists and unbelievable things can happen. Even though the over-use of clich&eacute;s might make the book unrealistic, and too much of a fairy tale, Noah's past and future and the intensity of their relationship makes The Notebook a living fairy tale and an international bestseller."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks' best book!!

This novel begins with an older man telling a story of love to a regular, elderly lady in a nursing home. From this notebook he is reading, he tells the story of a young couples redeeming love. Allie and Noah spent a wonderful summer together but were torn apart when Allies parents make them move away from the small country town Noah has lived in his whole life. Fourteen years pass without any type of communications and their lives have both moved on. Allie is engaged to a rich, powerful lawyer, and Noah has just come back from war and is rebuilding an old house. It wasn't until Allie finds an article in the newspaper that she realizes she has to see Noah before she gets married. This begins the story of a love so deep, that it's unexplainable.The Notebook is definitely one of the best love stories of all time, and although it can be sad at times, it is very heart warming. There hasn't been a single person who hasn't fallen completely in love with the story, as well as the characters. Nicholas Sparks describes them so greatly that you almost wish they were real people.I loved this book and would definitely recommend this to anyone I come across because it isn't like any other love story. Nicholas Sparks truly captures your heart in this one because of the way that you aren't sure about the \\"who's going to end up with who\\" which really kept me reading. I can't wait to read the sequel, The Wedding, which will hopefully be just as good or better than the first."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"During the summer, I watched a movie called The Notebook, based on the novel, The Notebook. I immediately fell in love with the film that I decided to read the novel for my independent book project.This novel takes place in the 1930's-1940's. It's all about one summer, and how it changed the lives of two people forever. Two young adults, preparing for college in the fall, met one summer night, and fell madly in love. The two felt as if they could never get enough of each other, and spent every waking hour together. Summer ends, and the two must go their separate ways. They begin their new lives, but the summer they spent together will never leave one another.Allie, the young girl is from a very wealthy family and is always on a strict schedule. Noah, the young country boy is more of a free spirit and he doesn't believe that money solves all of your problems. Allie comes in contact with Noah fourteen years later, when she sees him in the newspaper one day. Allie, now engaged, had completely forgotten what the summer had meant to her. While Noah had not forgotten a thing from the summer romance, and a day didn't go by when he didn't think about her. The two re-connect, remembering the magical summer they had spent together underneath the trees, so long ago, yet it seeming like it was only yesterday. Allie now had the major decision of picking to be with her old love, or her new one.During the course of the book, it starts out as an elderly man reading a story to an elderly woman. The story he is telling to the woman is the story of Allie and Noah. Which man did Allie choose to be with? Who is the older man reading to the woman? Who is the woman listening to the story?

The novel may be sad and heart warming, but is a great uplifting book that has many qualities that show us a lot of moral values. The notebook is an amazing book with a great plot and character's you will never forget! Overall, I would definitely give this novel a five star rating and suggest that all of you read it.Sheena DeslauriersLove is unpredictable - The notebook"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book in one day. I was truly riveted to the story line and it was a good love story. I have not had a good cry in a while and this book really touched my heart, to realize how true love never dies and stays with you throughout. The writer nicholas sparks is really good with words and imagery and the words came to life. I really loved it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"One of the greatest love stories in modern times-I havent had the opportunity to watch the movie but I hope it will move me the same way the book did."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I totally love this book. I could not put it down. A must read for the hopeless romantics out there."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I had bought the DVD and after seeing it I ordered the Notebook and the Wedding which has lead me to order every other book published by Nicholas Sp[arks...such a delightful experience - reading his books."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"There are very few books that I have read that touch me in a way that I have to read them every month, every week, or every day. Nicholas Sparks is one of those very few writers that can make you wish that you could jump inside the book and be one of the characters. That is what The Notebook did for me. While reading it I found myself wishing that one day I would meet Noah, as if he were a real person. I cannot decide if this book is truly a novel or a book of poetry. But it is a book that takes only a short time to read, but makes for a lifetime of enjoyment."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"There is not much to say about this book that has not already been said. A beautiful portrayal of enduring love starting in the teenage years and lasting until the very end.Despite all this, I found the first 90 pages a very slow read and abandoned the book numerous times, with my wife doing the same only that she abandoned it completely. Lucky for both of us, I persevered and went on to finish the book (which really became a breeze after the first 100 or so pages) and enjoyed it so much that my wife ended up reading it too. We both loved the story in the end. From a writer's point of view, I think many books surpass the Notebook. It's not one of the best stories, character development is quite mundane until the very end. Even so, this book retains a sense of magic that cannot escape the reader, providing the reader finishes the book.Together with my wife, I watched the movie after reading the book and as always in this case, we thought the book was much better than the movie. But even the movie was quite good."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Very sweet love story well written.

I loved the book, the author was so sensitive, very nicely done.Thank you."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Not for the hard hearted (unless you still yearn deep inside to find your soul mate). It's about the things that really matter and doing the right thing and the pain and joys of feeling that kind of love. My in laws story is similar, (WWII kept them apart for years) and I find them so inspiring. Cynics will hate it or laugh, those who have found a soulmate or long for one will love it and cry at the thought of losing something that special and hopefully be inspired to find and keep deep, committed love in their own lives."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was amazed at how much I loved this book after reading all the horrible customer reviews that it received on this website.

Towards the end you might find yourself relating Noah and Al's forgotten but not extinguished love to your own life. But, after gaining conscientiousness from your near drowning of tears, you'll get a grip on your emotions and find that the book is over. Don't be upset though.

If you have a loved one who is Dx. with Alzheimers Disease this is not only a must but could become a &quot;bible&quot; that will help you through those times when you think you can't go on. As a nurse on an Alzheimers Unit for 15 years...I still cried and felt the pain of the loved one left behind. Don't hesitate to pick this book up! Not only did it deal with the disease process it dealt with the emotion of love lost."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The book was written to draw the audience into emotions rather than telling the story.

A beautiful story with no unnecessary violence or bad language. A beautifull look on the relationship with a person with Alzheimer's and love that conquers all."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The book was brief, and a bit rushed toward the end. It remains an endearing tale. Worth reading if you're a romantic who doesn't need a \\"Disney ending\\"."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"It was too mushy for me. I couldn't get into it. I finally finished the book mainly because so many people had told me how wonderful it was. I guess it wasn't my type of book. All it was, was feelings, feelings, feelings. It never really went anywhere. It's hard for me to list a book as \\"I don't like it\\" because I can usually find some quality to like in a book which I did here when the couple was young, but eventually even that got to me. I'm glad the author is doing well, he has quite a following."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I found it very boring. I had heard good things but it really didn't hold my interest. The man in the story was very sweet and it was a great love story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Probably one of the greatest love stories ever written.

Buy it now, you will not be sorry."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was way overated.

He lives in South Carolina with his wife and two sons.The story is about two characters Allie Nelson and Noah Cahaun. After reading his book I know that it will stay forever etched inside my heart and soul. To me, \\"love is when you are with someone it's like the world around you seems to disappear.\\"The story begins in 1946 on the coastal shores of North Carolina, Noah is returning home from World War II at the age of thirty-one.In 1932, 14 years before Noah came home from the war, he had a summer love with Allie. The obstacles that ended their relationship involved Allies disapproving parents and the war.Noah goes off to war and for two years he faithfully writes love letters to Allie. Allies mother kept them and never let Allie see or read them.I could relate to his part of the story. When I grew up in the 1960's my parents thought they knew what was best for me as I grew up. For example, I grew up in an all strict Irish Catholic family. I was in love with a man I wanted to date and he was not from my Catholic school or upbringing. My parents did whatever they could to make sure we did not talk or see one another. My parents send me to an all girls boarding school, which brought about the final separation between me and the boy.At the age of 29, Allie found Noah in a story on the house in Raleigh in the newspaper. She was now engaged to a very wealthy attorney. She decided to go to Raleigh to visit Noah and see the house he remodeled. This is the very house years ago that they met and spent a summer finding the love they both wanted in each other.When Allie visits Noah she didn't think that her feelings would come back so strongly for Noah. Well her emotions took over and as they visit and reminisce, they find the true love they once had and fall in love all over again, forever.I would recommend this book to all who want to read a love story and a romance that will steal away your heart.Review written by Jackie Paulson 2012"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"\\"Notebook\\" is an appealing fairytale. Two talented, beautiful people are in a land of magic. They are charmed into abandoning all for love. The magic of their love accompanies them even to their very old age, when she is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and he from cancer and stroke.But this fairy tale has a critical flaw. When they abandon all for love, Noah and Allie abandon *conscience* for love, with few ill effects. Allie, while engaged to Lon, sneaks away to look for her former lover (Noah). Forgetting questions of right and wrong, Noah and Allie give in to their desires and enjoy a thrilling time of beauty, love and lovemaking. It feels so \\"right.\\" Allie, after hesitating, decides to marry Noah.This is the sort of thing that we wish would come true--in the wishes of our worst moments! Betrayal doesn't work in most fairytales, and it doesn't work in real life. Not really.\\"The Notebook\\" is an appealing but sick fairytale. Such fairytales can fill our imaginations with sweet, deadly illusions and lead to tragic mistakes in real life.We are better off with Tolkien's marvelous \\"Ring\\" trilogy. Or the story of The Beauty and the Beast, where the heroine is pure of heart."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Maybe the critics didn't feel this was great prose, but like The Bridges of Madison County, it warms the heart and brings a tear to the eye. What a wonderful tale of love and devotion and, yes, it seemed very true to life. I found it inspiring."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I as a 16 year old male read this book. It was one of the best books I have read. I have never read a love story before, but this was more than a love story..it was life. How wonderful I kept thinking it would feel to be loved as much as Allie loved Noah and Noah loved Allie. I have read quite a few books but only a few have left impressions. As for the person that said this story had a lot of Trite expressions..who cares!! I hope that people for generations and generations to come will enjoy this masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I loved this book and I'm not into love stories. I thought this was such a great story. I couldn't put the book down and I cried towards the end. I think it was well written and I loved the sweetness and simplicity of Noah, and the love between he and Allie. I will definately recommend this book to others."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Please stop trying to show off your English 101 skills, and just because you got an A in Rhetoric &amp; Composition does not mean that you should spoil this book for the rest of us. Love is not about plot lines and depth of chracters and why is all of a sudden &quot;trite&quot; your favorite word? And And, in case you missed it in your quick read-through, Love is what this book is about. I don't understand how you weren't moved by Noah's sacrifice for his Allie, the way he held back everyday from telling her all about their lives during her Alzheimers? I have been blessed not to have had this disease in my family, but I felt the pain he went through. All any of us can do is hope to find even a tiny piece of that love. Maybe you haven't felt it, but when you do, hopefully you will see this book in a new light."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"It was good and I even cried towards the end. But, it was a little unrealistic and predictable. It's a very good light read though and that's what I was in the mood for. Definitely recommend to my sensitive, romantic friends."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I am disappointed and somewhat alarmed at all the 10's this book has received here. Can't anybody see through the paper-thin prose and constant cliches? I love a good love story as much as the next person, and as a matter of fact, I am involved in a lost-and-then-found-again relationship similar to Allie and Noah's which has brought me much joy, but I was truly embarrassed by the author's simplistic, unrealistic, trite writing."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is the book that Bridges of Madison County wanted to be. Noah &amp; Allie are not extraordinary people who do extraordinary things - they are everyday people who have an extraordinary love and devotion to each other. The way that is conveyed to the reader makes this story one of the best and most endearing love stories of modern times. At times it reminded me of _Love Story_, only I found this book to be more touching. Additionally, I like the fact that I can recommend this book to anyone without worrying about offensive language or scenes. I hope Mr. Sparks writes many more books for us to enjoy."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The author has discovered all the ingredients for success -- make it short, use the same cliches over and over, refrain from developing any depth to the characters, provide no insight to the characters' personalities, skip opportunities for conflict, develop no character flaws. I never felt as if I really knew Allie or Noah. There was no develpment of Allie, what she'd been doing during the 14 years since she'd last seen Noah. To justify her seeking out Noah, she simply says over and over again, &quot;I was just wondering what you'd been up to.&quot; Please! These characters sound cardboard with dialogue that could have been written for a grade school paper entitled &quot;What I did during my summer vacation.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I did thoroughly enjoy The Notebook. The story is simple, but the descriptive writing is excellent. The characters are people you want to get to know better, and there are very little surprises. I thought that the second half of the story, when they are in the hospital is too unbelievable to be touching, but I really did like the love story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I could not put this book down and thought about long after I finished it. It was so well told. The author is a wonderful story teller."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book should be on the top of your MUST READ list. I've passed it on to all my girlfriends. It's a small book...great for those who don't have a lot of time to read, but full of great emotions. To be pulled into these people's lives and feel how strong their love is, it's amazing. This book will live on with you for a long time after you are done reading it. And for those hopless romantics, it will make you believe the right one is out there and you can live happily ever after."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A very well written story, it contain a huge amount of beautiful feelings and love. A real romance which could be hard to find in reality or even in other romantic stories. The writer has a magic of letting you - as a reader- feel, sence even get hurted with every single events on the story. You would have this feeling of striking the story's event somhow and beg Allie not to leave Noah again specially after those long years of separation ( which is going to happened any way later on). Personaly, i found myself deeply involved on this story, i found my self crying specially when the writer was describing the relation between Noah and Allie when she got sick with Al Zahaimer, and how Noah feelings towards her never changed a bit. I should realy congratulate the writer on this amazing story which makes you enjoy and live for a short time the real romance &amp; love that has disapeared from our real world to find it only on his books."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A bodice-ripper sans ripped bodices (ha, she unbuttons *his* shirt). Personally, I'd have thought she'd opt for a shower before going back to meet Lon. No wonder he disappeared. In short, about as plausible as Love Story, and serves the same purpose: makes the ladies sigh and look askance at the guy snoring next to 'em.Stick with &quot;How We Met&quot; in Ann Landers. At least they're real."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I'm reading this book for the second time and I LOVE IT. I'm obviously a hopeless romantic, but this book feeds my illusion of true love. Or is it not an illusion? I particularly love the feeling the description of the house and nature around it gives me. The book lies beside my bed and that in itself helps me dream away and relax.I recommend that ANOTHER GREAT BOOK you should read is &quot;Working on yourself doesn't work&quot; by Ariel and Shya Kane. It is an excellent relaxing book. It's categorized under self-help but I also find it an great reading book. It gives me permission to be who I am in the moment and it releases so much pressure I put on myself. Excellent way to relax.It's also been great doing workshops with the Kanes in Germany, New York and Costa Rica! It's a wonderful way to keep myself on track with my life and the wishes I have for myself. It's radically transformed my life. And it's great fun."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Well, the story was okay, but sex is sex and love is love, right? And never the twain shall meet? Except in this book, of course. Personally, I found the thought of two old people having sex just revolting beyond belief. Come on, who lives like that? If it would have just been love, okay, but sex? Give me a break, already! Too sappy and sentimental, but if sappy and sentimental is what you're looking for, this might be the book for you. Just be warned."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A friend lent me this book to read and I could barley put it down. I would be up until 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning reading. The Notebook is the best novel I have read in about 9 years. I just bought A Walk To Remember, and I can't wait to get started on it. The Notebook is the first book I have read by Sparks, and will continue to seek his work. If you are looking for a good novel to sit back, kick your shoes off, and enjoy then may I suggest this one!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Another disappointing attempt at creating a moving romance. The author equates love with tragedy. True, all life ends in death, but he dwells on the negative rather than the positive. The book takes the reader on an emotional roller coaster ride and then drops them off the cliff into oblivion. Don't bother with this book or you'll need prosac to face the day."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I barely call this a love story. It truly would be called a love story if it didn't have all those obscene descriptions in them. I was reading this book during homeroom and I got into trouple because of what I was reading. Truly, I couldn't tell it would that kind of a book from it's description in the back. I've seen more writing talent in a Dr. Seuss book than this."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I'm not sure why certain romance novels seem to &quot;catch on&quot; and become mega-bestsellers while others are relegated to the pink-and-baby-blue-softcolor shelves. In this case, I don't see what all the hype is about. There are much better books out there to spend your time with."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Predictable and lame, this is a weekend laptop turnout from an author who expects success. Why is it given to him? Are best seller readers so infantile that they will accept cheap writing at $6.95 a pop? Total waste of time. Don't read if you have any education or self-respect."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Oh, Jeez. I'd like some bread with my cheese"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Adequately written for the general public, yet way over the edge for believability. Admittedly tugged at my heart strings, but also pulled my leg."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A co-worker leant me this book and I alloted a night for it-it didn't even take me that long! I couldn't believe the characters, the situations, and most of all, the dialogue. I am in love and would make sacrifices--I only hope that my love will never be as cliche and ridiculous as this book!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was so poorly written that it was difficult to read. (Nicholas Sparks, if you're reading this, I'm sorry.) I could have written something better, more entertaining, and more subtle when I was about 8. I cannot understand what sort of publishing house would actually produce such an amateur attempt.I am reading Sparks's second novel, Message in a Bottle (or was it his first???), figuring that perhaps The Notebook was just a fluke. I must say, it is better, however a glaring lack of subtlety must be Sparks's trademark.But go ahead and read it - it will only take an hour or so."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Watch out Harlequin! This book reminded me of those ridiculous grocery store checkout romances I read in Junior High. Although the book is so short, it took me over a month to read it. The plot was non-existent and the characters were cardboard cut-outs. The dialogue became so cheesy at times that I had to put the book down lest I puke. I kept hoping it would get better but it never did. It did have a few touching moments, but overall this was a very disappointing read."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The predictable storyline of this book (I can't call it a novel) never really &quot;happened.&quot; I could have handled the thin plot if the writing weren't so meager. This book included some of the dumbest dialogue I have ever read. I only read with any interest far enough to find out what happened and then could have easily left it never wondering again what became of the lovers. I only finished it because I am on vacation. And now free to read a REAL novel."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book bored me to tears. Thank God I borrowed it from the library. I would have hated to spend hard earned money for it. Sorry Nick."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I can't believe this book is a &quot;phenomenal international best seller&quot; I hated it, I only dragged myself through it because it was given to me by a friend. I thought it was totally corny, and thoroughly unbelieveable. Were we supposed to cry? Where??"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"what is the big deal? i found this so boring i had to put it down and never did pick it back up."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"On my head for reading a story like this, of a man just came back from world war II but he stir the water to make sure the powders were dissolved , and a woman who cried for the sun rise !! this story is so poor it took advantage of Alzheimer .. and reading it is no charity !"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is a great, quick read. The writing is superb and the story is wonderfully romantic, with a slight twist."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The copy is quite good, but hasn't been read because it's a bit too racy for my 15-year-old.

I also saw the movie and loved it, but the book created such a wonderful picture in my head that I would have to say that I liked it much better. This author has such a talent for writing love stories!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Excellent story! I could not put it down. It will definitely stir your heartstrings and possibly remind you of love lost."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read about half of The Notebook and I really could not finish it. It was just way to boring. When it started I didn't even understand what was going on. Even the movie I thought was boring. I normally do relatively like Nicholas Sparks books but this one I just could not get through."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is the kind of love story that we all hope for, but never get (Almost?!?). When I first read this book, it was not a major motion picture, but held my attention from beginning to end. I also believe that while the book was phenomenal, sadly, the movie did not do this story any justice.(I beleive the actors could have done a better job personifying the protagonists)This was my first Nicholas Sparks book; I remember thinking how much I love this book and was immediately on the lookout for other Sparks books.I recommend this book 100%!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Not only was this book romantic it was also very mysterious. Alley came back, but you didn't know if she was going to stay with Noah or not. Then Lon called and she had to part with Noah and she thought it would be the last time she would ever see him again. Then she went and told Lon that her heart didn't belong to him and that she never felt the same way with him that she did with Noah. Then the book changed to having two elderly people in a nursing home. You didn't know what was going to happen. It always had you guessing. It was very fun to read."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Here's the synopsis: A beautiful princess is wooed by a handsome prince from an opposing kingdom. The princess falls into a deep sleep. The prince kisses her and, like magic, she awakens. They live happily ever after. The end.Sorry to spoil it for you. That's the whole story, in a nutshell. The other 238 pages are a mish-mash of poorly written, unimaginative prose. For example, he uses the phrase \\"emerald eyes\\" three times when once was more than enough. In one part of the book the author actually used the word \\"loins\\" in a sex scene. I don't think I've seen that word in print since my last perusal of the Bible. There were serious scenes that I actually laughed at while reading because they were so ridiculously described. Several times I thought \\"I can't believe I'm reading this!\\" I kept hoping it would get better. It never did.The characters in this book are one-diminsional. They have no faults or flaws to speak of. They live perfect lives, have perfect children, and are perfectly successful. They aren't realistic enough to be believed.The ending was a slap in the face to all people who have ever loved an Alzheimer's patient. If Alzheimer's were curable with love, few people would still have it. I would much rather have read a book about people who came to terms with their loss. That would have been more inspiring. This book was a waste of an excellent premise."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"\\"I am nothing special; of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul and to me, this has always been enough.\\" (2)By far the best line in the novel, Spark's writing will be sure to leave you emotional and touched.I have had the chance to see both the movie and read the book and I have to say that I cannot choose which is better, but that they both are compelling and beautiful in their own way; they compliment each other. Even if you liked the movie better than the novel, remember that without this novel you would not have even had the chance to experience the movie; so when you rate this book, know that you are rating the whole idea of Noah and Allie. I give it 5 out of 5 stars.A reviewer talks about how the story moves into another direction with sickness and death and says \\"It was uncalled for and it would have been nice if it ended on a \\"cute\\" note\\", but I'm sure that nothing in life ends on a \\"cute\\" note. Life is not a fairy tale and reality never is \\"cute\\"; it is filled with tragedy but maybe sometimes we can build upon that tragedy and create not a happy ending but a poignant, bittersweet ending and that's what Sparks does. His characters try to see the light in a bad situation and instead of just taking the bad they bring out the good. Sparks writes about love, life, and loss the three most realistic things we can experience on this earth. Sure it might be somewhat idealistic for an Alzheimer's patient to have moments of mental clarity but to know the power of love is to know then that anything is possible. I have actually had the chance to work with Alzheimer's patients at a convalescent home and come to the conclusion that everything Sparks writes (or dreams about) is absolutely true. People often doubt the power of others, the power of love; they doubt each other. I have seen patients actually brighten up, become more alert, and actually remember when the ones they love are around them. It truly is a miracle to experience or to even see that happen. Adding the Alzheimer's to the story makes Noah and Allie's story more real, it shows that the power of their love can and will overcome any obstacle and to me, that makes a \\"cute\\" ending.Beautifully written, this is by far the best novel I have ever read and I will keep it with me for the rest of my life. After reading a chapter, I would have to put it down, grab my Kleenex, and wonder in awe if I will ever experience a love so powerful and true as Noah and Allie's. He keeps me believing in love, and in life; that I too may be so blessed to know and even feel maybe half of what Noah and Allie had.Thank you Mr. Sparks for such a true gift.And as one reviewer put so beautifully before \\"This book will wrench tears from your heart and even lead you to view your own life with greater introspection\\", I wholeheartedly agree."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"THE NOTEBOOK by Nicholas Sparks is the love story of a man and a woman destined to be together. The novel starts with an old man reading out of a notebook, and the story he reads is his story. We meet Noah, a simple young man who falls in love with a girl who is visiting town for the summer, Allie Nelson. They have a brief yet intense romance. Their love was not meant to be, however. Allie's family comes from upper class southern roots, and they do not approve of her dating a man of Noah's background. The two are forced to separate and over the years they live out their lives, not knowing that they still loved each other.But as Noah had predicted, destiny brought them back together, and we meet the two again years later, with Allie engaged and about to be married to a highly successful lawyer (Lon), and Noah living alone in a house he had told Allie years ago he would fix up and restore. He lives alone, and still dreams of Allie. When Allie sees this house in the newspaper, she goes to find him on a whim. What happens between them after being reunited is what dreams are made of.The story in the notebook ends before the reader can know what really happened between Lon, Noah, and Allie. Did Allie stay true to her promise and marry Lon? Or did she choose Noah? The reader does not find this out til the last chapter.I found this book a very fast read. This is my second Nicholas Sparks book, and as with MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE, I enjoyed THE NOTEBOOK very much. Both were tear jerkers. I really can't say which book I enjoyed better, but I will certainly read his other books. This book is a definite MUST READ for all those who love a good romance. I would not be surprised to see this book turned into a movie in the near future."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook was a very interesting book. I enjoyed it tremendously and read it through very quickly. Noah and Allison grew up together in love with each other, but Noah was not of as high class as Allison and her family, so her parents banned her from seeing him. They still saw each other for a while until Allison had to move. Noah and Allison were heartbroken. Allison later got engaged to another man and when Noah found out about it, he was grief stricken. There was still a burning love inside of their hearts for each other, but they both tried to hide it. Noah dated other women, but all he could think about was Allison. He would do anything to see her again. Then, Noah found out that Allison was coming back into town. Her fianc&eacute; had to work nearby and so she wanted to go shopping in her hometown. Noah found out about this and caught up with Allison. She came over for dinner that night and they had a wonderful time. She kept trying to hide the feelings he had for her, but they just kept on surfacing. She would come over for days and stay with Noah and they would have tremendous amounts of fun. Allison's fianc&eacute; started to worry about her because he tried to call her numerous times and she wasn't at her hotel. He asked around and found out that she was seeing her old sweetheart, Noah. Allison's mother had been phoned by her fianc&eacute; asking if she had any idea where Allison was. She said she didn't know, but she knew in her heart that she was with Noah. She despised Noah and didn't feel that she should see him. Allison's mother showed up later at Noah's house to warn her that her fianc&eacute; was coming to see her at Noah's. She told her that she needed to make up her mind and choose who she wanted to be with because it wasn't fair to either one of them. Allison was an artist and had always dreamed of being one, but Noah was the only person who ever supported her dream. She had painted a picture for him and that was one of the main things that rekindled their lost love. Allison later decided that she was going to go back home and marry her fianc&eacute;, but later came back to Noah. He kept a notebook of all of their adventures together and later she got Alzheimer's disease. He read the notebook to her every day and sometimes she even remembered their love for each other. Noah had a very strong heart and never stopped loving Allison. Allison, on the other hand, was forced by her parents not to love Noah, but deep within she still loved him. Her parents were very bitter and hateful towards Noah because he was not of the same high class. I don't think that the author should change anything in this book; it was great. A strong burning love never dies out."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Such a wonderful storyof true love that lives through thick and thin, youth and maturity. What a heartwarming book. The setting of this story is so well written that mentally I could feel myself right there in the breeze in their meadow. I read A Walk To Remember also and it was a tremendously good book too. I highly reccommend this book. It's a great way to cap off a stressful day at work or being &quot;mom&quot; all day. You'll love it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A wonderful love story. Noah and Allie's love is something that was so real. I definitely would recommend this book. This was the first book I read from Nicholas Sparks, I was hooked."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I LOVED this story. I cried for the entire second half of the novel, and I don't cry for anything! He touched my heart and brought me into the story. I've read all of Nicholas Spark's books (because of this one) and though I have absolutely loved them all, this is by far the best!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is an absolutely amazing book! It is a touching story about a man's love for his wife and the trails they are put through in their elderly years. I would recommend this book to people of all ages. It's simply wonderful."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook describes a true love story like few people have the opportunity to experience. You will be captivated by Noah and Allison and the path they travel together. Allison battles Alzheimer's disease and can not remember the life she had with Noah. Not ready and unable to let go, he reads her &quot;the notebook&quot; of their past. You will cry, you will ache, you will yearn for a love like theirs, one that will not surrender to time, distance, or a debilitating disease. This story will tug at your heartstrings and restore your faith in love."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is the most amazing book I've ever read. I've actually read it several times now and it never ceases to touch me in my very soul. As a writer, I adore how Sparks shows great admiration for the art of poetry and how it is shown in such an amazing light. Poetry is not something to be overanalyzed...it should be allowed to seep in and affect you in ways that you cannot comprehend. But poetry is not the main focus of this book. This book tells a timeless story of love...but not everyday love, and this is not an everyday book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Spark's has delivered another sweet and touching love story, wrought with the complications of life. Obstacles such as family, time and disease must be overcome to unite these two lovers.The Notebook is a lovely story. I was particularly touched by the ending, while the two are now in a nursing home. I think sparks shows an amazing understanding of alzheimer disease and demonstrates wonderfully the extreme difficulty in surviving a spouse who suffers from it.A wonderful book to curl up with on a Sunday afternoon."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I came to Amazon to buy my second copy of 'The Notebook.' I loaned my first one out, and it is still being passed around. I was curious to read the reader reviews and surprised to find that people either loved it (higher percentage it seems) or hated it. I think it comes down to this. If you are a hopeless romantic that loves or has been loved deeply, this is a wonderful read. If not, you would be better served to spend your money elsewhere. Noah and Allie's story spans a lifetime and is as tender as any I've ever read. Critique the writing, or writing style if you will, but you can't knock this tender love story. It's one for the ages. Everyone should be so lucky as to know the kind of love that Noah had for Allie. I'm thankful that Sparks took the time to share it with the world."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The notebook was the best romantic,caring novel I have ever read. It was so........ touching. Now Nicholas Sparks is my favorite writer now im reading one of his books called \\"The Choice\\" I just got it today but I think it be a very good book scence the Notebook was."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"\\"I am nothing special, of this I am sure. I am a common man with common thoughts and I've led a common life. There are no monuments dedicated to me and my name will soon be forgotten, but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough.\\"And so begins one of the most poingnant and compelling love stories you will ever read...The Notebook is a tale of young love, love lost, romance, love remembered, and packed full of heartwrenching decisions. True love that knows no boundaries and can overcome anything. My heart literally ached for Noah and Allie in this timeless love story.Three...I've now read three Novels by Nicholas Sparks, and all three have had me in tears, however, none quite as badly as The Notebook. Tears now stain the pages in my book, a permanent reminder of the feelings evoked by seemingly harmless words on a page.This is why I love reading! For anyone who has ever loved, truely loved, this is a must read!! Be wary where you read this, and make sure you bring tissue."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The \\"Notebook\\" is a fine, weepy, chick flick that is filled with and even racked with love and devotion-- and I second that emotion.The scene is the nursing home and Duke played by James Garner has befriended another occupant named Allie (played by Gena Rowland). Duke passes the time reading to her a story from his notebook and Allie, who has Alzheimer's, loves hearing them.Duke tells her about a poor young boy named Noah (Ryan Gosling) who met a well-to-do young woman (Rachel McAdams) whose flirtations blossomed into love. Destined for Sarah Lawrence College and a place far away from the boy who worked in a mill, the parents accelerate her departure when they realize her attention has turned toward Noah and away from the future they charted for her.World War II makes the separation complete along with the girl's mother intercepting every letter the young boy wrote to her. A new man, an officer as well as a man of means comes into her life and the war ends. The girl makes peace with the love of her life that promised to write her and never did. She sets the date of her wedding. Trying on her wedding dress and reading the announcement of her wedding she stumbles onto a story about a young man who refurbished a house that he promised a long time ago, to give to the woman he loved.As Duke continues to read the story to her, Allie hopes the two will come together. Their only interruptions are the nursing home schedules and a visit from his family. He introduces them to his friend, Allie. The introductions are polite but awkward.This is where my part of the story ends.\\"The Notebook\\" comes from the novel written by Nicholas Sparks. It was adapted for the screen by Jan Sardi, and the screenplay was written by Jeremy Leven. Joan Allen, Sam Shepard and David Thornton top the superb supporting cast.This is a film, she will want to buy and she will probably want to play during the Sunday afternoon football game. You will definitely cry if you are a woman, a Russian, or just trying to show her that you have a soft, sensitive side.This is a great story. Take note."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I loved the story of The Notebook! The plot was fantastic and filled with deep, sincere emotion. Nicolas Sparks uses a lot of visual imagery within this book, which helps you to visualize everything that is going on. Be prepared! This is a tear-jerker. I have never cried when reading any book - before this one. The emotion is so raw and so real that you experience the same feelings as the characters.I would have given this story 5 stars, but I feel as if the story was lacking. The book was very short, a quick read. I feel as if a lot was left out and the story need further substance. Also, I do not like Sparks style of writing. He doesn't switch lines when a different characters dialogue begins. To some it may not be a big deal, but I found it hard to keep up with WHOM was saying WHAT. I've never seen the movie; however, I'm disappointed to say that the movie may actually be better than the book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks is the flame of love. I think I speak for all women when I say I don't speak for all women. So let me speak from the heart: I heart Sparks, Nicholas.I consider \\"The Notebook\\" to be one of the best books I've ever watched on television. If you were to ask any of my friends (that is, if I had any friends to ask), they'd tell you I'm as romantic as a man whose left eye always tears up because his right eye isn't a glass eye, but rather an onion.Put it this way: If Cupid weren't a flying midget in diapers, I'd consider that myth to be about my life. Not that I'm not completely convinced it's not.But even if I were Cupid, and I probably am, I still couldn't write as romantic a story as Nicholas Sparks. He is the master of romance. And since he is the master, I am wondering if he is seeking an apprentice.Nicky, baby, if you're reading this, shoot me a heart-tipped, arrow-shaped email to therealcupid@hotmail.com. You make me swoon."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I saw the film and it had me in tears and so I thought .... lets try the bookBIG MISTAKEIt not only failed miserbaly to live up to the film and my expectations but also ruined one of the best films I've ever seen. All I can say is the script writer is an absolute genius, because he/she managed to create absolute genius from a pile of rubbish writing I wouldn't taint my compost heap with. How do you go from Dear John to this???Did Nicholas Sparks fall and hit his head??????Go out and buy the film... you will cry like a baby and enjoy it immensly, but do NOT buy the book!! it will destroy the film for you forever!!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"For the second 1/2 of the story, the ending seems so obvious that I expected surprise ending, but no. Total cheese. At least it's a short book. No more Nicholas Sparks for me."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Maybe I made a mistake but watching the movie 1st. I kept waiting and waiting to get into the book, but never did. The end just seemed wrong."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Sorry, I hate to say it, but I think the movie is way better than the book. The movie is one of my favorites, and the book just skims over the whole beginning of their relationship. I usually don't think the movie outshines the book, but in this case, I say save yourself some time and just watch the film."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"You will not hear me say this very often and I find myself in shock saying it: The movie was better than the book.Granted, I saw the movie first and read the book YEARS later but still, the movie was a great deal better. I will also say that after reading the book and comparing it with the movie they were almost two different stories because the movie was so different from the book. In good ways I might add. The movie developed the story of Noah and Allie, whereas the book skimmed over their summer romance which, in my opinion, helps the reader fall in love with the characters and experience what they experience.I gave this book a three because when separating myself from the movie, the story was OK, not great, just OK. It had it's moments were I couldn't put it down but then there were moments where it was hard to relate to how deep their feelings went due to a lack of detail in their background.This was my second Nicholas Sparks book after Dean John. I found Dear John to be better. I found the sequel to this book, \\"The Wedding\\", more entertaining. I'm sorry to say but this so far is my least favorite Nicholas Sparks story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this in its initial release in hardcover years ago. I thought, at best, that it would try to maintain the spirit of THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, which was popular at the time, while coming up with an original story.The story is original. An old man visits the hospital room of a woman with Alzheimer's, his wife of many years, and he reads her their love story. This story involves a guy named Noah Calhoun, who loved a woman named Allison when they were kids and loves her still, even though she's involved with another, more successful man now, who is himself a rather nice guy. In the past story, of course, Allison must choose between the two men.This is all pretty blase, considering that you know from the outset of the story, though the author doesn't out-and-out identify which man the old guy telling the story is. Anyone who's ever read any sort of romance novel will be able to figure out who she picks.The Alzheimer's story, which frames the other narrative, is the more interesting yet less successful aspect of this novel. It seems that whenever the old man reads Allison the history of their love, she is able to remember him and escape the cloud of her Alzheimer's. It's a nice twist on an old story, and it's touching.Then Sparks, and this was his first novel, goes and ruins everything with a third act twist that's pretty creepy, if you ask me. He gives the old man a debilitating stroke, keeping the old lovers apart until, in the final pages, he's able to return to her.Whether she remembers him, what they do and how it all works out I'll leave to the reader. I, personally, found the ending jarring, particularly when the story introducing it was nothing more than sweet and slight."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is one of his second best novels. I read Message in A Bottle and it was excellent. He is a very intuitive writer and very deep coming from a man's perspective. He tugs at the heart strings but also shows much caring and love in his writing. I have had a similar situation in my own life but not everything is the same..."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Am I the only one? I thought this book was one of the worst I have ever read! It was written so badly that it was embarrassing to read. It was so cliched, so unimaginative, so awkward! If this was a bestseller it should be proof that anyone can write a book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I haven't read the book \\"The Notebook\\" but after seeing the movie I'll definitely have to. Though the movie got bad reviews from some in newspapers, I also agree that it was life changing. It makes you realize how special love is and makes you of course want to have someone look at you the way Noah does at Allie. I saw the movie twice already and feel like I could see it over and over. It is such a compelling story that the actors carry out so realistically and beautifully...hopefully someday we all find a Noah..."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is an emotional up and down roller coaster ride for those willing to take it. I found it very enchanting and was moved to the point of tears towards the end of the book. However, I found the plot line very surface-level, and with no depth whatsoever. In fact, some of the characters just seems to be too perfect. Innocent Noah who's first love is Allie and loves her unconditionally and perhaps too naively, and Allie who is the carefree albeit somewhat spoiled young woman. The story comes to a tumultuous decision when Allie must decide for herself to be with her childhood love or the man who she is engaged too. To me, this seems a bit trite and overused. The storyline is seen in movies all over the place, and in books. As a result, I have my doubts on this Hollywood like book.Nevertheless, this is a good airplane book because in an airplane one is often distracted by other people. But if you miss a page or two in this book you're able to continue on without a problem."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks always needs to have someone die to make a poignant romance. It's quite sad, really.And Noah was the most unrealistic character ever. NO GUY acts or talks like that."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Reminded me of a love I once shared.......... that I still dream about to this day......and can't seem to forget.

The plot was... wait... what plot? Character development was no where to be seen. Descriptive passages so boring I wanted to stick a fork in my eye to breakup the boredom... I kept reading thinking it might get better, in the end I was skipping whole sections just to finish. The idea is a great one, if only the story that went along with it was remotely interesting or made sense.Hard to believe Warner Brothers paid him a million dollars for this book.

I was prepared for a mushy love story when I opened the novel, but this is not just a mushy love story. It's also a poor example of prose, incredibly cliche, difficult to believe, and BORING. I hated this book. I consider it to be one of the worst that I've ever read, and I've read a lot of bad books (romance novels anyone?). The writing is terrible, in my opinion. Every so often, Nicholas Sparks throws in a shining metaphor or completely true observation on life, but more often, he writes in very simple sentences that left me wanting for more. As for being cliche, the description of Noah on the front porch of his plantation with his three-legged dog is laughable! I mean, c'mon!! Nicholas Sparks' characters were highly unbelievable. The ending is okay, but still unbelievable, and it did nothing to move me. Reading this would have been a waste of my time had I anything better to do that night. I recommend this only as a joke, or if you're a complete sucker for over-the-top sentimental drivel."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Predictable love story, no depth, over the top mushy love story.

I'm not the type to read books, only when compelled to like after watching the notebook, i read the book versiongoing into the book, there were no surprises for me in terms of plot. probably the best thing about the book was you get to find out little tid bits of the characters. And some of the letters read were pretty good. but other than that, there wasn't too much i liked. the book centered around a 2 day period, (which is a later scene in the movie and wasnt that bad since that scene was one i enjoyed a lot in the film), with references to the summer. i wanted more of the summer romance because i do not think the book provides much in the way of why they split up. it does take care of logistics, how come she never wrote back, addresses changed, etc. the movie does it so much better. I like movie version Noah much better too and Allie is pretty much the same. And movie version of Allie's mom is better. Basically, I just kept going back to the movie, which isn't a good thing.There were more dissappointments than highlights, but it isn't all bad, as it kept my interest (even though i knew the plot) and i finished it in one sitting, about 3 hours."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book is most beautiful, I thought it was perfect, Not many books can make tears come to my eyes, this one did more than once, I also have watched the movie, just as grand.Let me also recommend another book,Poetry that holds, stories untold, another tear jerker..."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is the first Sparks novel I've ever read; I chose it because the movie is currently in theaters and I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie. To give you an idea of how quickly you can read this book, I started it on a Friday night, and in an hour I had already read more than half of it. I finished it the next evening.At first I didn't know how I would like the story, because I wasn't really happy about Allie's decision to leave her fianc&eacute; at home and go see Noah, her long-lost love of 14 years before. I knew what was going to happen, and I felt sorry for the fianc&eacute;. However, it could have been worse: she could have waited until after they were married to go back to Noah and cheat on her husband. By the end of the story, I had forgiven Allie and was happy that she made the decision she did.The last half of this novel was my favorite. The love that Noah has for Allie is beautiful, as evidenced by the way he takes care of her day in and day out, even though she doesn't know who he is. I think I cried throughout the entire second half of the story because Noah's dedication and obvious love for his wife was overwhelming. I was so moved by the fact that Noah believed he could affect his wife's condition by reading their love story to her each and every day.This story will convince you of the power of true love, and will hopefully inspire you to seek a deeper, more meaningful relationship with your own loved ones. I found myself wondering how a man (Sparks) could write such a beautiful, touching story of love. I look forward to reading more of his novels."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I love this storyline about teen lovers re-united many years later. Noah is a man haunted by his love for a girl he knew long ago named Allie. Yet, 14 years later she reads about him in a newspaper and goes to find him. However, Allie is engaged. She's done what every Southern girl is traditionally programmed by momma to do--find a money man, in this case a lawyer named Lon. But when she becomes re-united with Noah, the old love is re-kindled right away. This story and even aspects of the writing have flaws, but the strengths far outweigh them and make this a very, very commercially appealing novel that will move many hearts. This tearjerker is a beautifully rare love story.David Rehakauthor of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"If ever there were a clear example of what twin souls are, it's Allie and Noah in Nicholas Sparks' &quot;The Notebook.&quot; As an expert on soul mate phenomenon, I was floored when I read this book, as every single one of the twin soul characteristics are in there. The book will make you cry definitely; I had to put it down five times and go back after wiping tears. Sparks has a very unique writing style and one in which I admire. Set in the old south, the story of Allie and Noah will keep you entranced as they rekindle a love that never went away. The whole twin soul experience is clearly defined as Sparks recounts how the love never dies, but is put through tests over time. If it were easy being twin souls, everyone would be one, wouldn't they? A clearly remarkable book and one in which will stay with me for a long time. I will definitely use its' example when explaining to people that soul mates do exist."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks is an amazing author.

It made me realize that true is a never-ending story and that it can only be found once in a lifetime. Even though Allie and Noah have fights they work through it and their love grows stronger. This should encourage couples everywhere to work through their disagreements because true love conquers all. I give Nicholas Sparks two thumbs up for this moving and touching story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks has outdone himself again in this wonderfully romantic love story, The Notebook. Its two main characters, Noah Calhoun and Allie Nelson were sweethearts in their late teens one summer when Allie's family decided it was time to move away. With a promise of undying love, the two part and live on their totally separate lives. As time grows, Allie becomes the socialite society taught her to be while Noah wanders aimlessly. The two finally meet up again in an odd twist of fate and their love begins to grow anew. But this isn't possible for them to be together again as Allie has become engaged to the states most popular families son, the lawyer Jon Hammond Jr. Caught between the two men she loves Allie is forced to make a decision that will follow her the rest of her life, while Noah can only wait patiently and try to help her remember the spark they had once and still shared. This is such a riveting story I could hardly put it down. Not only does it have the power to make it's readers laugh one minute then cry the next, but it's descriptive detail is so real you can almost imagine you were there as either Noah or Allie, running in the rain or walking barefoot in the grass. I recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys a good love story and has enough time on their hands for when they do not want to put this book down."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I recently read this book because I loved the movie and figured the book was probably better, as is usually the case. Turns out I was absolutely right. This book is probably the most romantic and heart breaking book I have ever read. Sparks does an excellent job of capturing the emotional aspect of Alzeheimer's and how it affects the family and friends of its victims, and in this story he shows the power of a great love and the heartache caused by this devastating disease. I thought the movie was sad enough, but the last two chapters of this book had be in tears. Great read and I would definitely reccommend it to EVERYONE."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is the first Nicolas Sparks book that I \`ve read. Knowing that he's famous for romantic books, I came in with high expectations. The book surprisingly was very well written with detail and in depth imagery, that allows the reader to imagine the story It's a love story between two people, Allie and Noah. A story that shows the test of love, and how much this couple actually love each other. Its very dramatic and full of pain, the reader cries along with the characters. The writing style of Sparks is very appealing to women, because he never over dramatizes the female character, but rather makes Allie stronger and smart. There were many scenes that I found to be very powerful and heartwarming but the one scene that every reader remembers is; the scene when Allie visits Noah after a long period of time. He takes her on a boat, and they go through a lake, while there it starts to rain. This scene is very romantic because they obviously love each other and when it rains, it adds another element that many find romantic. This was a very romantic novel and I would recommend this novel to anyone that wants to enjoy a love story"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is defiantly a favorite of mine. I saw the movie first, and I would have to say the book is much better. I've read it about six times because it's just such a good book. The book contains so much detail that you actually feel like you're there with the characters. You can picture Noah, the protagonist, as he grows older. You see Allie with her curls and bright smile walk up to Noah in the first scene. She's shy and girly, and Noah is bold and brave. The two share an amazing life together, but only after many dramatic years apart. The Notebook, written by Nicholas Sparks, is one of my favorite books for many reasons. It's a romantic drama and makes you feel warm inside. When the characters laugh, you laugh. When the characters cry, you cry. You feel their pain and their happiness. Sparks is an amazing writer because of all these things. I'm sure there are many interpretations of the theme of this book, but the theme that stuck out most to me would be, what's meant to be will always find its way. This may sound a little clich&eacute;, but that's exactly how the book makes me feel. After reading this book I guess you could say it gives you hope and faith that everything will work out for the best. Nicholas Sparks writes a compelling introduction and after the first chapter you can't put the book down. If you liked the movie, I would defiantly recommend reading the book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"i read this book up until the point he reunited with allie and then felt the story was over. when it jumped to them being in the nursing home and her not remembering him i lost focus and was bored. i honestly could not read on and put the book away. maybe i need to try again since it has such great reviews i don't know. i will NOT however see the movie as that definitely ruins the whole book reading experience since hollywood loves to change things so as too seem appealing to more people. not my favorite nicholas sparks book but still have NOT given up on him either as i have read quite of few of his that i just loved and will read again."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was my first Nicolas Sparks novel. I'll start out by saying that the novel is definately one that somehow intrigued me to go one reading, and it definately made me cry throughout the last half of it. I felt that this was a really good concept and the story line was also pretty good. However, this book was really lacking in a lot of areas. I felt that there were so many places where Sparks could have really delved in and captured a great moment, but instead of embelishing on these parts, he was very brief. There was never a chance to really enjoy something going on in the book because as soon as you got into the moment, he would hurry and switch to the next subject. I felt like his descriptions were vague and cliche...I don't like a writer to tell me what something looks like...I want to be able to see it for myself and also I want to be able to hear whats going on and smell the scents around me...his descriptions needed more depth. I thought the dialouge was very unrealistic...there were many places where I had to really try hard to laugh because the dialouge was so corny. I did enjoy the characters of Noah and Allie, but I didn't think either character was very well developed throughout the tale. This was a really easy read...it took me about 2-3 hours, and I enjoyed the reading, but I did feel that there was so much more than Sparks could have done with this story, and it just didn't live up to my expectations."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The best love story ever!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book shows true love! I usually don't waste my time reading ANY fiction BUT a friend bought it for me. I am ever so glad he did! When reading the book, I felt as if I was Noah's friend, watching from a close corner, and seeing / hearing everything going on. It was as if I could walk over and speak to him at any given point. This was mainly because the book is somewhat predictable (except with Ali's fiance) and also because I am from NC and can clearly visit, in my mind, most of the places mentioned as if I'd been there before. Towards the end of the book, when they were in the nursing home I would of liked to see two things: One, a better perspective from Ali's point on the internal confusion and panic of having altzhemiers and two, a more realistic view of the nursing facility. The book made the nursing home seem too pleasant. All in all I would encourage you to read this book. You won't be sorry unless you are the pessimistic type with a heart the size of a pea. I am buying the cassette now!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book in one night...it was extremely good I thought until I reached the last chapter. The love story was going so well and could've ended a lot quicker than it did. I feel that he dragged out the ending for more pages. I loved the book otherwise, I just think that he could've made the ending a lot shorter and less involved."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"It happens to me all the time. . .I read &quot;translated in 23 languages&quot;, and think that I am about to buy something brilliant (or at least well written). What I read was the product of an amazing marketing campaign. I did not laugh or cry, I simply shook my head over what a sucker I was to spend my money and a two hour plane trip on a sappy, shallow novel."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was a very boring read. A lot of words without saying anything. A bit too unbelievable."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"How this manuscript even got published in the first place is a miracle. Truly. This book is an inspiration for any aspiring writer because it shows you that almost anything can get published and marketed these days. It uses every cliche in the book and breaks about every rule about writing fiction. &quot;I love you, Allie.&quot; &quot;I love you, too.&quot; This is dialogue that is supposed to move me? Cardboard characters, weak plotting, trite suspense devices. At least Bridges of Madison County (another terrible book, but a good movie) had some confrontation scenes to make the characters seem somewhat believable. Allie is as aspiring artist, Noah likes to sit on the porch. These are the ONLY &quot;qualities&quot; these characters have. Using Alzheimer's to put a &quot;spin&quot; on the cliched plot can't be called anything other than a disgrace."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A GUY recommended I read this. I'm a chick. I read it. Wanted to barf during the ordeal. Bad dialog. Trite, to say the least. Tried other Sparks novels (I mean, after all, the guy's a bestseller! Millions are reading his books!) What I learned after trying a few others: either I have zero taste, or millions of others have zero taste. Ha-ha, take your pick! If you're an ardent Sparks fan, sorry for offending....not."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A recipe for The Notebook.Take two bland, perfect leads. Make them fall into a young syrupy love. Throw in a touch of class separation in the South. Age them enough to be world weary and to have accumulated another obstacle to their love. Overcome obstacle. Get old and forgetful. End the book with geriatric sex.Induce vomiting.[...]"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I couldn't agree more with those individuals who gave this book a 1 star rating. If I could give it a no star rating I probably would. I was actually very upset with myself for spending 4 or 5 of my hard earned dollars simply to buy this waste of paper. I could have spent that money on a latte and I could have better spent my time doing something fun and productive. Really really awful writing- it's very trite, bland, and repetitive. Seriously, I think Sparks probably could have made this a ten page book if he had taken out all the cheesy love stuff and just gotten right to the point. I like a good love story, but this was definitely not it. This book was pretty much a pathetic excuse for a romance novel. Oddly enough, I adored the movie. The movie made me want to read the novel. And on most occasions, isn't the novel supposed to surpass the movie in quality? Not so in this case. Just wanted to vent because this was easily the worst book I have ever read, no exaggerations. I really don't understand how this was published. If you like an easy (and I mean 3rd grade reading level easy- no insult intended to 3rd graders) read and don't mind corny and emotionally unfulfilling writing, then this may be your kind of book. Otherwise, just rent the movie."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I absolutely adored this book. It moved me in ways that I had never felt before. The love between these two people was so extraordinary, I'd like to think that this is what &quot;love&quot; is all about. I have recommended this book to everyone I know. I even wrote a letter to the publisher (something I had never done before) and they were nice enough to take an excerpt from my letter to use in a New York Times ad for the book. Read this book it will touch your heart like no other book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The book told such a touching story. I was deeped moved and inspired by the true love that two people could share. It made me feel good about life. Wish there are more good stories like that in real life."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was just looking for a quick, easy read and found a little book that made me feel like I had gone through 50 years with Noah &amp; Allie. I also suggest reading the last chapter ALONE with a box of Kleenex - What A Book!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks was a captivating love story that lasted a lifetime. I enjoyed this book emensley. I have shared it with everyone I know. I have read all of his works since. Thay are a quick read, but enjoyable all the same."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Couldn't put this one down. Sparks' characters are so real, so genuine. Their dialogue is never unbelievable, their love story is timeless. You will fall for these lovers from the moment you begin the book. I especially loved the fact that it was told from the perspective of an elderly man looking back on his one true love. If you are young, you can learn something about true love from this story, that it truly will hit you out of the blue and will grab onto your heart and soul, never letting go if it's truly meant to be. I shared this one with a friend and she finished it in one sitting!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Two years ago my teacher recomended this book to me. After reading it. I convinced three other people. Now the total has reached twenty. I love this book I couldn't it put it down. Even after reading it five times. This book still has the power to make me cry."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I just want to let the author know how he touched my heart with this love story. I could not put it down. I started it that evening and finished it at 2:00am. It was the most touching story. He has a way with words and details. It is a great love story but so sad that age comes to all but that true love will indure through it all. Thank you for this tear renching book that lets us know love is alive."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nothing really happens in this book. It reads like a high school student assignment. The end has a touching aspect to it which brought it up from a one-star review to a two-star review. If there's bad weather at the beach and it's the only book there, go ahead and read it. If, however, you have the choice to do anything else with the precious moments in your life, do that instead. There are better love stories."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I'm not sure what the big deal here is especially knowing that this has been a popular best-seller. This is one (long) declaration of love that leads us to a non-existent crescendo. A disappointing, but thankfully short and easy read."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Awful. Silly. I can stand a predictable story line if the writing is good, but this was the pits. If this guy actually considers himself an author, then I'm Ernest Hemingway. I got the book as a gift. I may never forgive the friend that did this to me!!!!! This book is an insult!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Well, I read this book a year ago at the hospital where I was a PCW caring for the elderly. When I read this book I couldn't help but look around and compare the couple in this book to real live couples in the home-hospital that I was working in. I want to be like Noah and have a love so strong in my marriage like he had with Allie in his someday. I hope to make it 60 years plus like these guys. I cried during this book. It really touched my heart. The love between a man and a woman so many years into it. Just touching."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"\\"The Notebook\\" is the best love story. A North Carolina man named Noah Calhoun and his wife Allie live in an extended care facility called Creekside. Allie suffers from Alzheimer's disease. Each day Noah reads to his wife from a notebook he composed himself about their love for one another. For just a glimmer of time Allie becomes lucid although not for long. Through the notebook, Noah does what he enjoys the most in life... falling in love with his wife...over and over again."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Wow! This is a great book! If you are looking for a novel with literary merit, this is not it, but a good heart wrenching story, this is the one! The Notebook is a classic fairy-tale, love overcomes all. The majority of the book takes place in the past and is being read out of a notebook. After Noah and Allie fell in love, they were separated for fourteen years. Upon meeting again, Allie (engaged to an attorney) and Noah's love was rekindled. Falling in love with Noah was a complete \\"no, no\\" for Allie because of societal pressure put on her by her family and friends to marry for \\"class.\\" Allie loves both Lon and Noah, thus she is faced with the ultimate decision of who to pick, the stable sensible one or the laid back anything goes man. Sparks keeps the reader wondering until the very last chapter. Personally I cried, but tears do not always imply sorrow. This novel is a true romance novel, full of tragedy and hope that love will and does concur all."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks is a good book! It portrays a love that holds two lives in its spell through time. Though it lacked in substance &amp; character depth, it was very detailed which made it easy reading. This book proves that love is the key, and with it you can concur all. I recommend this book to everyone, especially to those who have been in a long relationship. This book will help you express emotion that's been kept bottled up inside of you. The second part is the most meaningful becuase it points out that you should live your life to the fullest with the ones you love because one day all might be forgotten."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"As a first time Nicholas Sparks reader, I was very impressed with The Notebook. It is a timeless love story between two very passionate people, Noah and Allie, who once again find love after fourteen years of separation. Snags catch their hearts though, one being that Allie is currently engaged to a dependable lawyer whom she does love, but not like Noah. Throughout the novel the reader is left with the question of who Allie chooses and must read to the very last chapter to find out the ending to the story. Almost fairy-tale like in nature, the story proves how resilient love can be. If you're looking for a romantic love story, and don't mind a novel that plays with your emotions, The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks is a great place to start. I will definitely read some more of Sparks' books after the wonderful experience I had with this one."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks, fantastic book!! I would advise anyone to read it. It starts off in a nursing home, a little strange for a romance story. Then the end of the book returns to the nursing home which explains it all. This is the story of a man and woman who experience something so powerful, so real they never forget it. All throughout their daily lives they looked for that certain aspect in every individual they dated, but sadly they could not find it. Until one day Allie spots where Noah is and she heads off in his direction. They meet and sparks fly. Who does Allie chose? her fianc&eacute; or her one true love. You'll have to read and see!! Great book!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Everyone, doesn't matter who, we all read books at one time or another. Whether you have someone read it to your or you read it yourself, you have heard one. I'm here to tell you about a certain book I read. The book is called The Notebook. The author of The Notebook is Nicholas Sparks.The main characters in The Notebook are Noah and Allie. Noah is very kind, sensative, strong, hardworking, and he is also a poet. Allie is very outgoing, kind, has a sense of humor, and is intelegent. The two meet one summer when Allie comes to North Carolina where Noah lived on summer vacation. They meet at a fair when their friends introduce them. Immediatly they hit it off. They spent the whole summer together, and very much liked each other. They both lost their virginity that summer. Although Allie's mother didn't like her and Noah being together Allie ignored her mother's wishes and continued to see him anyway. Sometimes she would even sneak out to see him. The summer came to an end and Allie had to go back home. Noah tried sending Allie letters but he never got one back so eventually he just stopped sending them. Fourteen years later Noah was restoring an old home and it was posted in the newspaper. Allie saw it two weeks before she was about to get married and decided she had to see him again. So she went to visit him and told her soon to be husband ,Lon,that she just had to get away and go shopping or something, and he let her go. Allie and Noah fell very much in love all over again, but when it was time for Allie to return home she was faced with a very difficult decision. She did come to a decision though, and spent the rest of her life with the man she very deeply loved. A love so great that nothing could tear it apart, even a love to create a miracle.Literary elements used in The Notebook are Imagery because its almost like you were there when you were reading it. How the author describes the beautiful place they were in you can almost imagine yourself there. It also had a Surprise ending which I thought was very interesting with how everything worked out in the book.I think this book was really good. I would recomend it to someone who likes love storys. I thought the ending was extremely good and it couldn't have been better.Now that you have an idea about The Notebook, you should read it. It's very interesting and is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"One can't help but fall in love with two main characters in The Notebook, Noah and Allie. Nicholas Sparks does an outstanding job of showing their thoughts and feelings. He wrote of the love that Noah and Allie shared with such passion, that you almost feel jealous that they had a love that strong. The characters seemed like old friends, ones that you share memories with. The Notebook was a beautiful, alomost haunting love story that wont be forgotten by it's readers."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I love Nicholas Sparks. This book is one of his best!!!!!!!!! I would recommend that you read it no matter what kind of books you like because you could learn from it!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is the second of Nicholas Sparks' books that I had read, and it vastly surpassed the first. I had read &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; before, and while the story in that one was touching, the writing was juvenile and I just didn't care for it. Nevertheless I decided to read this one, and I'm glad I did. I have never cried so much from a book before. It isn't terribly accurate about the medical end of things, but if I wanted that I'd pick up a textbook. Its a powerful, albeit short, story of the power of love and what it could do for another. I would definately read this book again in the future, and think that anyone who has read another Sparks book should give this one a try."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A light romantic book that should be read in one sitting with a glass of favorite wine. Just an enjoyable experience. I want to marry either Nicholas Sparks or D.M. Roman (the author of Fried Calamari who shows great insight into a woman's mind)."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The love story in this book is touching, and even though it is written to pull at your heart strings, it's also believable. It's nice to have a story that is not cynical about true love"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I am not much of a reader. I can read, and love to when I do it but I don't make a good habit of it. This book was suggested to me by a &quot;friend&quot; in the midst of a unusual relationship. Love stories usually conjure up in me trashy romances. NOT THIS ONE! This love story is true and pure. It talks of commitment, choice, and lasting love. It talks of how marriages and families and children should be. It speaks to the heart and the mind. In reading this book, it has not only helped me understand love and life better, but has saved what I thought was a failed marriage. I owe my marriage and the sure future of it in part to Nicholas Parks. It has given me the mature understanding of love I have ever had, and has allowed me to re-unite us in a way that couldn't have been done before. I have recommended this book to EVERYONE. If I have my way, it will be back up on the charts again! After loaning this book to someone in Canada, I am getting another copy for my wife to read. Thanks!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks(aka. Noah) might be a poetry reader, but he surly is not a poetry writer. The writing is dull, pendandic,and downright boring. The whole book is so simplistic I am appalled at what the good reviews it has received say about the American reading public."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A thoughtful and beautiful tale told from a man's perspective through the thick and thin of his relationship. Makes you believe in happily ever after again."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book in almost 1 day, and cried for the last 60 pages or so. The book brings so much emotion to the text. The basis of the story, with every encounter of their life in the Notebook is a wonderful idea to remember every moment of your life with someone. The book is a wonderful book!!!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A real page turner on how Noah's love for Allie continues even when they are separated and reunited. It's nice to know that a man sticks by you and loves you even as Altzeimers attacks Allie. In good and bad till death do they part sums it up best."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is one of the best books I have read. The writing is so vivid and passionate. I have passed it on to five others and they whole-heartedly agree. Thank you Nicholas."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"&quot;You are, and always have been, my dream.&quot; What a powerful tale of undying love..... if only we could all experience a love as Noah and Allie did. To see such passion through the eyes of a man ..... as both the main character and the writer.... I had tears in my eyes throughout the whole book. I have read Message In A Bottle also and am looking forward to Nicholas Sparks' next novel."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Sparks creates an unforgettable tale of the persistence of love in a unique style that anyone can enjoy. Through this story of reunited childhood friends, Sparks creates characters and emotions that are genuine, rather than polished. This is not your ordinary inflated love story, but rather one that truly captures the magical bond between two people."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read the novel and saw the movie. It's a really touching story. I wish I have my own romance like theirs in my life."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"If you have not read this book or seen the movie, do it now! Read the book first though, it makes the movie even better because you are already in love with the characters. And I promise, you will fall in love."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is one of those books that you finish in like a day because you just can't put it down; you have to keep reading it. I loved this book so much and I got so excited when the movie finally came out, even though the book defiantly tops it because it goes into much more detail, that the movies seems to miss. This is one of the best love stories I have ever read, it made me laugh and cry throughout the whole story and this book has the best ending to it...it is both sad and happy, you can't not cry at the end of this book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I am a high school senior and in my English class we have independent reading and I have chosen The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks, one of my new favorites.In the opening scene an old man by the name of Noah Calhoun is in a nursing home and gets up early every morning, strolls down the hallway to a room where a woman with Altizmers stays, and he reads to her. From his notebook he tells a story of them when they were young and deeply in love.Noah and Allie were meant to be together. Allies parents did not want them to continue to see each other so her parents moved he far away. All they could think about was the summer they spent together. Years later Allie returned to Noah to tell him something that would break his heart. All that happened was a complete turn around and a change of heart after all. The first time you fall in love changes your life forever.This story is touching, very realistic, funny, and sad. I could very well relate to this story. I have also seen the movie. The Book and movie are different, so I would suggest that you read the book and the movie.I would recommend this book to teenagers, men and woman of all ages. I guarantee you, you will relate to this book also. Any other love story couldn't capture you heart like The Notebook, by a gifted novelist. The first person who takes your heart will keep it forever and even may have the power to create a miracle."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook, a novel by the very talented Nicholas Sparks, is a classic romance story that will warm your heart and leave your spirit inspired. His story takes you back to the 1950's, a controversial time of change. Noah Calhoun sees the magnificent Allie Nelson and falls in love at first sight. They spend the summer in a deep love until conflicting social classes tear them apart. Allie was wealthy, as Noah was not so well off. Years passed as the two lost lovers proceed with their lives, both with the feeling that something is missing. Now, mature adults, fate has brought them back together and the obsessions for each other begin to unfurl once again. Noah and Allie, separated by Allie's parents because of social class differences, begin their lives again. This heartwarming novel has touched me deeply and has a special place in my heart. I get chocked up every time I think about the everlasting, passionate love that Allie and Noah share, and hope someday I'll find the same love within a girl. This book is suitable for an audience of teenage years and older. This vast range of people can relate to The Notebook is some way, shape, or form. As the plot opens up, your heart will as well. The Notebook is a classic tale, if you haven't experienced the beauty yet, I ask but one question...What are you waiting for?"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book is an heartfelt, sweet, endearing story about love.

After watching this heart-wrenching movie, my eyes were red and my face was wet with the tears, however, my mother as said to me this morning used all her strength not to cry.For my birthday, I bought the book, The Notebook. I read it in about 3 hours. After reading it I felt like i had just experienced the greatest love story ever written, and I only hope these sorts of things do happen, and I can only wish they would happen to me.Nicholas Sparks truly is a remarkable man and I believe he has written the greatest love story I have ever read. I wish him success in everything he does."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I loved The Notebook. It was very romantic, but the ending was sort of bittersweet. Towards the final chapters of the book, I could NOT stop crying. It was pretty easy reading, though."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"It was a hot day in central New York, even for the first week of June. My friend Liz and I were in her living room sprawled on the floor in our tank tops and shorts trying to escape from the heat while watching television. A commercial for an upcoming movie, The Notebook, caught both of our attention and the casual conversation ceased. As the commercial ended we looked at each other and said, \\"We're seeing that!\\". After looking up the opening date on the movie homepage, we learned that it had originally been a book. At that moment we decided that we had to read the book before seeing the movie. Within the next few days we had both finished the book (neither of us seemed able to put it down) and were greatly anticipating the movie.This dramatic love story by Nicholas Sparks, inspired by his wife's parents, is about a young couple, Noah and Allie, who fall in love one summer in the 1930's, but were then separated by their parents and other circumstances out of their youthful hands. When they are reunited a few years later, the story unfolds as memories of their summer romance flood back and Allie, now engaged to a handsome and wealthy lawyer named Lon, is faced with the decision that will define the remainder of her life. This novel, which was a New York Times Bestseller for over a year, is a touching example of young love that will tug at the heartstrings of many. A quote from Noah, about his life, at the very beginning of the book is a perfect explanation of how I feel about it. \\"More ups than downs, and gradually trending upward over time.\\"This has to be one of the best books that I have ever read, and succeeded in getting me addicted to anything by Nicholas Sparks. I highly recommend reading this book, weather it's a cold winter night by the fire, or a hot August day, the magic of Nicholas Sparks will not be lost on his readers. As Noah says, \\"The romantics would call this a love story, the cynics would call it a tragedy. In my mind, it's a little bit of both...\\". No matter how you choose to view it in the end, nothing can change the fact that this is, to most, a touching and heartfelt story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"\\"The Notebook\\" is simply a love story. A deep, pure, love story. As it usually happens with love, there is a conflict, or a problem; a problem that moves the whole story. Because this book is written in a very unique and different way, it has basically two conflicts. We read a story about two different periods of time, and about people in them, and those periods interfere with each other. This novel is also unique because Nicolas Sparks wrote both in 1st person (I)-form, and in 3rd person-form.One period of time in this book is set in present, and the story starts with a scene about an elder man, in a rest home, who reads to an, also, elder woman, parts of his life that are written in a notebook. That woman happens to be his wife, who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease, and the man hopes to help her recover, anyhow, if possible...Another side of the story, that interferes with the first one, takes place in year 1946, after the War, and is about a 31-year old man, and a 29-year-old woman, that meet after 14 years. Behind themselves, they have their own lives, and other people in those lives, but something that they've shared together, long time ago, however, can not be easily forgotten.Here is the conflict that main characters, Noah and Allie have to confront: was their love something really true and strong, 14 years back, or is it still? And how strong is it? Strong enough to erase all those, now important, people in their lives, and all those years behind them...?Nicholas Sparks has given us strong and unique characters, great setting, and an interesting and different story, all in order to draw a perfect love in our minds. People change through their life, and through years, and no one is perfect. This is the way that the author presents the characters too. He has shown the way that Noah and Allie changed, emphasizing different lives that they have, 14 years after they met, and the way they themselves changed, abandoninig things they love throughout their lives. The seeting of one part of the book is in Noah's house, in New Bern, where they also had met 14 years before. The house is by the lake, it has a great sight, a lot of plants around- pure nature; which emphasises our senses, and makes the story even more romantic. The other part of the book is set in a home for old people, which brings us back to reality, to the fact that not everything is always ideal, and that bad things, such as sickness of the woman, can happen. But, even in those situations, when not everything is perfect, love is...This story is about an every-day-life, but it also shows a real, true and deep love, and how powerful it can be. It is not just like all the usual love stories that show young people in love and how their love \\"won\\". This is a story that also shows how that great love can survive, and even be greater, after so many years, even when people are so old that they can't take care of themselves, but despite that, their love just grows stronger. I suppose that there is not a lot of people who have experienced that kind of love, but I don't doubt that it exists.I have read the book and seen the movie too, but I would strongly suggest anyone who likes true love stories to better read the book first. This book is not just a book; it captures our hearts, we live the book, we live the lives that those characters live, and experience the passion and love that they experience. The person who reads this will never forget it, I'm sure..."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The book, The Notebook is a very wonderful love story and I guarantee anyone would like it! It takes place back in the early 1900's. As teenagers, Allie and Noah fall in love one summer while Allie is visiting. But Allie comes from the upper class and Noah is more in the lower. Though they don't care about this, Allie's parents do and make her go home earlier than expected.Noah writes her 365 letters, one every day for a year. But somehow Allie never recieves them. Allie gets engadged to another man but still thinks about Noah all the time. Noah does not have that much of a life and thinks about Allie everyday. In the end love brings them together.This is a great book! The author, Nicholas Sparks, uses many romantic words to set the mood and bring the story to life. The characters personalities are very intersting too. Allie is very strong and is not afraid of basically anything. I think this is weird because back then woman just kind of stood back. But Allie has a really big heart too. Noah on the other hand is shy, but he knows what he wants and he wants Allie.I recommend this book to anyone about 15 and older. This book can be a little too romantic for younger kids. Well, i don't want to ruin the book for anyone who hasen't read it so I wont say anymore."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Have you ever been in love? Not lust but the real thing? Where you would do anything for them? Well this is where The Notebook starts out. Noah and Allie are 17 years old and day by day they fall in love, more deeply than ever before. They become inseparable by every breath they take. They spent the entire summer together, laughing, crying, and just being together.Well Allie's parents did not approve of Noah. Don't get them wrong or anything just they thought that their daughter deserved better than him. So her parents packed their stuff up and took Allie away. Allie's mom heard Allie cry herself to sleep at night. Noah said he would write to Allie if he wanted to talk to her, but Allie didn't receive a single letter from him. You wonder why? If he said he would write, then why did I not get a letter from him? That's usually the question everyone asks themselves. Why? Why did I do it? Why? Why? Why? Well, maybe the letter got lost in the mail or Noah put the wrong address on it. It turns out that Allie's mom wanted Allie to move on so she took the liberty to take the letters out of the mail because she thought that it was the best thing to do for her daughter. This was hard for Noah too because he thought that she wanted to move on and go on with her life, but Noah knew that somehow he and Allie would be together one day.As hours, days, weeks, months, years gone by Noah and Allie grew apart, but one thing for sure is that their love never ended. It just kept growing deep down inside them. Just maybe one day, they would be together again. Allie moved on with her life, meeting new people, but not one man made her feels the way Noah did. So what happened? Did Noah and Allie get together some day? Did Allie move on with her life and make a family? These are some questions I asked myself while reading The Notebook. Well this is the part where you need to read this book and understand the love that Noah and Allie shared together.Some of the parts in the book that I liked the best were when Allie saw the newspaper of Noah and the house of his dreams for sale. It was just like what she told him she wanted it like and that he promised to give her one day, a big white house with blue shutters and a porch wrapped around the entire house and a room where Allie can view at the lake and paint. This is where she found that one part of her still loved Noah deep down inside and that can never go away. Another part of the story that I liked was when Allie went back to Noah's hometown and went and visited him. They talked and hung out together. Then they realized that they were still in love and always have been. The reason why I chose this book is because I saw the movie and I really liked it, so I thought I would enjoy the book too. I found out that I liked the book better because it gave you more details with where they were and learned more information on the main characters. So I think that just about anybody would like this book if they are interested in romance."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I can honestly say this is my favorite book of all. I was captivated from start to finish. I read this book for the first time a few years ago when I saw the previews for the film. I fell in love with it so much that I have since then read it many times over. Any time I am feeling sad, happy, or have just given up on the world I pull out this book and I cry, I laugh, I regain hope. I think the love that is shared between Allie and Noah is the true love that all of us look for and hope to find someday. I have also seen the movie and although I think the book is better, I was laughing and crying throughout both. Since I first read this book, Sparks has become one of my favorite authors. I have read many of his books and am always waiting for a new one to come out. I recommend this book to everyone. It helped me see what true love really is and helped me understand life, love, and how they are truly intertwined. I think anyone who gives it a chance will really love it. So I encourage everyone to laugh, cry, and find hope."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book took me away the first time I read it years ago. It wasn't too big and I read it within 2 days. I read it again before the movie came out. It was just as good the second read around. The movie is nothing to compare. Always read the book first."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is a great book, much better than the movie. Its got love, loss, sadness, underdogs, reuniting, and tradgety. It will bring tears to your eyes and will warm your soul all at once. Sparks is the master, the only love story that can compare is a walk to remember. Both are certaintly worth reading, infact your missing something if you dont read and reread both- the movie will never look as good."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book is right up there with Bridges of Madison County. A compelling love story. Well written. The arthur makes you feel the emotions. Don't read without a box of Kleenex handly. A must read."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks is one of the most greatest love stories I've ever read. This book shows how true love can never keep people who are destined to be together apart from one another. The main characters are Noak Calhoun and Allie Nelson. During there teenage years they were the most happiest couple one can be. Unfortunately Allie's mother felt that her daughter shouldn't be with him. According to Allie's mother Allie was supposed to seek for someone who was in the uppermost social status group. Noah is not rich, but is loving and kind. Allie and Noah's relationship went down the drain when Allie's mother sent her off to college.I enjoyed this book very much. My most favorite part is when Allie goes to visit Noah after many years and finds him looking the same as if he didn't move on. She told Noah that she was engaged and felt bad afterwards. My least favorite part of this book is when Allie's mother finds out that she is in Noah's house and tells Allie's fiancee. I felt that her mother had no business in that, if Allie wanted to keep it as a secret that would be her business.The best quote from this book is when Allie says,\\"Please don't be angry on days I do not remember you, and we both know they will come know that I love you, that i always will...\\" This shows that even though both of their lives are at an end because of her illness. She wants him to understand that she loves him and always will. The ending of the book left me with alot of suspense because Noah goes into Allie's room to see her and she actually remembers who he is. Will she soon forget like always? I guess one will know unless you make up the ending yourself."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook, the original that inspired the movie, is breathtaking. It's so romantic without getting to mushy. When I picked this book up I couldn't put it down. I would say, hands down, that I love the book more. The movie does have some similarites, but there's nothing like the original. The Notebook is just a real fairy tale without it being too fictional, the events you would believe that it's possible that it will happening somewhere, and praying that it will happen to you one day. I have to say when I was through with this book I kind of fell for the character Noah Calhoun."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I haven't seen the movie yet but this book is one of my favourites. Nicholas Sparks is a wonderful author, and anytime I read his books, I'm surprised that the story is written by a man. There is so much passion in it and it's really heart warming."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was among one of few English books I can find where I live. It was the best find I could ever hope for. The story was heartwarming and uplifting. In it's few pages it had me sobbing one moment and laughing outload the next. It was wonderful. Pure and simple. It touched basic emotions and I can't wait to read it again."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Man! What a book!!! I thoroughly enjoyed reading the &quot;notebook&quot;. The lyrical beauty and honesty reflected by Nicholas Sparks is too wonderful to be described. As I read the book, it was not only a love story but also a beautiful reminder for everyone to appreciate the simple things in life."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book is about a man who really loves a woman. He will do anything for her. She loves him too but her life and his life do not match because she lives in the city and he lives in the county. They both had completly differnt life styles. They shared an incredible summer together and they will never forget that, but she has to leave him and they don't know if they will ever see each other agian. I enjoyed this book, but i thought it was kind of slow. It took forever to get the point across, but other then that the book was very romatic. I recommend this book to people who enjoy reading love stories because this is a book about true love. I think this book was worth reading because it was interesting, even though i thought it was slow some of the parts just wants you to keep on reading the book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book for my college literature class (don't ask me why). We had a debate at the end of the course as to whether this was really literature. About 75% of the class said it was and the other quarter, denied any connection between Shakespeare and Sparks. It is a sentimental story and is great if you like that mushy-gushy type romance."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I don't think anyone is going to confuse Nicholas Sparks and Shakespeare, but reading this warm tender romance is a perfect way to spend an afternoon. Although the book is predictable and sticky sweet, I truly enjoyed becoming lost in the North Carolina landscape and dreaming that I could be with a man like Noah. People who think this is a low grade of literature should stop fooling themselves into thinking that literature is so cut and dry. Kudos to Nicholas Sparks for keeping America reading."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"How could Nicholas Sparks possibly know what it is like to see yourself and your spouse deteriorate with age? This book made me cry so much I had to put it down often to get control of myself. I look around and see all our friends, and us, struggling to live with a myriad of physical and mental problems like Noah and Allie. So, forget the romance, which is lovely, and read this book for the insight about ageing."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was a great read for everyone out there who who is intelligent enough to know that every book you read doesn't have to be in the same league as Shakespeare. I feel sorry for the people who said this book was too sticky sweet. SO WHAT! Make your dentist appointment read it and stop patting yourself on the back and thinking your a literary critic. If so you just mind find that you actually do have a heart. Kudos to Sparks for writting something that makes the American public feel good. We need more of it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK!!! I would have to label this as my very favorite! It touches every piece of the human soul, and it proves that true love really does exist for all time."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have visited New Bern many times and to see the city come to life and the story of love take such pivotal turns just makes it impossible to put the book down. I read the entire thing in 2 hours. Well worth the $6 for all of those people who seem to lack a heart or any sense of emotion. This love story beats anything I have ever read, including Romeo and Juliet. Sparks is a master of emotion, both male and female. How often do you find a man who can write both sides of the gender. All I know is I would love to be Alli (all but the illness part )and I am forever in search of Noah!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have never cried at something I have either read or watched before in my life. This has to be the best book I have ever read, and beats any movie I have ever seen! I checked the book out of the library and then I went out and bought if for myself. I'm reading it again and now so are all my friends!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Overall, I liked the book and I read it in one straight sitting of about 3 hours. However, I did at times find the book to be overly sentimental and over the top at some points. Sometimes I just wanted to scream OK I GET IT THEY LOVE EACH OTHER MORE THAN ANYTHING LETS NOT DWELL ON IT! Too sappy at some points but i would recommend the novel."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I saw previews for the movie during CMT's Top 20 Video Countdown and I looked up more about the movie online. When I found out it was a book too I bought the book and read it. It was a wonderful book! I cried through the whole last chapter because it was so beautifully sad. It's a strange emotion! I strongly reccomend the book to anyone who's up for a good romantic book! It's like a chick flick book!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is a major tear jerker. I bought the book, took it home, and decided I'd read a little as I was going to bed. I ended up reading the whole book through from start to finish, only putting it down to wipe the tears from my eyes or get MORE tissue. It is a love story that touches the soul. A treat. I was so involved in the story I just didn't want to put it down and interrupt the mood of the story. I can't wait to read The Wedding, which is the follow up to The Notebook."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks' &quot;The Notebook&quot; is a stunning tale of love lost and found, and a romance proving that true love has the power to conquer all. It confirms that love, passion and devotion are able to blossom and thrive in the hearts of any person at absolutely any age. The novel is extremely well-written. Sparks, somehow, is able to effortlessly spellbind the reader with such dazzling images and sparkling word choice. The characters we quickly grow to love as if we've known them forever magically come to life. The diction paints colorful, vivid images inside the reader's mind, and will capture the hearts of all who read it. The pages turn far too quickly, making this magical, miraculous love story a one-night read. It will pull at your heartstrings and without question, make you cry. An extraordinary tale that will stay with you--always. A must-read!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I am not averse to sappy love stories, but the film's trailer gave hint to a melodrama I thought I would rather do without. After a brief hesitation, I suggested to my wife that we see the film. The story was predictable and not exactly original, neither of which kept me from crying. I think the story (which I assume, based on the reviews, is even more vivid in the book) will appeal to married couples, to elderly folks who have lost their spouse, and to any romantic who still appreciates a good love story. The one appealing part of the film, which steers away from previous stories of the same genre, is that Noah and Allison are not free from disagreements in their relationship. On the contrary, Sparks makes sure to highlight the extreme disagreements in the relationship. The objective is to show that if you love someone enough, you work at resolving your differences. There is no such thing as a perfect relationship.This story is a fine example of entertainment that is infused with heart, and enough reality that you can relate to the characters. (Who doesn't think about growing old with your loved one, and the issues that come with old age?)"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"this book can be read in one day, and you won't want to put it down. now that it is being adapted into a movie version, I hope the actors can capture the passion and intense relationship that Noah and Allie have for one another."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"amazing AMAZING no other words can describe it ... i am a teen and i normally am not into this type of book but this book is amazing you comeout of it thinking o i want my life to be like that it was funny, heartwarming and heartbreaking to see the man(dont wanna give away the ending) love the woman so much (who has alztemeriers) and she cant remeber and then the love between noah and allie is so amazing but the one thing that i didnt like was that it was SO short i would have loved for him to spend more time explaining the summer and how they came back together but still its WAS amazing i mean he isnt the best writer but still with a story liek this u cant go wrong, its an easy summer read so i HIGHLY recommed it!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I'm really surprised by the amount of criticism by people who scoff at this book's simplicity. A book doesn't have to be longer than the Bible in order to be a touching read. Nor does it have to go into hours of drab detail and boring history in order to be satisfying.I found this book to be spectacularly moving. It touches on both the hardships of love in youth, and love in old-age. Yes, the book is small and is an easy read. (At approx. 200 pages, I woofed it down in about 3 hours.) But few books grip me enough so that I feel compelled to actually read 3 hours straight. Even if it had been 6 hours long, I think I would've finished it in one sitting.Despite what haughty 'literites' may tell you, the book is moving. It has changed my perspective on the elderly,... I now see them in a different light. You see history. You see love.Do be careful where you read this, though. I made the mistake of buying the e-book and reading it at work. I had to fake allergies to cover the fact that I was teary-eyed most of the afternoon.If you're looking for a great book to kick off your summer, I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I absolutely LOVED this book! I got it because I saw the preview for the movie and wanted to read it. I wasn't disappointed! I just hope they don't change this one as much as they changed &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot;.I finished this one this afternoon...it took me less than 24 hours because I could just not put it down (until sleep got the better of me). I'm actually starting it again...I enjoyed it that much! I can't wait to get the sequel, &quot;The Wedding&quot;."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is truly a romantic love story. It is one of the best books that Nicholas sparks has ever written and I have read them all. It is just a beautifully well written novel. It is easy to get through and enjoyable. The ending is compelling. I could read it over and over again."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The NotebookThe notebook starts off with an old man telling a story to another girl who falls madly in love with each other. The girl in the story is named Allie. The boy is named Noah. They were never apart. Allies mother didn't approve of Noah though. She thought he was too low class. He wouldn't support Allie like a high-class suitor would. For that, she moved them away from him. Over the years, Allie went to college, worked as a nurse to help the soldiers in war. She met a man who was wealthy and her mother and father approved. She was then engaged to him.When Noah and Allie were together, Allie told Noah about her dream house. He built it while she was away, still madly in love with her. After it was built he got his picture taken for the newspaper (along with the house). Allie saw him and freaked out. She decided to go back and see how he was. At first they were merely friends, but they both knew they had missed each other. They gave in and had a passionate love affair. She went back to her fianc&eacute;, but realized she really did love Noah, and that money wasn't everything. They lived in their house and were happy. In her later years she began to loose her memory so Noah tells her this story of him and her. They both die at then end lying together on the same bed; forever in love.*This book is passoinate and moving. A wonderful womans romance."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was my first Sparks book and I loved it. It is a quick read. I read the entire book on a flight and the other passengers probably thought I had lost my mind as the book moved me to tears on the plane ride."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"After I heard about the movie I was interested in the book. Because I had seen \\"A Walk to Remember\\" and had loved it. So I bought this book and I got wrapped up in it so easily. It is about these two people, Noah and Allie, who fall in love. But they are only together for one summer. Then Allie moves away. Years pass, Noah goes to war and does a lot of other things. Allie is engaged to a lawyer and she wanted to see Noah (her first love) on last time. She goes back to North Carolina where Noah lives and sees him. They talk and end up falling in love all over again.Don't wanna give away the whole story, so I'll stop. My mother, who has read a few of his books, refuses to read this only because she says she gets depressed by the sad and dramatic endings. She complains that someone always dies. But I think it's beautiful. It is somewhat depressing knowing one of the characters you love die but this book leaves you with a more peaceful feeling than some of his other books. Nicholas Sparks is a brilliant writers and really knows how to capture the hearts of his readers. I never wanted to put this book down and I stayed up late in the night just to finish it. I love romance novals and this is one of the best ones I've read. I can't wait till I see the movie on DVD, I think it will be excellent. I have to give Nicholas Sparks two thumbs up for this book, it's truly heart-warming."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book over the summer and I was blown away. Nicholas Sparks is on my list of favorite writers. He paints a scene with his words. His writing evokes so much emotion and you find yourself hoping that Noah and Allie end up together. This was my first time reading a Nicholas Sparks novel and I am hooked. I cried at some points of the story. It was a touching and moving read."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book isn't well-written in the sense of elaborate and beautiful language, but it is a very good story. I would venture to say the same about the movie as well: acting isn't all that great, but it's still a good story, because the book is a good story. You might be able to figure out who Allie ended up choosing just by the beginning of the book, but it doesn't matter because that makes the story that much better. It's pretty sappy in some parts, but not too bad, and it certainly made me cry. One displeasing aspect, however, was that I found certain parts to be a little too graphic and descriptive. I think Sparks's novel could have done without such parts and still be a romantic plot. The story is wonderful just the same, even if you're likely not to be wowed by the style of the language."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have not seen the movie and was glad to read the book. It's a nice book to read at the end of the day, just curling up on the couch and getting lost in this fabulous love story. The story is beautiful and the book is very well written. The characters are very likable.I just thought it was a little unbelievable that after so many years she just drove in to see him and he happened to be home."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"When I read The Notebook I loved every moment of it. I laughed and cried. The letters that were written by both lovers will touch the readers heart like never before. This book is one I would re-read over a thousand times!!! I loved it so much that after I had to return it to the library I went out ot buy it right after. I think Sparks has wrote one of the best books in this century."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Spark's novel is not only outstanding but its great for readers who dont mind letting a few tear drops drip. The novel takes place in the south and is wonderful story of true love and whether or not it is strong enough to keep two soul mates together. I absolutely fell in love with this novel I feel it is probably one of Sparks all time best. It defintely was a tear dripper so be prepared! (Don't worry though all the tears are worth it!)"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"As a guy I was naturally reluctant to read this book. I finally realized that I was secure enough in my masculinity to read it. It is a great book. Please read the book before you see the movie because it is different. I really enjoyed this book. It is a good rainy day read. I guarantee once you start you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is the sweetest, most touching novel I have ever read. I picked this book up before a 7 hour car ride and had to put it down numerous times to hide the fact that I was about to cry. Even if you know what is going to happen, as I did the first time I read it, you will cry. I cried many, many times during this book. I have read this book 3 times and have not gotten sick of it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have never been more deeply touched by any other story, book, movie, or play. The Notebook is a brilliant love story about eternal passionate love between two people that were placed on the face of the earth for no other reason but to love one another. Nicholas Sparks describes the love story like no one else can. This book will move the depths of your soul. If you are an avid reader, or if you are picking up your first book, read The Notebook. The sequel to this book - \\"The Wedding\\" is a must read as you will learn about the continuation of the lives of the most incredible characters you will ever get to know. The Notebook is a story that will live within your heart for the rest of your life. You will never be the same after reading it. Highly recommended to anyone who has ever loved."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is a classic Nicholas Sparks love story, but one to last a lifetime! This is the kind of love we all long for, rather we have experienced it or not. The feeling that you can take on anything just because you have loved with all your heart. I have read several of the reviews and there are some inaccurate statements made in some of them.This story is the story written in \\"The Notebook.\\" This notebook is being read to Mrs. Hamilton by Duke. The Notebook contains the story of Allie and Noah. They meet one summer and have a summer long romance. The big conflict is that Allie is from a well-to-do family and is heading to college after the summer. Noah is the average small town guy, working at a lumberyard to make a living. A very improbable connection, but one that beats out the sparks of fireworks on fourth of july. Needless to say, Allie's family is all but impressed with Noah and takes Allie away early giving them no chance to say goodbye and leaving their last conversation to be a fight they had. Neither of them forget about their summer love and Noah writes to Allie to find no response back. Finally, he gives up on writing her and heads to join the army to fight the war. He returns safely and finds out that Allie is engaged to a weathy guy (of course, the new guy is much more suited to her family and lifestyle.) Yet, we learn that she too has not forgotten about Noah. In true Nicholas Sparks fashion, Allie goes back to visit Noah and realizes he is the one she truely loves. She breaks off the engagement and proceeds to spend her life with Noah. About this time in the reading of the story, Mrs. Hamilton realizes that she is in fact Allie Callhoun and the story is being read to her by her husband, Noah. Allie has altzheimer's and the only time she is able to recognize Noah and remember their improbable romance is on occasion when he is reading the notebook to her (that she wrote, by the way.)It gives me chills just to recall this story and I absolutely love it!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This down home, southern book of literature is one of the greatest books that has been written in years. I cannot count the number of times I have read this book. Noah found the girls he loved, lost her, and found her again. I would have liked to read a little more of Allies parents after they were married and watched their relationship with their new son in law. This book had me laughing, and had me in tears at the end. What a story. What love.The Note Book should be on the shelves along side the other great writers like Twain, Hemingway, O' Henry."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Had the story began when once upon a humid night in the low country, Noah Calhoun and Allie Nelson met, and they lived happily ever after, the book would have been greatly improved. I don't care to read a romance novel about a guy with claws for hands and a woman with Alzheimer's in a nursing home.The only likable character in this book was Lon, whom Allie was engaged to when she reunited with Noah and then shacked up with him, while he [Lon] was desperately trying to reach her. I never got that she [Allie] claimed to love this man who obviously loved her (putting his career on the line), for so afraid was he of losing her, and then cheated on him. Break up first, and don't think you can have sex with another man (I don't give an arse if he was your first love and you never got over him), and then go back to your fiance if you change your mind.What further endeared me to Lon was that he was a gentleman about the whole thing, because he did want Allie to be happy, even if it wasn't with him. Noah was shameful, justifying that because of his love for Allison, it was okay them screwing each other repeatedly and not feeling any remorse for it. It was obvious they did love each other unconditionally, and that's great, but she should have never led Lon on (who took it well for four years when she told him she wanted to wait for marriage to have sex, and never did he cheat on her in the four years they dated to get it on with someone else), and as soon as she knew she was going to bang Noah, she should have broken it off with him. Same rule should apply to a marriage: You want to cheat, get a divorce first.Noah came across as kind of an existentialist, not to mention a hermit, and don't tell me there isn't a person in this world (unless they're Bill Gates, or Al Gore even), who wouldn't not be affected if someone left them 70K? And the fact that Allie wasn't angry with her mother at all at keeping Noah's letters from her is just ridiculous. I would be furious, especially if I cared about the man as she did.The best thing about this book is the back cover. Nicholas Sparks seems like a great guy, a family man, not to mention quite handsome and totally someone I would date if he wasn't married, but he isn't a great writer--he's simply capable of producing popular fiction that sells. The fact that the love scenes are tastefully done and there isn't any profanity was refreshing makes it a shame that the story wasn't more interesting."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"If your looking to read the book because you loved the movie, just know that it's a lot different! But, it's also just as good."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I really enjoyed this story. For me it was a single sitting read, as was The Bridges of Madison County, and I really savored it. The concept was good, the writing natural and the story beautiful. The book itself is so lovely with the picturesque cover art and nice binding. I must admit that I think I liked the film version more, but I have no regrets about reading this absorbing love story. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is an amazingly emotional piece that gives the reader exactly what they want - a promise that love can transcend everything. This story traces a couple's relationship from start to finish, with all the battles that we actually face. Much better than the movie, this is a story for men as well (my husband read the entire book in one sitting, staying up all night to do so). Two enthusiastic thumbs up!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I'm not going to describe the book because so many before me have. But I do want to say that it is one of my favorite books and what got me to like Nicholas Sparks. Some aspects are a bit far fatch but its kind of sweet to think that someone would be so enamored with someone else. Its a sweet story. I don't know why anyone would give this book a bad review unless you don't like romance novels."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was captured from the very beginning of the book, and had to read it in one sitting. It is a magnificent piece of writing describing the intricacies of the human soul. Bravo for Nicholas Sparks!The title is relevant, for it depicts the notebook that Noah shares with Allie, his wife. The notebook describes the love story of Noah and Allie. This is the story Noah reads to his wife every day, in the hospital, hoping that one day, she will remember their life together.As a young man, Noah's life was changed when he met Allie. They came from different worlds, yet their love blossomed during those few weeks together. After fourteen years of separation, she re-enters his life, and this time, never leaves again. They have a happy marriage and children; and then 49 years later, the inevitable happens, she leaves Noah again. This time, it is not her doing. It's Alzheimer's that snatches her away.The love that Noah has for his wife is all consuming and so powerful, that it had me in tears. Nicholas Sparks' writing has reached a higher level of writing that aptly captures the human spirit in love to perfection. Noah has moved into the hospital, in another room, to be by his wife's side. Every day, he makes the trip to her room, and reads to her, and leaves poems underneath her pillow, and every day she doesn't remember him, which is heart wrenching to see. A few letters that she's written to him in the past reveal her true love for him also.The surprising twist at the end of the story left me sighing with satisfaction. Can it be? Can miracles happen? Read the book to find out!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have read this book four times because I love it so much. I cry and fall in love each time I read it. It is such an amazing story and doesn't even compare to the movie--the book is SO much better!! It is a must have in any romantics library."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"After seeing the movie &quot;Message In A Bottle&quot;, it made me search for the novel, and I realized that Sparks also wrote another novel, &quot;The Notebook&quot;. Bought it on the 28th of May. Finished reading on the 29th of May and absolutely love it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is a love story that stirs the heart of the reader to love their spouses, children, and friends with a genuine love most people only dream of experiencing. The book can be easily read in an evening, and leaves the reader longing for the love described so eliquently by Nicholas Sparks."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I thought that this book was very good. I could not put it down. I liked the way he used flashbacks to write it and how he left us hanging in the middle of the book. I cryed at the end."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks has an incredible way with words. Very seldom do I find a book that evokes the kinds of emotions he expresses. A wonderful and touching story of fate, love, and hope."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Because I live in North Carolina, it was even more visually powerful. There is some truth even today about the Southern caste system of marrying the &quot;right&quot; man. Sparks made both characters feel with their whole hearts. A story about the one and only &quot;perfect&quot; love each of us deserves. I truly enjoyed every minute of reading this book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book has been one of the best book I have read for awhile. It shows the real meaning of true love and passion and if two people are meant to be, they are meant to be."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A friend of mine lent me this book to read and I can't thank her enough. It is the best love story ever told. I stayed up all night cause I couldn't sleep til I finished. My husband thought I was crazy! I have now found the perfect Christmas gift and plan to give it to all my close friends and family. Everyone person should be loved like that. A must read!!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book hit a special place in my heart. My Grandmother had Altzhiemers, and this story reminded my of the last time we spoke before she died. Nicholas uses so much imagry in his writtings that I felt as if I was back in the South."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Cheesey, full of cliches, there is no depth in the characters whatsoever, and their love does not ring true. The ending in the retirement home was the only portion of the novel I really enjoyed - not because it was well-written or rang true, but because it was an interesting concept. However, it read like a cheesey young adult romance."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Take this book for what it is. It isnt a classic novel of literature, but yet it is a romance novel to read in a day. If you read it for that, it is wonderful and romantic and heartwarming. Though I did not cry through the whole thing, I felt emotional. Being the hopeless romantic that I am, I truly felt this novel and it made me love love even more. It was a great book to lift my heart and my spirits :)"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Beautiful love story...Just touched my heart love Nicholas Sparks and this did not disappoint in any way shape or form"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A million times better than the movie. It really makes you believe that true love can exist and last a life time. One if the best books and movies out there"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was very excited to read this book at first after seeing the classic movie. Unfortunately I do not enjoy the book very much. It skins over the young Ali and Noah which is what I actually wanted to know more about (what the movie left out) overall it is a good read if you have seen the movie otherwise read the last song by Nicholas sparks instead"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Beautiful and perfect in any way possible. A wonderful book that I could not put down for the life of me."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was wonderful showing that love can even more stars, love is more powerful than any other in this world. Just beautiful."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book is one of my all time favorites. I've seen the movie countless times. I've read the book one other time. Some say this book is sappy. Well it is a Nicholas Sparks book. He is known for the sap. That's why you read his books.I enjoy reading the love story of Noah and Allie. It started out as a sweet innocent love that turned into something so much more.How many women would love to be loved the way Noah loves Allie? I know I would. Soul mates are forever. Time does not end love if its meant to be. Neither does illness.My heart breaks for Noah time and time again."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is my new comfort book :) I love Nicholas Spark\`s work. The book is not as sad as the movie."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"love this book. its a special love story that has happiness and sadness to it. one of my favourite books"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A beautiful poetic story. I've not read a book so filled with emotion in a long time. It starts out like any good love story, but goes way beyond. Truly pulls you in."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have read a lot of books before, but the notebook isn't just a book. It's an example, a lesson of love. It shows us that just because the odds are against us, and just because everyone else doesn't believe that miracles can happen, that love works in mysterious ways. And some loves are strong enough to overcome anything. And that love is the only real cure for tragedies."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Anything would have been better than Bridges of Madison County...now that was dreck. I'm originally from Iowa and, trust me; strange trucks, parked at the farm yard, while hubby is at the state fair, will shortly be the talk of the surrounding counties. How this book was such a huge success, Still baffles me.I liked The Notebook. Sentimental? Yes. Treacle - is too harsh. It's a pretty story. Like At Weddings and Wakes. Sometimes it's pleasant not to have to think too hard but just enjoy the flow of the book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book is compelling; once you start reading, you can't put it down! It is a bittersweet story about enduring love between two people. It is a great read for those who consider their spouse or significant other their best friend as well as their lover. It is also about loss. Strangely, I saw a number of local couples I admire in this story - an elderly couple from our church in their 90's who have been married 62 years; a middle-aged couple who lived across the street from us and had just retired to enjoy life (they were best &quot;buddies&quot; until death took them both within six months of one another). I also saw my husband and me; we have been married almost 30 years and have had our share of trials. Through it all, we have emerged as eternal friends and lovers and that is so special. I cried my eyes out over this story and you will, too! It is excellent. That an author so young can be so perceptive about thoughts and feelings of others is extraordinary!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A lovely romantic read. As moving as Craig Furnas's THE SHAPE is thrilling I read them both in one week, with a story that will make you smile when you go to sleep, and make you fall in love with love all over again. Did you see Nicholas Sparks profiled on 48 Hours? He's just as you think he would be!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Cliche plot, cliche sentences, unoriginal, unmoving: John Locke was correct when he said that in a capitalistic society mediocrity would rule, would rise to the top, but he NEVER prepared us for this!!!where is the Salinger of our time???!!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I found myself being quickly drawn into this story and found an awareness about Alzheimers that was very touching. I had to share this with others and found myself buying multiple copies to give to friends and family. I have since then shared many conversations with others about the stages of Alzheimers and how their loved ones may be at a certain stage as mentioned in the book. I was very impressed with this story. Because of the sections that were rather sexual, I was reluctant to offer it to a priest I am friends with, but the message is so important to share with others, I hope many will read this book. Kudos to Nicholas, I am presently reading Message in the Bottle and am enjoying it as well."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"While the concept of this novel is not very original, I liked the sandwich effect of time (present, past, present). This technique added a enough tension to spur me on and finish the book. I found last portion of the book to be the most enjoyable, though I had some difficulty because I was crying most of the way through. Sparks does a good job tugging at your heart strings and I believe the movie version of this book will be just as successful as &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot;. A great book for a lazy Sunday afternoon."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks seems to be under the mistaken impression that mediocre writing and a contrived plot can be hidden under adjectives and long-winded description. It can't. This is writing for money's sake, without any poetry, emotion, or heart. About four pages into the book, the reader basically can figure out the gist of the plot. And did we really need that five-page description of cooking a crab dinner? Allie and Noah are merely caricatures of actual human beings, and Sparks barely touches real human emotion here.. All in all, a disappointing and actually unbearable reading experience."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Wow! The response to this book has been huge, I purchased this book on a whim. The minute I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. Browsing through the critics (and this seems to be a love/hate book) I can only denounce their own petulant tendency to take apart every little part of a beautiful book which has touched many across the globe. I, for one, was greatly moved by the book and most unexpectantly - I was in tears for the last few chapters of the book. Well done, Mr. Sparks, you have touched the hearts of many!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The most tender story of unconditional love, written with the power of simplicity. No intellectual posing, or toying with the reader, but handled with gentle caring and directness.This far surpasses even &quot;Madison County.&quot; Every writer, as well as reader, should be taking notes on this work!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This story is a fast read, yet one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. I couldn't put it down. The only time I did, was to stop myself from getting so lost in the book. I had to look up and distinguish my reality. A book that can do that, is worth reading. You won't finish this with dry eyes though. Enjoy, it is heart-warming."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have read this book over 5 times in the past 4 years. I absolutely love Sparks style of writing and the intimacy of this love story. It is the perfect read for any adult woman!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"It is awesome even though i want to cry my eyes out in the end:'( i read this book in 7 hours(including break) because once you start reading it its hard to put it down!!! Love it!!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Who didn't want to own this book after the movie came out? It is a great book that was at a great price. Very happy!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I love this story. It's a feel good, quick read. A glass of wine in front of the fire place and disappear into the love of two wonderful characters. I could read this over and over again."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is a very moving story,which gives us an insight to life, living with dementia from a partners perspective. It is sad but also shows the strength of a love that is determined and stubborn.The book is very well written, as I work with dementia people five days a week and have a very close connection to husbands and families, I could read a very truthful account of the inner feelings of all concerned. Well done!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Story initially engaging but then in the middle it was \\"and now?\\". A little too syrupy for me. But I liked the contrast between the young & old couple, and also the insight into alzheimers from a partner's perspective."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was well written..the pages kept turning. It really makes you think about your life and to cherish each moment with those you love. It changed me after I read the book!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have read all of his books and they never cease to amaze me.(: one of the best love stories of all time"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Ok I confessed it. I'm a straight male, and I love The Notebook. I'm not overly sensitive. I'm masculine and can sometimes come off as a jerk. Yet this story deeply touched me.I don't know how many times I have heard a girl claim that Nicholas Sparks is a phenomenal writer. Girlfriends, my mom, my sister, and every other woman I know that has read The Notebook have made that claim. Each time I heard that, I would immediately scoff and write it off as women's pornography. Finally, after years battling women over this, I decided to read it. After all, what's the big fuss all about?After the first couple pages I was hooked. I was embarrassed about being hooked, but I was hooked. His words were delectable. It wasn't poetry, but it was poetic. Some lines were such a treat that I had to read them out loud to fully soak them in. The characters were realistic. They wrestled with the topic of what would happen if you were face-to-face with your first love. At the same time, they didn't only romanticize it. There was pain when Allie was wrestling with her past love and her future fianc&eacute;. There was struggle as Noah in his old age tried to remind Alzheimer ridden Allie of their love.It was beautiful, yet tinged with sadness- a true romance tell. At the same time the author also bared his heart. What many people probably don't know is is that like Noah, Nicholas Sparks was crammed into a world that didn't let his art flourish (business). But he always found a way to remain faithful to his art. He actually wrote the notebook on his spare time when he wasn't doing pharmaceutical sales. That whole idea of struggle to define oneself when the world is pulling you in every other direction is clearly seen in this work.All I can say is read it. Male, female alike- read the notebook. It will touch your heart."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"As the author ofThe Rain Began To FallI can really appreciate this author's character development, plot and style. He defines the power of love poignantly in this story of Allie and Noah; that the heart knows no bounds and is always true - despite class barriers, time and distance - and will yearn across the decades for the one who holds it.There is such a depth of tenderness in this story, and it touches a special place in the receptive soul."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I though it would be the run of the mill love story. Was I ever mistaken. From the very beginning, Sparks held my heart in the palm of his hand."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have read the Notebook several times and each time I fall deeper in love with my husband. Nicholas Sparks has put into words the love I feel for my husband and the love I feel from him. A must read. I think of this book often. I have extra copies to give to my daughters when they grow up!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The book was romantic and touching, although also a bit trite and simplistic. The general theme makes it an incredible story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Primarily, upon listening to the tape I quickly discovered a lack of story continuity along with strained believability character wise - secondly the word drawings became tangled, and then a bit sticky - thirdly I had to make a decision... finish the tapes or turn on the car radio. If you knew our local stations it would be perfectly clear why I continued with the tapes.The story, plot, characters, etc... may be thin but a strange ambiance enshrouds the very pretty story the further one bears into reading/listening. I understand the strong positive attraction of many to the story and also the strong rejection of others giving a spread of 1 through a very strong 10 rating. A bit of quick math and a simple means applied to the results and the book wins very easily. Look for the mediums in the ratings by the readers reviews. There are so few that they are nonexistence. Many readers review screens pages downs of ratings in the 10's, then one or two ratings of 1's. Something powerful is happening here. It is called &quot;A successful piece of prose&quot;. No matter the writer's style or seemly lack of prose ability, the popularity remains. So those with a rating of 1 with gnashing teeth, spittle flying and stamping of feet will not change any of those tens. If these ratings are any indication, the 1 givers are in for quite a shock at their next book club meeting.If you like straight forward, old clich&eacute;s, (sometimes I do), feeling twisting, tear pulling writing with a basically pure non-knee-jerk nerve jangling story line, get the book. You may like it. If you don't, there should be some twenty odd people in your immediate vicinity that will love it. --This text refers to the cassette edition of this title."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Sparks tells a wonderful story that seems so real. The words that Sparks write paint a beautiful story in you mind. It's a book that you can't put down until you know what happens to the two lovers. You feel each characters pain, happiness, and want. Just seeing the cover of the book or hearing the title makes my heart skip a beat and brings a tear to my eye! I recomend this book to anyone that is in love, wants to be in love, or who has seen love."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I found the Notebook to be a touching heart warming story. After the plodding read of Cold Mountain by Charles Fraizer it was good to read a book that at least used quotation marks. I thought Mr. Sparks did an excellent job of conveying what the characters were feeling. I loved this book and I don't really care much for Romance novels. I certainly would not put it in the same category as the Danielle Steele drivel that other reviews have. Maybe some readers need to take off their jaded glasses and give this one another read."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I really like a good love story and I usually find that the books that make me cry are some of my favorites. Somehow The Notebook falls far short. I question the accuracy of the time period. I think perhaps Mr. Sparks interjected too much into his grandparents' love affair, equating it with what a modern day affair might be."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"What is it with the reviewers who trashed this book? Have you not one romantic bone in your heart? This book is honest about what it is - a story of two people who find each other again and have the courage to let their love guide them instead of giving in to external forces wanting to keep them apart. By taking a risk and honoring their love, they have almost half a century together of a love that is rare and precious and beautiful - through good times and tragic ones as well. Is this book full of action and suspense and mystery? No. Is it chock full of witty dialogue? No. Sparks has told his story simply (for which he has been unjustly criticizecd) and beautifully. Often the best told stories are the ones told without the reader needing a thesarus by their side to decipher the author's overblown prose. To see the love Noah has for Allie in her illness along with the pain he goes through at her deterioration is is heartbreaking. I liked this being told from the man's point of view. As far as Allie having moments of lucidity due to Noah's love, I have seen stranger things happen in the years I have worked in the helping professions. Sparks never tries to say real love will cure this horrible disease, he is just saying that soul deep love can perform all kinds of miracles - even if only for a brief time. I would have liked to see their reunion and some of the years with their children. I still give this book a ten, though because it touched my romantic heart. For those of you that want &quot;literature&quot;, get a reading list from your nearest high school's English Lit class. For those of you that want &quot;realism&quot;, read the newspaper. And, yet, there are those of us that know love like Allie's and Noah's does and can exist - some of us are living it now. I feel really sad for those of you that do not have this in your lives and can not bear to read it in a book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"THIS BOOK HAS TOUCHED MY SOUL.IT GIVES HOPE AND SHOWS THAT LOVE CAN SURVIVE."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read the reviews of the other readers and I can't believe the criticism people gave this book. Lighten up people! It's just an enduring love story...if you read the inside of the cover you would have gotten the jist of what it was about and saved yourselves the time...I myself, enjoyed it for what it was! Just a touching love story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books. If you want to curl up and read a sweet romance story and maybe shed a few tears, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I had to wait a while after reading this book to write this review. Just enough time to get my composure, you understand. \\"The Notebook\\" by Nicholas Sparks was chosen by my library book review group to read and review for the month of April. This is my third book written by Sparks to read. The other two being \\"Message In A Bottle\\" and \\"A Walk To Remember\\". Both were very good books and both were made into motion pictures. I don't know if \\"The Notebook\\" has been made into a motion picture, but if not, I think it should be. I can just picture Paul Newman as the senior Noah, talking about his love for Allie. I might add that I've donated four boxes of Kleen-X to Sparks' books, two boxes on \\"The Notebook\\".I'm a romantic. I love to read romance. And anyone who thinks romance is just for the young will have a change of heart after reading this novel. Although \\"Message In A Bottle\\" and \\"A Walk To Remember\\" were both sweet reads, this book by far was much sweeter. Why? Very simple. Because it lasted through a lifetime. In the beginning, I thought the book started slowely. Too much detail for me. And it was almost obvious Sparks was still a little \\"green\\". However, I almost knew he wouldn't let me down. So I read on. The more I read, the better the writting and the story. Sparks writes from the heart, and therefore, he manages to touch the heart of the reader. Something any really good writer should thrive to learn. His loves scenes describing the physical act of two people coming together as one is as well written and heart warming as any I've ever read. I hate a love scene written in SMUT, and Sparks knows how to evade that all together. This makes him special with his ability to let the reader know what the characters are feeling and still keep it beautiful. That, my friend, takes talent.My hat is off to Sparks on this novel. A wonderful read for anyone of any age."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"this book is so good i love nicholas sparks. but i must warn u have a box of tissues because u will need it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I started reading this book sometime after lunch and did not put it down until the following morning. I tried to sleep but awoke because I just had to know what would happen.Simply put, I BALLED MY EYES OUT!I actually hate romance novels, they're usually too gooshy for me and I can't stand their unrealistic twist and turns, not to mention the over the top characters. However, Mr. Sparks takes real people, real places and real emotions and writes about something that could happen to people you know. I read this book thinking about my parents and how powerfully in love they are. I imagined this happening to them and I that's when I couldn't hold back the tears.Only the literally insane (those who care more about sentence structure)will have a hard time enjoying a book like this. REAL people living REAL lives will LOVE it!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Author Nicholas Sparks bestows upon us the story of Noah and Allie in this one-night read meant to tug at the heartstrings, which it does rather well, especially at the last chapter.Beyond touching our emotions though, this novel doesn't have much substance. It's a love story, with the typical formula (despite being based, so is said, on the true-to-life story of Sparks' wife's grandparents) of boy meets girl; they fall in love, then must overcome whatever obstacles stand in their way. Not to say it isn't a good read-it's just a light, relaxing one for the times we're too tired for the mental gymnastics that more often than not accompany the experience of reading meatier tomes."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook was such a touching book that I cried &amp; smiled while I read it. I would highly recommend reading this book before reading any of Nicholas Sparks' other books."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"&quot;The Notebook&quot; is one of the best short novels I have ever read. Nicholas Sparks writes from a man's perspective on love, friendship, families and life experiences. He writes in a very genuine and sensitive way where you &quot;feel&quot; everything he writes.I purchased this novel when it was first released in 1996. I passed it around during the first year to all of my family and friends,encouraging them to read it, both men and women. The response and feedback I recieved from them was; &quot;wow, what a wonderful story, I've never read anything like that before.&quot; It's one book I have read more than once, and each time, I am touched. It's definately a novel you must read. You will treasure the story forever."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook was an awesome book, and I recommend it to anyone who likes romantic novels. I laughed and I cried. It is my favorite out of all the Nicholas Sparks' books!!! It is just incredible to me that a guy could write such romantic thoughts, I didn't think it was possible. But this book proves me wrong, everyone should read it!:)"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was one that I started reading and could not put down.The story of Noah and Allie was one of a love missed, but not forgotten. I cried with this book it was definitely a tear jerker and a thought provoker. The only thing I didn't like was the last page of this book, after reading it I thought did that really just end this way. My advice would be to read the book stop at the last page and then make up your own ending.Before I read the last page of this book I would have rated it a 5!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Right in the middle I was disappointed by an unnecesary love scene.. but other than that this is a quick read and pleasant for one weekend.I enjoyed the writing and the story, but it is a watery romance with little robust character. Still, as I mentioned: pleasant."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read mostly fiction; at least 2 books a week and enjoy most of what I read. The Notebook is the worst book I have ever read and the publisher should be ashamed of themselves. The first 20 pages are stock full of the word &quot;and&quot; connecting sentence after sentence after sentence. It's almost comical. If you haven't read a book in 20 years and want to get started again, this might be the book for you; just do me a big favor, don't buy the book, check it out at the local library. Make sure to look in the card catalog under &quot;over rated&quot;. If I could rate this book with no stars I would have."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I had heard of this book so many times and seen interviews on TV, I decided I would read it. In fact, it was chosen as my bookgroup's selection to discuss this month. But I surely felt robbed as I read it. For the first half of the story I kept waiting for something to happen... during the second half I lost all hope. I still can't shake the feeling that this guy, with his business sense, said, &quot;I'm certainly not a writer, but I can sell a book&quot;! He wrote with a shameful shallowness, and it makes me sad that such a book became a bestseller. It says something dreadful about the mentality of our society."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I can't imagine someone in their 30's with this much insight into relationships throughout the course of a marriage. This is my first book of his and I loved it. It's an intense brutally honest look at how things really are; with his dialog and conversation, I felt like I was feeling their pain too. I appreciate his unexaggerated way of describing things in this book. Towards the end, the book almost compels you to think about your life and how you've lived it. A must read book for sure!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I believe this book has it's place. If readers want something other than a nice vacation from what is all too real in the world, then steer clear of this book. It isn't typically realistic, and maybe the characters are not fully developed, but I think that is the appeal of the story. It is told from Noah's point of view, and while he seems sickeningly sweet, it's nice to think that there might be people as simplistic as he. Reviewers who chastise Sparks' so called inability to develop Noah, need to realize that when a character is simple, he is simple. As for Allie, she could be developed more, but the essential story line is about Noah's time with out her, in her much too typical southern socialite life. We all know where these two lives would go if left alone. It may be cliche', but sometimes comfort with what we know is just what we need to remember that not every piece of literature needs to be a ground breaking active piece of what is quickly becoming overdone. Remember, something new today will be old and cliche tomorrow. Simply, the notebook was a beautiful story that never needed much prodding into. Appreciate it for what it is...Simple and lovely."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I can't even believe this book was published, never mind that people thought it was great! They obviously have not read truly great books. It read like a freshman's attempt at a novel, only worse."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Supporters of this novel are wrong in suggesting that critics have no literary taste or are heartless. Critics are...well, right. Completely."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I find it disheartening (and yet amusing) that this book received any positive appeal whatsoever. It is also quite amusing that this book moved some to tears. Instead of provoking tears, the thick, sickenly mawkish mood thoroughly disgusted me. Furthermore, the poor writing style was a &quot;big turn off&quot; (couldn't help myself...) as were the never ending cliches. Although the book has many flaws, I will mention just one more: the lack of strong conflict. Perhaps I'm being naive, but I believe strong conflict is essential to a well-written novel; The Notebook has no strong conflict (if any conflict at all). In fact, Sparks, for some odd reason, skips over what could have easily have been the most compelling scene in the book: Allie's confrontation with her fiance Lon. Instead of providing the audience with some tangible conflict, Sparks decides to instead leap 49 years forward. After suffering through this book, I recommend that those who haven't read it don't; this book has no reedeeming qualities, (except for making you appreciate REAL literature a little more than before) and can only be detrimental to your present mental state."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I simply don't understand how people can give this awful book a 10. What else have they read, or better yet, what haven't they read? Perhaps it was the small size of the book that was so appealing... Can hardly wait to see the movie - NOT! At least I borrowed the book, wasting my precious time and not a dime."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"From the moment I picked up the book and began the story from Noah's point of view I could not put it down. The simple, yet moving story brought tears to my eyes. I finished the novel in a day, and cried for hours after. The knowledge that a terrible disease could take away the most precious of all memories will haunt me forever. I, too, like Allie, had to decide which path to take. I felt as if I understood the choices being made...truly magnificent and touching. I will enjoy it for many years to come."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Next week will be my first meeting with a neighborhood bookclub. Alas, if they collectively like this highly-publicized drivel, it may be my first and last. The boring, stereotypical, wooden, one-dimensional, humorless characters and the improbable dialogue and interaction were painful to experience. I did appreciate the length - mercifully short. And Mr. Sparks looks real cute on the book jacket."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book is not much more than a souped-up trashy romance novel. The skeleton of the story line is really lovely, but the writing itself is almost intolerable. Most irritating is the regular, randomly-inserted tedium about Allie's cosmetic habits--trying on different dresses and examining herself in the mirror, finding shoes that match her dress perfectly, wishing she'd brought a mascara with her--what the heck is that all about? Are we expected to like and respect this woman more when we read about her fussing with herself? And what are we to make of a narrator who actually finds this important enough to write down?I didn't even find myself rooting for the couple. They were together for one summer, when they were children. So what? Don't we all have a first love that is sweet and passionate? But we don't allow those memories to dictate how we live our adult lives, do we? Stewing over them on a daily basis? Not allowing ourselves to fall in love again? That they fall in love again as adults I would find more a coincidence than an inevitability.The writing is at its best (which even then is not very good) in the scenes in the hospital. However I would have found these sweet scenes more touching if I had actually grown to respect the couple from reading about the development of their relationship. But I hadn't."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I can't say enough how wonderful this book was. I have read A Walk to Remember, and liked that a lot...but this book... WOW! I am a huge romantic at heart and this really moved me. I read the book in one day. It's a nice fast read, but it's a tear-jerker! Have your tissues ready for this one. Keep in mind Nicholas Sparks wrote this story from his wife's grandparents experience. Love like this does exist! The romance was unbelievable! I was so happy reading this book, that I became Allie and wished I was her! She was a really lucky girl to have someone love her the way he did! The way he showed her, and described his love was truely amaizing- unlike anything I have ever seen or heard about! Any guy out there should read this, and show this type romance to their loved ones-if you want to keep her forever, this is the way to do it! Mr. Sparks, please keep writing your love stories! I will read them, as long as you keep writing them."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Noah Calhoun and Allie Nelson fell in love fourteen years ago in New Bern, North Carolina. They spent one summer together, but this summer would change their lives forever. Will their love survive trying ends?Noah Calhoun, a well-rounded character, comes back to his hometown, New Bern, after being away fourteen years. In order to get over the loss of his first love, Noah moves away; he comes back in order to start over and to finally put the past, and her, behind him.After fourteen years, Allie, also a well-rounded character in the novel, returns to New Bern to see Noah on hearing of his homecoming. She feels obligated to tell Noah the news of her engagement. She knows deep in her heart he is the only one for her, but feels time has distanced them.While seeing each other again, sparks begin to fly, and they each fall in love once again. Allie is torn between Lon, her fianc&eacute;, and Noah, her first and only love. Even though she wants to stay with Noah, she feels she would be unfair to Lon and would never be able to forgive herself.Allie leaves Noah to return to Lon. Noah knows deep in his heart her choice will result in him never seeing her again. Noah's heart breaks once again, just like it did fourteen years ago, when she left the first time. Allie is torn between her head and her heart, but chooses Lon over Noah anyway.The notebook ends here, but the novel does not. Allie returns to Lon but only for a short time. She tells Lon of her true feelings for Noah. He is heartbroken and upset, but he shows his true love for her by letting her go. Allie picks her heart, chooses Noah, and returns for the last time to New Bern.Noah and Allie marry and live a complete life of forty-nine years together, but after forty-five years of marriage their lives take a terrible turn. Both Allie and Noah are diagnosed with malignant diseases. Their love for one another is ultimately tested, but their true love survives in the end.The Notebook is a formula fiction novel. Noah meets Allie. Noah loses Allie. Noah gets Allie back. The boy-girl analogy is summarized and developed through the novel's plot. Although the plot is strengthened with other analogies, the formula fiction is the most obvious.The true and pure power of love to overpower and overcome all obstacles is the reoccurring theme in The Notebook. Noah and Allie's love is evaluated many times in this novel. Their true love, as all true love does, survives in the end. The theme develops throughout the novel; though it is never stated, of course, you understand it as the plot thickens.Through love and tragedy, Sparks created a wonderful work of literature in some minds. Whether you view The Notebook as a love story or heartbreaking story, you should be intrigued none-the-less. I, personally, view this book as a wonderful escape novel and enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Ugh. This book is the most sappy, predictable, and unreadable I've ever encountered. I read all the others recommended by Amazon under the &quot;Customers who bought this also bought...&quot; and they are all far better than this one. A Harlequin romance for the geriatric set."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Almost 200 people so far gave this book, 1 star. I think that's a bit harsh.His ability to describe setting was good. .... and his prose style is very melodic and lyrical.I think he could have changed it up a bit for variety, however.Okay, POSSIBLE MAJOR FLAWS:The main character, Noah, seemed slightly one-dimensional because he had nothing to overcome. He had no inner-conflicts. Surely a real-life person is not that boring (Sparks made Noah appear like a country bumpkin that only likes to canoe/kayak, chop wood, and visit swans) - at least we know he could cook up a mean crab. But where was Noah's inner conflict? And where was the character to help him discuss, challenge or motivate him to overcome that inner personal conflict and grow as a result, just as humans grow.This would have given the reader a richer experience. The more dimensions you have to a story the more realistic it feels.Allie was slightly more realistic, at least she had to make a serious choice.I'm always slightly let down these types of books where they are obsessively concerned with the two lovers - and nothing else. You feel like the entire story takes place in a vacuum and it loses dimension.Same problems in \\"The Time Travelers Wife.\\" Good book, ingeniously plotted, but it could have been a forever classic had the story had more dimension.But despite these flaws, I still cried at the end."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Loving the movie, the book gives you a little bit more info but is not as romantic.But if you are a fan I recomended.Awesome story"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Usually I say when a book it turned into a movie, the movie lacks something. In this case though I felt the movie was able to portray the emotion of their love much better than the book. As I was reading the book I felt as if he wrote the story as a script for the movie then wrote the book as an afterthought. On its own it is a very good book, I personally felt more emotion from the movie."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I am such a huge fan of the movie when my friend told me the Notebook was based upon a book, I had to buy it. Honestly I thought that the first fifty pages were rather boring. At some points it was really hard to figure out who was narrating the story. I was also disappointed that Nicholas Sparks did not go into much detail of how they met, fell in love or so forth. I feel that that part of the story is important and should be told. The flashback when Noah and Allie were young actually started when they Noah had finished the house and Allie went to go see him. That is when I became interested in the book. Another point that I would like to add is that the author never really tells us, the actual scene where Allie goes back to see Lon. After she leaves Noah, that is pretty much were the book goes back downhill again. I was very disappointed with the end of the story. I was hoping for something like the end. Not some sex scene. I really would not recommened this book to someone. See the movie, it is so much better."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I loved this book so much. It's so amazing. It's such a romantic love story. I read it when I heard the movie was coming out. I thought it was amazing. I cried a lot at the end. They were happy and very sad tears due to the amazingending. You should read this book along with a Walk to Remember, which from what i've been told and seen of it as a movie is amazing. I've also recently read \\"The Wedding\\" by Nicholas Sparks, which is said to be it's sequel. It isjust equally as amazing as \\"The Notebook.\\" You should definitely read it.thank you for your time,Loran"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is one of Nicholas Sparks' best books yet.

It has been a long time since a book like this has affected me. The story tells of Noah and Allie's summer experience when they were still teenagers and discovered love. Their parting was brought about by Allie's parents who thought that Noah was not good enough for their daughter. After more than a decade, Allie comes back to Noah to tell him that she is engaged to a prominent lawyer, yet is still drawn to Noah, her &quot;dream&quot;. Sparks weaves this story fluidly. He descibes scenes and situations vividly that the reader sees himself in the story. A light, fast-read, beautiful love story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is a very sweet love story. I enjoyed seeing such unrequited love through a male narrator's eyes for once. His feelings for his love were beautiful and emotional. A lovely story that is sure to bring tears to the reader's eyes!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks had a great idea: the reunion between lovers lost to each other until post World War II in North Carolina. A Sparks book seems to radiate a charm around it. The thing, though, that I didn't like too much about the book was the somewhat unrealistic air that was presented. Such a story was so lacking of passion. I suggest this book for most people, but not to the fraction of readers a bit more critical."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A story about an amazing relationship that showed how love can even exist when you forget its there. I've dealt with Alzhimers in my family and the ability of Sparks to give this to his characters and still have the love story makes him an amazing author. Romance novels are usually tight little buddles of everything working out fine for enternity. Sparks' characters are shown as all too human, giving me faith once more in real life love. A must read!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I've read the good and bad reviews on this book and can only come to one conclusion: The people that don't like it are heartless or yet to fall in love. If you've ever loved you will be hooked, you can't help but be. The words are magical... and while the plot may seem too good to be true... it proves there is always hope. This is a story of hope and love and the meaning of life. If you hated it... I dare you to fall in love and then read it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook by far is one of the most brilliant heart warming novels I have read in my lifetime, a novel everyone should read young or old. Nicholas Sparks touches on love in so many aspects that one cannont imagine. It teaches that love is not &quot;self seeking&quot;."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and it is one that I would read again. It truly touched my heart and I would highly recommend it. I had loaned my copy out and am anticipating buying another copy. It shows how poignant a long lasting lifetime of love can and should be between a husband and wife."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is the best book I have ever read. I have referred this book to about a dozen of my friends, almost all of whom have felt the same as I.The Notebook is a simple story of love, love lost, and love regained. It has suspense, joy, and sorrow. It will make you think about your spouse, about how you want your marriage to be, and how you want to feel about your . You cannot help but identify with Noah, and hope that your spouse feels about you the way Noah does about Allie. And more importantly, think about whether you feel the same about your spouse as Noah does about Allie.The best quote from the book is &quot;I am nothing special...but I've loved another with all my heart and soul, and to me, this has always been enough.&quot; You'll hug your spouse a little tighter after reading this gem of a book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I looked up this book to review it because I think it's the worst book I ever read. No wait, that was the one time I read a Danielle Steele book. Anyway... The writing is like cardboard, dry and stiff, and that's how you leave emotionally. There is nothing engaging about the romance - which is the most unromantic love I've ever read about. It may have been a good story written by someone else.I give it 2 stars because the segment at the end is more engaging and touching, unlike the main bulk of the book, but still even that part should have been much better. Bad writing."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks has written a beautiful, inspiring love story about a chapter of life most writers avoid. What a tragedy that some people are offended by or afraid of looking at the beauty of a love that has lasted a life-time. The description of Noah's dedication to his wife and his patience in waiting for her &quot;return&quot; is truly inspiring. Some may think it's &quot;sappy&quot;, but I've seen couples who love like that. This is the kind of love I want when I'm 80. How about you?"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I thought that this story captured love in its most simple and powerful terms.Love in it's true sense is endearing and enduring.Allie and Noah were lovers who loved not only of the body but of the heart.Neither time nor distance quenched what they shared and no matter what obstacles came their way they were destined to be together.This is the basic human emotion and desire. To love and be loved so deeply that you can count on it even when it is far from your touch and sight. The senses hold on to this powerful vehicle and you ride it through life.In the case of Allie and Noah there is chance to capture the power once again in their realities, which they do, and lead by expample to their children the depth of such love. One is instantly drawn to them and anyone who isn't moved by this story should take his/her BP to make sure they are alive.The movie did not hold true to the book but it was ok because the chemistry between the actors was tangible. I wanted to see more, know more about these two, what happened next to them. In the book there was more to learn and in the movie there was more to yearn.I thought it was fast reading and if it was not challenging to the intellect for some of the reviewers on this page so what? It was apparently challenging to their hearts for they did not get it. If one does not feel after reading this book or seeing the movie than one is lacking in basic humanism and I will count my blessings I am neither he or she.Thanks for the time"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I don't tend to write bad reviews - but I wanted to warn people if they were thinking of reading this one. If you're looking for a sappy short read that you can get through in a few hours, go ahead and read it. But if you were looking for a memorable work of fiction that has believable characters and a solid storyline, keep looking. I haven't found anything to recommend instead of this book quite yet, but The Notebook definitely isn't it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"So far, I've read two of Sparks' novels - neither have impressed me. The author is very unimaginative with his plot and word choices. How he became so popular is beyond me. Within the first few chapters, any intelligent reader can dissect the rest of the book to figure out the ending, which is, by the way, unsurprising. I would only recommend this book to preteen girls - they might find some depth to the story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I'm starting to wonder why I belong to my book club, considering that I've been subjected to books like this one. This book was long on detail, short on plot. It's the kind of witless book you can read while supervising the kids swimming during the summer; your full attention is not necessary to grasp the \\"plot\\". This book reads like a made for television movie...that you decide from the advertisements not to watch. I did learn one thing though: even if you write a really bad book, someone somewhere is bound to publish it. Save yourself from the nausea and spend your money on another book, just about any other is more worthy."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I don't normally read romance or romantically-inclined novels, so for me to pick up The Notebook at all was a personal victory...And as engaging as it was--the imagery is as powerful and dynamic as in any story I've ever read, and the narrative's simplicity helps it flow smoothly--this story simply left a bad taste in my mouth...The overall idea of the story, a man's undying love for his wife and her inability to reciprocate as they get older, is one that tugged at me...This wasn't simply sweet and swoony, it was heartfelt and tender...But about midway through the book, when it was apparent how things were going to go, I lost most of my sympathy for Allie and Noah...Allie's mother's appearance in New Bern is bad enough (I'm not telling you what to do dear, BUT...), but we never do find out what happens to poor Lon...My sympathy lies with him in the end...A quick-reading book, it can be easily finished in one afternoon..."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I watched the movie first, not really a fan of love stories in book form but I decided to give this one a shot when the movie was so amazing. The book itself was beautiful. Unbelievable? Maybe a little, but who knows, I mean love has worked miracles before. It made me cry repeatedly, I read it as often as I could (took about three days because of my schedule). I finished it last night and let me tell you, the ending pissed me off!****Warning ~ Spoiler****In the movie they have they story time during the day, she freaks out, he gets sick (has a stroke), they reunite in the middle of the night and Allie remembers him and tells him that she missed him and that she worried and they lay down together, discuss their love; can it transend time, it is capable of anything, they fall asleep, and die while dreaming of one another. It was a peaceful, happy END to the tramatic love story.In the book the same stuff happens, a little differently but the same non-the-less. Then after his stroke, he goes to visit her in the middle of the night Allie remembers him and the book ends with her saying, \\"I love you,\\" and undoing the buttons of his shirt. WTF!She freaks out after a few minutes of memory and the end of the book is saying that she is going to have sex with him, right there in the home, where (in the book) she believes gnomes live that are staring at her and they drive her crazy. I thought that the Hollywood ending was much better.The book itself was amazing but I, personally, am replacing the book's ending with the movie's ending because it is sweeter, more believable, and an actual ENDING!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"An extraordinarily powerful novel. Touches all the bases of the classical love story, which I believe this will be counted among them. Nicholas Sparks has a time tested style: authentic characters woven into a floating prose. This novel should be handed out as standard issue in English Lit classes, given away to friends and lovers, and shared between wives and husbands.Trust this author. He does not cheat and offer cheap soap-opera gimmicks or cheese to keep the story moving and flowing. This is the first Nicholas Sparks novel that I have read. It&#65533;s not going to be last."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read the book and watched the movie and both were terrible!! The characters are never developed, they're just there. Noah and Allie fall in love but it's never described how it happened or when they first felt it. Sparks never describes any of their dates so that we could see how they interacted.All we know is they meet, they fall in love, parents disapprove, they go their seperate ways, meet again, end of story. That's it, and that's pretty much how it's written.Characters are introduced that are never spoken of again, such as Sparks describes one of Noah's neighbors that he would occasionaly have dinner with and talk to. But after that paragraph describing him he's never spoken of again. Nor do we ever hear Noah mention him.This book is incredibly predictable as are a lot of romance novels these days, but most usually offer some sort of twist to it. I suppose that's what the ending was but it wasn't much of one. One could easily guess at the ending. Thats why I said it reads like a grocery list. Two people meet:check. One is from the \\"wrong side of the tracks\\":check. Parents disapprove:check. Meet later and fall back in love after each has supposbly moved on with their life:check check. There is some sort of obstacle they must overcome to be together: Check, check, checkout time.This book could have been a lot better, it's a great idea for a book but isn't written well."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book is astoundingly awful. It has almost no plot, character development, or conflict. It is completely predictable, boring, and slow. It brims with syrup-y ingenuine unbelievable sentimentality expressed in childish cliched prose.The protagonists are flawless and over idealized. The writing itself is nauseating. One protagonist is described as a &quot;living poem&quot;.The other's &quot;every movement exudes sexuality&quot;.Read the other criticisms. They tend to be right on the money.My sister-in-law gave the notebook to me for Xmas because it &quot;changed her life&quot;. I'm baffled as to how. And I'm not just a heartless male. I've enjoyed several &quot;Oprah&quot; books.&quot;The Notebook&quot; is cotton candy. Overly sweet puffed air in pretty colors that will leave you with a stomach ache."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I haven't read a book this bad since The Bridges of Madison County or Love Story, both runaway bestsellers like this one. The Notebook is bad in just about every way a book can be bad.PLOT There is a contrived feel to it, contrived to give the reader a warm and fuzzy feeling and perhaps jerk a tear or two. The manipulation is just too obvious. Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy findss girl again, boy loses girl again, boy gets girl again, boy loses girl again, boy gets girl back. No kidding. Count them up for yourself as you read the book. It's just nonsense.CHARACTERS Noah and Allie are just too too nice, too too talented, too too sensitive. He spouts poetry and she paints pretty pictures. There are no contradictions whatsoever within either character. Each just glides along on rails. And because of this, they are unlike any real people I know and they are not believable.WRITING There is an abundance of purple prose, of redundancies, of pronouns that don't refer to the nearest antecedent, errors of syntax, etc. Obviously some people like all this, as evidenced by the number of five-star reviews for this book. But that doesn't make this well written or even competently written.DIALOGUE Noah and Allie don't talk in the manner of any two people I have ever known. It is stilted, over-cooked, groan inducing, right up there with the closing line of Eric Segal's Love Story.The only redeeming quality of the book is that it is short, despite all the purple prose. And I am thankful for that."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The book was good but if you love the movie you won't love the book... it is a love story but not from the same angle... I was disapointed in it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is a difficult book to review. I have seen the film, which I absolutely loved, and which is now one of my all time favourite romance flicks. As I read the book I could only imagine the characters as they were in the film. Fortunately for me, this was fine as I think the actors are great, and now I have also read the book, a perfect match for Allie and Noah.I also had difficulty with reading the actual story that was told within the pages. I kept filling in the blanks with scenes from the film. I think this was because the book didn't show the whole story of Allie and Noah, just the part where they see each other again after many years apart. The young romance we are shown in the movie are just fleeting memories and flashbacks in the book. The movie gives us a lot more detail of certain times in Allie and Noah's life that weren't actually developed fully in the book.The Notebook is a very quick read at only 189 pages and a part of me wishes that it was a lot longer. I wish the book showed us the story of young Allie and Noah and let us live and feel their romance and passion and what it meant to them. The fact they fell in love again after fourteen years apart with just a few minutes together would have been more deeply felt by me had I lived through their romance all those years ago.The film also had a profound affect on me regarding Noah and Allie and the difficulties they faced in old age. I think the impact would have been far greater when reading the book, if I had been shown the whole story of Allie and Noah. And I think this is why I prefer the movie to the book, which is very unusual for me, as I usually dislike or am disappointed with movie adaptations as directors seem to change so much. But the director of The Notebook film was very respectful and there are only minor changes and maybe a different interpretation of the ending. But again, I was okay with it as I actually preferred it to the ending of the book, which was a little ambiguous for my taste.Overall I loved The Notebook. Sparks did a great job capturing emotions and pulling hard on my heart strings. It still brought tears to my eyes, although didn't have me blubbering like the movie. This is a sweet love story. It's sad as well as beautiful. It also reminds us of our own mortality, of love, loss, life and death. And it broke my heart.Verdict:If you enjoy reading love stories or watching romance movies then this book is certainly for you. I really enjoyed it, but for me it doesn't come close to the impact that the film had on me, but this may be because I already knew the story and what was coming. However, I whole heartedly recommend this book, you won't be disappointed (I also say, go rent the movie!)"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"As an avid fan of literature and a strong supporter of the theory that all books are better than their film counterparts, I was saddened to discover that my beliefs were refuted with The Notebook. The novel is mundanely formatted, I found Sparks' writing to be somewhat lacking in the fluidity and depth I expected of him.The enthralling tale of teenage lovers who rekindle their passion after years of misunderstood silence held so much promise-- and then fell flat. Each line is positively dripping with utopian goo and the characters exist in a glossed-over world reminiscent of a period soap opera. If you are going to attempt a storyline this dramatic, the characters need to be rich in emotional depth and the reader needs to feel every heart-wrenching plot twist. Ultimately, Sparks fails to make his novel human-- his characters have no flaws, his story progresses without a hitch, and I am left on the outside of this perfunctory narrative without a care as to what happens next."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was so beautiful, I couldn't put it down.

If you have not read this book yet, you must."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"First off, let me ask you this question: Are you a big romance novel enthusiast? No? Me either now that I'm older and less dreamy-eyed. Okay, now, have you ever seen the movie? Me too. Liked it. Took it back to the video store despite some great classic actors.What I did was feel something for the Alzheimer's and cancer victim's plight in the story because both diseases run in my family. If they do in yours, hold onto your hat. I don't always like Nicholas Sparks, but this novel won me over in every way. Not only is this novel better than the movie, but it is short and poetic in writing style without ever being completely sappy. His story of Noah and Allie as both young people with strength and old people past the twilight of their years is so sad and painful, yet so beautiful and touching, that it will make the most hardened of hearts begin to believe in a love born of destiny all over again.I got the sound recording of this book narrated by Barry Bostwick, but Sparks has an incredible way of telling this story with heartbreaking detail, enhanced by beautiful new age music, so maybe that helped, but the tale of the joys of youthful love, and how people never grow old in each others' eyes even decades after time and conditions take their toll is crushing. I laughed and cried (God, I sound like that horrible guy in all those movie commercials!), but it was for very good reason. Sparks has a poetic and gentle soul that shines like a lighthouse in a deep fog. His writing style is incredible in the Notebook and, as a literature student, this is one book you'll want to take notes on."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"You can't go wrong with Nicholas Sparks' novels. Once you read one, you want to read all of them."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks has written a moving and heart-felt story about two young people who's love covers a lifetime.Allie is a young girl from the city who has come with her parents to their summer home. Soon, she meets Noah, a local boy who lives near Allie's parents' house. After a while, the two begin going steady and they develop very deep feelings for each other. However, Allie's mother informs her that the family will be leaving to go back to their regular home. Allie is crushed by the news, and she sadly goes to tell Noah. A fight ensues between the two, and both say things they really don't mean. Allie enrolls in college, and Noah enlists in the Army and serves in Europe.After the war, Noah returns home and buys a local plantation home that is very run-down. But he restores it to immaculate condition. The story of the house soon reaches the local press, and Noah's handywork appears on the front page of many papers. Meanwhile, Allie served as a volunteer nurse during the war. She met a young soldier named Lon, who she's fallen madly in love with. But she sees the story of Noah's house and she realizes that she must see it for herself. Soon, she's back with Noah, and all of the earlier feelings they shared come rolling back like a tidal wave. Now, Allie must choose between Noah, her first love, and Lon, the man that cares very deeply for her now. She agonizes over her decision, but in the end, she makes the decision that she believes is best for her. Who will she choose?This is an excellent book. I read it as a requirement for a Master's degree course, and from the beginning, I was drawn in by the striking story of Allie and Noah. Nicholas Sparks has done a magnificent job in both character development and storytelling. The reader can easily identify with Noah, the hard-working ex-soldier, Lon, the successful lawyer, and Allie, the beautiful woman who must make a painful yet happy decision.I give this book my highest recommendation. The story and characters will draw you in and keep your attention throughout. Read this great book and see how true love can overcome any obstacle."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is, once again, another good romantic novel from Nicholas Sparks, who wrote A Walk to Remember and Message in a Bottle.I started to read this book because my cousin had bought it. If she didn't bought it back home, I would not know this book. When I first saw its cover, I just only think \\"NOT ROMANTIC STORY AGAIN,\\" because she likes to read this kind of book very much. After she finished reading it, she tried to persuade me to read this book like she did. I just picked it up and kept it on shelf in my room for many days. Lastly, I read it in my free time, when bored from other activities.The book started with an old man reading a book to an old woman who was in a nursing home. The story that he read was about Noah, a mill worker, who fell in love with Allie, a city girl from a rich family. They loved each other very much. They had spent most of the time together. One day they had to be apart, but they still loved and missed each other very much. They had not met each other since then.Many years passed, Allie found her new boyfriend, Lon. They already planned to marry in a few days but before the time had come she saw the article about Noah on the newspaper. So she decided to come to the town where Noah lived, because she wanted to meet Noah, her ex-boyfriend, one last time.What happen next? Do you want to know? Nah!! I will not spoil you, so I will not tell you anymore. I just want to tell that this story is full of romantic and a very good story for both old and new lover couples. It gives you a very good feeling about love. Just try to read it and find out the conclusion of this book by yourself. Try it once and you will never put it down until you finished reading it as I did.RiBoSomE"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I bought this book because of the hype and I was not impressed with it. I gave it 3 stars because they get married in the end and Noah really loves Allie and Allie is no pushover but that's it. The ending sucks and is very depressing. It shows no optimism for the future, just indicates that Allie remembers him enough to boink him on their anniversary. There are way more romantic books out there with more depth and optimism. Nicholas Sparks has written way better and there have been better movies out there and this isn't one of them."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is the best book.It's SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GoodITRocks"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The special summer when allie and noah once fell in love was quite short. And 14 yrs. later whr a lot of things could've happened didnt stop them frm wondering on &quot;what if's&quot;.

Their past love story was romantic but the hell with nicholas sparks cuz it left me pondering &quot;What then?!it didnt made me cry at all even though it was sad how allie cant remember noah and how strong thier love was to each other that it can create a &quot;miracle&quot;.

It was a powerful love story that we can share with others."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"It's a love story, the main characters are handsome, intelligent, she's rich, his poor, but they are \\"perfect\\" for each other. The end is perfectly predictable. After reading 20 pages, you will know how it ends... Honestly I finished this book because it's very short (thanks God!), otherwise I would have jumped to the last page. So if you want to read a mushy predictable love novel, read this one, you won't be disappointed. I hope they never make it a movie."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I received this book as a gift and blew right through it, the novel has good flow. Yes, it's about how 2 fall in love, part, and come back again, how love conquers all in ways that medicine and logistics can't even explain. Though tactile and sweet, I found &quot;The Notebook&quot; to be simplistic and unoriginal. I was waiting for the twists and turns, the thought provocation and came up somewhat empty in the end."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was excited to read this book initially because I heard Sparks is a good writer but I was dissapointed very early on. Sometimes predictable books are fun but this one was too predictable in the sad sort of loathsome way. Sparks did a good job of characterizing the two main characters with their weaknesses and strengths but the two characters weren't exactly the least common kinds of people. I was dissapointed with the main characters actions towards her fiance and they both acted like small children who didn't know much about right and wrong, either that or they didn't care. I skimmed most of the book because my eyes could not stay on the page long enough to finish it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I expected this book to be engaging, but what I found was 2-dimensional characters and predictable outcomes.

It's unreal as to how many people this probably happens to in real life. I feel Sparks &quot;caught&quot; the real life drama in this novel. The characters were very well written, my heart really went out to Noah, it was if I felt I was listening to a love story being told by my own Grandfather. This is a must read book, especially if you love romances. Sparks once again does a great job. When you read this story, don't forget your box of tissue's! The ending really touched me."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Actually I thought this would be a nice time-passer after seeing Message in the bottle and that for a second time I would be able to escape into emotional trip. But the story was too foreseen, caracters and whereabouts of story were similiar to that in Message. Again there was water, this time a river, and Allison is a painter as Catherine in MITB. There were to many similarity with MITB that this novel can stand fo itself and give something new and on the other hand that old romantic passion. I was specially mindful to letters, for a search of that little moments that MITB made my life more genuin. But those were nothing comparable to ones in MITB and though I read it in several hours it has left me a taste of a bitter orange.

And there is nothing wrong with that. Enjoying &quot;Message In A Bottle&quot; led me to this short and sweet love story.In this novel, we meet Noah Calhoun. A rugged scamp of a man who is still yearning for the past love of his life. Allie Nelson is now a socialite engaged to a wealthy attorney. Alas, she also craves her long ago romance with the boy that took her breath away.Sparks does a complete job of making a twist on an old plotline. Including conundrum victories and glimpses into aging human behavior. As I was pulled into these characters lives, the haunting song &quot;Where've You Been&quot; by Kathy Mattea, kept whirlpooling in my mind.So, if you are in the mood for action adventure, look elsewhere.

Then on a lazy weekend I picked it up and started reading it myself. I haven't been the same since.I instantly fell in love with the lead character, Noah. I'm ready to rush down to North Carolina and find the man. The details brought out in the writing, the pace of the story, the emotions that fuel the pages, it was just too much.I found myself fighting back tears on each page, thinking that this story is just too incredable. But the thing I kept rememboring is that it is a real story, that some where people love that much, care that much. It was truly an event that opened up my heart again."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is a cutesy little book about Noah and Allie who've lost track of each other since their teenage years. When Noah returns home from WW2, Allie visits. Will they get together despite the fact that Allie is engaged? I think that sums up the plot rather well. You can probablly write the rest of the story yourself. Its sappy, syrupy sweet and makes Bridges of Madison County look like a Hemingway novel. But yeah, its romantic, its what you wish romance in real life could always be like. Makes you wonder if everyone can write a novel and be successful?"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I'm surprised that the most recent readers who reviewed this book were so disappointed.

I have never read a love story that inchanted me so much. I hope he writes many more."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"What a waste of time. My wife and I just read The Notebook and were disappointed by almost every facet of it. Most of the dialogue was contrived and totally unreal. I don't care how romantic Noah is drawn up to be, no man speaks like that; unbelievable (in a bad way). One reviewer said the ending was creepy, and I would say that is putting it nicely. Another thing that was really stupid was that Sparks tries to give Allie virtue, yet she cheat's on her fianc&eacute; without remorse. Total character flaw, again unbelievable.Did I mention the writing was horrid? Sparks jumps between perspectives way to much. Third person is good, but he puts us in the mind of Allie and Noah in the same scene on more than one occasion. It surprises me Warner bought the rights in the first place. Not only that but the editor should be fired.I paid a mere 5.95 for the paperback and trust me that was too much."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I actually saw the movie before I read the book. The movie was so wonderful and emotional not one person left the theater with a dry eye, especially me. I always heard and knew from my own reading experience that the book is usually better than the movie. That is soooo not true in this case. I found the book very disappointing and very unsatisfying. It missed so much of the emotion that was in the movie that I closed the book in tears for what I missed from the movie. It didn't even end the same way as the movie. The writing was so boring that I skimmed through most of it and had the book done within 2 days. I should hav known a lot was missing from the book by how skinny it was. As stated in one of the other reviews, the main point of the character's dating was missed, such as their adventures, and their talks, how their love grew, the night they both lost their virginity. What exactly they did before she left town, how she met Lon and what happened to Noah during the war and after. He missed telling about the relationship Noah shared with his father. And why exactly he fixed up the old house, and how long he took to do it and all the hard work put into it. It missed so much emotion that I am going to see the movie again to get the taste of the book out of my mouth. This is one instance where the book should have been written AFTER the movie was made. Sorry Mr. Sparks, hopefully you took notes from the movie to improve your next novel."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"After I read this book, I watched the movie, and I can say that I LOVE The Notebook! I have written down mine and my husband's story and keep a detailed journal of our lives. I cannot wait to get Alzheimer's disease and have him read it to me when we are old! I have begun saving money so that we can turn our three bedroom house into an old folk's home so we can live here forever. I watch the weather channel religiously so I know when there is rain in the forecast, then I can be prepared. I stand in the rain and yell for my husband to come out and kiss me and then we have passionate sex on the floor of the living room. I make sure to remind my teenage daughter to leave her first true love, so that he will be able to steal her away from her rich fiance that she will settle for later in life. She understands that this is the only way that she will have her happy ending.

It seemed all over the place, yet only in one place, I don't know I'm still like .... ok? However, despite that there were a few passages that had me on the verge of tears. I wish he (Mr. Sparks) wrote the whole book in the poetic way he wrote some of the letters the characters had written to one another. I could've done without the minute detailing of each and every movement, it dragged the story out and oftentimes I was like &quot;come on&quot;. What saved this book for me was his idea of Soul Mate love. That made up for a lot of the nuances the book had. All in all it seemed rush."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"My favorite book still remains &quot;A Walk To Remember&quot; but that doesn't mean that &quot;The Notebook&quot; isn't a good book. It sure has its moments and really tunes you into the book. It's a good story but it didn't really captivate me as much as &quot;A walk to remember&quot; did. It starts off a bit dull and then gets really interesting and ends dull. The end was also a bit strange and weird. If you're in a situation where you don't know whether to buy &quot;a walk to remember&quot; or &quot;the notebook,&quot; pick &quot;a walk.&quot; There is a movie already completed for the book that will star Mandy Moore.

Shopping at Amazon's is really easy!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Krystina Sanders December 4,2004The NotebookNoah and Allie started off by having a summer fling, but then things got serious and they actually got a lot closer then they ever thought that they would. Allie was in the high class and Noah was leaning towards the poor class. None of that mattered to them, as long as they had each other they were okay with anything that was happening.Noah enjoyed poetry, because he used to have a lisp when he was younger, and his father made him read poetry aloud so the lisp would go away. He read it to his father almost every night, until Allie came along. When the two started dating, Noah had barely any time to spend with his father or read any poetry.Allie enjoyed painting and she would almost everyday draw or paint some kind of picture to hang in her room or to give to one of her friends. There was one painting that she had spent almost the whole summer on. It was a landscape, and she had given it to Noah before she left to New York at the end of the summer.The summer was over and Allie and Noah were two worlds from each other. They had never spoke to each other again, until Allie came in on a trip to New Bern. She had seen a picture of him in the newspaper, and she knew that she had to see him right away.Noah had always told Allie that he was going to buy a house that was a little outside of New Bern, and he would fix it up and make it look like it was brand new. According to the newspaper, he did fix up the place and make it look brand new.Allie was engaged to a lawyer named Lon, and she knew that if she did anything outside of her boundaries that she would jeopardizes her relationship with Lon. She had told Lon that she was going to go antique shopping and that she would be there for a few days. She knew lying to him wasn't the right thing to do, but if Lon knew the real reason why she was going to New Bern was to see Noah, then he wouldn't have allowed her to go.When Noah was just relaxing from a long days work around the house, he saw Allie pull up to his house. He was shocked to see her but yet he was happy that she decided to see him after fourteen years. They spent the evening together and when Allie went to the hotel that she was staying at, all they could do was sit in amazement about how good the each of them looked and how well they were doing. When Allie stepped out of her car they both were silent. They hadn't seen each other in fourteen years, so they were a little surprised to see each other. They spent three days together, until... on the fourth day, Allie's mother came over to Noah's house, and told Allie that she had to choose between Noah and Lon. They didn't tell the answer until the end of the book, but she had chosen Noah. They got married, and they had a boy and a girl, Allie developed amnesia, and by the time she was fifty, she had forgotten who Noah was, and who she was, who her children were, and where she was. They grew up, and they went to an old people's home, and Noah read he story of their lives to her everyday, and sometimes, she remembered, and sometimes she didn't."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"While I was reading this book, I couldn't stop thinking I's reading a cheap romance book. Mostly, macho guys and slender blodies are drawn on top of the cover pages of those cheap romance books, but this book perfectly disguised itself with a beautiful southern scene on its cover pretending to be a novel with a soft and valuable romantic story that brings awe and respect. Also, as I was deeply impressed by &quot;A walk to remember&quot; by the same author, I thought this book would have something to cherish and adore.The author abanded commitment a long time ago, just concentrating on sensual feelings adult male and female have based on their good ol' memories from their teenage year. There's nothing more~!! Does this mean that you're supposed to give in to one, as far as you think he/she's the first love or ever love you have had, even though you decided to comit yourself to someone else? Neah... it's not true love. Noah and Allie tried to live on their memories and comit adultery someway. Whatever the end is, it's wrong to have the romance ignited in that way. and... it's just...

If you like romance novels, you'll probably like this book better than I did.As for the unconditional love part, yeah, it's there, but I think that I have seen the scenario from the end of this book (to say more would be a spoiler) in real life and don't see that the story here stands out more clearly as a shining example.Oh well, on to some of the other fantastic literature out there just waiting for me to read."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"i had went and seen the movie when it first come out at the theater.I went out of that theater just a baling like a two year old.I not got to read the book yet but, i really can't wait until the movie comes out.

I have never read a book that was so... blatantly graphic in it's portrayal of &quot;love making&quot; - So graphic that it went from a sweet, innocent tale of childhood love rekindled... to a harlequin romance novel under guise of a love story. It was as if I were watching a couple exact their love from a tree outside their window. Now, excuse me if you disagree here... but I rather don't like the whole &quot;peeping-tom&quot; feeling.

He showed the value of nature and romance in this story about two young people falling in love, loosing each other, and finding what they lost years later.

Allie and Noah fall head over hills and cannot spend enough time together. However, Allie's parents do not approve of Noah because he is not as wealthy and known as their family. They feared the embarrassment that Noah and Allie's relationship would bring, and forced Allie to move before the relationship became more serious. Although the two teenagers tried very hard to stay together, there was nothing they could do. Noah continued to write Allie for 365 days, but never got a response and began to lose hope. Allie's life was also moving on as she became a nurse during WWII and met a wonderful man that her family actually loved and Allie and him eventually became engaged. Everything seemed to be going perfect until Allie picked up a newspaper and saw Noah standing in front of a house that he had completely redone. She noticed the house because when they were together they went there and Noah said he was going to buy it and build a wrap-around porch for Allie to sit and do her paintings. Allie was taken back to the way she felt when she was with him and knew she had to go and see him. When she saw him, all the love and excitement that she was once full of came rushing back. But she does still have a fianc&eacute; and family that she has to deal with. She has to make a life changing decision and hope it will be the right one. An elderly man is actually telling the story of Allie and Noah to an elderly woman in a nursing home. The woman has Alzheimer's and is having a rough day, so the man thought he would try to cheer her up with a sappy love story. There are so many good meanings behind the story. It is a wonderful southern romance with controversy and life lessons that everybody needs and wants to learn."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I thought it was a good book. I saw the movie then read the book, and i thought they both were good. The only bad part was the endings dragged on in both. Other than that, they were great, and i'm not that easily entertained."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"\\"The Notebook\\" is a beautiful story that revolves around a 60-year love affair between Noah Calhoun and Allie Nelson. The teenagers meet in North Carolina during the summer of 1932 and quickly fall in love. Noah and Allie come from very different backgrounds, and Allie's wealthy parents aren't thrilled at the idea of their daughter ending up with someone like Noah, who comes from a very poor family. Allie and her family eventually leave town at the end of the summer. Noah writes love letters to Allie for the next two and a half years, but Mrs. Nelson intercepts his messages and Allie never receives them.Many years go by, and Allie and Noah both attempt to go on with their lives. Noah returns to the town of New Bern after fighting in World War II and spends time restoring the house of his dreams. Allie abandons her dream of becoming an artist and becomes engaged to a wealthy attorney. When Allie reads a newspaper article about Noah's restoration project, she journeys to New Bern to see him one last time. Even though fourteen years have passed, Noah and Allie realize that the feelings they once shared for each other never went away: in fact, they are stronger than ever. Allie is then faced with the most difficult decision of her life: will she follow her heart and remain with Noah, or will she be loyal to her fiance?Nicholas Sparks hasn't really created groundbreaking literature with this novel, but it is a really beautiful love story about two people who are truly destined to be together. What makes this book so unique is that the character of Noah is actually reading the story of him and Allie to his wife who is now in a nursing home suffering from the advanced stages of Alzheimer's. \\"The Notebook\\" isn't just another story about a couple getting together. Sparks paints a picture of a love that stands the test of time and survives far beyond the \\"happily ever after\\" stage. Some critics probably think the novel has a tragic ending, but I'm a sappy romantic at heart and I think the ending is very beautiful, reminiscent of \\"Romeo and Juliet.\\" Noah and Allie are an illustration of what true love should be.This book is a pretty quick read...I finished the whole thing in one sitting and it took me just under two hours to complete. \\"The Notebook\\" is written in a style reminiscent of \\"The Bridges of Madison County,\\" but I think Noah and Allie are a much stronger couple than Robert and Francesca. Bottom line: if you're looking for a great love story, then \\"The Notebook\\" is definitely the book for you."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Novel is beautifully written by Nicholas Sparks. When two young kids Noah and Allie fall in love at a carnival one summer, thinking nothing could go wrong until they're dramatically split apart and when Allie's parents don't support her love for Noah, their love grows stronger and is almost impossible to stop. Noah wrote her everyday for about a year and when she never returned any of his letters he knew something was wrong but it wasn't over. Although this novel is a very romantic and realistic story, it has some low points. For example, the beginning is a little bit confusing with who is actually telling the story. However there were also many high's to this novel, whether it was the breathtaking passion between Noah and Allie or the strive to keep your true love. I would definitely recommend this book. I would only recommend it to teens and adults because they're many points in the novel where there's a lot of maturity and I think that you should have a high maturity level to understand what Nicholas Sparks is saying about finding your true love."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"As I found myself nearing the end of the book, I could feel my heart about to burst from my chest. It it brought sadness and tears, happiness and hope. Quick read for any taste."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This love story definitely brought me to tears. After spending 1 1/2 years of reading self help, new age books, this was a nice diversion. You couldn't help but love Noah. He was strong, soft, and everything in between. His devotion and love for his wife was beautiful. The tragedy in their life was incomprehensible. This book was well written. I enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"what a lovely story ...

Yes, it's not a &quot;classic.&quot; But why do we read books in the first place? For an escape, to dream, to imagine, to be entertained. The Notebook delivers on all fronts. It's a one-sitting read, a great way to spend an evening -- and this is coming from a guy. Cynics and English professors need not apply. **Note to movie fans. Pray Keanu Reaves is busy."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Not much to say. A genre romance with a twist. How the sorts of books that are on the best seller list these days get there, I will never understand."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"My husband was worried when I hadn't stopped sobbing for several minutes after I closed the book. He is reading it now and, while he hasn't shed a tear yet, seems to be enjoying it. The book is an easy read, no doubt. But I resent the comparison to &quot;The Bridges of Madison County&quot; - which I consider sentimental trash about someone who risks what she has in a good marriage for a torrid little affair with a drifter (actually, it would've been a much more interesting book had it been presented that way!). The characters in &quot;The Notebook&quot; are at least responsible - to each other and to those around them. The angle of the Alzheimers is the story, not the relatively simplistic romance."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I cant' believe I could read something worse than the Bridges of Madison County. Nothing is believable in this novel. I still wonder how the author could come up with that stupid end (without that it could have deserved a rating 2). There is more to love than sex, mr. Sparks, especially (and hopefully) after your hair starts whitening."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The story is very charming, but what grabbed me was the sad and lonely way this journey had to end.

I thought we were in love. This book shows me, we have a long way to go. I am not the emotional type, but this book led me very near to tears and that my friends is hard to do. After the first chapter or so, I couldn't understand what all the commotion was about, and was about to close it. I'm glad I didn't, for this relatively short book will be with me a very long time. I recommend this book to the young, the old, unmarried as well as married. If only we could all love each other in the same manner, this would be one wonderful world to live in."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The year is 1946, and thirty-one-year-old Noah Calhoun is back living in North Carolina, after escaping from World War II unscathed. However, instead of being haunted by war images, he is haunted by images of his first love, the one who got away back when he was a mere teenager in the year 1932. Allie was everything he'd ever wanted, and never expected to find in a girl. Smart, beautiful, and she loved him. Little does he know, but Allie has never forgotten him either. Twenty-nine-year-old socialite Allie Nelson is about to enter into a deep, serious marriage with Lon, a wealthy lawyer, whom she cares deeply for, but isn't in love with. So, three weeks before her wedding day, Allie decides to head towards coastal North Carolina to visit Noah, hoping that she will be able to prove to herself that their romance was nothing more than young love, but what she finds is quite different, and leaves her in a heartbreaking predicament, choosing between two men she cares for.When I saw the movie trailers for THE NOTEBOOK, I felt that it looked interesting, and decided to go out and read the book before seeing the movie. I was unsure of what I would find, but after reading this treasure from Nicholas Sparks I am happy that I chose to do so. THE NOTEBOOK is one of the most touching, and beautifully written novels that I have ever had the chance to discover. The words are passionate and thought-provoking, leaving the reader full of joy and happiness, as well as longing. From the moment you delve into page one, you will be unable to remove your eyes or mind from this amazing work of literature, and while the reader will be saddened to see the book come to an end, they will also be filled with satisfaction. A must-read book this summer, or anytime of the year for that matter.Erika Sorocco"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I began to read The Notebook at 7 AM this morning hoping to finish it for the much anticipated opening of the movie tomorrow. I finished it around 11 o'clock AM.. I have never finished a book this quickly. Its a pageturner and I can say that I have never cried like I did over this book in any other book that I've read before. The plot is amazing and truly touched my heart. Noah is that country boy that all of us girls from the midwest dream of and Allie was his soulmate. Their love was so respectful and genuine, it pulled at my heart. I didnt think that I would love another Nicholas Sparks book more than I loved A Walk to Remember but this one clearly wins. I was thrilled from start to finish with The Notebook and Im going to be first in line to see how the movie turns out tomorrow."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book in two days! I fell in love with it. I had it on my list of books to read and when I saw a clip for the movie, I ran out and bought it so I could read it before the movie. I cannot WAIT to see the movie! They seem very similar, book &amp; movie so I am just thrilled.If you love to read love stories, this will touch you like no other! That is all I can really say without giving away too much. I couldn't stop crying!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A quick read of LOVE. If you read at a decent speed, you can finish this book before you fall asleep in one evening. haven seen the movie first, you can visualize all of the characters in the book. It makes you wonder, if you are still single, if you will ever experience this form of true love in your life. Thus, it can make you feel very depressed if you start comparing yourself to the characters in the book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The book really captivated me. In fact the second I got it, I started to read it, and finished it the same day. The story was just so brilliant. I really fell in love with it. And I completely understood all the feelings, it was like I was there. The only problem was the ending, it was, like someone else said, too short, it was too sudden, and I wanted more of the beginning. I really want to see the film, I just hope it doesnt end as quickly as it did in the book. Maybe its just the way the author writes. Just like with a Walk to Remember the ending was sudden. Just like bam, it was over. Anyways, the book is really, again, very captivating, and just sucks you into it, you cant look away."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Overall, I thought this was a great book. I had seen the previews for the movie on TV, and that's what interested me in it at first. I've never been one to say that &quot;the book is always better than the movie,&quot; but I'll be interested to see how the movie vs. the book pans out on this one.Sparks did an excellent job in creating a vision with his detail and descriptive language. There were even a few points during my reading that I found myself picturing the story happening between my first love and I! However, I was a little disappointed that Sparks got me so involved in the story but then decided to tell the most important parts (I don't want to give away the ending) through a second party conversation. And I was a little disappointed with the ending because I thought it ended very suddenly and without a lot of closure.So, I give the book 3 stars because of the memories and emotions it evoked."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Any and every emotion I could experience, I did with this book. It was on my sister in law's coffee table and I glanced at the first page just to see what she had been reading. I seriously couldn't but the book down. I took it home and finished it that night! I'm a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks. I've read most of his books now and this is by far my favorite. I recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I bought The Notebook after seeing the preview for the upcoming movie based on the novel. I was kind of dissapointed in the book because I expected something much different.I would've like if Nicholas Sparks go into Allie and Noah's relationship before the &quot;reunion&quot; instead of going straight to it.Other than this flaw (in my opinion), I found the book fairly entertaining. It was really touching how Noah read the Notebook to Allie everyday when Allie developed Alzheimer's. But I found the end... well... disturbing and kind of gross.I still plan on seeing the movie and I hope it will be a better representation of this love story than the book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I wanted to read this book after seeing the previews for the movie, which made it look really good. However, I was surprisingly disappointed. Reading the story, I kept expecting some major plot twist or turn, but - surprise, surprise - it ends exactly how you think it will. You automatically know who the man and woman are when you begin reading the book, and it's not hard to guess who Allie chooses to marry at the end. Also, it was kind of hard to believe that they could so easily revive their 3-month relationship after 14 years. Fourteen years ago I was six! That's a good bit of time there. And the way the book ends is kind of creepy...I wouldn't recommend this book unless you're a sappy romantic who cried at &quot;Titanic.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The love described in this book doesn't come along too often, and only to the lucky.When these two people meet, they find they were meant to be together, and battle many different odds to be united.

The whole feel of the book was it was trying too hard to evoke an emotional response from its readers. The only response I managed to muster was laughter. The premise had all the makings of a promising novel. What resulted instead was a poorly executed made-for-tv movie-of-the-week script disguising itself as a touching human drama. The characters were annoying...one dimensional and lacking any sense of depth or reality for that matter. I kept hoping the story would get better and it finally did---when I closed the very last page and realized it was finally over"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Beware of all the &quot;10&quot; reader ratings. I found this book lacking in substance &amp; character depth. Sparks doesn't even take the trouble to explain why the &quot;sparks&quot; flew between the two main characters or why the flame kept burning for so long. I laughed all the way to the ending. &quot;The Notebook&quot; is nothing but a spin-off of the &quot;Bridges&quot; tale by Waller. Why can't writers &amp; their editors come up with more unique idea content? I mean, come on, let's give everyone reading the book a good cry now by letting one of the character's come down with Alzheimer's. I found this book a feeble attempt at capturing the essence of enduring love. I think if the book is ever made into a movie, I will save my seven dollars &amp; cut my losses.

When so much time is spent in reading a book only to get to the end and it is so sad leaves a very bad taste in ones mouth. Hopefully, his next book will have nicer endings or endings that can be clearly figured out. Right now I, like so many other people I know have no desire to read another sad doom and gloom saga."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I'm embarrassed for all the people who liked this book. I agree with the reader from northeast PA (July 11) that reading it was a complete waste of time. It doesn't entertain, enlighten, inspire, or make you feel anything except complete disgust with yourself for having bought the book in the first place. I'd recommend something of true literary quality, but most of the reviewers of The Notebook would never appreciate or understand it if I did."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I can't believe how many people liked this book--they must not do much reading or they'd know how completely unremarkable this is. The characters are cardboard and the story is 100% unoriginal. The numerous descriptive and explanatory passages are unimaginative and try the patience. Somebody in my book group selected this; what a joke--there was absolutely nothing to discuss. Plus, the ending was completely manipulative, pouring on the sentiment to try to get you to care about characters that are completely unreal. I guess Nicholas Sparks is laughing all the way to the bank, but as a writer he has no talent. The only kind of book I can't stand is the kind that insults my intelligence, and this one does. To the people who loved this: please, browse around amazon.com and expand your horizons a bit. If you do more reading, maybe your taste will improve."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I found the story to be a wonderful heart warming novel. I could really relate to the feelings of the characters. There honesty with each other. There true feelings of closeness and the way they both loved each other so deeply. Like Nicholas Sparks mentioned, &quot;Marriage these days just doesn't seem to last&quot; it's extremely sad. This book was special to me because the characters had a true passion for each other which lasted a lifetime. For better for worse till death do them apart.I pray that Nicholas Sparks will keep writing such wonderful books that just take my breath away. I have never read any other books which touch my heart so deeply. It really fills that place in my heart that I always wished for. (everlasting true love). I really wish people could cherish love the way Allie &amp; Noah did in the novel. What a great gift in life to be able to have. Life is all what you make of it. It was also inspiring to hear that Nicholas's wifes grandparents had lived such a wonderful journey in life together. May God bless them always."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A friend of mine strongly suggested this story because I was raised by my grandparents and she thought I would relate to the story and enjoy it - which I did whole-heartedly. I read the first 30 pages at a slow pace and crying almost immediately after I picked up the book. After letting the book collect dust for about two months, I picked it up again last night and did not put it down until I finished late in the evening. The story was beautifully written and took you through every emotion you could imagine. It was especially hard to get through towards the end when Allie and Noah are in the nursing home and Allie suffers from Altzheimer's. Having suffered through this with my own grandmother only a year ago, I know the pain of having someone you love so dearly not recognize you. I cried for about an hour and a half when I was reading the ending chapters of the book. I am now a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks and look forward to the movie that I'm sure will come soon - I just hope it can live up to the book! I'll bring a whole box of kleenex to that show!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Okay I admit it, I bought this book because I liked the different textures on the cover. Sadly, that's as exciting as it got. If you like love stories you will enjoy the fluff stuck in the middle. But come on, how unbelivable can you get. Not only was the writting poor (A lot of talkin' but not much said) but the plot was ridiculous. I'm sorry, but Alzhiemers dosen't work that way, no matter how much you love. For those who cried, are you sure it wasn't because you paid for this book?"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A friend told me to read this book (she loved it)and it just so happened that I had received a book store gift certificate for Christmas that I was dying to spend on a new, good book! What a disappointment! I want my certificate back!! I thought this book was the worst book I have ever read! I love romance and I believe in true love, but this gagged me so bad. It was horribly written and was so boring....I will not read another thing this guy writes. I won't even see the movie, &quot;A message in a Bottle&quot;.

Could have been written over a short weekend by a C- average high school student (in love)."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I enjoyed the book and felt empathy for Noah and Allie, although, at times during the description of their second meeting I just wanted to shout &quot;GET ON WITH IT--QUIT BEATING ABOUT THE BUSH!!!&quot; Sometimes, I felt the &quot;mushiness&quot; was overdone -- I wondered what these people did all day other than profess their undying love for each other. The reader was left with the impression that they hourly declared their love. I realize the story was about their love and not about the non-essentials of their lives, but I just wondered if they did anything else. I had trouble believing that for 14 years these people had met no one that was suitable, and that this love lingered from their teenage years when people are notorious for weekly new-loves. I don't think they had the maturity at their first meeting to recognize and value characteristics that they did, and at that age, their own values and characteristics are subject to fluctuation. That was a turn-off! to the reader. I think if the characters had been older at their first meeting it would have been more believable. I enjoyed the later years more - nursing home scenario and his feelings towards her. I think that was more in touch with reality. If you've spent 49 yrs with someone (in harmony) you would be devastated by Alzheimers and would do anything to try to reverse it and would miss the person enormously. I enjoyed the book, but one reading was enough(hearing actually, I checked out the audio form the local library) - I would not purchase."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Without being dramatic, this is, without a doubt, the worst book I have ever read. The story itself is rather trite but innocuous -- a slightly different spin on a love story you've heard before. There are no surprises here, in part because of how the story is told as a retrospect. The tale is not very imaginative, but it's inoffensive and the humdrum material is not what makes this an awful read.The &quot;prose&quot;, if you can call it that, is so horribly pedestrian and uninspiring. Sparks feels the need to form one awkward metaphor after another and catalogues with painstaking detail the minutia in a relatively bland world. Does anyone care how many glasses of sweet tea Noah consumes? The book is already short, but if you cut out the clutter and descriptions of mind-numbingly dull details, you'd see that Sparks really only had the material for a short story.A skilled writer might have made a relatively inspid idea palatable. Sparks is clearly not such a writer. My only condolence is that even with all the needless information, the book is still short and you can have it done in a few hours. I never thought I'd see the day when a movie adaptation so wholy surpassed its source material, but with &quot;The Notebook&quot;, things couldn't get much worse. I say just spend your $5.99 on the movie. It's slightly more charming and finishes even quicker than reading this tripe."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"It was books like this that killed Emma Bovary, and would that she had taken them all with her to her grave. An elderly man reads to an elderly woman every day from an aged notebook that he carries around with him. Within its pages is told the story of Noah Taylor Calhoun, a young Southerner, and of his great teenage passion for Allison Nelson. Alas, their affair came a cropper because she was of higher social station then him. But in the intervening years, during which he has sought his fortune in the North and fought in WWII, both have been unable to completely commit their hearts to others, because of the bond that still exists between them. But now, as she is about to marry an upper crust lawyer, Allison journeys to Noah's farm, where he has essentially secluded himself, to see what remains of the desire they once shared.Well, guess what ? A fair bit remains. And as the newly reunited lovers reminisce and feel out the situation, so to speak, Allison's mother and her fianc&eacute; come rushing into town to see just what she's getting herself into. Will Allison choose Noah or the lawyer, and which one is the old man who's reading her the notebook ?For one incredibly brief moment, I actually entertained the idea that Nicholas Sparks was going to throw us a curve and that it would turn out that the lawyer and Allison had shared fifty years of loving marriage, such that he remained so devoted that he could even read to her about these painful memories, that the message of the book would be that passion is all well and good, and exciting enough when you are young and stupid, but that it is a transitory and relatively meaningless thing, while love endures, and genuine love lasts for a lifetime. There's even a line that raises the possibility, when Allison acknowledges to herself that she doesn't actually love Noah, but is instead in love with the youthful lust they once had for one another. But Sparks tips his hand when she recalls the words her mother used to get her to break off with Noah all those years ago :[S]ometimes, our future is dictated by what we are, as opposed to what we want.Clearly this sentiment is intended to be abhorrent to us. Contrast it with the admonition she receives from Noah :You can't live your life for other people. You've got to do what's right for you, even if it hurtssome people you love.Ah, such is the monstrously selfish ethos of the romantic : we each only have one great love; it's rarely the person we're with at the moment; but when the \\"right\\" person comes along, all boorish behavior on our parts is to be excused; seize the moment--the consequences be damned; gimme, gimme, gimme, I want, I want...GRADE : D"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The notebook is by Nicholas sparks; a successful author who has beautifully wrote 17 numerous novels with themes that include Christian faith, love, tragedy, and fate. Although this novel was Nicholas sparks' first published novel, the book was on the New York Times best seller list in its first week of release, since the novel was so good. They made a popular movie out of this novel. Published by Warner books, the edition I am reviewing is 239 pages long with no illustrations. This book was inspired by the story of the grandparents of sparks' wife, who had been married over sixty years. Nicholas was very happy to see how much they cared and loved each other.Their magical love started out in the calm and beautiful town of New Bern, north California. This story is set in the year 1946. There's wealthy people and poor people, but it comes down to having the connections. Noah, the hard working gentlemen that just barely makes it threw life.

Noah, 31, is restoring a house that Allie thought would be their dream house when they were a young couple.Because Noah was poor, her parents felt like they needed to be broken up so her parents made her move away and Noah went to the war. The parents felt like they had totally different lives, which was true. Allie never cared about him not being a wealthy man but cared for him because of his personality and how generous he was. Not being able to forget about the woman who stole his heart, or the summer they spent together, Noah is prepared to live with only memories... until she unexpectedly returns to his town to see him once again.Allie nelson, 29, is now engaged to another man, but felt that the love she shared with Noah can never be replaced or fade. Although the issues they had when they were dating will stay the same, she still wants to be there with him. Allie, who is about to get married in a few weeks, feels that she needs to confront her hopes and dreams for the future, a future that only she can make.Once Allie went to visit Noah, her feelings for him came back quick as a bullet. Noah couldn't believe she was there, in his house, looking for him. The one thing that's keeping her from leaving her life behind is her fianc&eacute;e that she also loves. Who will she choose? Her teenage sweet heart that never had the chance to stay with her instead being forced away, or the guy she met in her new life that cares about her more than anything. Who is reading to Allie when she is old and doesn't remember?From teenagers who are just learning the concept of love, to the adults who are either looking for love or has found love. Everyone will enjoy this beautiful story of the notebook because it's touching and very moving. If you enjoy happy endings and romance that can inspire you to not give up on love and that it's out there, then I would definitely read this book. It will not disappoint.Alisson"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"What a compelling love story.

This story is so special and unique, that it will stay with you for a lifetime."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I know it is the kind of story that makes for great \\"chick flick movies\\" but this old guy loved the book. And loved is not too strong of a verb to use. Niccholas Sparks just keeps writing wonderful books that even macho guys can enjoy! I have not seen the movie but the book is moving enough. I can relate to falling in love with that special women - I married my high school girl friend in 1970 after we broke up in 1964 - have been happily married ever since then! I just could not get her off my mind while in Vietnam and I had to go back and find her. So these stories are not so unreal! This book is a FIVE STAR book because that is all the stars that I can rate it on this review."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This tearjerker will make you fall in love with falling in love. The simple story can be read in just one day if you have the time."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Oh this book is wondeful if you are a true romantic. It makes you yearn for that true kind of love. I know it is out there and I know it exists. It is wonderfully written and it pulls you in and keeps your attention. A true \\"can't put it down book\\".I've had the movie and this book since they both came out. I have read it twice.Bravo Nicholas Sparks!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have never been one to read a book when there is a movie, but i made the exception with The Notebook. The book was wonderful. I figured it wouldnt hold my attention since i had already seen the movie and knew the end result, but much to my surprise it did. I stayed up late reading, I just couldn't get enough. The book was great, it was funny, sad, romantic. I was very pleased with how well of an author Nicholas Sparks is. The characters and the plot of the story made the book i think. The story itself was great and left me with a fairy tale dream of what my marriage can someday be."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"D. Lane, I don't know what you are talking about, because love is great and powerful. The whole fact that it's a BOOK, and we know that some love cannot cure a disease such as that, it was a great story. And you know what? I'm 17, I've had a teenaged passion and love someone better than anyone I've ever known and we are getting married in March. The book was excellent and the movie was great! This book and movie will make you cry, it's a great story of true love and sticking together. D. Lane's review is completely wrong and insulting! You are insulting us by saying it's intelligence insulting. This book was full of romance and greatness. READ IT and see the MOVIE!! They are both great."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I don't have words to adequately describe the beauty of this story. The characters Allie and Noah have such deep love for each other, more love than seems humanly possible. While reading this book, I kept thinking about the relationship I now have with my wife, and about how we often let things get in the way of our love. I think deep down we have feelings like those of Allie and Noah. But not everyone is good at expressing those feelings (I tend to take things for granted). Before we know it, though, we're old and facing the twilight of our own lives. My greatest fear is that I will let life go by and never adequately express my own feelings. So I've made it a goal to be more expressive (and more loving) before it's too late. After all, things happen to people--sometimes not good things, and we have to do our best while we still have time. The message of the book, I think, is that there are ways to live; fulfilled ways, loving ways, which everyone can strive for and attain. Let yourself love and be loved, and you will find that despite its tragedy and pain, life is good.Share this book with someone you love. And go see the movie, for both are wonderful beyond imagining."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This little book may be too sweet for some but the premise is both lovely and touching. Some say this novella was written in the tradition of Bridges of Madison County but I think not. Where Bridges is pompous to the core, The Notebook is sweet and engaging, its characters real people who actually touch the heart. In Bridges, sex is sex, but in The Notebook sex is love...something that never goes out of style."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was in two minds about writing a review for this book and waited for 24 hours before going ahead. In one way,it makes you feel that such an all encompassing love is unachievable and that you just have a faint copy of the real thing and ,in another way,it made my throat really hurt with emotion that two people could have such a perfect union! Either way -it hurts!Don't read this right now if you're feeling emotionally vulnerable as you're going to cry for hours,either with joy or a sad ,lonely feeling!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I don't believe it's possible for Nicholas Sparks to write a bad book. Some authors just know how to tell a good story and Nicholas Sparks is one of them.Although \\"The Notebook\\" was written before \\"The Rescue\\", this is my second book I've read by him and again, without fail, he has written a masterful story.Unlike some other authors who try to fill their books with unnecessary words and pages (as if they're getting paid by the page), Nicholas Sparks doesn't fill his book with anything but good story telling, cover-to-cover. Just like if you were to feed your pet food full of fillers, in the end all you get is a whole lot of s**t. Not here. No fillers, no s**t!! Simply short and sweet.It's easy to finish this book in a day, but what a book. It's a sweet tale between two people who managed to keep their love despite the pull of time. This is simply a heart-warming, tear-jerking book filled with the bitterness of life, but overshadowed by the sweetness of True Love.What can I say, it may be short, but a good story is a good story, no matter how long. And this was, without a doubt, and excellent story. PERIOD."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Even though \\"The Notebook\\" is Nicholas Sparks first book, I read it after \\"A Walk to Remember\\" and \\"Message in a Bottle\\". This is a nice creative love story taking place in the late 1940's (post WWII). Noah has never forgotten his first love, Allie, and can't seem to get over her, and then she suddenly comes back into his life again. The problem? She is engaged to another man.About halfway through the book we skip forward to the 1990's. Allie is now confined to a nursing home and suffering from Alzheimer's. Her husband reads her love story from a notebook everyday in the hopes of helping her remember who she is and who she loves. The identity of who her husband has been all these years is kept a secret until the very near the end of the book, and while it is quite obvious who he is, it really could have gone either way and still been a good book.It's a story about true and long lasting love, apparently based on the author's own grandparents story. However, I found the sex scene grossly inappropriate for a story even loosly about his loved ones (really, do we need that many details? It's mainly gratuitous sex in a book...badly done). I found the rest of the story pretty good and mostly believable, although the end kind of lays in on a bit thick. For the most part, the second half of the story is far superior to the beginning, although the beginning is more romantic...or is it? You can decide that yourself.This book is better then \\"Message in a Bottle\\" but I prefered \\"A Walk to Remember\\". However, I am still in search of good romance minus the smut that Sparks and many other authors find necessary. I'll just have to keep looking."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have read this book twice now. I encouraged my sister who works with patients with dementia to read it also. For both of us, this book has been life changing. To appreciate what you have, at this moment, is a gift. She sees and hears times of clarity with her patients. The time of clarity may not be as long as Noah and Allie shared but the idea was there. A beautiful love story. It is best to read the last 60 pages by yourself with lots of tissues:)"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is mass marketing at its best and fiction at its very, very worst. If you want true love &amp; romance, try reading Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights or O Pioneers. The writing is laughable, though Mr. Sparks looks good on the jacket photo :)"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"After reading this book , there are several comments that need to be made. First of all, we understand there is an audience for this simplistic love story, but for anyone searching for something more, they will be sorely disappointed. Our book club found the story very formulaic, trite, banal and uninspiring. As women, we were disappointed at the shallowness of the characters, especially Allie. She is presented as the &quot;virginal&quot; fantasy who saves herself for 14!!!! years until she is resuscitated by the strong and virile Noah. Until then she has stifled her artisitic creativity while Noah led a relatively full, albeit solitary life. The storyline had the potential to be interesting and provocative. Unfortunately, we are given one-dimensional characters whose love for each other seems free of struggle and not grounded in reality. They make it look too easy. We wish the best of luck to Mr. Sparks on his next novel."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is by far one of the worst books I've ever read in my life. The cheese is laid on entirely too thick, and everything about Sparks's style reminds of the books my 12-year-old sister reads. Do not read unless you're 12, or unless you enjoy crap books that mock the theme the sell-out, commercial author is trying to portray."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Let me start off with saying that I absolutely loved the movie, which is what motivated me to buy the book. I can now say that this book has made me not want to watch the movie for a very, very long time.What an absolutely nauseating 'novel' (let's not kid ourselves, novel is being generous. Let's call it a short story). I'm one of the sappiest, mushiest people I know and I could hardly get through this book. I promptly threw it away once finished. Sparks should have at least attempted to make his characters' dialogue even the least bit realistic or believable. The constant over-the-top 'her eyes glistened like glowing emeralds in a sea of shimmering diamonds and she wondered how she ever made it through one breath without seeing the ripple of his chest' writing was just way too much. WAY too much. This book managed to thoroghly nauseate me. Anyone need some paper to start a bonfire??"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This story was beautifully written. A heartwarming...and yet heartbreaking story about a young love shared between two wonderful people, Allison and Noah. Though their time together was limited at their young age, their love was stronger then even some of the lovers that had been together for many years. Torn apart by Allison's mother, these two had to go their separate ways. For years, Noah would send Allison letters and they were letters she never received. So, they lived their seprate lives. Then, some years later, Allison is engaged to marry a rich and stable man with a big heart and Noah is living alone on an old farm house with his wonderful dog. Accidentally coming across an article in the paper about the house Noah lives in and the way he restored it, Allison is overwhelmed with the temptation to pay him a surprise visit and see how he is and who he has become. And from there, this becomes a beautiful love story and Allison must decide whether to follow her heart or her mind. I read this book while I was on vacation and I could not put it down. If you have given up on love or are pretty close to doing so, or even if you have never felt such a strong love before, this is the perfect book of love and loss. It makes you wish you could fall desperately in love with someone, or it makes you thankful that you have fallen desperately in love. It just goes to show how beautiful love can really be and that there really is true love out there among us."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was the first Nicholas Sparks book that I've read and I absolutely loved it! It's a heartwarming, sweet story of love that reads very poetic. I enjoyed it so much that I ran out to rent the movie, however, I was kind of disappointed. The magic that was captured in the book, I felt, didn't convey on the screen. Never the less, I loved it and would recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I liked it and it was the second sparks book i read. I liked it because like his others it tugged at the heart. Ehat I want to know is where all his love stories come from?"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was perfect, it couldn\`t have possibly been any better, I just got to see the movie made of it, WONDERFUL!This is one grand writer!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is a feel good about love, must read book!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"i had seen the movie first and than,thought i should read the book. Well,after seeing the movie and reading the book i feel more in love with my boyfriend. it's kinda how me and my boyfriend met like noah and allie. Then we broke up because my (father)didn't like him. We finally got to talking again and i hurt a gentle man like allie did with lon. We have together ever since and i love him each and everyday like allie wrote in her letters to noah. This book was the best book i have ever read.I like to read but, this book is awsome."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I heard this was such a great and fantastic book! I was really disappointed. Maybe I expected to much from it?! Its a sweet book about a love that doesnt really exist to often in this world. Call me cynical about love but I never understood people who get their needs for love fulfilled by a significant other so completely. The story was sweet and those connections between others rarely are this strong so that was nice to read too. Pretty much a basic love story.The writing though.. the authors writing was very bland and I didnt feel a lot when I read it. He didnt color his images and people very well. I felt like I was reading a continuous bad love poem, ironic because the main character is great at remembering poems! I can see now why his main character was unable to write poems himself and more enjoyed reciting them.I also read one of the most poorly written and structured sentences Ive ever read before.Im looking forward to seeing the movie in hopes that it touches on the love and passion the two character shared more than what the book was able to capture."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A very good book. I'm not going to give it 5/5 because there was just a bit too much of an all-around everything works out in the end sort of novel, even though -- technically -- it doesn't. I lvoe the feel of it all and how everything just sort of fits snuggly together. Definately worth a read by all Nicholas Sparks fans, and anyone who speaks the English language.If you're too lazy to read the book, at least watch the movie when it comes out. It's a lot different, but just as good."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I just finished reading this book and while I was reading it, I couldn't put it down.I thought it was a great love story and not one that is just all about sex, it touches more on the \\"sweet\\" side too. It's incredible how much Noah loved Allie and I loved that about the book because I think that is the kind of love we all would want to have. The reason I didn't give it five stars was because I expected a little more from the end. The ending was ok and I didn't feel frustrated with it but I think the author could've added a little more to it.Overall I think this is one of the best love stories and the first one I've read because I usually don't get into reading the heated love books but decided to read this one because I wanted to see the movie. It was definately worth it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is a beautiful story, Nicholas as a wonderful way of creating a world and love beyond imagination. His ingenius way of using the narrator(Noah) looking back and having the hope that his wife will recover is brilliant. I have never enjoyed reading romances but after it was suggested to be I decided I should read it. You can not put it down. There's not much for me to do before I go to work at 2pm especially since it's summer, it's not like I have homework. So when I began reading this and couldn't put it down I was amazed that hasn't happened since I read S.E. Hinton's Tex and that's quite the oppisite book. I highly highly suggest this to any person young or old it's so touching. A part that was really touching was when Noah says &quot;Silence is holy. It draws people together because only those who are comfortable with each other can sit without speaking. This is the great paradox.&quot; It really makes you think about who you are comfortable around."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Sparks has a style of writing that doesn't strike you as impressive when you first start reading, but he has a way of drawing you into his story and really communicates his characters well. The book is not long, but will leave you satisfied. I also recommend The Wedding, and The Guardian."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I found the book insipid and poorly written. You cannot trust Mr. Sparks. When he writes that his character \\"knows that he will \`never' see her again,\\" you have learned from previous passages that you cannot trust him and so you, the reader just know that he WILL see her again. Why doesn't he write \\"he thought he would never see her again.\\" It's misleading and ticked me off because this type of deception happened over and over. Also, after I got to the end of the book (last chapter), I realized that the whole story was written only so that he could write in documentation style about Alzheimer's. The story was only 30% of his effort, a fable quickly written (and poorly edited) so that he could get to the heart of exactly WHY he was writing this ... and that is to \\"discuss\\" the horrible mind-and-memory-eating disease of Alzheimer's. A good book for someone wanting to understand this disease more (a doctor, however, may disagree), but a lousy read for the rest of us."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I do enjoy love stories but this is beyond your average love story. This book is extremely sappy and all the character is dull and boring. None of their personailites stand out that attracts the reader to them.If you love sappy love stories, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I watched the movie several times before reading the book. I didn't care much for the book. They were like 2 different stories. Not sure why the story line was changed soo much. I loved the story of Noah and Allie when they were young, falling in love the way the movie portrayed it. The book just tells you that they were in love. Stick with the movie version.5 stars to the movie2 stars to the book"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I saw the movie, and had to read the book. The book was so much more than the movie. I loved it. Everyday I would read it I could barely put it down. And towards the end, I was sad because it was over, and there was nothing left for me to read. I would read this over and over again. I cried and cried and cried. It kept me yearning for more from the story and although the story touched my heart and made me cry, I was just as sad that I had nothing left to read. It kept me wanting more. Although the movie was great, the book has so much more to offer and I would recommend it to anyone who loves a great love story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Very bad book. I like romance, did not find this book romantic. Incredibly depressing, made me cry a lot and while I was crying I was still thinking that it was one of the worst books I've read in my life. I thought this book might be good because of all the favorable readers' reviews here. But now I've learned not to judge a book by that. Much better way it to check the the blurbs on the book jacket. If there aren't any from good sources, it's to be avoided."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I can't believe this was such a hit! Thankfully I did not buy it. I have to be honest I read my first Harlequin romance novel the week before just because I had nothing to read and my friend told me it would be a fun. She was right; it was fun, light and unrealistic. It lived up to all of my expectations because after all, it was just a Harlequin Romance novel. The Harlequin novel, \\"Old Enough to Know better,\\" proved to be more of a literary accomplishment than \\"The Notebook.\\""},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The one star I am giving this book is just because it saved me from complete boredom while in between looking for something more interesting to read, it was sweet but maybe actually a little \\"saccharine\\" sweet. A friend gave me the book telling me she couldn't understand why the book was so popular and why it had been made into a movie, I decided to go ahead and read it, but perhaps I should have taken her advice and skipped it. While I was in the middle of the book I was thinking about how it reminded me of Danielle Steele books I used to read as a teen before I discovered the better literature out there, and lo and behold on the Amazon list readers who enjoyed this book also recommended Danielle Steele! So I guess that about sums it up, the person who would enjoy that type of book will enjoy this as well. Honestly in this day and age of cutting edge competitive stories to make into movies why this was chosen is beyond me. I kept waiting for the story to take an interesting twist that would change my mind but was sadly disappointed. I really don't like putting a book down in the middle before I've finished but I was sorely tempted with this one. I felt like I was wasting time and could have been reading other things better. In fact maybe that is what the single star is for that I am rating this book, maybe it inspired me to move on and tackle Tolstoy's Anna Karenina which has been a project I have been putting off all summer."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I enjoyed Nicholas Sparks' other two novels very much. This book was very good, but you really need to have a positive outlook on life to read this. The first part of the book was like any other typical love story. In the middle of the book, you are brought into the present of the main characters in their seventies and eighties. the rest of the book drags a bit, and focuses too much on the feebleness of the two main characters. This is the part where you will need the whole box of kleenex. The end of the book made me feel happy for the main characters, but depressed about my own impending aging process and where it will someday lead. Believe me, you will feel like you need a prosac for the rest of the day. If Sparks focused a little less on the detailed aging process of the characters, I think this book could have been as much of a romantic heart-warming love story as his other two books."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"It was a waste of 3 hours when I could have read something of substance. The author writes like a grade school student with simple sentences and unreasonable leaps int the passages of time. He knows nothing about Alzheimers...What was the point of this book?"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The book was sent already but he hasnt received it yet... :/ if he doesnt receive it who do I inform that too????"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The depth and magnitude of Noah's love for Allie is beyond words and beyond comprehension. I kept reading excerpts which showed just how much they love each other and then wish I was Allie &lt;&lt;&lt;shiver&gt;&gt;&gt; That was the most transcendental love story I have ever read in a long time. I can't wait to read Sparks' third novel &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; and see if even he can transcend such genuine love on another level."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"From the moment I hit page 140, tears rolled down my face uncontrollably. Yet, I couldn't put the book down -- I just had to know how it all ended. An earlier review criticized Sparks for his endings. I found this ending sensual and relieving. After I completed the book, I read the pages of reviews (along with those here) and was pleased to know others compared this work to Bridges of Madison County. I'd rate it higher myself. I'm off to the library tomorrow in search of Sparks' Message in a Bottle and A Walk to Remember."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Beautiful &amp; touching, Nicholas Sparks causes the reader to realize the preciousness and briefness of life here on earth. The book touches the heart and strips it bear to let the reader feel the love and pain that the characters encounter. Never had I ever read a book that moved me so. Perhaps because it was so realistic but I found myself crying on the plane unable to let the book go and never letting go the lesson that it teaches. Life is brief, love like it will end tomorrow and when you find the one...grab her and never let go. Life is too short to hope that the next one will be good enough. Never settle for less. Nicholas Sparks writes with such grace and beauty it captures your heart and makes the reader long for a love as strong as their's. I loved everything except for the end when the 80 year olds do the nasty. That was enough to knock it down one star to a four instead of a five. For one I doubt you could do &quot;it&quot; at the age of 80 and secondly throughout the entire novel Sparks draws a picture of complete serenity and overwhelming southern beauty and then he has to end the story with a love scene with two old senior citizens. Just trying to picture it jolts the reader enough to completely erase the beauty of everlasting love with...yuck. I still can't get over it..."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I saw the movie &quot;A message in a bottle&quot;, I sought out the author and got this book. Nicholas Sparks has got romance down to a &quot;T&quot;. This book was so romantic, and truely touching. Makes me believe that there is truely love out there to be had."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook was wonderful! A heartwarming tale of finding and losing true love. In the book I was shown the torn hearts of two seperated lovers. The two finally find their way back to each other, but this time things are a little different. It's been many years, they have many experiences behind them. The story of Noah and Allie's love if truely terrific. If you are a romance fan you must read this book, but make sure you have a box of tissues close by. Nicholas Sparks does a great job of showing you the hear and souls of Noah and Allie. Their different views, thoughts, emotions, but mostly their similar devotion and adoration of each other. When tragedy hits home will they make it? I found myself not able to put the book down, I had to root then on when they were hit with a tragity that turned their life up-side-down. I knew their love was strong, but strong enough to survive this? Maybe the greatest aspect of this book is the way it shows love. Not just storybook love, but mature love, the joys and the trails. All in all I recommend this book. Nicholas Sparks wrote a beautiful story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I am a 14 year old and I loved this story. I would totally recommend it to anybody who is amazed by what love can do."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book has to be my favorite of all times. I read this years ago and still find myself picking it up and reading it again and again. I have given this book out to everyone i know. If you believe that true love exists and once you find it it's beautiful up to the very end, then you must read this book. You must be a true romantic to find this book as it is meant to be. This was a book based on two real people and there lives. I hope noone tries to crush this beautiful story, because it doesn't have a &quot;happy ending&quot;. If you believe in love you will realize that this book does have one of the happiest endings, because these two people lived their lives and found love. That is what it's all about."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"If you have ever wondered if love really existed-here is your proof. I couldn't put the book down and I have cry every time I read it.

This story is a depiction of what love should be. fearless,daring to step beyond what you know or have been brought up to know,passionate and a true understanding of where a heart belongs and who it belongs to. The Notebook tells of a dedicated love of two kindred spirits from vastly different backgrounds, who through their profound love for one another, managed to overcome adversity and formed a union more powerful than you could ever imagine."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"\\"The Notebook\\" was Nicholas Sparks breakthrough novel. It has gained popularity because it appeals to every age group- the young at heart to the experienced at heart. Not many contemporary love novel have their own Cliff Notes. This one does.Both the story and prose flow well and smoothly. You can feel that you are in the deep South at different time periods as your journey through the emotional highs and lows of the main characters.As a story, there is the spontaneous love and passion of youth. Then, there is the bonding and eventual longetivity of the relationship. And, there is the enduring love and loyalty that can only come with trials and time.JR FelisildaAuthor of the book, \\"Nanay: Lessons From a Mother\\""},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I love reading Nickolas Sparks books.

They are stories that you just want to keep reading."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Finally retired from working at the public library and decided to do what I'd promised myself while working: Read a Nicholas Sparks' book to see what all the fuss was about. I've always contended that the reason there are so many different kinds of books in the world is becaue there are so many different kinds of readers. But \\"The Notebook\\"? I skipped through the last 75 pages. Maudlin. Foolishly sentimental."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The movie was the way I would have chosen for my Mom & Dad. The book was more realistic. This book is written in a way that it not only is a story beautifully told, it is presented in a way that can be healing for someone that has gone through a similar experience."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I've never been much of a book person but after falling in love with the movie I was told that the book was even better. I just received it this morning and already cannot put it down. Absolutely love it!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is a simple story about a couple that falls in love. After being separated for most of their youth, the couple finds each other again and rekindles the attraction that really never died.The Notebook is very direct, and that's almost a double-edged factor when it comes to the plot. The story is so straightforward that there really isn't any suspense or tension. Fans of the movie will notice the differences, as much of the drama surrounding the couple's relationship is actually just added in the movie version. The book is relatively easy and drama-free.The final pages of The Notebook are surprisingly powerful and heart-breaking; and the dark tone contrasts with the lightness of the rest of the book. It's the last chapter that The Notebook shines, for me, in terms of emotional grip on the reader.There aren't really any plot twists, dramatic developments, or conflicts... because that's not really what The Notebook was trying to do anyway. If you're in the mood to read something cute, heartwarming, simple, and direct, go for The Notebook."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"What can be said about The Notebook that has not already been said in more than forty languages? The book and the film had been available to the public long before I got around to this wonderfully crafted story. I saw the movie first, and afterward, I had a fresh copy of the book in my hands within the hour. I read it in one sitting, for it flowed smoothly ...as tears. One will find it easier said than done to walk away from The Notebook, unfinished. It has that gravitational pull that draws you inward, not simply into the storyline either, but it will have you searching your own heart and reminiscing on a first love. I highly recommend The Notebook for those possible four curious people who may have never heard of it before now."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I borrowed all nicholas sparks books from the library and read them and loved them! now i am in the process of buying all his books in hardback books to keep as my collection and read again whenever i want to. i love them that much that reading once is not enough! i have seen \\"the notebook\\" so many times and loaned it out to my friends. i have all his movies and watch them over and over. i would suggest his books to anyone. my 11 year old grandaughter got me to reading them and there aren't many books a family can read and share, but his are the ones to bring families closer and these days, that doesn't happen very often anymore.i don't know how anyone could see \\"the notebook\\" and not shed a few tears. i know everyone around here have to pause the tv every now and then or leave sniffling. this book and movie touches the feelings and emotions a lot of people keep hidden deep inside and make us rethink our life whether we want to or not!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I just wanted to get a few books to read over the summer, and I loved this movie so figured it would be a great book. Definitely worth it! I loved reading every second of it!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks is a great writer. If you haven't read any of his books yet, start with this one."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book is wonderful. The best fiction I've ever read! I recomend all of Sparks' writings. He is simply the best. The Notebook is however, his crowning achivement."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This novel is too short for the reader to become involved and sufficiently engrossed enough in the story. With romances, and especially a romance that spans over 50 years, the reader needs time....and text. There are too many ideas that have been cut-off for the sake of editing, as Nicholas Sparks readily confesses. In all fairness, this was Nicholas Sparks first novel, and he did feel pressure to bring it in under a certain amount of pages....which may have suited his publishers and editor, but leaves the reader very unsatisfied.In general, when you are spanning the decades in a sweeping romantic saga, you cannot put the story into one of the shorter novels, without ideas becoming half-expressed and squelched, and there are many half-expressed thoughts that the reader longs to be fleshed out more, especially when the characters are so memorable and the story so touching. Whole chunks of time are missing and glossed over, leaving a feeling of incompleteness.I can make allowances due to this being Sparks, first novel. And, I am looking forward to the sequal &quot;The Wedding&quot; which is currently in publication.What's good here is the love between the two senior citizens, even though there aren't enough scenes of it. The book drags a bit through the first part, until you get to the part where they are seniors and absolutely cannot put it down. I just wish that would've been the whole part, or significantly more.Not enough authors focus on senior issues, or even whether seniors' romantic love is just as valid as young love. The fact that Nicholas Sparks was willing to delve into this is wonderful, and he beautifully captures the feelings of the elderly in love.I just hope the sequel to the &quot;Notebook&quot;.....the current &quot;The Wedding&quot; , by Nicholas Sparks, fills in some of the gaps that were edited out here."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Highly recommend. It made me realize our life is not a stage rehersal, it happens daily. We must not let today slip by without grasping what truly matters...."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I took this book with me everywhere. I could not put it down. It was a wonderful book and I recommend everyone read it if your interested in a great romance novel."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book when it was originally released and I still think it's one of the best books I've read. The story line keeps you interested throughout - it was hard to put the book down. I've recommended it to many of my friends and they have enjoyed it just as much as myself."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Any Nicholas Sparks book must be rated with 5 stars! Just when I thought that this book may perhaps not be such a hit, I was stunned how foolish I was. This book is very different than his other books, in a way, since the whole story is based little on a story but mainly on an ongoing emotion. I could really tell this story in 45 seconds. But the way he relates the moments, and later, the flash backs, is just so typical Nicholas Sparks, and is simply so ecstatic and awesome."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I really did love the book. You either like it or you don't. But for those who did (including myself), It was by far a peace of hope for those hopless romantics out there. It's always about the &quot;one&quot; who got away...and how someone can wait, search, and rekindle somethintg that once was. The ending was sad, but it fit the whole out look on life. Nothing lasts forever, except love. It's a must read."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"&quot;The Notebook&quot; is not as good as &quot;The Rescue&quot; and &quot;A Bend in the Road&quot; but keep in mind that it is the first book Nicholas Sparks ever published. It is short - I finished it in one day - and very emotional toward the end. If you like the &quot;happily ever after&quot; type endings, then you might be disappointed. But I found &quot;The Notebook&quot; to be a wonderful story of true everlasting love."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"There is always first love that you will remember for a lifetime; A first love that can never be replaced. For Noah Calhoun it is no different. He will long remember Allie Nelson, the girl he fell in love with in one beautiful summer.Little does he know now soon to be married Allie has come for a last visit to see her lost love. What happens between them though is surely something neither of them expected. But have dreamed of for so long. The return of a memory once left behind creates a magical moment that neither one of them imagined. When the end is finally near the miracle of love will defy all.Most people would say that this is a book for hopeless romantics. But I'm not most people, nor am I a hopeless romantic. This book is meant to be inspirational and uplifting. While showing you the power of love and hope you see that anything is possibel."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I like Nicholas Sparks.

Was like being a 1st hand witness to the intimate details of what made 2 people 1 -- reminded me of my grandparents who have been married 61 years and together 68 -- passion is a miracle and this couple was likely to experience it"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This romantic book was the best I've read in a long time. Every page made you want to read the next. The characters came alive to you as you put yourself in the story. I really admired the patience that the male character had in waiting for his beloved to return to him. Sparks is very good in detailing the feelings of the characters as well as the surroundings. The only disappointment was that on one part near the end, it leaves the rest to your imagination, but Sparks is such a good writer! I found myself enraptured in this story that I read the entire book in two hours!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I found the story engaging, but not very believable. These 2 people are portrayed as too &quot;perfect.&quot; Maybe I'm cynical, but I got tired of all the &quot;mush &amp; gush.&quot; He was perfect, she was perfect, their children were perfect, their home was perfect, their lifestyle was perfect, their faces &amp; bodies were perfect, their relationship was perfect... Whew! Give me a break. I closed the book dazed &amp; confused. It seemed like the story just stopped. It didn't end. I've concluded that the narrator died at that moment, but that's not so according to my friends. My book club is in a heated debate over this. This debate has been the most interesting part of reading this book... wondering what on earth Nicholas Sparks is describing there at the end - death or new life? I reread it several times looking for the answer, but I'm still at a loss. Perhaps THAT is what Sparks intended? To keep us guessing &amp; wondering &amp; drawing our own conclusions???"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read The Notebook in 2 days because I could not put it down - except to sleep! I normally read thrillers and mysteries but my mom raved about The Notebook so I gave it a try. The only word of caution would be to have a very large box of tissues close at hand. I have lent this book to several friends (and one of their mom's) and all have loved this book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I think I picked out the book because I liked the cover and I liked the Bridges of Madison County. I read it one night when I couldn't sleep and realized in the middle that I must be reading something equivalent to a Harlequin romance. (I've never read a Harlequin romance, so I don't know.) I had to skim over a great deal of it because the writing was so bad. The mother's actions were unbelievable; &quot;true love&quot; at age 15 is very rare; and the Alzheimer's situation was unrealistic. I couldn't believe the fiance would have submitted without a fight, since he was such a control freak. The writing was too simplistic, trite, and maudlin. I felt cheated out of the money I spent to buy the book. I wish I could give it no stars."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was enthralled by the twists and turns of this short novel. I wish that everyone had the opportunity to love the way that the characters in this novel loved one another. I also wish that this book had been made into a movie instead of &quot;Message In A Bottle&quot; which was a good read and a good movie....but doesn't hold a candle to the story presented in The Notebook."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"...but most of us will never find. I read through it in one day, couldn't put it away. It made me cry sometimes, especially at he end. I hope that Nicholas Sparks will go for more wonderful books like this one."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"All I can say about The Notebook by sparks is that it was wonderful. The story made me cry, and felt simpathy for the couple. And with this story i realized how rare true love is.. Many people might think that they can live without love, but i tell you that one way or another you and everyone in this earth will live times that wished had someone to care for them........."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I almost threw this book down in frustration at the awful cliches of character and the syrupy style (which is repeated in Message in a Bottle). It reads like the film script it is surely destined to become...ie he wore a blue denim shirt and jeans (you can just imagine Hollywood actor in them). However something strange happened to me as I was reading it. I had just complained to my husband about it when something I read totally touched my heart, and I started to cry. This book is about love and devotion, working through hard times together. A powerful and universal theme. We as a race almost need to re-learn what true love is. Not just a feeling that happens, but in action, how we speak to one another, how we behave and act towards one another. what we are prepared to do to help one another. I am not talking co-dependent relationships here, I am talking reciprocity where both partners give of themselves equally. And towards the end of the book Noah is left to hold the torch of their love for both of them. A profoundly moving book and surprisingly so, given the characters are so weakly drawn. The number of rave reviews is surely a sign of how much we all need to read about reciprocal loving relationships and the power of holding possibilities for one another. Thanks Nicholas, you have inspired me to pick up my own pen!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was given this book to try and revive my faith in relationships and it has worked... A terrific love story!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The book everyy time makes me cry to the point I must set it down to collect myself. A wonderful love story as all great ones are.

Its a must read for anyone who is in love with love!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Another case where I have read the book after the movie, and once again I found the movie to be better. You can't totally dis it though. It was good enough to keep it interesting, despite the fact that you know what is going to happen.I don't know if I will attempt anymore Nicholas Sparks books. I don't like reading tragic sob stories, which seems to be his forte, the same as Jodi Picoult. Good love story, but read the \\"Outlander\\" series by Diana Gabaldon. That has the greatest love story of all time."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Even though The Notebook came out already 1996 and movie in 2004, I just found this book and decided to read it.It's a love story and this is the best way of describing it. Live-long love story which mirrors characters' life during their lives from the moment they meet until the final days of their lives. The writing was slowly paced and it really suited to the story. Thoughts and descriptions gave an overview of the depth of their love story.It was beautiful and sad book.4 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"After reading one of Nicholas Spark's later books one day I decided that I would read all of his books. Out of the ones I have read so far, The Notebook is not my favorite. I think that Nicholas Spark improves a lot by his later novels, and ultimately this book does not showcase his talents in a way that he is capable of writing.However, the story itself is simple enough; two teenagers from two completely different walks of life meet one summer and fall into love. They are determined not to let the contradicting social status' affect them. Nevertheless, fourteen years later they find each other after never having heard from the other. Allie Nelson is engaged to another man, but she is drawn first back to the place where she fell in love and eventually falls in love again.We, as readers, know that the choice that Allie has to make is what pulls us irresistibly towards the end. The Notebook is about a choice between true love and diplomacy. It is a choice between what is easy and what feels right. But mostly the book is about ultimate love and sacrifice as we discover how Allie and the man she chooses love each other to the very end, even as the fabric of their lives falls apart. The true moral of this story is about sacrifice."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was very surprised to find out how much i would enjoy both the book AND the movie.....EXCELLENT!!!GREAT story, and GREAT acting!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Purchased a copy as a gift for my mom since we both enjoyed the movie years ago, and after hearing her rave about how much she loved reading it again I think I will have to borrow it and re-read it next."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is short and sweet...This is the perfect love story. Plenty of romance, drama and everything in between. Not only do you wish you were in the time and places written about so beautifully but you wish you were that couple...the whirlwind summer romance, the poor blue collar boy with the spoiled rich girl staying for the summer, the playful bickering of two people in love and from different worlds. I am telling you if you have seen the movie....STILL READ THE BOOK. The movie is wonderful and honestly one of the truest movies based on a novel but there is something so magical about reading the pages of this book that the movie just can't interpret. Love it!!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Another beautiful and tender romance by Sparks. Noah and Allie are beautiful characters with beautiful hearts. Two people whose hearts truely beat as one. I really enjoyed this book.

I highly recommend this book though!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"this book changed my life. ill never forget it. its definately on my top 3! it was one of the sweetest things i have ever read! i cryed and laughed and cryed some more. mostly happy tears though...i would recommend this book to anyone ...theres no way you couldnt appreciate it!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A beautifully written story of true love and devotion. Sparks' artful words will restore your confidence in the goodness and capacity for endless love in the heart of man."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook, by Nicholas Sparks, is a sensational love story filled with ups and downs, memories and adventures, affection and happiness. This story starts out with the description of an old man reading a story to his wife who doesn't remember him because of her serious case of Alzheimer's. He tells her a story of two young lovers, Allie Nelson and Noah Calhoun, who fall in love one summer but then Allie moves away. Though their passionate love seems indestructible at first, they learn that being away is enough to destroy even their friendship. Allie and Noah came from different classes of society so naturally, Allie's rich parents were not fond of Noah from the beginning. When Noah sends Allie letters almost everyday, her parents secretly hide them from her to avoid her from falling for him again. Fourteen years pass with no communication between the two until a realization comes about. Allie is set to marry a rich man named Lon whom her parents adore but she may not be truly in love with. When preparations for the wedding become overwhelming, Allie suddenly takes off to find Noah. They spend only two days together but even this amount of time was enough to fall deeply in love with each other once again. Allie's parents finally realize that keeping the two apart will never work and Allie and Noah truly belong together. The story finishes by referring back to the beginning and revealing that the old man and his wife were really Noah and Allie. After reading to his wife for so long trying to make her remember the love they once shared, Noah helps Allie realize that they are married and have children. She gets her memory back and remembers her past once more.I loved this story and thought it was one of the better love stories I have read. Even for those who have seen the movie, I would still recommend reading this book. The themes throughout the plot vary from general life lessons to choosing your priorities. One theme throughout this story is that true love will overcome all obstacles. This is shown in the plot itself when Allie is engaged to Lon, but her and Noah's true love overcomes her family and Lon's money allowing them to be together. I can relate this story to The Alchemist because the theme in that book is that if you really want something and are meant to have it, the whole universe conspires to help you achieve it. In The Notebook, Allie wants nothing more than to be with Noah and even though she is engaged, the world conspires to getting Noah and Allie together.Having the conflict of money vs. love taught me more about the classes of society in their setting. Allie's parents were rich folks who wanted their daughter to go to a University and marry a wealthy businessman whereas Noah and his father were perfectly happy on their own even though they did not have much money. Throughout this book, I was reminded that at times love blocks out all society, class, and conflict in order to bring two people together forever. Allie realizes that she needs to be with Noah in order to have a happy life.The author, Nicholas Sparks, wants the reader to take away many lessons from this story. Most importantly, he wants readers to understand that Noah's character strengthens because of the love he has for Allie. His character is more distinct because he has such strong feelings for her. He also shows that if you are in love with a person, it is just as powerful as being loved by another. Nicholas Sparks does a great job with this complicated novel and I would recommend this to teenagers who enjoy a touching romantic novel about the powerful themes of love."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A wonderful love story with a timelessness that will be enjoyed for generations. Great book for people who have little time to read as it is so short."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"i cried so hard reading the book. my family has history of altzhymers. so my husband who is my soulmate and i became the couple in the book and i became totally immersed and never put book down. not even to sleep."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Much better reading the book than watching the movie. Sparks is an amazing author. Very happy with purchase"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is one of my favorite books by Sparks. He did a great job and I thought the movie came out great as well. This is one of the books that I have never gotten tired of reading over and over. I feel it captures a great love story with paths that can lead to a different ending or different adventure."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Typically the book is a 1000x better than the movie...but not this one. I watched the movie first. It is one of my favorite love stories EVER. So I thought I should read the book and was VERY VERY disappointed. I am actually quite impressed that the writers and directors of The Notebook did such a fantastic job given the mediocre story that inspired them.First, the conversations, passion, and intensity between Allie and Noah in the book do not EVEN compare to the movie. There are lines in the movie that move me everytime and these same lines are not even in the book. Second, the book doesn't even share much of their first summer together...the events that made them fall madly in love with each other. Third, the ending was nothing like the movie. UGH soooooooo dissapointing. I read the book in a couple of hours, I honestly wanted to stop and just watch the movie instead.This is only the second book that I have read so far where the movie is better. It's a cheap book but if you loved the movie I wouldn't even bother."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was a great read. If you liked the movie, you will definitely love the book. I literally could not put it down."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"for a love story that few every have. writer is great, always buy his books. and will continue to; dh"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"After having seen the Notebook film many times I decided to read the book. It's a lot shorter than I thought (only around 200 pages) and the book itself is pretty small. I enjoyed reading this book. Nicholas Sparks is a good author and I liked his writing style. His writing is very easy to understand and you can read it very fast. He writes from both Allie and Noah's perspective. It only took me about two days to read this book. Good details and descriptions.There are a lot of differences between the book and the movie. The movie obviously adds more drama to the story. It also leaves out some characters written in the book that I think are important to the character's development. I would definitely recommend that you read the book. Good story line of two people who fall in love and more than a decade later come together again. Nicholas Sparks adds some love letters between Noah and Allie in the book. I really liked them as they gave a deeper insight into Noah and Allie's relationship.I will definitely read this book again someday."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"After reading Message in a Bottle I felt that I had to read this book.

Once and only once, and a long time ago. Ant it had changed him forever. Perfect love did that to a person, and this had been perfect.&quot; This passage was written by someone who has truly been in love once. I know, because I too have been in love once, a long time ago, and, even though it didn't work out, it changed me forever. There was no reason for the main character, or me, to try again. Nothing else could ever be that perfect. Real love, even if only once, is enough."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"My sister recommended this book to me because of the similarities to my parents and our own family. The interweaving of the current with the stories of the past keeps the narrative interesting and builds some dramatic tension. I get warm fuzzies reading this story of well worn love. It speaks a timeless message in a day when we need to hear it. I think the book could become a classic in time like &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot;."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is one of the most touching books I've ever read. It is a small book, but the lesson and story it tells is wonderful. After reading it I told the story to my husband. It is a testament to true love and how to make it last. Everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I liked this story for it was just perfect. Well written and believable. I can see why it became a New York Times Best Seller. The beginning was easy to get into. Also, so many books I read do tend to drag on, but this story ended just perfectly. The character development was just right, for I could feel for everyone. Even though I thought the story was a bit predictable, like a Harqulin romance, I still enjoyed it and would readily recommend it to others."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I bought this book in London on my vacation and it was read in only three days. It is so wonderful to never forget one summer and one and only girl for the rest of the time. And to find her one day again... Sparks describes the events so wonderful that I thought I was it myself. In the end his wife doesn\`t know Noah anymore and that was so sad that I cried when I read it and I cried when I told my boyfriend about this lovestory. There couldn't be a better end. Always Happy End is boring."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I WEPT OPENLY AT THE END OF THIS STORY. IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL AND SO ENJOYABLE. SPARKS MAKES YOU BELIEVE IN LOVE AND SHOWS HOW IT CAN HELP YOU TO OVERCOME EVEN THE HARDEST THINGS THAT WE ARE SOMETIMES FORCED TO FACE IN LIFE. I LOVED THE ENDING, THE CHARACTERS, EVERY ASPECT OF THIS BOOK. I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO READ.."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This simple story about love in one of (hopefully) many lifetimes is very inspiring. It reinforced in my mind that as long as you have your soulmate, everything else can be conquered. If you are looking for a book that is straightforward and honest, give this one a try. I cried through a lot of it...tears of happiness, even when it was sad, because (even though it is tough) Allie and Noah are together, forever."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was one of the most beautiful books I've ever read. A book of love and hope. The story of the kind of love that can survive anything. It's a book that will leave you believing that there are poets in the world, even if they never write a poem."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book over two evenings and I found it to be a real tugger of the heart strings. &quot;The Notebook&quot; is a story about two people who are soulmates and will find a way to be together no matter what may stand in their way.

I have lost count how many times I have read it. It was loaned to me by a girlfriend for a trip to Europe. I finished it in the airport! I read it twice more on the trip.

The ending was equally as beautiful and the beginning. If you believe in true, lasting love this book will warm your heart. I occaisionally read the book again to remember the magic of this wonderful story. ( I thought Message In A Bottle was equally as powerful, A Walk To Remember I couldn't finish b/c I was bored and The Rescue was enjoyable - more like the first two books but predictable. The main story was touching)"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"As the Disabilities Host on BellaOnline, I recommend this book. It's a true and powerful love story. Nicholas Sparks has a powerful way of writing. You won't be bored at all."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Once again Nicholas Sparks brings us into his world of love, commitment,and passion. Two people seperated only by years come back together and rekindle the love that they had many years ago. They do not let their present situations hinder them from rediscovering each other, but rather they pick up right where they left off, only using a little discretion. The book reminds me of a simple quote that I've read and said to myself time and time again. &quot;If you love somthing let it go, if it comes back to you it is yours and if it does not it was never meant to be."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"the story moves into tear.

I considered it somewhat of a classic. I borrowed the book and am considering purchasing it. The author has such a way with words, its truley amazing to me. I loved his style of writting and would treasure some of his written words. This book is definately something to reread again, at maybe another point in your life. The ending was wonderful. I cried a lot at the end. I reread it to my husband when I was finished, he thought it was touching also. This is a love story everyone should read. It truley is what real love i all about.

Noah ( the main character) gets reunited with his old girlfriend after 15 or so years. Then it jumps ahead 50 years and starts to get confusing. In the end it all works out. This book is very touching and romantic. I heard alot about the ending being a tearjerker, so I guess overestimated it. I didn't cry at all because I kept waiting for something extremely sad."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I don't know whether anyone will ever read this review, but I had to write it. &quot;The Notebook&quot; is one of the sweetest love stories that I have ever read. Nicholas Sparks seems to know just how to hit the right chord, at least with me anyway, and I've never thought of myself as a hopeless romantic. This story is much deeper than &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot;, which was a nice story, but didn't have nearly the uplifting quality that &quot;The Notebook&quot; does. I usually don't cry when I read books, but I cried BUCKETS with this one, mainly because of the tenderness that Sparks gives his characters, and the beautiful pictures that he paints with words. I think that one of the most attractive things about the way that he writes is that I think we all want to be loved this way. Sparks has a tremendous gift that he graciously shares, and I am thankful to have read this book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this first, and was so affected by this mans great love.I have hoped to have this with my own husband.

Noah and Allie, a love that surpasses any fairytale. Noah and Allie, the Romeo and Juliet of today. This book made me cry and laugh and wish that I could someday experience a love so genuine, a love so true, a love so beautiful words could not describe. But Nicholas Sparks did a wonderful job of describing a feeling so powerful, that you feel for the characters.

It will honestly make you feel like you haven't loved until you've meet someone like Noah or Allison. They give a new meaning to unconditional love. I've never read a book from a man's point of view that was so romantic and heart wrenching. Mr. Sparks has sparked my interest back to making time for readng again. I feel very blessed to have read a book that will remain priceless and always at the top of &quot;my&quot; best sellers list for as long as I live."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I just finished reading The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks. I found it to be an enjoyable book, full of passion and deep love. The year is 1946 in New Bern, North Carolina. Noah, 31, a man who just returned from World War II, lives by himself in his large house. About two hours away, in Raleigh, Allie, 29, is going to be married. Fourteen years earlier, Allie and Noah shared a love like no other. Allie's parents never approved of her romance with Noah. Therefore, they couldn't be happier about Allie's plans to marry a successful lawyer. Despite their discouragement, Noah and Allie never forgot about each other. When Allie seees a newspaper article about Noah's return from the war, she knows she must go see him and tell him of her engagement. When Noah finds this out he is devastated. In the time that Noah and Allie spend together, they realize that their love for each other is still alive and strong. However, there is still Allie's family and fiance to think about. Will Noah and Allie be able to keep their love alive? How will Allie ever decide which man means more to her? Whose heart will she break? You have to read the book to find out. Most of the book keeps you turning pages, while the end seems to drag on longer than necesary. As an 8th grade girl in Los Angeles, I found the vocabulary to be extremely understandable with very few exceptions. The Notebook was an easy read. It consists of 214 pages and the print isn't small, but it isn't huge. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good love story with a couple of unexpected twists and turns."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I can't recall a book that ever brought tears to my eyes.

If I have to hear the sentence &#34;She was beautiful&#34; just one more time, I'm going punch Nicholas Sparks in the kneecaps.

If that get's your attention, you'll like the book.It's a &quot;one-night&quot; read. It's only over 100 pages. The story simple, yet deep. It's about true love and honor. The relationship of the subjects is the kind of love we all dream about.The second half of the book will have you in tears. Still, the story doesn't lose anything. It's not a pity book. It's just a classic love story.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks' The Notebook is a good, quick read that is reminiscent of Bridges of Madison County. But, this book too closely resembles a cheap romance novel in that it spends too much time focusing on the characters' sexual thoughts and desires. These drawn out passages get old very quickly. This story could have been much more interesting and compelling had Sparks focused more extensively on the true meaning of young love. Conversations about longing and missed opportunities were far too frequent and predictable, given the story line and these characters pasts."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I loved the book because it made you reflect own your own life. Was I really ever in love? Have I experienced true love? Would I have made the same sacrifices? You may or may not believe the story, but it is these questions that are raised from this book that really matter. And to those who could not get passed that, I'm afraid you will never know what it means to give yourself to someone completely and know you are recieving the same, if not, more from your partner. Love is real people, don't be afraid to embrace it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is the type of book that makes you never want to give up.

I thought it was an amazing book and suggest it to the dreamer in everyone."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I could not put this book down. I finished it just before dawn and went to sleep covered in tears. Love Story was my favorite book until this one."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I think that what makes a novel great is its ability to characterize the feelings that are predominant in society. During their times, Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre were viewed as masterpieces (and still are) by their society because they described the Victorian era and its quirks. However, The Notebook provides this same description for today. With a 60% divorce rate, true love, in its ideal sense, seems to be lost. Sparks' novel epotimizes the fear of many in today's society: of never experiencing real love. While similar themes run through the &quot;classics&quot;, the Notebook relates this want in an easy-to-understand context. What a beautiful triumph for love when violence, divorce, and hatred are destroying today's society. Everyone can relate to this novel, if only in the simplistic sense. Whether it describes your a love in childhood, marriage, or the aged, the Notebook provides all of us with hope for the future..."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"When I saw Nicholas Sparks on Oprah talking about this book, I ran out to buy it. I think it only took me a few hours to read, but my emotions were running wild. I don't think I have ever cried as much as I did with this book. Not even Bridges of Madison County made me cry this much. If you are a true romantic, read this book and then pass it on."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book has been written a thousand times before Mr Sparks was even born. It's such a common love story, a 12 year old could have written it. You don't even care about the characters because you don't get to know them, and every word is a deja-vu of third rate romance novels. Thank God it's so short!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The book covers a deep, heartbreaking subject in a shallow and unrealistic manner.Want to be depressed and bored? If so, this is the book for you!!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This thing (I hesitate to call it a novel) is a gooey mess. Allie and Noah were totally unrealistic (except for their very real diseases) -one could find better character development in a comic strip (remember Nancy and Sluggo?). I've always wanted to write a novel but feared rejection. Thank you, Mr. Sparks - I've changed my mind!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Imagine a love so strong which causes a person to disobey her parents and rebel against expected society values. Noah Calhoun and Allison Nelson, though from two different social classes, came together despite the thinking of others. In the novel, The Notebook, written by Nicholas Sparks the theme of love appears throughout the book. Based upon his family history, he describes the joys of their relationship as well as their agony of being torn apart. Although Nicholas Sparks wrote this book to explain the theory of love, it is a true story of a couple's life and struggle to be together.Love conquers all is a universal theme that is used in The Notebook as a way to present the true story of his wife's grandparents. The author intended to provide the reader with a taste of a love that was meant to be. Even though Allison Nelson and Noah Calhoun were from two totally different social classes, their love survived being torn apart then coming together again. Nicholas Sparks wanted the reader to see that true love is possible when two people are meant to be together, which is also a common value in society. This book leaves the reader with a sense of warmth and humanity even though the theme is not original.The title of the book is significant because it was a notebook of history which was kept by the grandfather of the author's wife. It was from these words that the author wrote The Notebook. It can be argued that his point of view is biased because only one viewpoint, true love conquers all, is presented in the story. The book leaves no unanswered questions since both characters in the story remain together until they are both elderly.This book is a well-written love story which influences and keeps the reader's attention. Nicholas Sparks clearly argues the point that love can survive any obstacle. After reading this book, the reader is convinced that love can last a lifetime. The book is accessible to anyone and will provide entertainment when read.After reading this book, the reader will experience a sense of warmth and well-being. What is a strength in the book is also a weakness in that only one story about two people is presented rather than many experiences involving others. The reader, however, will have better understanding and appreciation of love.Noah and Allison grew up together, fell in love, lost each other for a time, then came back together for a lifetime. It was the author's intent for the reader to have an understanding of their story and the obstacles faced by being in love. Although Nicholas Sparks wrote this book to explain the theory of love, it is a true story of a couple's life and struggle to be together."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"this story should be with the books w/ fabio on the cover. I can't believe it is a bestseller. I read this when I was in a book club, totally going into it with an open mind. this is for small-minded folk. These characters are so phoney and the dialogue so corney that I thought I was going to throw up on the book itself. yuck!!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Sparks does what every writer in the business has been told not to do since the beginning of...well, since the beginning. He ignores the concept of viewpoint, switching between characters in the same scene, confusing everyone except those &quot;romantic&quot; enough not to notice. The language is pedestrian at best; however, I can't forgive the writer (and apparently editors) who let lines like &quot;and she smiled softly&quot; slip through their fingers. When I figure out how one can smile softly, I'll try reading another book by Sparks."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Two people whose taste I respect insisted that I read this book. I still haven't figured out why. It was simply awful. Poorly written, cliche, boring, trite, etc. The only reason I read to the end was because my friends had insisted I would love it. If you like great literature, don't bother with this book no matter what your friends say. If on the other hand, you love reading cheap romance novels, you will probably love this one."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Are you an avid reader? Then really, don't waste your time on this one. It will only take a few hours, but you may as well be picking your nose because this is really disappointing. I am all for a sad love story, but this is a sappy, poorly written novel. It might have been easier to read with fewer grammatical errors and some sort of writing style. I can not believe that this was a best-seller."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read a lot of books and I can't remember the last time I read a book more insulting to my intelligence (perhaps it was Bridges of Madison County)! The writing is dreadful; it reminded me of the Danielle Steel novel I read as a teeny bopper. It's filled with useless descriptions of what the characters were wearing and what they made for dinner and breakfast. The characters are made of poor-quality cardboard. It's unbelievably trite and sappy. I'm so glad I borrowed a copy and I can't wait to give it back...I'm embarrassed to have it on my shelf! IF YOU HAVE ANY SELF-RESPECT, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK! I don't think I live on the same planet as the people who rated this book a &quot;10.&quot; My book group will get strong warnings from me to stay away from this time waster."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is a feel good book.

Allie who is engaged to be married decides she needs to see Noah and to tell him of the engagement herself and hopefully be able to move on with her life, but soon they fall in love all over again.Nicholas Sparks is an evil, evil man I never begin any of his novels without a box of tissues by my side, I have only come across one of his books so far that didn't leave me in tears, but this novel put the others I have read to shame. It is so beautiful and moving, the love the main characters share is so strong that the thought of it can cause me to emit a heartfelt sigh. I had put off reading this book for a while now because I had seen the movie and if this book was anything like it I knew I would be crying like a baby, but I was not prepared for what awaited me. Whereas the movie focuses a lot on the summer the two spent together this novel focuses on the time that came after and I don't think it could have been better. I wish I had read this a long time ago it was absolutely amazing."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"While this book may make you cry and is sweet, it definitely made me see how typical Nicholas Sparks is. He uses the same themes or ideas for most of his books and they are all very similar. Because the story seemed so familiar and unoriginal, I really didn't enjoy it. If you have read several of his books already, I don't recommend this book. If this is the first Nicholas Sparks book you have read, you probably will enjoy this book, although others like Dear John or The Last Song are better."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Received the book promptly.

We like to imagine that and create our own romance with it. That's how it is.What's bad is the writing. Oh gosh, the writing wasn't up to par as you might've image it.

But I could not resist sharing my thoughts on Nicholas Sparks' &quot;The Notebook&quot;. For a southern country boy like myself, the setting could not have been more perfect, making it easy to identify with the charming subtleties of rural life. The detail is sufficiently descriptive, idyllic and romantic but not overpowering or distracting. The author remains true to his task of writing a love story, capturing the essence of what we all would like to have in our lives - the once-in-a-lifetime love that endures forever. Like many I'm sure, I draw many parallels between the characters and my own life. Even the details - Noah's deep, musical voice, his love of nature, the strong work ethic and easy-going style are traits that describe me, so I especially became drawn into the story. I, too, have met THE ONE that I dream of spending the rest of my life with, yet there remains a chasm between us. I only hope I don't have to wait 14 years for her! As corny as it sounds, I am inspired by Sparks to keep alive my true feelings for the most beautiful woman I've ever met. Yes, I'm an idealist, but you realists out there need us! I devoured the book in one evening and the same night penned a poem which I SHALL one day share with my true love."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The real love story of this book is not the young, sensual love of their youth, but the extraordinary love and devotion in their last moments of life. Sparks recreates the struggles of age and Alzheimer's beautifully; and, thank goodness, he gives us hope that true love can endure them both. It's hard to recommend a novel that hurts this much to read; and certainly, I cannot advise the cynic or those who have never loved to read this. However, I do highly recommend it to those who have loved or have witnessed such a love in their parents or others they have known. It gives us all hope that there is still some beauty in wearing out. I just wish Sparks could have made Noah 96 years old instead of early eighties."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"As an avid book reader, this book was one that made me sad &amp; happy at the same time. I highly recommend it to everyone. Recommended by a friend. This book is worth a second reading. Don't miss it! Would have like to have given it 6 stars."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book in one sitting, it was the most inspiring collection of thoughts, feelings and truly inspirational proses. Do not pass up the opportunity to read it - I am purchasing copies for my entire family. It will be read many times over. Thank you Nicholas Sparks!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was told to read that book by someone I had just met. The book was too good to put down! I have talked to several people who loved it too. I just picked up his new book a message in a bottle."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is a book that pulls you in from the start and by the end you don't want to let go. It's a simple love story and I cried through the entire last chapter. It's one of those books that allows you to feel as if you are right there with the characters. The letters written by the characters show just how much love they had for each other. Two friends told me that I had to read it and I'm glad I did!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Sparks shows great sensitivity to the problems of aging in this engaging romantic tale of deep love. Through this book and his subsequent novel, Messages in a Bottle, he renews interest and enthusiasm for letter and journal writing. Both are great books to curl up with- just realize your legs will go numb because you won't be able to put either book down."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have never read such a great book that made me feel more happy or more sad at the same time. I couldn't put the book down, once I started reading it, I just couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. I absolutely loved this book, I will definitely buy Nicholas Sparks next book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"It sounded like something I would like. Really, it did. However, I found the plot hard to follow and there wasn't that much of a story there to begin with. I'm now trying to get interested in Message in a Bottle, and I'm having the same trouble with it. I'm wondering what all the fuss over Sparks is about and just what kind of motion pictures can come from either of the novels."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"if you like to cry you will like this book...not much to do but cry your way through it...... not much story, but still entertaining...."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I hate books that have movie covers on them, unfortunately this is one of them, a great story by an amazing author ruined by a cover from a movie."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Although it doesnt start out as the moive starts, it still is a breathtaking book!! I just loved it from cover to cover."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I would say it's never to late to enjoy a good book! I love a book that just flows, and is not so overwelming with characters that I can't keep up. This is simple, touching, and full of powerful emotions. I'm happy I'm reading it before watching the movie, although I'm sure I will enjoy the movie too."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"All of Nicholas Sparks books are amazing and they never seize to blow my mind. This is one of my favorites"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was a good book, I forgot I already had a copy in my Nicholas Sparks collection. Ended jup giving the extra copy to a girl I work with. I have not heard it she liked it or not."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have not seen the movie yet, and made a point to read the book first, and I absolutely love it!! Recommended to everyone!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Very good.. everyone should have or at least want a love story like this!!!! Inspiring I'm 14 and Nicholas sparks has got me hooked!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is the quickest book I have ever read. It was THAT addicting and hard to put down.I surprisingly enjoyed the time lapse in the book. After completing it, I thought \\"wow, it only took them two days to fall in love again,\\" but I did not realize it had been such a short amount of time while reading. Allie and Noah really do love each other, and Noah's love for her especially is what broke my heart by the end of the book. He never once gave up on her.I find it painfully beautiful that he reads \\"their story\\" to her everyday day or so. If I were to become ill like Allie, I would want the same thing. I completely broke down when she said his name on the last page, when she remembered him. That gave me hope that love can truly find a way through time."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I thought this book was amazing. It had great detail and gave me many emotions. I just really didn't like the very end."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book touched my heart. I have never been so moved by a book. This has inspired me to never give up up in my goals or passions. I truly love this book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Anyone who has feelings will love this book. This is simply a great story from beginning to end. Noah's love for her is so pure, every woman should be so lucky. I am so tired of readers who think every book must be analyzed to death. Sparks didn't write this story so it would be picked apart; he wrote it to entertain. And that is exactly what it does! Read it today. If it doesn't break your heart a thousand times I am sorry for you."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"TOO SAPPY? Well, I guess if your self-involved, self-centered, living totally in the ME generation, taking no thought for others except for what you can GET from them, then yes, I guess it would seem alittle sappy. But TRUE LOVE is what this story is really about, it's not just here when the times are good, or when it's only good for you, it's for the long haul, to the end of that life, even when it's fading and far away. I loved every word, was swept away by every loving gesture and watched my husband cry as he read it to me. THANK YOU NICHOLAS!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"After skimming through the 189 or so reviews I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one who thought this book was a total waste of time. Luckily, I got it at the library (sorry, amazon.com). Trite, poorly developed, unrealistic are mild terms for this poorly written book. Skip it, folks, and read some Anne Tyler."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I cryed from beginning to end! It is a wonderful story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I really liked this book because of the bittersweetness of it. From the magical romance , we are transported to the cruelty of Alzheimer's disease and how it hurts Noah. He really loves the girl but the disease tears them apart.A tearjerker that will touch you to the core of your heart ."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Boy, this has been the most online reviews I've seen for one book here at Amazon.com. And it's a love/hate book. You either love it or you hate it. It takes a lot for a book to make me teary eyed. The last one to do that to me was The Bridges Of Madison County, and now The Notebook, so closely compared to Bridges, has done the same thing to me. I was touched by the romance of the lead characters, not so much with their rediscovering of lost love, but of his devotion to his wife in their &quot;golden years&quot;. That was the best part of the love story. Usually books about romance have the man and woman get together and live happily ever after. The Notebook tells you how that ever after may end."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I'm excited to read this book because of the good buzz it has been getting. Boy am I to be disappointed! There is no humour, and the dialogues make me cringe. The characters are as flat and one-dimensional as pancakes. I won't be reading his ssecond book.Mr Sparks, don't quit your day job."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Aren't we all searching for this kind of love and total devotion? Nicholas Sparks has written so eloquently, so aware of the heart and the soul, so aware of what is the most important element in life---love. This book is a must read for anyone...anyone that does believe that this kind of love is really out there."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"While this book certainly had its flaws, to include the unrealistic but uplifting ending, the love Noah felt for Allie really shined through. Sparks did a wonder ful job of conveying this love to the reader and made you really feel Noah's struggle in maintaining his sanity as his world fell apart. His abiding love for Allie made his remaining days ons earth worthwhile and full of purpose."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book a month ago and cannot get it out of my head. I, unlike other reviewers, read for pleasure not to grade for some Doctorate Literature class. This book was a beautiful account of true love. It also describes, like no other, how intense a &quot;first love&quot; can be no matter what the age. My first love was at age 14 and he is still permanent fixture in my heart. 15 years later. It made me question so many aspects of my emotional being. I have recommended this book to Oprah for her book club because I believe it will touch many different types of people. Alzheimer's is a very real disease that many of us will have to face whether we like it or not. This book definitely accounts how patient and kind love must be to endure this kind of disease. I can't wait to read it again."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I've read this book at least a dozen times and it is still my favorite! It's still beautiful, as well as heart wrenching every time as it was the first time I read it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Love defies all of minds boundaries. This book inspires me to run back to my first love. As he explains how Noah felt after Sarah left town. \\"Barely anything stirs any of my innermost feelings as She, my first Love\\" He said something along those lines. I related with a soul deep connection when he stated that. I felt as though I could run through mountains, spread my wings and soar, better yet I felt as though I was doing just that. Just knowing that I loved her and I was never as sure as something else in my entire life. This book has talked about True Love. Something that people lack in relationships now a days. Love at its best. True Love in a World like this is"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Incredibly short and not very detailed. May be the only book I've ever read where the movie was actually better."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I bought this for my sons girlfriend she is 24 ...she says she likes to read this guy' stories...so bought it for her from her wish list"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have seen the movie many times, but the book is so much better. I loved this so much better."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book is as good as the movie is I couldn't stop reading it it took me 2 days to finish this whole book!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was a used book so I didn't expect perfection, but the packaging was extremely flimsy and beat up when I received it and the front and back covers had some bends and tears in it which I didn't expect based on the description when I got it. But, for the price I can't complain to much."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I Loved This Book! It Makes Me Want To Find True Love Like This! I Was Scared Too Read This Because I Loved The Movie And It Was One Of My Favorite, I Was Scared That If I Read It And It Was Really Different I Would End Up Hating It, But I Love The Book And Still Adore The Movie. Definitely A Must Read!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I absolutely love this book. This is an amazing book that explains about true love and total compassion. There is also sadness, but when complimented with the passion, it is wonderfully beautiful. The book is different than the movie, of course, but it is in a very, very great way. I would recommend this book to anybody looking for some real love. Nicholas Sparks is just pure genius."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Like a lot of other people, I read the book after watching the movie. A beautiful story worth reading, Nicholas Sparks always deliver."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Those who say that this book is full of &quot;goo&quot; are missing the whole point !! This book is a great love story.....even I had tears streaming down my face as I read it.....A MUST for anyone with Love in their heart !!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I don't know what is wrong with people who don't love this book! I guess people just think a romance novel is supposed to be full of sex and more sex. This was tastefully written and Mr.Sparks is a great author. The ending was so touching I cried and cried. It was not unrealistic, it was beautiful."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"My friend told me about this book... she loved it and so did I. It's a must-read for anyone who has forgotten what true love essentially means. Uterly amazing..."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The book is so inspiring and it shows that real love really can occur in a world as harsh as ours it's comforting. It is a wonderful love story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"As I finished reading The Notebook, I cried like a baby. My husband walked into the room and just looked at me. This story holds special meaning for he and I because we have grown up with severely terminal illnesses in our families. The book completely encompasses what 'true love' and marriange vows are all about. I would encourage anyone considering marriage to read this first. If you could be the one sitting in the chair...you are ready!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks' The Notebook was simply amazing. This is a beautifully written love story that only happens in the movies-or in a book in this case. The feelings that this book evokes can not be put into words. Reading this book makes you long to be in another's arms feeling safe and secure. I recommend this book to everyone-especially those who are hopeless romantics."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. As I was reading the book there were parts in it where i actually cried as i was reading. That has never happened to me before. I felt the characters so vividly. And whispered a pray for God to send me such a man. The only part is ifeel it ended to quickly, there was more. I wanted to know how he felt when she was her self that amazing time it left me hanging, which i feel the writer wanted to do."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I enjoyed this story very much...short and sweet. I did feel though that the prelude to the ending was a bit drawn out. I don't feel that we needed to know so much about Allie's disease. The ending made up for this though. It was very beautiful. A must-read for anyone who believes in soul mates."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is the most sensitive pageturner I have ever read. It captures everything a women ever needs in a relationship. I can only imagine what it would be like to be loved like that. You must read it, if not for the enjoyment then for the experience."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is a book about true love and the fact that whomever you are with, your first love is never forgotten.This book made me feel all the emotions and I loved the characters. The ending is something that you will never forget!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook, by Nicholas Sparks, is a fiction book about a gripping romance between two people, Noah and Allie. They met as teenagers one fateful summer at a carnival 14 years ago....when they meet up again, will they rekindle their romance?Allie was a rich socialite visiting her summer house in New Bern for the summer. Noah was a poor working class villager, trying to have some fun and earn a living. They are introduced by their friends Sarah and Finn one night at the carnival, and from then on they were inseparable. Allie's parents didn't approve of Noah because he was poor, and when Allie went back to her house, they lost contact. They met other people and Allie was engaged. But they still couldn't stop thinking about each other and the love they had so many years ago. Then, Allie and Noah meet again, and Allie is extremely confused as to why she is still having strong feelings for Noah. Who will she choose?This book was memorable, entertaining, and gripping. Its tale of romance is so real and beautiful, and I hope that someday I will have the same kind of love that they have. This book is also sad; I cried at the end. The book suggests that you will always have a place somewhere in your heart for your first love, and that sometimes, that love is the only one for you, as it was for Noah and Allie.This book made me see that true love really does exist, and if you are lucky enough to find someone who you love completely, there is nothing else that could make you happier other than being with them.This book was one of my favorite books so far, and if you read it, you should keep a box of tissues nearby."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Tear-worthy! I loved The Notebook with a passion. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a instant classic love story. This book shows the amazing, emotional travel of the love between Noah and Allie. I would give this book 5 stars, hands down. I love this book and would rave about it to anyone who will listen. Wonderful! Amazing!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The book I read is called The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks. It's a romantic novel in which I enjoyed reading a lot just because it was a pleasant and romantic book. The only part that made me emotional was the end.I loved the characters in the book. The main characters are Allie, who is a rich girl from the city and she had everything she's ever wanted. She fell in love with a guy named Noah, who was the total opposite from her. He was from a small town in North Carolina when he met Allie. She was just there for the summer with her family. He wasn't making that much money but they were so crazy about each other and that's what I found to be so cute.The conflict had to do with Allie's parents. They thought Noah was going to be a distraction for Allie since she was heading to collage at the end of summer. The conflict with her mom forbidding her to see Noah didn't keep them away forever. Though out the story Allie had to make her own choices instead of making ever one else around her happy she had to please her self.I loved The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks. I also loved his other book a Walk to Remember. He writes such great love stories that keep people so entertained. Anyone who likes to read romantic novels should read the notebook"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Amazon.com ReviewMy personal thoughts about The Notebook, by Nicholas Sparks, are mosthighly. The story is very well written and readers who like excitinglove novels would absolutely love this book. This novel keeps yourthoughts wondering, makes you happy and sometime even depressed. Ipersonally think this is one of the best books I have selected to readlately. A really cool fact about this book is that there is even amovie made after it! But I would suggest reading the book first,because some little details are left out. All in all if you're lookingfor cute love novel this would be the perfect book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The notebook is a remarkable love story between two people. Allie and Noah met and spent an, unforgotten summer together where two hearts joined as one. Eventually the summer ended and so did their love. Fourteen years ago, they parted and lost contact. They went on with their lives, but not completely. A piece of their heart remained with each other, they constantly thought about each other, which began the start of a remarkable love story.This is an easy read. Nicholas sparks, an excellent writer, gets your attention quickly making it hard to put down. The story begins from Noah telling the story; you are able to feel the emotions. The middle of the book is being told by the narrator, you can still feel the emotions that come along with the book. Then the book ends with Noah reflecting into the past, and telling how he feels, as if remembering everything. The book is mostly written in Noah's side of view, but Allie's side is shown at critical moments. I enjoyed reading this book; because it was about the love of two young people who shared the true love they had and realized it was completely unlike any other that either of them had felt. As the book progresses, you can feel the emotional stress and difficulties each are going through. The book shows the lives and thoughts of both young and older people. It also shows, the sides of Allie and Noah, as they grow older, and their lives begin changing, as you can't stay young forever. Although, they are getting older, their love for each other is never ending. They will always be connected in some way, shape or form, whether its memory or heart."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks is a great book. I would recomend this book for any high school student or a mature middle school studeant I would not recomend this for a child. I like this book becuse it is a love story. If you are not in to the lovey dovey books this book is not for you. This book is about two young lovers. They go through some difficult times. This is a great book and it is hard to put down. A hint for the women I would not wear any eye make-up when you read this book. You will cry!-monica c.-a.k.a chipper chearleader"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Sparks' is a tad melodramatic in his prose but this tender story of growing old with your true love is endearing. All I can say is ... we should all be this lucky. The Notebook has all the standard love themes of \\"love lost and found\\", \\"torn between two lovers\\", \\"love that cannot be due to socioeconomic constraints\\", \\"first loves reunited\\", and on and on and on.Noah and Alli fall in love at 17, again at 31, and Alli and Noah find themselves in an old age home in their 80's. Once more, if you're meant to be together, nothing and no one will stop it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A man named Noah Calhon was a very lonesome man. He lived in a beautiful location out in the country all by himself. Noah was having images and dreams about a woman he fell in love with long ago. Her name was Allie Nelson. Allie Nelson was about to get married to a wealthy lawyer named Lon. Allie had also been thinking about Noah and decided that she must go and see him before she got married. Allie met up with Noah and they had dinner together, went on long walks together, and had long conversations together, for two days. Before Allie had left she told her fianc&eacute; that she was going to go look for antiques for their house that they would be living in. Two days later, Noah and Allie were having breakfast together and Noah heard a knock on the door. It was Allie's mom. She told the two that Lon had called the hotel room that Allie was staying in and did not get any answer. He called several times, then called Allie's mom. The Lon and Allie's mother had a hunch that Allie might be at Noah's house. She said Lon was on his way to the hotel to look for Allie. Allie started crying, because she knew she had to make a big decision, whether to stay with Noah or go back to Lon. You will have to read the book to find out what Allie's decision is.What I didn't like about the book is that the book kept using I at the end. I wasn't sure who they were talking about. The book also had a couple different speakers which got kind of confusing. I liked mostly everything else about the book.I don't think my book is comparable to any other books or series I have read. It is the best book I have ever read.I think mostly girls would like this book unless any boys are really into romance. This book is not the easiest book to read but it is also not the hardest."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is an incredible book with an engaging romantic story line. The book will surely keep the reader interested with it's rich details and plot. I reccomend this book to anyone who likes romance novels because this book is great!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This summer I decided to try Nicholas Sparks's books. I loved the movie, \\"The Notebook\\" and wanted to see if the book was as good/better (usually books are better). I don't know if it was because I remembered the movie so well but I found the book not as exciting/touching as the movie."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I just saw the movie premiere of The Notebook - I did not read the book, however, the movie is so wonderfully done - there was not a dry eye in the theatre ! Honestly, this movie could not have been done more beautifully, the acting is wonderful - Ryan Gosling - unreal ! A must see it again and must own when it comes out ! I could go on and on - but hopefully you get the point - GO SEE IT !"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I absolutely loved this book! Unlike some of the other reviewers who were expecting to be intellectually stimulated by reading it,I found it to be a heartwarming love story; one we could only hope to find. In light of the recent death of former President Ronald Reagan, one can only imagine what Nancy Reagan experienced with Alzheimer's disease. She once refered publically to this disease as &quot;the long good-bye&quot;,because it slowly takes the mind of a loved one. Nicholas Sparks does an excellent job of describing Noah's pain in dealing with this disease. The end of this book clearly states that it was based on the love story between his wife's grandparents. I am looking forward to seeing the movie, and I only hope that it is as good as the book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"My cousin and I had seen the preview for \\"The Notebook\\" while we were going to watch a movie, they had said that it was also out in a novel version, so that week we just had to get it and we did. It was easy for us to read it especially because its one of those books that you could understand and relate too. Were finally done with it and now its time to watch the movie this June."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was recommended by my younger sister to read this book. I did and enjoyed it for its entertainment value.Like any action movie, we know movies like The Matrix or any of that sort will never be nominated for the Oscars.&quot;The Notebook&quot; is not a work of literature compared to the works of Hemingway or Twain or Steinbeck. But, &quot;The Notebook&quot; does move me as an individual. It may not challenge me on my intellect when having to read books like &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; and analyze it line by line; however Sparks' novel truly did move and captivate me--it is after all a romantic novel.I find any person odd and awkward if they did not feel anything when reading this book. They should at least feel a miniscule amount of a warm and fuzzy feeling inside.To continue, I do fine Allie's decision to go to Noah during her engagement a flag-raising issue. Had Allie and Lon been married for quite some time and then if Allie visits Noah, then this will be issue of moral degrading on her behalf.Bottomline is: I truly enjoyed reading the novel which is a break from reading &quot;literatures&quot; from college assignments. I for one, sincerely recommends to other people my age to borrow from a friend or have a copy. And go see the movie when it comes out in theatres June 25, 2004 and please share the movie with your significant other. :-)"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"When I brought this book I knew exactly what I was getting myself into. I wanted to read a simple, predictable romantic story, and that's what I got. Yes, the characters are pretty one dimensional, and the plot and the writing style are pretty standard, but the book as a whole is a good (but certainly not great), lazy summer read. If you know what the book is like and what to expect, you'll be satisfied. This is not a novel that challenged me intellectually. I accepted it for what it is: A straight, fairly ordinary romantic novel."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was an emotional but enjoyable read for me. A bit of a tear jerker, but in a good way. Nicholas Sparks evokes all the feelings of first love and its simple beauty. When that love lasts a lifetime and battles old age and disease, it is even more precious. More than anything, I think this story is a reminder of the power of love, and the power of telling someone how you feel - in words both written and spoken, in action and deed - every chance you get."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Between work and graduate school, I still managed to finish this book in 4 days. I didn't manage to finish it with dry eyes though. If you are a romantic you will love it or if you aren't a romantic (at least thought you weren't like I did) it will move you in ways you never thought possible. It tells the story of a love that is rare and very moving. It seems predictable but the author did a wonderful job of keeping you guessing and throwing in a few twists that makes you realize it isn't going to end exactly how you figured. I couldn't put it down and now that the movie coming out soon, I'm thrilled. If you plan on seeing the movie...ever....read the book first. You don't want hollywood to recreate another romantic story that should be experienced through words first."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Wow! This book is great. It's simplicty just touched my heart, soul, and mind. This book will stay with me forever and I hope to pass it along to my children. It proves to me that we take things in life for granted, but once we put our lives (or one specific aspect of it) into focus,and really pay attention to what is dear to us, a deeper meaning begins to unfold."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I bought this book because the movie is coming out this summer and I like to read books before I see the actual movies, this was a wonderful book. I couldn't put it down and ended up finishing it in one afternoon. The way Nicholas Sparks creates a scene and conveys characters' feelings. Everything is so vivid, you can feel every single emotion, as if you're the one who is experiencing the plot of the book, not the characters. I can't wait to see how they convey Noah and Allie's love on screen, but somehow I know that it will not measure up to the way Nicholas Sparks created their love. It's a love that you only wish you could experience."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"i don't normally like to read, but when i started this book i couldn't put it down! as soon as i was finished reading it i went out and bought my own copy and i have probably read it about 50 times and it is still great. it truly is a timeless love story about people finding love again after so many years. this is a must read for everyone who loves romances and even some who don't. i cried when i first read it and i still cry when i read it now. before you go see the movie, which is opening in june, you must read the book. i hope this review helps someone buy this book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is a magnificent book that I will never forget. This book shows how much people really can love eachother. The love between Allie and Noah is unforgetable and timeless. While I was reading this I could not put the book down. After reading this book it become one of my very favorites. Nicholas Sparks is an amazing author!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"You'll never know what true love is until you found that special someone who will be devoted to you until the very end. This book took me on a beautiful journey of what true love can ultimately be. Nicholas Sparks captivated me through the characters and I could feel the emotions as I read the story. I didn't want to put this book down because I wanted to know the ending and I must say that it took me 3 days to get there! The ending is a suprise in itself! This book will take you on a journey and show you what love is. All I can say is, read the book and enjoy the journey."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I began reading this book, without having read one review. I read the first chapter, and was hooked! It is a truly romantic book - not trashy in the least. I have since bought this book for both my daughters. It softly reveals the loving, tender circle of life for two people who were obviously very much in love... even to the end. The ending is a surprise - I cried all the way thru it. Would highly recommend this book. Girls... marry the man who appreciates this book, and you will experience it LIVE."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is a romantic novel that is filled with tragedy and triumph.

But they soon realize how much they need each other and how many memories there are yet to be made.The Notebook is a well-written and interesting novel that will intrigue those who love a great love story this book is the best love story you will ever read, The Notebook."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Having read the book I honestly don't know if it can be titled a romance. To me it was a human interest story. However, the touch and go of love in the story dragged my emotions in. I wish I could believe in the love that transcends medical science, but the emotions of the story confused me. The book is for those who know there is something greater than us in the world.

It was depressing and too unbelievable. Believe me, I love FICTION and stories that seem like they can only happen in fairy tales, but COME ON, just as someone else said, Alzheimer's can't be cured!!! Why did Nicholas Sparks even want to add Alzheimer's disease in his story? This is just insulting to people who have Alzheimer's disease or to people with grandparents who have it. Can't he find another issue to write about in his book?"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I can't help get the feeling the person reviewing this book above for Amazon.com is simply looking to be critical for the sake of being a critic.

I can't count how many times the writing brought tears to my eyes.I was a little disappointed about how the movie changed the sequence in which things occured. Especially the ending. For by the movie doing what they did at the ending, means it will be impossible for the sequal movie to ever be made, cause Noah is alive and well in the sequal book.Doesn't mean I hate the movie, by no means.

Yeah, it started out slow, but after the first 20 pages, I couldn't put it down. The story is so romantic, and I cried three times while reading the story.

Speaking to my future mother in law the next day I found out that she owned the book 'Message in a Bottle' and 'The Notebook'. Today I have read the whole book 'The Notebook'. Subsequently I have not stopped crying. This is the best book I have read this year. I am a very keen Danielle Steele fan and have a copy of all her published books and this book has topped the best of her's.

The love letters to one another are perfect. I want to be loved like that.

My mind drifts to Noah and Allie quite often during the day and each time it does, I grow to appreciate my own husband more and more. &quot;The Notebook&quot; truly gives the perfect example of &quot;in sickness and in health&quot; and shows what true love is made of. I'm sure that I will never forget this novel, unless I should happen to be dealt the same hand in the end as Allie, in which I would hope that the same miracle could happen to me and my husband. Thanks Mr. Sparks for sharing your talent. I am now a fan and truly look forward to reading your other works."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was really drawn in by Ally and Noah's relationship through out the book because no matter how angry and upset they'd get with each other they never did stop loving. Their relationship was based on forgiveness and understandance. I feel in love with Noah's character because he was very charming and at the same time a very strong person and though a little stubborn at times, he knew how to make Ally happy.The Notebook is the most romantic story I've ever read. I loved the way that Nicolas Sparks showed their relationship transform and grow stronger. It really captured all parts of relationships too with expressing their feelings and thoughts and reading about their typical arguments and the way they worked things out to be back together. I loved how emotional the book was because it was extremely catchy and harder to put the book down.I really enjoyed this book, tears and all because Nicolas Sparks used brilliant words for description and catchy incidents to make this book last a lifetime in my memories, a lot of books I've read I never think about later but every time I think of romance and love stories I will always remember back to this book. I would recommend this book to any reader who loves romance and rapid changes of emotions because this book is based on love and strength and I know that without a question it'll be a challenge to put down the book for good."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I really like this book . My favorite part was the part when they were at the lake and all the birds were around. The only part I didn't like was the order that the book as in. It started when they are really old and cripple.

Nicholas Sparks describes every moment, every single word just perfect. He makes me think that the true love exist, just one for all your live."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book is a great story. I like that it carries you all the way though their life. Sparks books, while enjoyable, always tend to be a little cliche, and a little too squeaky...but you can't help fall for this story, the characters, their stuggles, and their development....the movie is wonderful too...and very true to the book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"When the movie was released in 2004, my friend was so ecstatic about seeing it hoping it captured the magic of the book. I've never really opted to read a book in place of a movie (most people are shocked when I say this), so, I thought I would give this one a go just to see what I was missing out on.Although the movie captured the essence of the story, there are some differences. The book spans 14 years, and, if our math was accurate, the movie spans 7. The book details additional insightful information about his father, the war, her paintings, and the many years in-between which are excluded from the movie. The ending is also different - (no, I'm not going to spoil it). Both endings are good, just different. If you liked the movie, you will absolutely LOVE the book. If you haven't seen the movie, read the book....it's better.It is such an easy read. Sparks' first person perspective and writing style contribute to the personalization of the story and the smooth flow of events. The reader is immediately drawn in, feeling all of the emotions with each turn of the page. I love Sparks' simple conversational style of writing. There is a classic simplicity that makes the delivery of the story better than others I've read. It doesn't feel as if you are reading something conjured up with a dictionary or thesaurus full of metaphors - just a simple, personal story from a man's perspective. This is an absolutely beautiful story that is a must read."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A rather thin, simply written novel without much substance.Very quickly read, the novel is a rare example of the movie'sadaptation being better than the book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"It is a sweet love story from the youth of people who are now old and ill. It is much better than the movie.

It's a love story between two people, Aly and Noah. They met in New Bern in the 1930's, ever sence the day they met they were unseperatable. Aly was the girl of Noahs's dreams. The summer Aly spent in New Bern was the summer of her life. Everday she spent it with Noah. Finally it was the end of the summer, and it was time for Aly to go back home. Noah wrote her everday for a year straight. Finally on the three hundreth and sixty-ninth day, from not hearing from Aly all year, he wrote her a goodbye later. For fifteen years they were seperated in there own lives doing seperate things. Noah went into war, his dad died and he inheirted a good sum of money to restore his \\"dream home\\". Aly worked as a nurse for the war veteren's, and finished school. She met a successful lawyer named, Lon Hammond. They got engaged. When Aly saw the Ad for Noah's home in New Bern, she had to go see him. She spent two days in New Burn finding out how much she's missed sence she hasn't seen Noah. In the end she followed her heart and married Noah. Noah was her soul mate. They had three children. Aly now suffers from a disease called Alheimerez's. She lives in a hospital with Noah right by her side. Everyday Noah reads her the story, of how they met.Ever sence The Notebook came out on DVD, I always wanted to see it. Finally I had some spare time, and got around into watching it. Ever sence I watched it for the first time, I could never get enough of it. It was then labeled as one of my \\"favorite\\" movies of all time. Sence I happened to fall in love with the movie, I thought i'd thoroughly enjoy the book. Now that I have seen both the book and the film, I highly reccommend this book to anyone who loves, love stories, a classic reading or has seen the movie. I think people from ages 14- to even an adult would enjoy reading this classic. It's an excellent story and is very hard to put down.The Notebook was definetly a page turner. I was often up till 11:00 at night reading it. I was tempted to find out, what was going to happen next. One of the reason's I enjoyed this book so much, was because the way it was written. Nicholas Sparks is an amazing writer, and has excellent use in word choice, quotations and sentence fluenceny. He can tell a story and you will know exactly what is going on throughout the whole book. Throughtout the entire novel there were many diffrent sences that i was often intrested in. From the part where Aly met Noah, till the day she left New Bern, every part had something intresting to find out.The Notebook is an excellent classic and I would reccommend this book anyday."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook, written by Nicholas Sparks, is a true love story. This story is written about Nicholas Sparks wife's grandparents. It is published by Time Warner group in the year 1996.It is a romantic non-fiction piece. It is a 213 page book.This is a love story about Allie Nelson and Noah Calhoun. In this story Noah is remembering the past about when he and Allie first met in 1940. She was nineteen and staying in Newbern North Carolina for the summer with her family and this is where she met Noah. That summer they both fell in love with each other. Unfortunately, Allies parents were not fond of Noah and in the fall they took her back to Winston-Salem. Noah tried contacting her but his letters went unanswered. They eventually moved on with thier lives. Ten years later Noah is still a bachelor and Allie is now engaged to a wealthy lawyer, Lon Hammond. She often thinks of Noah and saw in the newspaper that he was restoring an old plantation house they had once had a vision of restoring together. Before Allie gets married, she decides to visit Noah one last time. During the visit they once again found the love that they shared before. What do you think Allie will do? Go against what her parents want for her or stay with her wealthy fianc&eacute;?This book is my absolute favorite. The book is just like the movie, but when you read the book you will have a better understanding of what each person are thinking. That is a strength of this book. A weakness of this book could be that it's too much of a sappy love story. The theme of this book is not relevant to any matter of my life. The writing of this book is wonderful it is so easy to understand what is going on, like when he is flashing back to the past summer between Noah and Allie it's so easy to follow.I definitely recommend The Notebook! If you're looking for a love story this is the book for you. The mood this book put me in I was in awe! The twists of fate that led them back to each other are amazing."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Aw, this book was such a fairytale. It was not only a beautiful love story of two soul-mates, it was inspirational! Just reading this book, really taught me that TRUE love will never die.

Finally when they met again, they found themselves different people with different stories but the same intense connection.Their love leaps off the page & into your heart.Beautiful book.I don't reccommend this to just anyone! It's definetely for girls. In other words, it's a tear-jerker. High school girls & mom's will love it!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I urge everyone who enjoys a love story to read this. It was a lovely tale-a tear jerking story!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This story is full of romance,heartache,and tragate. It captures your heart in every very and makes you wonder is there really love as great as the love that Allie and Noah share. I have read the book and watched the movie. Though the movie does cover some of the things in the book, the book covers so moch more.The book starts out in a nursing home where Noah at the age of 80 reads to the nursing home residents. Though he reads to so many people in the nursing home there is one special person down the hall that he looks forward to seeing.When Allie was diagnosed with Alzhimer's she forgets everything and the most important memories of her life.Noah reads \\"The Notebook\\" to his soulmate Allie everyday in hopes that she will remeber the life that they once lived.So the story begins in a town in North Carolina called New Bern where ninteen year old Noah meets Allie (17yrs old) at the Neuse River Festival. Not knowing that they would once become romantic, separated, and reunited. They meet and soon are insepirable. They spent every minute they can. Though Allie's high class family does not approve of their love Allie finds a way to be with him. And as everyone knows all goods things come to an end, Allie and Noah are separated because Allie's parents have decided to move back to Winston-Salem. Though separated they both never forget the love they shared that summer.Noah writes her still determined to be with her though she had moved. He wrote her for 2 yrs, never recieving a respond. Though sad that she didnt respond he wrote a final letter stating that he hopes they meet again not knowing that they would again. What he didnt know that was Allie never recieved any of the letters. like Noah she thinks he forgot about their love and trys to forget about him.After 14 years had passed Allie has been engaged and Noah has been in War and recived a large money sum using it to restore a old home.One day Allie sees an article in the paper with his picture in the paper next to the home.

The next 2 days that followed were like them falling in love all over again. And Allie is forced to pick between her first love and her fiance. But as hard as it is she follows her heart and picks Noah.This story proves that love does find a way and that behind every great love story there is great love .I recommend this story to everyone. It touches your heart and is so romatic."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks is known for many different books, three of which have been made into major motion pictures. These three are The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, and Message in a Bottle. He is also known for many other highly acclaimed books and is, in my opinion, one of the greatest authors of all times. My favorite Nicholas Sparks book is The Notebook for a variety of reasons.The Notebook is about separated love, and the struggle to figure out what true love is all about. The book begins with the reuniting of two lovers, Noah and Allie, after fourteen years of separation. Conflict arises when we find out that Allie is engaged to another man-an affluent man with whom she believes she is in love. Will she choose the man that she feels comfortable around, or the man with the money? The book adds a giant twist at the end, and will leave anyone in tears.Amazon reviewer, Martha R. Dienst, said that she did not like the book at all and that she almost quit reading it mid-book. She said it was \\"clich&eacute;d, vapid, and predictable-way too predictable,\\" a direct opposition to my opinion. In the fear of giving away the book I will not go into much detail as to why I disagree, except that the ending was extremely surprising, and added an emotion that was not present previously.Orrin Carson Judd, who posted his review on The Notebook online, had other negative feelings toward the book. He said that it had a dull ending that was \\"utterly shallow.\\" He thought that the book should have ended the opposite way than it actually did; and I disagree. When people read a book they do not want to read a cruel ending that tears apart the two people that you have grown to love, even though there is still a good amount of emotion that must be put into the closing of a book. The book must have a good variation of drama, reality, and still maintain an acceptable ending that does not tear people up.Many Amazon reviewers had positive things to say, such as Judith E. Pavluvcik and B Fizzle. They both highly acclaimed the book and recommended it to anyone who was a \\"hopeless or hopeful romantic.\\" They also said that the book was great for all ages and would warm anyone's heart. Judith reminded us to \\"keep a box of Kleenex handy-you are sure to use them!\\" I agree with both of these reviewers one hundred percent. Everything about this book was magical and poetic. I remember telling my mom after reading it that \\"they were the most beautiful words I had ever seen written on paper!\\"Don't expect to read this book without feeling emotions along with the characters. Nicholas Sparks does an excellent job of making you feel like the characters from the first paragraph. You will laugh at the awkwardness of Allie and Noah as they first get reacquainted, you will smile as they get stuck in the storm and share wonderful moments amidst the rain and thunder, and you will cry as the story winds to a close and you realize the reality of the situation. Although the book brings a tear to almost everyone's eyes, isn't that the best kind of story? Life isn't perfect either, and books like The Notebook remind us of this while still maintaining the fantasy of a love that endures all trouble and for which everyone longs."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks' intriguing novel The Notebook about the enduring love between Noah Calhoun and Allie Nelson is truly a touching love story. Sparks captivates the heart of the reader through his repetitive use of letter writing. This form of writing is used effectively for deeper insight into the thoughts and feelings of the characters. The letters are written in first person thus giving the reader a break from the primary third person point of view. The letters are also a realistic form of communication for a couple in a long distance relationship. The author uses epistolary elements sensibly because of the experiences he shared with his beloved wife in the early stages of their courtship.Flashback is the second literary element employed by Sparks that makes The Notebook a success. This style of writing allows the reader to experience the everlasting passionate emotions felt by Noah and Allie. It captivates a broader audience by describing the lives of the very old as well as the references to their lives as very young people. Noah reads to Allie in the present to help preserve her memories of the past, which she fails to remember due to her Alzheimer's disease. As a result, the reader's attitude toward the novel's characters is concerned and sympathetic. In conclusion, the author's employment of letter writing and flashback strengthen the novel's content and the effect it bestows upon the reader."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Annotation: \\"The Notebook\\" is about a man named Noah Calhoun who had lost the love of his life more than ten years ago.

After breaking the Notre Dame school record as part of a relay team in 1985 as a freshman, he was injured and spent the summer recovering. During that summer, he wrote his first novel, which was never published as well as his second novel. In 1990 he collaborated on a book with Billy Mills, which was published. In 1994 he wrote \\"The Notebook\\" and was published in 1996. Then he followed with \\"Message in a Bottle\\" (1998), \\"A Walk to Remember\\" (1999), \\"The Rescue\\" (2000), \\"A Bend in the Road\\" (2001), \\"Nights in Rodanthe\\" (2002), \\"The Guardian\\" (2003), \\"The Wedding\\" (2003) and \\"Three Weeks with my Brother\\" (2004). They were all domestic and international best sellers and were translated into more than 35 languages.Evaluation: \\"The Notebook\\" is about a young man named Noah Calhoun who lived in New Bern, North Carolina. He met a beautiful young girl named Allie at the fair. When he met her he fell in love with her. Soon they were together everyday and were inseparable. But by the end of the summer she had to go to School out of town. After she left Noah wrote her a letter everyday, telling her about how much he loved her. But the letters never got to her because her mother hid them from her. Allie son got engaged to Lon a man who she also loved but not like she loved Noah. One day as she was reading the newspaper she noticed that Noah's picture and the beautiful house he had remodel just for her. At that moment she decided to go see Noah. When she arrived he was happy to see her. They spent that day and the following together, reminiscing and talking about what had happened in each others lives over the years. Allie had asked Noah why he had never written and he told her he wrote her 365 letters. That's when she realized her mother had kept them from her. Allie's mother comes to Noah's house and informs her that Lon was in town. Allie had to make a decision between Noah and Lon. She of course picked Noah. She had lost him once and wasn't willing to lose him again.This has been one of my favorite love stories. I had never read a book by Nicholas sparks before. I have been impressed by his work it's very touching. He had also written the book \\"A Walk to Remember\\" which was one of my favorite movies. \\"The Notebook\\" has encouraged me to read more of his books. If you like to read love stories, I would definitely recommend his books. This story is very romantic and sad. It shows that when you love someone and have to be separated, if you love is strong enough it will bring you together and if not then it's not meant to be. No matter how many people you love your first love will forever stay with you. If you want to continue reading more about Noah you have got to read the sequel \\"The Wedding.\\" It is also a great story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book is definetly a one sit read.

It was a heart-warming story above neverending love, the existance of soulmates, and the power of fate. I cried throughout the book, and strongly recommend it to anyone who has ever been in love and is searching for a good read.I have since seen the movie, and while I enjoyed that too, I suggest reading the book first. The movie doesn't develop the intimacy and feelings between the characters as deeply as the book...the reader will get a stronger sense of the story by reading the actual novel."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I thought that the book was good, but I thought the movie was outstanding. The book goes into more detail about the feelings of the characters, but the movie goes into more detail about the summer Noah and Allie spent together.

Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Okay on this Sunday, i have to say that i woke up and quietly layed there...thinking of the movie last night. I started to cry, damnit and then i figured if i lie down any longer i would just keep it up..lol What is wrong with me? Then i decided to get my butt up and get to my office. I have some stuff to research for my husband, instead i turn on the damn computer and start the search @ Amazon for the book, \\"The Notebook.\\" I swear, i had to know if this was based on actual events/people...although the copyright page says \\"fiction\\" - which of course can be because the names are changed - the backflap of the book says it was indeed based on the writer's wife's grandparents...awww.As i read the sample pages-front cover to back cover and in between, my favorite part being page 2 of the excerpt...that same very part in the beginning of the movie, that sent me to immediate tears.If any of you havent yet seen, \\"The Notebook,\\" please get out and check it out... it is a great love story...a different kind of movie, one that i can say we needed for a long time!The wife in this movie is suffering from degenerative disease, i believe it to be Alzheimer's and the husband, wow, is so devoted to her and - to (periodically) bring her back to him, he reads from this notebook - that tells the story of their love...\\"their journal, their lovestory.\\" Once in awhile she does comes to, as he reads, only to fall back into her demented state of mind, so heartbreaking...oh i better stop, you have to see it, read it...one or the other!!!!The latter is preobably much better.And no you haven't had to love deeply before...seems like some of the hardest of hard, have been brought to tears by this heartwarming story, i have read some reviews by spouses of the reluctant...so very real, a must see & read for EVERYONE."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A great way to express the lives of two lovers.

There may be some changes, but it is just as good as the book!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is truly a wonderful book. Plenty of helpful and nurturing description to the book... and Nicholas Sparks describes a beautiful chemistry between two lovers who are parted, but who find each other after several long years of seperation.However, this book doesn't have many elements that prove this relationship to be genuine. You don't hear about the dates they were on, or adventures of the two, or anything that hapened before they were parted. Instead, they are briefly hinted, and then talked about in an area of the book where we can't really understand how it happened.I also felt that this book really dwelled on love, and would never depart from it. It was incredibly unctious, and about 3/4 through the book you wondered when the &quot;love&quot; was going to end and reality would peak through the door.But, in conclusion, it was enjoyable. It's definitely a good summer book, because it's not too thick and it'll keep you interested as long as you can handle."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Do you believe in true love? If you don't, after reading this book (and seeing this movie) you just might!This book follows the journey of two young lovers (Noah Calhoun and Allie Nelson) who fall magically in love over the summer and are reunited 14 years later after their lives have taken completely different turns. We hear their story through a man who is reading the story of Noah and Allie to a woman who is suffering from Alzheimers.While this book is cliche... it is so perfectly written (almost TOO perfectly written) that it tugs at all the right heartstrings at all the right times. It epitomizes true, everlasting love, and will bring out the romantic in you :)Read it and then see the movie to get the full affect, as the movie focuses more on Noah and Allie's teenage years and portrays them more realistically and passionate. Plus the chemistry by the two leads (Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams) is AMAZING...I don't think i've seen this much chemistry in a movie for a VERY LONG TIME. Definitely a must see for everyone from hopeless romantics to pessimistic ones!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A really touching love story that goes beyond illness, death and time."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"definitely my favorite nicholas sparks book (i have also read a walk to remember and the rescue). it is such an amazingly sweet love story. some do not care for spark's style but i think he is an excellent writer that really touches the hearts of readers. this book is incredible!!!!!! READ IT =)"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I thought this book was a pretty good book because I finished this book in about 2-3 1/2 days! I could not put this down. And when I couldn't find it when I wanted to read it, I was very [mad]. But don't take my word for it, read it yourself and see how much you enjoyed it"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"No more than any of our own stories are perfect examples of living, this novel doesn't HAVE to be a masterpiece of literature. I don't believe that was the author's main intent in writing this book. This is a tender and passionate story of a deep, true, unselfish, and enduring love. It is a moving reminder of what love can be like with the right person, that if one follows one's heart, rich treasures may be found. This book sat on my shelf for months waiting for its chance to be read. Had I any idea I'd finish it in two sittings, I'd have read it sooner. You can't please all of the people all of the time, but millions and millions of readers prove that although there is a place on the bookshelf for &quot;perfect&quot; literature(which is sometimes boring and often read because assigned to do so), &quot;The Notebook&quot; stirs the emotions and hits readers in places that some of the classics will never touch."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is one of the worst books I've read in this decade. This is not literature--this is women's magazine fiction from the 1950s (except they would have toned down the sex scenes). If I was a Southerner, I would be embarrassed by this one. Was Sparks subsidized by the Alzheimers Research Fund or some group? They should have spent their $$$$$ on a cure instead. If you want to read a great love story, buy Ethan Frome by the wonderful Edith Wharton."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I can't quite figure out what all the fuss is over this book. And I loved Bridges of Madison County! Nicholas Sparks gives hope to aspiring writers everywhere - if he can get published, anyone can. I've read some awful stuff, but The Notebook just about takes the cake. It is a cliche from beginning to end. The characters are one-dimensional, the plot is completely unbelievable, and the writing is lackluster. Save your money and don't buy this book!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I'm still agog after the reading experience of The Notebook. I believe it's still on the bestseller list and it made the number one spot on some magazine's (ok, so it was Glamour) reader-submitted list of the top-ten love stories of all time. Topping Jane Eyre and Pride and Prejudice no less. Even the number two spot-- Bridges over Madison County--was a mildly diverting read.This debut effort is the most simplistic, hackneyed, uninvolving novel I've ever read. Cognizant of all the hooplaa, I kept waiting for the story to get better. It never did and I was glad when I turned the last page.I see from the reviews that four stars is the average score. Here's a one-star to balance out such undeserved approbation. Of course, Sparks is laughing all the way to the bank over his literary coup."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I believe there is a truly wonderful love story here. Too bad it is buried in this terribly mediocre writing. I think this story could be half as long and twice as enticing."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"It is very obvious that those of you that rated this book a 1 or 3, have never experienced the joy of loving another person completely. HOW COULD YOU NOT CRY THROUGH THE WHOLE SECOND HALF OF THE BOOK??? And to those of you who are &quot;literature hawks,&quot; TRUE-- the author doesn't go very in depth into the characters lives, but that wasn't the point of the book!!! So what if we didn't find out what Allie likes to eat for breakfast or what Noah suffered through in the war----Sparks didn't intend for that to be important anyway. He was simply sending the message that love endures all, even the most tragic of circumstances. Period. We don't need full, well-rounded characters to understand their feelings between one another and the tragedy and bitter- sweetness of their outcome. I do have two gripes though: it did seem to be a little to modern for the time period of its setting, and I don't see how this short little story can keep its down-home charm in a drawn out movie. It's just too short for that. Some stories are better left in a book, and I think this is one of them."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was the BEST book I think I ever read. It made the reader realize we normally take our lives for granted, thinking we, or our loved ones are going to be around forever. Sometines we put off what we really want to do, or telling someone how much we really care about them, and too often it's usually too late. The Notebook makes the reader feel a new appreciation for the quality of life and friendships"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I bought this novel for an easy, no-brainer, enjoyable read-on-the-beach book. So far as being easy and a no-brainer, The Notebook followed through. When it came to enjoyable, however, it fell terribly short.I think the premise of the book is wonderful. An Alzheimer's patient being read the ultimate love story -their own- by her husband in hopes of rekindling old memories, if only for a moment. Very nice and the story is sweet.BUT... the characters. Good lord. They were, without doubt, some of the most two-dimensional protagonists I have ever seen. They were undeveloped, their dialog was rigid, and some of the scenes that could have potentially been fabulous (like the scene on the lake) were murdered by characters I could care less about. If I can't empathize with them, I won't care what happens to them, and this is what happened in The Notebook. I was extremely disappointed. This could have been something great, but instead made me feel like I had wasted my time.For once, I will have to say that the movie was better. I saw it several days after finishing the novel and was pleasantly surprised by how they added new scenes and the cast breathed life into otherwise stale characters. Not to mention that the movie completely changed the original ending... the original ending being an innuendo that was not only 110% unbelievable and unlikely, but also made me want to vomit. If you read the book, you'll understand why... but I suggest renting the movie, instead."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Books like this makes me sad to think of how many amazing writers out there are somehow obscured by crappy drivel like The Notebook. Why do books full of crap seem to get so much much recognition than books full of beautiful writing with developed plots and characters? This book's characters and plot are not in the least bit developed and go through no transformation whatsoever, except that Allie eventually marries Noah (there, I saved you from reading this awful thing). As an avid reader, I never think highly of books that have a movie equivalent where the movie is certainly better. The Notebook falls into the movie-is-better-than-book category.I wanted to read this because I had seen the movie previews and they made the story look pretty good. Knowing it was based on a book, I wanted (as usual) to read the book before seeing the movie. I am sad to say that once I finished the book and then watched the movie, all the changes in the movie from the book's plot were a vast IMPROVEMENT on the story, rather than having the usual outcome of destroying it. The funny carnival scene where Noah hangs off the ferris wheel in the movie? Only the carnival itself is barely referenced in the book. The famous kissing-in-the-rain scene in the movie? Never happens in the book. And those are just a couple of examples of good changes.In short, I hate this book because it has no substance whatsoever, and the writing is just plain juvenile and bad. Don't waste your time with this, unless you want to get a headache like I got while reading it. I threw it across the room when I finished it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is one of my all time favorite movies. The story was amazing and so I wanted to know more about the characters. Books always offer more... don't they? Ha! Hardly. Nick Sparks has the writing talent of a 4th grader. This book was awful. I didn't like the characters and the ending was nowhere as profound as that of the film. The idea was great, the execution was a train wreck. Thank God for great screenwriters who took the idea and turned it into something great. As I asked about Nora Roberts, how on earth did this man get published?"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book when I worked at a bookstore. It was so popular I thought I should check it out. Being an English major, maybe I expected too much - like, a plot, or convincing characters, or anything that wasn't so horribly sentimental it makes your head spin.One thing I took away from my college career in literature was this question: WHY should we care about the character(s)? If you care about the characters in a book, then the story becomes important. That wasn't the case here.The main characters in the book were generic cardboard-cutouts of actual people, the writing was incredicly sappy and overly-romantic, key scenes were left to the reader's imagination, while other scenes I wish had been!!! (i.e., the book ending in a NUSRING home with two old people getting it on, one of whom is so mentally degenerated she barely knows who she is??) Sorry if this sounds too Valley Girl, but EEEEWWWW! That is absolutely the antithesis of romance to me. All in all, the book was a total waste of time. The only quality about the book I'm happy about was that it was short!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"One of those rare books that is worse than the film. What drew me to the standard and over-done rich girl-poor guy, love triangle in the film was that there was a lot of unique chemistry between Noah and Allie, a deep passion. The best part was that they fought like a real couple, matched up perfectly because they fought. Noah was a unique character, sort of bitter and broken by war and heart break. The book, on the other hand, was all sap and the flat characters, their romance sickeningly sweet. The prose was whiny and boring. It was simple and unoriginal. Grade: D"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was plain terrible. Nicholas Sparks' writing seems very amateur and there was nothing that made me want to keep on reading. This book was filled with cliches and forced moments to make it even more sickening and syrupy. I think I quit reading after 75 pages because Sparks, in my mind, did not create very likable characters. I did not care what would happen to Noah and Allie. The movie, however, is decent, but probably because I didn't have to sit through Sparks' mediocre writing. I think his target market of lonely housewives will soak it up, though. The only tissue I needed for this was the crying I did for wasting my time and money."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book is a sappy piece of garbage that people couldn't pay me to read again let alone watch a movie about."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I would like those 3 hours back Mr. Sparks.This book lacked substance, was choppy, predictable, and uncreative. Writing was that of a middle school student. Extremely disappointing. I am super curious how the movie is. I didn't even read the insert at the end of the book for Nicolas Spark's next book, as I just wanted The Notebook to endddddd."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was so excited to read this book...it had so much potential...but it ended up pretty much sucking. No detail, too quick, and the same sentence and words used over and over and over again. I was hoping that something amazing was going to happen...but, it still sucked. If you are a young kid, you will like it, if you are smart and like something with a little more deepness and effort put into it, you will not like it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I don't like this book. The movie had far more detail. I can't believe I bought this piece of garbage! It didn't even include the scean were they met at the carnival! TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Both the new and the used books I ordered were in great condition...both were sent immediately...of course I am addicted to Amazon.com....I love that everything is so easy...I do all my Christmas, b.d. and wedding shopping here....that's my review and i'm stick'n to it!!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book is excellent. The delivery was timely and the item was in excellent condition."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I hate to give bad reviews, I really do, and when I do I try my best to justify it or still find some good in the book. But after suffering thru \\"The Notebook\\" I felt compelled to jump to my computer and spill my guts! This is a plain bad book. I picked it up because all the hype and the countless weeks it spent at the top of the bestsellers lists. It looks like a short read so if it is not good at least it will be brief, I thought My mistake! It feels like reading the Bible cover to cover in a foreign language you don't understand!Stay away!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was inspiring and touching. I found it hard to connect with (I've never been in love) but it was hard to put down, and I really enjoyed reading it. I would recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was a wonderful, romantic story. It proves that true love does last and that if it is meant to be it will be. I recommend this book to anyone who likes emotional stories. It keeps you interested until the end. It was quite a tearjerker."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is a great book to read while floating on an inner tube at the river. It doesn't take anything to keep on track. You can go splash around, pick up where you left off, doze off, read some more. Yes it is sentimental and I would recommend it to other readers that love to read and cry at the same time.I wonder if Mr. Sparks has had any contact with Alzheimer's patients? I have. It is not pretty. The french kissing was so inappropriate and unreal! I think there could have been some other way of describing to readers their deep affection and love.Thank goodness I got my copy from the library!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book expecting a deeper story. The story is touching on some accounts, but the direction the story takes is incredibly obvious. There is no element of surprise, or anything that makes the book worth reading to the end."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"What a bunch of sticky, gooey, syrupy drivel. Nicholas Sparks is a talented writer, but I'd like to see him employ his skills on a meatier story. This book is hugely successful, and I think that speaks for his WRITING as opposed to his choice of story. For truly gripping reading, turn to Uris, Vidal, earlier Follett, Kingsolver, etc. Sorry, Nick!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I paid money for this and what I got was a stupid re-hash of all the other romantic novels I have read in my teen years. Gooey, sappy, this thing was a virtual maple tree of goop. C'mon. Stop buying trash like this. WHERE CAN I SEND IT BACK FOR A REFUND. Excuse me, I think I'll vomit first. Oy."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Sappy? Yes. But, come on, isn't this the kind of love that all us diehard romantics are looking for? I think so. I realize that this isn't a shining example of classic literature, but you just have to accept it for what it is. A sweet, enduring love story. Call me a sap, but I openly cried when I finished it. I recommend this little gem to anyone who wants to renew their faith in love, regardless of how sticky sweet."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Beyond awful. I can't believe how many people liked this book. The writing was unbearably bad - downright embarrassing in fact. I was relieved to see that there are some people here who agree with me. I really wanted to like the book and the characters, but because it was so boring, transparent and predictable I was unable to even finish. I had to skim over the last 90 pages. I wouldn't have even done that except that a co-worker lent me the book (thank god I didn't spend my own money on it!). It's not that the idea &amp; premise are so bad; it's the insincerity with which it is written that betrays any real depth of emotion. I think it is a sad state of affairs that this a bestseller.And if I wanted to know how to cook a crab dinner, I would have read a cookbook. Boring, boring, boring, boring."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The story is so sentimental that readers should make a dental appointment on page one. The cookie-cutter characters march through calendar scenery with predictable results."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I love romance stories....I love tales of triumph...I love stories of lost loves found.... I love happy endings.....But, I didn't love this book, I found this book to be most of the time very boring and predictable...."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Normally, one would read a book before seeing a movie that stems from a novel. I on the other hand did the opposite. I saw the movie before reading the book. I fell in love with the movie immediately. The book, on the other hand, didn't have that effect on me.The movie goes more in depth with the love story, how they met, how he tried to win her heart, etc. The book has them meeting on one page. More or less, the book takes us back to Noah telling how he loved her, and how Ali's sickness is getting the best of her.I don't know about everyone else, but I'm the type of person who is drawn to sappy love stories. While reading, I want to say, \\"Aww...that's so sweet.\\" more than once. Every two seconds in the movie I thought that. To say the least, by the time the movie was over, tears were pouring down my face. Maybe it was because it was a movie, I could see the expressions of the characters' faces with accented words. Maybe it was because I could see myself in that situation. Maybe it was because the movie took the story in a different direction.I say this because I have yet to finish the book. I don't remember what page I stopped on. I simply closed the book because it was not \\"as good as the movie\\". Plain and simple."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book is sorely predictable, and I never have said this before, but I enjoyed the movie far more than the book. I felt much more emotionally attached to the characters in the movie than in the book. The problem I have with this book is that the characters are very bland and one-dimensional. There is no depth to the characters. A lot huge portion of the book is just the characters actions. \\"She drove here...\\" \\"He placed his hand here...\\" \\"She walked over there...\\" etc. I was also extremely dissapointed with what happened at the very end of the book, and we're talking about the last paragraph here. It was uncalled for and it would have been nice if it ended on a \\"cute\\" note.The reason I didn't give this book a total thumbs down is because I did choke up a bit and I truly loved Noah's detication to Ally."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"When I started reading the first couple of chapters, I thought it would be boring. Not long after I got into it I couldn't put the book down. It brought happiness and romance. I found myself smiling and at times crying. The book is like a fairytale. I recieved my book after ordering it from Amazon on Sept.30th and today is Oct. 3rd and I have finished it. I couldn't put it down. I had to find out what was going to happen next so page after page I read and read. I loved the book and I can't wait to see the movie and read more of Nicholas Sparks books."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Sparks is not only an astonishing writter, but also a phenomenal poet. The Notebook is by far one of my favorite books of all time. Sparks portrays the love of youth and age as a magnificant seed growing ever more through the years. The novels heart grows nourished by the amazing emotions and feelings put into this love epic. I myself am romantic, therefore I was swept away by the enticing words and alluring poertry in the novel. This stroy shows the truth about a love that only happens rarely. And also depicts the truth about the elderly and the innocent souls they hold, along with their hidden youth. It gives the elders their respect and enacts them as young lovers who still contain a passion most youngster cannot even imagine. This is a novel that makes you smile, makes you cry, makes you want, and makes you love"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks is one of those mezmorizing books. It's enchanting, and captivates you from beginning to end. I picked it up yesterday and just finished it today!. Noah and Allie's love story is something wonderful and magical. Sparks captured this beautifully and I was amazed and delighted that Noah's love for Allie affected her condition and made her remember him, even though the doctors said it was impossible. I knew once Allie left Lom to visit Noah that something was going to happen. One reviewer said that she wasn't sure how she would like the book based on Alllie's decision to leave her fiance. But when I was reading that passage, I felt that something beyond reason had compelled Allie to visit New Bern again. Their love story is enchanting and beautiful. I loved the letters they wrote to each other, and how reading their story to Allie helped her to remember. These characters are two amazing people and will live in my heart forever!. A true masterpiece! this book makes you believe in the amazing power of true love, and makes you cherish your loved ones and truly enjoy life."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I've never read about two people more in love than the characters in this book. You feel everything with them. Nicholas Sparks has done it again!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is by far the best book I have ever read! I read it in 1 day. I could not put it down, and then I read it again because I loved it so much. I was so excited to see the movie after reading the book. But after seeing the movie I would recomend that you read the book instead of the movie. Please read this book, you'll love it!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I am normally a slow reader, even with short books, but I just couldn't put this down and read it in 2 days.I fell in love with Noah and Allie!! Sparks brought you into each character to get to know them well enough to fall in love with them and didn't drag with unnessary details. You have to love the &quot;mushy&quot; stories, because this overflows with it. It has enough twist from your typical love story to keep you reading. Keep tissue nearby, you'll need it. Loved it!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Comme ci comme caI give it three because I will admit, I read it in about 3 hours flat. I laughed, I cried, I reminisced about first loves. However I could write more creative metaphors in seventh grade and a better book by eighth. Take it to the beach, maybe to a poolside, but be warned it is no great literature by any means. Will make a good screenplay though."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I decided to read this book because I saw the movie trailer and it looked like a lovely summer read. Do not be fooled! Go, see the movie and do not be lured into reading this book. The premise is clich&eacute; and everything that Allie and Noah say to each other has been said a million times over. The dialogue has no flow and no creativity. Sparks uses the phrase, \\"God (damn) he/she looked good\\" to describe how Allie and Noah felt when they see one another, so many times, that it becomes a laugh. He has no other way of describing what each character feels. After reading this, I needed to read \\"Gone with the Wind\\",-immediately-a real love story, that doesn't insult your intelligence. There is a reason why some books and some authors transcend the ages, we can read those books and be transported to a different world each time. This book has none of those qualities. Sparks and this piece of \\"literature\\" will be forgotten, and it will not matter."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was passing through the Atlanta airport and stopped by the book store to purchase a book because I had forgotten to pack one before I left home. For some reason this book, with the view looking off a front porch onto a country landscape caught my eye. It was a small book and looked like something I could knock out during the two hour flight to DC. I had never heard of it before. It just said read me. So I did. I am not one to pick up and read a love story, It's just not my thing to do. But let me tell you, Once I got into it I could not put it down until I finished it. I was in my hotel room when I finished it. It had me flooded in tears at the end. It is a good book. It draws you in and keeps you bound to the end. Enjoy it! When I got home I gave it to my wife to read. Later that evening I found her in the laundry room glued to it, near the end ...and also in tears. It is a good book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This story was so beautifully written and full of laughter and tears. It defines the true meaning of love and expresses it with such power and emotion. This book is for all the people in the world who believe in true love and fate. It will capture your heart and leave you in tears. It was such a delight for me to read. It's a story about two teenagers who once fell in love. They were separated at the end of the summer that they met and each began to lead a new life. Years later they met up again, and found the love that they once had. Nicholas Sparks writes with such charisma and enables you to believe that true love will always win in the end. I recommend this book to all dreamers and believers. This was a book that I know I will read again."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was amazaed to go through this work. It moved my heart.

What an awesome well written book! I loved it! I recommend this book to anyone! I will definately read this one again!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was so wonderful, passionate and beautiful it's hard to believe that a man wrote it. It is a wonderful story of love and the power of love.Set in the south, this story follows a couple from the time they met to the tale of how they finaly came together and the even deeper story of what kept them together in old age.It's incredibly moving, take out the kleenex, you are going to need it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"If you've honestly felt the completely unconditional, whole-hearted feeling of love for another person, the devotion of these two characters to each other ---- especially him to her ---- makes your heart melt.

This book is about love so enduring and deep and tragedy. This book reminded me of the love me and my boyfriend have and it also made me cry. It taught me no matter what troubles can come between me and my boyfriend, we can stick together like Allie and Noah did. It's also hard to quit thinking about your first love.If you want to read a book about love, tragedy, and how to stick together through hard times, The Notebook is the perfect book to read. The Notebook is a love story and it will capture your heart and then it becomes an experience to remember. Maybe you're going through the same trouble as Allie and Noah. The Notebook is a great love story to read if you are in love."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was my first Nicholas Sparks experience and remains my favorite. The story is very touching and is written from an angle that most &quot;love stories&quot; forget about. It is the best story about a lifetime of love I have ever read.

It's definately worth it!!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I am not a romantic at all. I don't know what made me want to read this book, but I'm so glad I did. When I recommend it to people, all I say is, &quot;I read this one book that made me bawl-&quot; and they instantly say &quot;was it The Notebook?&quot; I read this book in one day. I cried and cried at the end. I think if you can get passed all the sugar sweet stuff, you will see the real message of the story. Come on now, you know everyone tends to get cheesy at times when they are in love! But I think the letter Allie wrote Noah will stay with me forever, because it moved me so much. I have never in my life cried over a book, but I was so touched by their love. Maybe it was because I was about to get married when I read it. I don't think so though. I think it was an amazing love story that encompassed what love SHOULD be. Deep, enduring, and only grew in time. I can only hope that my husband will still love me as much, when I can't recognize his face, and he's left alone in our love affair. I think Nicholas Sparks' wife is a very lucky woman to have a husband like him."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Even big burly lineman like the Oakland Raider's Lincoln Kennedy have delved into Nicholas Sparks' books. This one in particular is a very touching story. It is well written and very descriptive of not only the landscape in which it is set but also of the feelings and thoughts that one has when they are either in love or have been in love. This is such a great story about love lost only to be found years later."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Sometimes, you'll know whether a book is a good one simply by reading through the introduction and this book is definitely a good, if not the best one, I've read so far.If you loved &quot;Bridges of Madison County,&quot; you surely wouldn't want to miss this one. Congratulations to Nicholas Sparks for being able to put into words the feelings and thoughts of the characters. I can almost see and feel what Noah &amp; Allie are going through."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A tender story of a love lost and found, The Notebook is based on a real life love story. Unlike the sexy novels found in this day of mass-produced romances, Mr. Sparks cares about his characters and will subsequently pull you into their lives. A must read on a rainy day beside a fire or in a bubble bath, uncork the wine and fall into The Notebook"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The greatest accolade I can give this author is that I after reading it, I immediately recommended it to five other people and recommended it on our email bulletin board. No other novel has moved me quite like this one. I've been an avid romance novel reader since my teens. There is no better love story than this real life one between Noah and Allie. The beauty of the love and compassion these two feel for each other and Noah's love and concern for Allie &quot;till death do us part&quot; will make you cry and make you try to express that kind of love to those you love. The poetry is in the emotion, in the writing, in the living, and in the poems in the &quot;Notebook.&quot; The cost of the book isn't its value; the story and the feelings it will evoke in you are worth more than the price of the book"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The love Noah has for Allie is overwhelming. This bookrestored my faith in mankind and what we are capable ofif we love unquestioning. I need to read this again andagain but I have to buy more tissues first. It may mea tearjerker but certainly not because it is sad butbecause it is so beautiful. It is great to have such rawpoetic emotion written by a male. Thank you, Mr. Sparks,you must be a very special person."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book helped to put my priorities back where they belong (but often wander).Many times through the book I found myself having to put it down for awhile just so that I could &quot;get a grip&quot;on my emotions. Sometimes we get so busy with work that we do not realize howshort our time here with our children/spouse really is. This book will remind you - and leave you with a lot of wet tissues"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is the best book I have ever read. Nicholas Sparksknows how to write about the true meaning of love. This bookmakes you realize what the meaning of love and marriage is allabout and really makes you think about the marriage vows thatsay &quot;for better or for worse.&quot; Love can last forever!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"My reading group has chosen this book for review.Human interest stories such as this allow the reader to relate his/her life events to those of the subjects. Mystery, love, confusion, and last but not least, love plays its part throughout the pages. Read it and weep"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Hideous drivel--trees died for this? I am shocked that so many people liked this book. I bought it in desperation at an airport and couldn't give it away afterwards. A child of ten could write a more compelling story. The dialogue is cliched and awful, the plot is a joke. Fans of this book, branch out! There are plenty of well-written love stories out there."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"How did anyone actually like this? It is badly written, has all the cliches of a second rate romance novel, no plot, no characterization worth even mentioning and I got a cavity from the endless amounts of syrupy sugar. It actually worries me that so many people liked it. I have to wonder why and what is missing in life that makes someone say \\"this is wonderful!\\" about a turd."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I know people love this book, but frankly, it's horrible. The writing style is plodding and slow and difficult to get through without falling asleep. From page one it is depressing and extremely predictable. There's nothing about this story that was interesting; no excitement, and the relationship between the two characters wasn't inspiring or appealing. The triangle conflict was typical and completely anticipated. There are better love stories out there and there are a lot better stories that grab you and hold you so you can't put the book down. This isn't that story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A book written to appeal to an audience of shmucks who have no knowledge of great literature. Perhaps a great reading primer for kindergarteners, minus the sex scene. It made me think, I bet this is the kind of stuff that makes up those grocery store novels with Fabio gracing the covers. Characters so one-dimensional, the movie rights will probably be for a cartoon."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I bought this book with high expectations - every review I'd read said how wonderful it is. Now, I'm embarassed to admit that I bought it! It's poorly written - elementary, really - and is a cookie-cutter love story. I felt no bond with the characters, and although I did cry while reading the last chapter it was because I related Allie's illness with that of my late grandfather, rather than because I really cared about them. My advice to those considering buying this book: save the cash and buy something really worthwhile, like Diving Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was so curious about this book which received such horribly bad reviews but made so much money that I decided to read it. Thank God for libraries! Mr. Sparks didn't receive a dime from me for this book, and rightly so. I have never read such a poorly written book in my life--and I am a voracious reader. The characters are ninnies who never had an interesting or crazy thought in their lives and I couldn't have cared less if she had married Satan himself and if he (I can't even remember the characters' names they were so unmemorable)threw himself in his duck pond in despair. I am amazed that an agent thought this book was even publishable, and incredulous that Warner gave him so much money for such much trash. The characters are flat, one-dimensional, there is minimal plot, NO character development, barely any moral dilemmas (you knew what's her face wouldn't marry the lawyer)and the writing is awful. I could barely make it past the first chapter. Mr. Sparks violates a firm principle of writing I was taught first in 8th grade and am still hearing, 20 years later: &quot;Show, don't tell.&quot; He told us what they were feeling, never showed it. I never felt any passion between them, was never moved by her illness. I didn't care at all. The love scenes are disgustingly sweet and unrealistic--my friends and I read the sex scene and the rowing in the lake scene outloud and laughed ourselves silly. What tripe! If the book had been more cleverly written, I would have taken it for a satire of romance novels. Despite all this, however, many people have bought it and made him a millionaire. What a sad commentary on the public's expectation of literature today. We no longer demand and expect the best, but will be satisfied and even pleased with mediocrity."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book as a part of a book club. A big part of the group was still teary-eyed over it, but to me it was a big disappointment! I'd define this book as &quot;fluff&quot;.Although the significance and the suffering that Alzheimer's brings cannot be debated, the development of the characters was weak. I typically do not find a book that is this quick &amp; fast reading to have any significance to me. Just because it causes you cry or stir your emotions does it make for a work of genius."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I returned this book after reading ten pages. It should be listed under &quot;true crime&quot;, b/c it's just that!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This isn't the worst book I've read, but I can't understand why it's been a bestseller so long. There's hardly any story here.I'm not unromantic, and the love between the main characters is sweet and enduring, but that's not enough to make this a good book.I was 14 pages from the end and had no trouble waiting a day to finish it. Actually, the only thing that got me through the whole book was to see what the big deal was. And I still don't know. Sorry, Nicholas."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I love a good, romantic story as much as anyone, but this story is a huge waste of time. Its only salvation is that it's short. After the first few pages, the rest of the book is entirely predictable and unoriginal. What would you call the written equivalent to a paint by number picture?"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Yikes! How can so many seemingly bright readers fall for this maudlin and implausible tale of sex on the deathbed? Friends with whom I have agreed on many other books told me would love it, warned me to keep tissues nearby.... tissues unnecessary except to stifle my alternating giggling and gagging. Probably the best thing I can say about this book is that it's marginally better than Bridges of Madison County: the worst thing? That it's sophomoric and maybe little bit gross. That final image actually made me say, &quot;Eeuww!&quot; Yucky.No, wait -- here's the worst thing I could say: It was obviously written with a movie in mind. Maybe the movie will actually be better in the same way Bridges made for a better film than novel."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I rushed to buy this book the first day it was out in paperback because I had heard such praise about it. Perhaps I was expecting too much, but even without the build-up I'm sure I would have been just as disappointed and even disgusted by the writing. I am a hopeless romantic and have someone in my life whom I consider my soulmate (for 9 years so far), so I certainly have no problem with a storyline about an enduring love. In fact, part of the reason I was interested in reading the book was because it was hailed as such a touching love story. The fault of this book, and the reason I now feel that I was robbed of the two hours of my life that it took me to read it, is that aside from its original intent of telling a love story, it has no redeeming characteristics WHATSOEVER. (I am completely baffled and disheartened by the number of people who loved this book!) The characters are flat, shallow, and unrealistic. The prose is simplistic and boring. The story line has been overdone so many times I was able to predict everything that happened (Allie is artistic and misunderstood by everyone but Noah; he's rugged yet sensitive; her fianc&eacute; is well-meaning and provides for her, but there's no passion; her upper-class family frowns on her and Noah's 'innocent and pure love;' etc. It's so trite and stereotypical that it's insulting!). The plot is so undeveloped that I felt as if I were reading an outline rather than the finished product. Major developments occur with no explanation or reasoning behind them. For example, although Allie's mother disapproved of her love for Noah from the beginning and went through the trouble to keep them apart, she suddenly shows up with the letters she intercepted (and kept? Why would she have kept them for over 10 years if she was so against the relationship and Noah?) and gushes about how she was wrong and how they should be together. Why the sudden change of heart? There's no explanation before or after, and the main characters simply accept this as if nothing special had happened. The characters go on to lead a perfect life where nothing ever seems to go wrong and everyone &quot;cherishes&quot; each other and every moment--until the tragedy of Alzheimer's occurs, but even then their love overcomes the disease (and reality!), an insinuation I would think is painful to anyone who has a loved one with Alzheimer's. The fact that the book is supposed to be based on truth makes it even harder to swallow, since I can't imagine a more plastic or contrived story. I FORCED myself (painfully) to finish the book in hopes that SOMETHING worthwhile could be found, only to be even more shocked by the absurdity and tastelessness of the ending. I identify with the other customer who said they were embarrassed to have it on their shelf. I'm looking forward to burning mine so there will be one less copy out there to distract people from worthwhile reading."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was awful. Trite, maudlin, lacking in plot and containing shallow characters and an undignified and improbable ending. I had to force myself to finish it. A cure for insomnia."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was a really nice book. Noahs' love for Allie was beautiful to read about. I couldn't put it down, and when I finally did I was moved to tears. This book is a quick read and will be with you for days after you've finished."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook, written by Nicholas Sparks, shows the reader what true love really is, but at the same time it shows about betrayal, shows you that a person can accomplish many dreams in life if they really put some effort. While you are reading you will experience sadness, happiness and a lot of doubt in making decisions. Throughout al the book you can notice that mainly Noah tells the story, but since you know how the other people are feeling the story is omniscient. The author did a good job in keeping my attention because he gave many new problems and I wanted to know what would happen next.Noah, as the main character, shows a lot of passion toward Allie, his true love. When Noah and Allie were young they were high school sweethearts. Suddenly, things between Noah and Allie ended. Fourteen years passed and they hadn't seen each other. One day Allie decided she wanted to see Noah before she got married. During the summer, Allie goes to Noah's house to spend time with him. Allie, a woman who likes to paint and see antique stores, has made the decision to live her life the best way she can and marry a man who can give her the type of life she wants. Allie is engaged to a very well known lawyer who could give her a great life. In the time she spends with Noah, Allie notices that since they first broke up she hadn't forgotten him. Allie still loved Noah and Noah loved her. Will Allie give up Noah, her true love, for a persona who will give her a good life?I liked this book because it is a real love story and because it tells decisions a person has to make to fight for his/her true love.Mainly I would recommend this book to girls because they are the ones who mostly like love stories. This book is a complete page-turner; you always want to see what will happen next."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is my absolutely favorite book. By far the best of all his novels. Hard to believe it was written by a man and not a woman. The story is touching. A true love story. Be sure to keep the tissues handy. I give this book to my friends as gifts because I want to share it with them. Everyone I have recommended this book to has thanked me for recommending it to them. I know you will just love it!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I marvel at the way people have given this work more than one star. The sentimentality oozes out of the writing and often, for want of anything better to contribute, the author continues to dwell on small mundane scenes...The book is a shallow and inept endeavor to capture a love story and lacks the talent of a true artisan of the craft of writing."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this silly little volume as I was being driven from New Hampshire to Montreal. I should have thrown it off the Champlain Bridge, but I didn't want to get arrested for polluting the St. Lawrence River. This book is unrealistic and sappy, and, although I am a romantic, this story just didn't ring true. What happened to the great literature of our time? And this pathetic book is on the bestseller lists?"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Not a huge fan of the romance novel, I was lured into reading this book by a friend. Not a fan of the genre either, she swore that The Notebook would fall on middle ground between romance and literature and that I would enjoy the cry of my life. I did not shed a single tear, as I wanted nothing more than to get to the inevitable sticky-sweet conclusion and run away. This was the most transparent, contrived story I have ever read. The manner in which he related the ending of the story to 'Hannah' almost made me throw the book down in disgust. First person-telling-third-person account; &quot;When I heard you tell me the way you sat down so-and-so and told him you couldn't leave me...then you said you got in your car and came back...&quot; blah. I felt as if I were reading a third-grade essay. I could probably forgive the lack of writing prowess had I found the concept remotely interesting or original. But &quot;girl falls in love with guy from wrong side of tracks but! ! love overcomes&quot; didn't exactly blow me over. Been there, won't do it again."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I'm always looking for escapism in a good romance. After this book, I'm still looking. There is Alzheimer's in my husband's family, and this book is an insult. It implies that true love conquers all, and if you love someone enough, they just might remember you! Of course! Why didn't WE think of that? Save yourself some time and money and skip this book!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A friend had recommended this book to me. She told me that it was better than Bridges Of Madison County. I was thinking &quot;yeah, right!&quot;. I read the cover to see what it was about and to tell you the truth, I thought it sounded like just another boring love story, even though it was a true story didn't intrigue me. I took it home anyway just to please my friend. It sat on my nightstand for about a week and every night I would look at and say &quot;tomorrow.&quot; One night, not having anything better to do, I started to read it. I didn't put it down until I had read it all! I have never read a book that has made me cry more than this book had! I finished it and laid in bed for hours just watching my husband sleep. All the hard feelings we were feeling toward each other were magically gone! Needless to say I think my view on love and how love should be, has changed dramatically since I took the time to read this wonderful book! So far I have managed to talk all my friends and family into reading it! My mother told me never to bring her another book like that again! She couldn't handle all the tears! Anyone, guy or girl, needing something more in their life, needs to read this book! I promise you'll love it"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Yeah, I didn't get the hype about this book. It was lent to me with the command of &quot;read it with a box of tissues.&quot; The only way I would cry would be because of boredom and sincere disappointment. For a book that is considered so &quot;moving&quot; I found that it lacked anything to actually move. It's one thing to write a short story and be done with it, but another thing to try to rush through and make a story short. To me the story was a good one, but the way it was written made this book an empty vase. See the movie; it's a better way to get the story and not waste your time."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was marketed to make money--at the expense of good literature--and Mr. Sparks succeeded. I saw an interview of Nicholas Sparks where he stated that he wrote this book precicely to become a millionare. Hey...you've got to give him credit...he's no dummy. Sparks knows that sappy love stories--regardless of how poorly written they are--sell. The comments by the reader from MO sum up this novel: it's trite, littered with cliches and horribly written."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Amazon needs a zero-star rating...or maybe even negative stars. This is one of the worst examples of writing I've ever endured. Pedestrian, simplistic, stilted, slow, meandering, boring. Reads like a junior high school student wrote it. The story is silly as well.And Mr. Sparks is laughing all the way to the bank. Fortunately a friend loaned me the book (she LOVED it)."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I don't say this often, but yes, it's true - the movie is better. I bought and read the book before I watched the movie because I assumed the book would be better than the movie. After I read the book, my friends and family had a really hard time convincing me to watch the movie - yes, it was that bad.The writing wasn't that great - not vivid, not creative, and very choppy. The conversation between the two main characters was very trite and lacked excitement - even through what should be an exciting and invigorating time. I can understand what the author was trying to do by moving from the present to the past and back to the present, but it just didn't work well in this book. I, as the reader, didn't learn much, if anything, about the characters other than how they felt about each other. I like to know about the whole character, the whole person, not just one facet of them.While it's not the worst book I've ever read, it ranks right up there. Maybe it is because the movie was so hyped and I expected the book to be some knock-out; but whatever the reason, this book was a huge let-down. This was also the first of Mr. Sparks' books that I've read, and I most-likely will not read another one.I suspect I'll get a lot of negative feedback from this review because I know there are a lot of fans of Mr. Sparks' work, and especially this book. I'm not attempting to be offensive, I just call 'em as I see 'em. Read at your own risk!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Excellent reading! Brought many tears to my eyes. Nicholas Sparks certainly knows how to write them. It is one of those books that you can't put down."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I watched the movie first and really fell in love with it. So I was excited about reading the book. Unfortunately, I wasn't as thrilled with the book as I thought I would be. :/I expected all of the characters that I loved from the movie (Noah, Allie, Fin, ect.) to really come alive in the book, but they never did. The sub-characters were really just names, the author didn't bother to give them stories or anything. And Allie and Noah reminded me alot of Barbie and Ken; pretty, but not much past the surface other than \\"I love you, I love you\\".I also thought the book would go into Allie and Noah's younger love, the part in the movie that I enjoyed the most, but instead they were only short, un-detailed memories. There were lots of \\"Remember when we sat under the tree?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"And then remember when we sat by the lake?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"I really liked that summer.\\" \\"Me too.\\" And it seemed like in parts where there should have been great dialouge, the author instead explained things the reader didn't need to know.I thought that the begaining and middle of the book were okay though, nothing great. But the end is what really killed it for me. It started getting so cheesy (\\"I am a midnight bandit...and I will break down the door and lift her in my arms and carry her to paradise.\\") Really? And the ending, ew. The movie's ending is 100x better.I honestly wouldn't recommend this book to any of my friends. But I would recommend the movie to anyone. So my advice is to skip the book and watch the film instead."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"In the Depression Era South wealthy 15 year old Allie met and had a summer romance with Noah, a 17 year old from a poor family. When the summer ended and Allie's family took her back home the two were broken hearted. Noah wrote her faithfully for years but never got an answer. After nineteen years and WWII Allie returns to the little Southern town just three weeks before her wedding. She has seen a newspaper article about Noah and wants to see him one last time.From there the story follows the rather predicatable path of most romance novels. What sets this apart from the rest is the sensitivity that Sparks tells this familiar story. Also it is written as much from Noah's, as Allie's point of view. Noah is in fact the main character and we get to see him at various points in his life, as a hopeful teenager, heartbroken young man, ardent suitor and failing old man.For those who have seen the movie, read the book anyway, it is slightly different from the screenplay but beware, this is the first time I have ever felt the movie was, albeit slightly, better than the book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was not a reader of Nicholas Sparks but I picked up this book for a quick read at the beach....Once I started the first chapter the pressure started building behind or on top of my chest and the tears welled in my eyes until I read and cried for two full hours. I couldn't put this book down it was so good. Sometimes a girl just needs a good cry and this is the book to give it to you. I cried for Noah's happiness, his loss, his pain, his regret, his kindness, and most of all for his simple love of one woman.This is a story of love lost and found. You absolutely can't help but fall in love with Noah and Allie. A wonderful book. I wish I could say I will buy and read all of Mr. Sparks books but I am not sure my husband can take me crying from cover to cover."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I love the way Nicholas Sparks tells his stories. He has an amazing way of pulling you into the lives of the people he is writing about so that you feel like everything is happening to you. I never cry at movies or books but this book was so touching that I had to stop reading it at work because I kept getting teary-eyed (The same thing happened when I read &quot;The Rescue&quot;, also by Sparks)."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book quite a long time ago and that is why it is so unusual that I remember it pretty clearly. I actually read it in one sitting and this was the first book that made me cry while reading it.This is an amazing love story about a love that is lost and then found again. As the characters age, Allison and Noah are both in a nursing home and Allison has lost her memory, but every day Noah walks down the hallway to her room to retell the story of their love.&quot;The Notebook&quot; was the first novel by Nicholas Sparks that I read although it wasn't the only one. I just finished reading &quot;The Rescue&quot; which I also enjoyed and I plan on picking up his other novels as well.The story made me smile, cry and if you are a romantic at heart that loves to read sappy love stories this book is definately for you. Also, if you read or saw the movie &quot;Message in A Bottle&quot; and enjoyed it, please read this one."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A co-worker put me onto this book. Responding to my inquiry during a happy hour conversation: &quot;so, have you read anything interesting lately?&quot; I don't think I ever read a &quot;romance novel&quot; before this one and if it had not been for my friend's follow up inquiries and the shortness of the book (plus she gave the book to me the following Monday), I would have missed out on a real treat.Now, I'm no expert on this kind of novel and I'm no great literary critic, but it was a great book. The part that got me most wasn't the classical love story of lovers from different sides of the track, falling in love, being seperated but finding each other in the end. This was well written and not too mushy. Except for his name - Noah, the male was a real &quot;he-man&quot;. The most touching part of the book was how devoted Noah remained throughout his wife's illness, moving in with her, reading their story each and every day even though she had no recollection of him or their lovely life together. Anyone who has had to care for a sick spouse or parent will really relate to this part of the book. Anyone that has experinced Alzimers in a friend or loved one will be amazed at the depth of Noah's love. Unfortunately, it's not something seen very often in real life.It's a fast read, but very emotional even if you are not use to having your emotions stroked by a book.Thank you for evaluating this review!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was incredible. It made me feel as if I was apart of the book. Making me feel as if I was actually there. The Notebook was well descriptive and very well writtened. Especially during the LOVE scenes. Every word was well thought out and I complement Nicolas Sparks for writing such a marvelous book! This book will touch the hearts of everyone who gets their paws on it. Once you start raeding it, you'll never want to put it down. This book will &quot;grab&quot; you. Count on it!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks has become famous for writing the sweet and tender love story that appeals to the romantic in all of us. He doesn't disappoint with &quot;The Notebook&quot; as he weaves the tale of two teenagers, Noah and Allie, who meet one fateful summer and fall in love. Since the course of true love is never smooth, it should come as no surprise that Allie's parents do not approve of her relationship with Noah. He does not have the education, money, or social prominence they wish for their daughter. Allie and her parents move away and Noah writes to her for years, but after never receiving an answer gives up. WWII comes, lives change, but one thing remains constant---neither Allie nor Noah can forget the other. As Noah's friend Gus tells him, first love changes your life forever and no matter what else happens in your life, the memory of it stays with you. And so it is that fourteen years later and three weeks before her wedding, Allie finds herself driving to New Bern to find Noah for reasons she herself does not fully understand. Their reunion proves once again that they are true soulmates, but it that enough? Can Allie forsake the &quot;perfect mate&quot; who has not only her love but also the approval of her parents? Can she walk out on Noah for a second time? Will Noah let her go? The story then skips to the nursing home where an 80-year old Noah resides and spends his time reading poetry to his fellow residents. But down the hall is a very special woman. The reader will be overcome with emotion as this relationship unfolds and the missing pieces of Noah and Allie's story are revealed in the notebook he carries with him. Intensely romantic and a tribute to the power of true love, &quot;The Notebook&quot; will leave you emotionally spent and thankful to be so."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I borrowed this book since &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; was unavailable at the library. Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. I brought it to work which was a major faux pas. The story touched my heart and spoke to me in a very strong way. The expressions of love, the devotion, and respect that the characters had for one another reminded me so very much of my relationship with my fiance. A few passages brought tears to my eyes, much to the consternation of my fellow workers and clients.I so loved the simple, yet deep love story that Nicholas Sparks brought to life that I went out and purchased a copy for my fiance. I will give it to him on our wedding day and hope that our love like that of Noah and Allie will stand the test of time.Incidentally I loaned a copy of this book to my younger sister and warned her to find a private place to read &quot;The Notebook&quot;. She didn't listen to my advice and read it on the subway - much to the consternation of the other commuters. She in turn loaned it to her sister-in-law with the same warning..."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"After reading a Walk to Remember by Nicholas Sparks, I had to dash off to the library and read The Notebook, which I read in one sitting. What can I say about the quintessential love story? Boy meets girl, girl meets boy, parents separate them and then they meet again years later, get married, and live happily ever after.Only with Nicholas Sparks as the author, this story is different. You are immediately captivated into the story, reliving it, feeling it and savoring each and every emotion. It is a sensory experience reading this story and you feel like you become Noah or Allie, the main characters, the soul mates. By the end of the book, tears are sure to be shed, deep sighs emitted and then one is left thinking is such a love possible and where does one find a love like this?This is a beautiful love story, with all the emotions to hook you from the get-go. The sensitivity of the author is clearly portrayed in Noah and Allie. Nicolas Sparks weaves his magic with this story, which is based on his wife's \\"beloved grandparents.\\"I absolutely loved this story and I am not a big romance reader. But I do love Nicholas Sparks' books and now have read all of them. If you are a hopeless or a hopeful romantic, then this book is a must read! As with all of Nicholas Sparks' books, keep a box of Kleenex handy - you are sure to use them!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Beautiful story of love that lives forever. Nicholas Sparks once again writes a little quick read story about love in a fairly common situation. Unlike &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; the author gives the characters and the story a lot more depth.Sparks has the ability to describe scenery and characters to my satisfaction. He doesn't get bogged down in useless characterizations or drawn out plots. He doesn't overwhelm the reader with excess research. He keeps his stories easy to read and not too complicated. As with his other books this is a couple hour read that allows the reader a little escapism without much thought.I really enjoyed meeting Noah the local country boy who kept his past summer love in his heart and Allie who returned the love. It was also enjoyable to read about the lessons Noah's father had given him to help him mature into a real man. What can you say about a man who likes John Wayne, reads poetry and appreciates the small things in life, has a fit body and truely loves girl? What can you say about a girl who is a painter, comes from an upper crest family and appreciates the love others have for her?When you have finished reading this story you will wipe your eyes of the welled up tears and realize you're smiling all along. It's a beautiful love story and a good read."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I started to read The Notebook book only because my neighbor forced it upon me, and I had to stop at page 50. I know that since I am not a romantic person, it was not a good idea to read it, but i wanted to please my neighbor, so i tried and, believe me I TRIED to finish it (or AT LEAST get to page 100)! Nicholas Sparks' writing style horrified me! I felt I was reading a C-students narrative in Junior High!I can now fully understand why a lot of his books are made into movies; many directors and writers are looking for a book that they won't have to rewrite to make a movie. I felt like I was reading a script, it was all dialogue and actions, and, oh yeah, more ACTIONS! He was barely able to describe anything at all! I will never again read a book by Nicholas Sparks, or even let alone THINK about doing it!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"My dissatisfaction with this book may stem from the fact that I'm listening to it on tape, and thus can't skim through the dull bits and eruptions of poor writing.In the first two tapes, the phrase, &quot;S/he ran his/her hand through his/her hair&quot; is repeated at least 5 times. Many other uninteresting, repetitive details choke the recitation of this wooden tale.There may be a good story hiding in here, but it is decked over with stereotypes (&quot;emerald-eyed&quot; Allie, &quot;muscular&quot; Noah), poor writing (all that messed-up hair!), and miscellaneous goop. The only remotely interesting character is Clem the 3-legged dog, but even she can't give this dull book some &quot;legs.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"My God! Where did all those 10's come from? Is the first non-Harlequin romance these people have ever read? It makes &quot;Bridges&quot; look like &quot;gritty realism&quot; which I didn't think possible. Let's see if I have these one-dimensional characters straight. He is a poetry-reading, guitar-playing guy with no flaws whatsoever and a &quot;flat stomach&quot;. When sexually excited, he feels &quot;his loins begin to stir&quot;. She on the other hand, is totally different. She is a beautiful world-class artist who also has no flaws whatsoever. However, whereas he has a &quot;flat stomach&quot;, she has a &quot;stomach flat&quot;. Can you believe this? This is typical of the writing: &quot;His shirt was unbuttoned at the top, and she could see his chest muscles flex with every stroke. His sleeves were rolled up, too, and she could see the muscles in his arms bulging.&quot; Please! For this, a 10? I agree with the reviewer below who said that those who were so swept away by this thing must have lots of problems with their own love lives"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"What intrigues me is the number of five-star reviewers who seem to think that folks like me who dislike this book are hopeless, heartless cynics who have obviously never been in love. I might gently suggest that a lot of these reviewers are confusing giddy teenage infatuation with the idea of being in love to real, mature love. Mature love is not about magically finding your one \\"soulmate\\" (to use the currently fashionable blather) among the six billion on this planet. (We're supposed to give up Santa and Cinderella at eight.) Rather, it is about caring, willful commitment to people we occasionally can't even stand. If, as a number of reviewers have suggested, this book represents deep insight into the \\"true heart of a woman\\", the feminists must be beyond despair, and there are going to be a lot of disappointed lives out there.What escapes a lot of enthusiasts for this book is that the author is essentially telling the poor drudges over at Iowa Writer's to forget their MFA's; if you want to be a successful (as opposed to great or even good) writer, get your MBA-marketing. Ironically (admittedly a distant concept to this author), that is exactly the advice philistine Lon would give Sensitive Poet Noah, while Allie sulks petulantly downstage right. Now, that's cynicism!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Some women I work with recommended this book and said it was sure to make me cry. I read it with amazement that anyone would find this thin, heavily cliched writing worth crying over. It almost makes me cry to think that this bland mush is so popular. I was hoping for a story with character development, one that would demonstrate how love develops and lasts. Instead the writer keeps telling the reader how much Noah and Allie love each other without making the characters interesting or compelling in any way. They fall in love at first sight for some mystical reason, and keep their love strong (apparently without any conficlts for 49 years except Allie's final illness). The writer really cheated here. Instad of writing dialog that showed the depth of character of his protagonists, he fell back on hackneyed expressions that were not even well written. If you are easily amused and have time on your hands that you want to kill, read this book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have to admit, when I neared the end of the book, I was looking for more information about what happened in between the initial romance and the ending days of their lives. But I realize now that the book needed to leave that less understood because it gave an easy to guess story a little more excitement and room for speculation. This has to be one of the most touching love stories that I have ever read. If you have ever encountered Alzheimer's within your family, this book may hit so close to home that it will scare you. Sparks is masterful at creating the perfect beginning to a love story. But his real genious is in the ending of the love story. You look at the whole situation in the storyline and can safely say that these two people had what most people can only find by reading a book like this: emotional, passionate, exciting, overwhelming love. I am so pleased that someone finally wrote a love story that actually feels like it could be real."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book with a box of Kleenex beside me. The characters are well drawn, and its easy to escape into their lives, into their story. The story itself is simple, and true in that simplicity. There are no extra bells and whistles, just a beautifully sweet book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"To start off with I'm not much of a reader, but I had to read a novel for school. My teacher highly recommend this great book, and so did my mom, so I decided that maybe I should just start it and see if I liked it. Amazingly, I could not put this book down. I'm only 15 years old, with a very busy social life and I sat down and read this book over a period of only one weekend. The Note Book is filled with so much passion and romance. It wasn't hard to read but it was very intricate and creative. I told some of my friends about this book and I got about 3 or 4 people interested in reading it as well. The whole plot of this story is so sweet and compassionate. People that read this book will see the way that love is meant to be. This book has inspired me to read more love stories, and just to read more."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I am very depressed that this book is on the bestsellers list...(who can one believe?) I would recommend this book to no-one...the writing is just plain BAD"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was the most predictable, crappy piece of drivel with ridiculous characters. How many times can this dopey author have the characters say I love you. No climax, awful writing, left me angry I spent my five dollars on this instead of a Starbucks Tall Late'."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The characters were perfect, the setting perfect, the storyline so predictable and unbelievable. I had to go to the dentist after this too sugary sweet read!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is a wonderfully written book that deals with all of the human emotions that one feels after falling in love. Throughout the book you begin to think you have the story line down, but at the very end something strange and surprising happens. And some might say that it is depressing but in the end shows the love between them. As a reader, this was the first book that I can say I was truly involved in.I began to feel the emotions that these lovers were feeling. So if you ever feel that your one true love is gone forever all I can say is never lose you faith. This is my favorite book that I have ever read. And I think I'll read it over again!!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I started this book yesterday and finished it this morning - it was not only a quick read but also impossible to put down! I was crying so hard by the end of the book, and I am not reduced to tears by many books or movies. This book was a joy to read; the reader feels the emotions that Noah and Allie are experiencing about their reunion, falling in love again, and the fact that they are meant to be together. Nicholas Sparks truly captures all the parts of true love and all the obstacles that it can overcome. Above all, Sparks makes us realize that true love is what we are all looking for the most in our time on this earth. He writes beautifully about the power of love and shows the reader that it is the one emotion that matters above all else in the end. The romantic side will be brought out in all who have the opportunity to read this wonderful novel. I recommend this book to everyone, especially the hopeless romantics out there, but be prepared to cry many tears of both joy and sadness at the power of love!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book came highly recommended from a friend. I, however,don't think I have ever been so disappointed with a book, particularlygiven all the hype surrounding it... The plot was sappy, but I could have dealt with that had the writing been of at least a decent quality. It was not. He overdoes the detail, uses trite language and has no &quot;flow&quot; to his words and sentences... I would not recommend this book to anyone..."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook, a novel by Nicholas Sparks, is a great fictional work about two people from different social backgrounds who find true love with each other. Sparks uses imagery and flashbacks to develop the characters, Noah Calhoun and Allie Nelson, and depict their struggles with love in this truly heartfelt love story. His ability to make the reader feel the same emotions as the Allie and Noah create a wonderful tearjerker that truly captures the heart of the reader.Even though his writing style is not complex, the simplicity of his statements parallels the simplicity of small southern town of New Bern, North Carolina. His style is straightforward and he shows a good use of the vernacular. The fine use of dialect helps the reader to put himself into the southern setting and time period. Sparks develops the character to an extent but allows the reader to create his on picture of the characters. He unfolds the story beautifully and does not confuse the reader. The flashback of Allie and Noah's story is perfectly placed and creates a smooth transition. The reader is pleasantly surprised to find that Noah and Allie are together in the end and that even now that they are older, they still have the same love for each other that they did so many years ago. The imagery is beautiful in this novel. It makes the reader feel as if the story is unfolding before their very eyes. The reader is able to see the lake with the swans and is able to see the passion between Noah and Allie. The reader sees and hears the colors and sounds of the South. It is almost as if the reader becomes Allie or Noah. This novel also uses a frame device. Noah reads his journal to Allie. The journal is the story of their life.He also uses symbolism as a major device in this novel. The house that Noah rebuilds represents the rebuilding of Noah and Allie's relationship. This house is a special place for them and he does not want to let that go. The article in the paper about the house is what draws Allie back to go see Noah. The house is the collection of their dreams. It is what they wish that they could have together. Writing is also very symbolic. Noah writes letters to Allie. He loves to read poetry. In the end, he reads his notebook to Allie to help her to remember. The book of poetry saves Noah's life in WWII. The writings and the notebook itself shows the power of words. These words are written for all to see and will forever be read. It strengthens the bond of their love and devotion.Nicholas Sparks' writing style can be compared to a modern-day Greek tragedy. He uses universal characters and situations with an edge of tragedy to create a dramatic novel that plays with all the emotions. His novels are not all necessarily romance novels.The Notebook was very captivating and shows that true love really does exist. It shows that the first love is special and changes lives forever. Nicholas Sparks was successful in employing the devices of imagery and flashbacks to create a classic that will be read for many years to come."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have read most of N. Sparks' books, and I have to say....THIS is my favorite!!A wonderful story of what love really is. This story takes the reader through the stages of love and marriage, health and illness, youth and maturity.I have recommended this book to so many friends and casual acquaintances. This story will touch anyone's heart. It will make you smile and it will make you cry and some of the scenes will make you laugh out loud.This book made me understand more about Alzheimers and the affect it has on it's victim and the family members dealing with this devastating disease.Do yourself a favor and pick this book up and read it. It will not disappoint you. This is not a depressing story, but rather a story filled with love and knowledge that sheds light on the things in life that really matter."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"... I choose to do my book review on the book The Notebook. I have various opinions on this book. I enjoyed the overall content of the book. It was emotionally touching and suspenseful at the same time. The description of true love in the story keeps you intrigued and wanting to come back for more.I disliked the writing style of the author to some extent because in various occasions the author strayed from the point of action or suspense to a give a detailed description of a thought or scenery. Overall I like the writing style of the author and plot of the story. In some excerpts I would have included more action and dialogue. I liked this book and would recommend it as a good choice of reading."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I love Nicholas Sparks dont get me wrong but this one wasnt as good as the others. It was kinda boring. It was okay"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This novel was a true love story about a couple who let us know that an individual can be any age and still be in love. This book is more touching than any of the other books of Sparks. If you want quick reading then choose this book. You won't regret it. It's so moving that you can understand the characters' feelings -- it's gonna make you cry."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I am 22 years old and never would have thought I'd relate to this book especially when the first page said the man was eighty yrs old. I thought that I would be bored but I wasn't. I was drawn into Allie's dilemma that I couldn't put it down till I knew her answer. GREAT BOOK! It relates to real life because it is possible to be in love with two people for there different qualities. It raises the question what would you do? Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book on vacation while on the beach...and it's the best book I have read in ages! Being in a romantic relationship myself, I was able to relate to all the feelings wrapped up in this book. For anyone who loves a great love story will really enjoy this. I couldn't put the book down for a second...I was getting goosebumps just reading it!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"True love of course. This book is absolutely amazing! There is something about an old couple still in love after so many years of being together, something so special, unique and so pure, that I can't wait to grow old with my soon to be husband! The way this man loves his wife in this story will leave you feeling a sense of comfort, that it can happen. I think every human-being should read this book, it touches on something we all crave, true, unconditional love.This book made me realize how precious true love is, to never settle for less and not to take it forgranted! I am more sure now than I have ever been!Thank you Nicholas Sparks for your inspirational and well written novel."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"True love can happen at any age ... true love can last a lifetime!!!What a great book!!!Only took me 2 days to finish!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read a review once that said this book was &quot;Not your average trashy beach novel.&quot; I found this sentance perfectly suitable for the book. It is sweet and Romantic beyond belief. Though it's kind of predictable (especially if you've ever read any other Sparks books) but It's none the less enjoyable and I think everyone can relate. Though there are a few parts that arent exactly G rated, this book is amazing and touching. All of my teachers have read it and say that they cried all the way through the end. Though I didnt, It's touching and I highly reccomend you buy it here along with &quot;A walk to Remember&quot; and &quot;Message in a Bottle.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks never fails to write wonderful love stories. He writes with such passion that I found myself laughing along one minute and crying the next. Really a great book, I was very shocked to learn it was based on his Grandparent's lives because it was very, very sad, but the book was excellent and I would definitely reccomend it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Im 12 and just recently read The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks. There is only 1 word to describe this book and that is amazing! Its a story about love, the most powerful thing in the world. A woman, Allie, spent a summer w/ Noah. They loved each other deeply. After the summer was over she moved away. 14 years later she gets engaged and goes back to tell him. She goes back and they spend a lot of time together and she starts to love him again. Does she pick Noah or her fiance?I leave that up to you to find out!I recomend this book for girls mostly.Hope you read it!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I ordered the book fom Amazon.com.

However, the sequel to this book, The Wedding, is a really good book that I would give 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Bought this book for my daughter for Christmas. She will love it. Wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The book The Notebook was very good. it had a very good message to it which was to listen to your heart. When you are stuck in a situation that needs solving, you listen to your heart and do what you think is best. When Allie went and visited Noah, and became close to him, she didn't know what to say to her husband, Lon, about it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Obviously NP has the gist to write love stories. This one is good albeit it has its ups and downs. As many of his books you can read this this one in a long flight or in a tranquil day at the beach."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I just finished reading this book an hour ago and I'm not as impressed with it as I had hoped to be.The author's writing style is very undetailed, simple and straight to the point. I found it difficult to jump inside the book and experience the scenario due to the lack of detail and continual scene jumping. It seems as if it was wrote by an amateur.Though I did like the book, I found Noah and Allie's personalities to be cookie cutter and far from unique. Perhaps due to the fact that the moment Allie arrives at Noah's home you can predict the outcome. The romance is very sentimental and sweet, but very cliche. I enjoyed the plot, despite the lack of thought put into it. I'm not going to spoil the story for those who haven't read it yet.Perhaps if the writer had focused more on developing the character's personalities and detail I would have enjoyed it more. It would be a very good book to read for those who are beginning romance novels."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Like many people, I read this novel after seeing the movie. I am very happy with the concept, but the movie trumps the book in almost every way. Parts of the book feel stilted and cheesy. The book also makes the intimate scenes more graphic which takes away from some of the romance. Nevertheless, Sparks fans and romance readers will probably love it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"In the summer of '32, Noah and Allie meet and quickly fall head-over-heels in love. But somehow, at the end of the summer, the two are separated and lose contact. After 14 years they meet again. Will their love overcome the barriers between the two. You betcha. And it's all rather touching, even overwrought at times. So far nothing new, and, indeed, from my perspective nothing worthwhile.The last portion of the book, however, fast-forwards to the modern day. Our protaganists have now aged and one is in the grips of Alzheimer's. The love story continues. This portion of the book too is sacharine. It is not nearly so hackneyed, though.Even though, in my opinion, this book is not worth reading, it is by far Sparks' best and the only of his novels that displays any inventiveness."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I've always heard great things about this love story, so I was a little disappointed when I finally read it. The story line, though pure and passionate, seemed too simplistic for me. The story became predictable and boring, especially at the end. I've read so many other great moving and passionate books that I thought this one did not compare. It was too short and undeveloped. I did find a quotation that was insightful near the end of the book when Noah was coping with Allie's illness: \\"Life is simply a collection of little lives, each lived one day at a time. Each day should be spent finding beauty in flowers and poetry and talking to animals...\\""},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Just reading recent reviews, why would anyone give away the entire story and ending of ANY book? Please be considerate of others!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was the BEST book i have ever read! I look at life in a totally new way after reading this book. The way Nicholas Sparks writes is amazing. His use of words and the emotions, makes you feel like this is happening not just to Noah and Allie, but to you too! I cried so much while reading this. I couldn't put it down and you won't be able to either! I'm only 13 and have just finished reading it. Reading this book has opened a new chapter in my life. It will open a new chapter in yours too!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I love this book, this is one of my favorite titles, I love every book that Nicholas Sparks has written and they just keep getting better."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"If you are looking for a great summer read this is it.

It is the best love story ever told."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was one of the most contrived plots I've ever read. My bookclub picked this book and A Bend in the Road. Both books were so predictable. I won't read another Nicholas Sparks again."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Sentiment is a good thing, and even when a story gets a little sappy, a good writer can make it into a thing of beauty. THE NOTEBOOK, unfortunately, was not blessed with a particularly good writer. The plot is very thin, the &quot;suspense&quot; is not suspenceful, and the writing itself...ouch. Sparks has quite a following, but his work isn't even good enough to be considered escape reading; it's too full of distracting bad grammar, etc, etc. If you must read it, get this one from the library."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Who knew a man could write such a romantic book and not have it dripping with sleaze. I was so impressed by how much heart and soul this book has. A great book to read while the weather is bad and the kids are in bed."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is the best book I have ever read and I have read it 4 tumes. I recommend it to all my friends. I hope to someday be able to attend a signing by Nicholas Sparks. He is my favorite author. I have read all of his books and look forward to any new ones anxiously. The Notebook was a true love story. A story of two people who stayed together and loved each other even when health reasons tried to pull them apart. This is the kind of love everyone dreams about."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was struggling to get through the last half of the book because I was crying. When you read a book that makes you cry you end up crying for so many reasons. It is more than just a story of a husband with a wife who has alzheimer's...it's a story of love that lasts a lifetime, love rekindled each day lived. It's a book you can put down but a story you'll never forget. With the amount of sentiment invoked, I'd say &quot;The Notebook&quot; is in the same genre with &quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; by Mitch Albom."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook, by Nicholas Sparks, is truly a heart-warming love story. It is about Noah, a thirty-one year old man just out of World War II. He can't stop thinking about a girl he fell in love with when he was a teenager. Allie, a twenty-nine year old woman is about to get married, but before she does she has to take a visit back to the past.Nicholas Sparks does a great job at using point of view. Throughout the book, he lets you see what both characters in the book are thinking. He goes from Noah's point of view to Allie's point of view all within one chapter. It is nice way of writing because you get both characters' perspective about things.Sparks also does a great job at setting the scene. He describes the places very well and you almost get the feeling that you are really there. He also describes the feelings Noah and Allie are having very well. It's nice because it makes it easier to relate to the characters because you can relate them to your own feelings easily.The one thing I don't think Sparks does well is his predictability in the book. I wish that he had thrown us a curve ball and had Allie go with her fianc&eacute;. Instead he does the predictable thing and she goes with Noah.I also don't think that the flashbacks work well with this story. I think they are confusing and could be worked better into the story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book is the most romantic love story I can remember reading. From the first page I was engrossed and stayed up late into the night to finish reading it.

A more rewarding, emotionally fulfilling, provocative novel I have yet to come upon. Everyone hopes for a love mirroring that of Allie's and Noah's - most will seek it, few will attain it. Sparks has challenged the odds and won. It is my opinion that no female author as yet has been successful in capturing the hearts of both male and female.

I can compare the love story to the one told in the current Titanic.

The story of Noah and Allie is timeless, and if I had one wish for humanity, it would be that every person experience the love that these two people felt for each other. I know that I will read this book over and over again, and will probably wind up giving it to my grandchildren!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Very touching story. I cried several times during and at the end. An excellant, well written book. I was expecting it to be longer, this book is not a short story but not lengthy novel.

I can't conceive of a more beautiful way to celebrate love and life."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I cried my heart out because it reminded me so much of my boyfriend and me. No matter how old you are, when your true love comes, you have to go for it... Allie realized that just in time, her one true love was Noah, who was also her first love... The last part was totally powerful, and sad, it leaves you thinking about it... First thing I did after reading it, was buy it (it was borrowed): I fell in love with this book, for me it's the kind of book which when you need it, you just open it, read a bit and feel better. This IS true love, it's a beautiful book, simply written, but that's what makes it so unforgettable, because it feels real, but most of all because it feels GOOD."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I've been reading the pages upon pages of customer reviews, and find it so hard to believe that most either rated this a &quot;1&quot; or a &quot;10&quot;. This story touched my heart in a way that I never expected. I read all the classics, and many of the bestsellers currently out (I work in a library so tend to read much of the new stuff we get, and found that nothing even compared. I guess I wasn't trying to compare it to anything like so many others were doing. I judge all books individually. There is no comparison!

I was unsure and a leery when I started it. But, by the end of the opening scene, I was completely sucked in. It opens with an old man reading a story to his wife who has Alzheimer's and doesn't recognize him. The scene is so well written and is both powerful and understated, I found myself getting emotional.The middle two-thirds of the book go back in time 45 years and tell a beautiful story of love found, lost and found again. It is not a fluffy tale of lust and desire or of cheap emotions. It is a fully adult story of two people who never gave up on their first true love even after being separated for fourteen years.The final third returns to the old man and old woman. Their story is painful and wonderful. It made me think of my own mortality, my partner, my parents ... It gave me a model to live into 40 years from now when its my turn to be in my twilight years."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The absolute best love story I have ever read. It's actually 3 love stories involving Noah and Allie, as teenagers, as young adults, and as seniors. As a senior myself and having been married since I was nineteen for 48 years to the most wonderful woman in the world, I was able to relate to the characters especially Noah. My father-in-law had alzheimers and my mother currently has alzheimers so I could easily relate to Allie. It inspired me to write my \\"notebook\\" about my wife and I's life experiences for our older years and future generations."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"When I first discover this book I loved it! the charaters wer great. They where madly in love, and you could tell with everything they did. Noah was a strong sensitive man, and Allie was a sweet confident girl. They fit together perfectly! It was so romantic, how they fall in love, but can' be together, but find each other in the end.It had a sad ending, but it was still great! It's a beautiful romance thats wonderful for all ages!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is a classic tale of old love being rekindled. I loved the story and the beautiful romance that goes with it. However, I have read several Nicholas Sparks stories and I didn't like the writing in this book as much as his other books. At some points it could be a heavy read weighted down with too many details and some points could be confusing.Although the writing wasn't as good, I love Nicholas Sparks and his marvelous books.*parental review*bad language - 2 - only a few d words and s wordssexual content - 6 - much kissing and infidelity. also a detailed sex scene, romanctic & not too graphic but detailed enough.violence - 0 - noneadult content - 5 - sex, cheating, and very strong emotions.however, I would let a teenager read this if they've seen the movie or have read other books by Nicholas Sparks like Message In a Bottle."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is the first time in my life where I have liked the movie over the original book. Sparks does a nice job of describing the scenery. But this book lacks depth and never really explains the time of when the characters actually fall in love. I couldn't even finish the novel because I was so disgusted by it. The book went into way too much detail of certain parts that left me grossed out, it seemed more like the writer's own fantasy than an actual story. The novel is filled with unbearable cliques and awkward conversations. I remember thinking to myself this is stupid, why am I reading this? To anyone considering reading this book, don't! Watch the movie because it is actually really good."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Oh, the passion involved! It is so difficult to let go of a past with someone that you love. It is also very tramatic to be in love with two people. Your heart is torn in two. There is such a fear of regret!Without crossing the line into \\"cheating\\", how can you possibly decide who is going to make you happier when both suitors are as handsome, as kind, as sweet, and as in love with you? How to choose?Sparks' writing style is very easy to read and find yourself absorbed in. He writes to underscore the heart in matters that are almost too hard to talk about- let alone write about for all the world to see and criticize.The movie was just as brilliant.If you loved this story, read \\"Wretched (this is my sorry)\\" by Katherine Marple. It has a similar idea of: Do you go with the passionate relationship that makes you feel insecure at times, or with the comforting one- your best friend?"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I loved this book because it reminds me so much of my parents' story of true love. Just like in the book, my parents were madly in love and my Mom suffered from Alzheimer's the last years of her life. My parents died one month apart after sixty-seven years of marriage. This book is so realistic in that it shows what power love can have over the long haul and in spite of all obstacles. The husband and wife in this story are so real to me and can help you believe in true love if you are a cynic. I think the type of love this couple has in The Notebook is something we all can strive for. Definitely worth reading, but read it where you don't mind a tear here and there.Power Path to Love"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is the first and only book that I would say just watch the movie. I don't like the book, in reality, I really didn't love the movie. Too sad, too depressing and sappy. I really struggled to keep reading the book. I think it jumps around too much and is really s.l.o.w. I just don't get why it was on the best seller list for so long. This is the third book written by Nicholas Sparks that I have read, and I think it will be the last."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Two people from completely two different views of life come together in one romantic love story that will have your heart beating for more. Personally, I couldn't put the book down once I started it. This is a slow moving book that gives great detail in one love story that can make just about anyone cry.Hearing so many good words about this book, I decided to read it and I'm glad that I did. Not being one for romantic love stories, I enjoyed this book as much as any other and possibly my new favorite.I didn't care too much for the movie that was made from the book because of its missing detail and also because of its false add-ins and take-outs. But yet, the movie, as the book, caught my attention for its heart-warming feeling you get after you read, or watch it. The book doesn't say how Noah and Allie came together but the movie did and it made me feel more connected to the story.As the story continues and the two unusual couple fall more deeply in love, it still pains me how they decided to end it one summer night. Their argument seems little but enough to tear apart their first \\"real\\" feelings of love. Noah fights for the love of his life back after a few years of writing letters to her but then he decides it is over and writes his final goodbye letter to only be hunted by his memory of her.Nicolas Sparks has a way of relating most of his books to just about anyone's life. His detail is one to remember and I know that this book will stay with me forever for its character's strong words and affection.Morgan"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook will have you rooting for the characters from the beginning and crying at the end.

The author held my interest with the details of that small southern town, the hot southern weather and the southern passions growing. In addition to the plot of the love story, the first and last chapters were so meaniful to anyone who knows someone with Alzhimers (and who doesn't).

Allie is engaged to her parents dream man but still has Noah in the back of her mind.

I will read this book many times over. Never has a book ever moved me as much as this one has."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"When I first picked up this novel, I had already known the story. I took the easy way out at first and saw the movie. Naturally, it was fabulous, and so my expectations were at a high level. Having fallen in love with the story, I wanted to have it on me at all times in the form of a novel. My wish was granted and I got the book. I read it in a day and a half and twords the end was a bit dissapointed. You see, in the movie, it ended just the way it should, but in the book, it took a different route. I was dissapointed in the sense that it ended differently, but glad that I was able to see both the fairytale ending and the real-life ending. The book was more focused on how the lover's lives were effected as appose to the movie which was all loving tenderness, you know, \\"mushy stuff.\\" The novel had a greater lesson to be learned, which pleased me. It was more about the realism of the sutuation than the fairytale side. Overall, a fun, deep read that will leave you with questions in your head, and tears in your eyes."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"If you are buying this book because you loved the movie...it is sooooo much better than the movie. The movie was made well but too many little details were changed. This book is a true romance, I have read it at least 5 times and it makes me cry everytime! Have kleenex ready! What a love story! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read \\"The Notebook\\" following my viewing of the movie (which I thought was great), so maybe I came in with higher expectations than I should have.The flashback portions of the story were rather dry. I found myself wishing that there would be more magnetism between the characters. Plus, the first times that the characters share together when they meet and fall in love, as teenagers; the love that draws them back, thirteen years' later, to the same small town where they met and fell in love, is not elaborated on at all. It made me feel like I was missing half of the story.There also was very little depth to either of the main characters. There are lots of actions (this one drove here, etc.) but the thoughts and feelings are mostly overlooked. We never really get to know either of them, so it makes the story less compelling. I would have liked more dialogue between characters, so that we could have a better sense of who these people were.The bones are here for a great story; I guess I prefer a little more emotion between the characters in a romance. If you are looking for a better Nicholas Sparks' novel, I recommend \\"A Walk to Remember\\". As far as this one goes, stick with the DVD."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The book entitled \\"The Notebook\\" by Nicholas Sparks is one of the most ntouching, moving, and romantic love stories that will break your heart.This book is about a man who tells a story from a notebook to his wife who has Alzheimer's.

She was still in love with him so was he.But despite that, she was engaged to wealthy successful wealthy named Lon. Now, she must choose between her first love or Lon who is rich.While reading this book, you laugh and cry. this book will teach you that love comes only once in a lovetime, and to hold on to them. But most of all, that no matter how howold you are, true love is ageless and timeless. You would want to read this book again and again.in the book, on page 207 it says, \\"please don't be angry the days i don't remember you, and we both know they will not come. Know that i love you, which i always will, and that no matter what happens, know I have led the greatest life possible. My life with you. And if you save this letter to read again, then believe what i am writing for you now. Noah, wherever you go and wherever this is, i love you. I love you now as i write this, and i am not able to tell you. i love you deeply, my husband. You are, and always have been, my dream.\\"This quote represents mostly what this book is about, that love is ageless timeless, even though she has Alzheimer's,she came back.On page 212, it says, \\"Another miricle, the greatest one of all! And there's heaven itself.\\" This quote also states the other half of the story, that when it comes to true love, miracles can happen."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I never really enjoyed romantic books, but this book stole my heart. Normally I hate to see a movie before I read the book. This time I gave in and went to see the movie with my best friend. The movie was incredible. I figured that if I enjoyed the movie so much I must love the book. I read the book, and it was awesome too. Unlike the book, the movie focused mainly on their summer affair. The book, on other hand, showed me the love they shared, the life they lived apart, and the life they lived together. Both book and movie created tears. I cried for a half hour after I saw the movie. It's just a beautiful book. But it's a matter of taste, if you want to see their summer together - go get the movie. If you want to see the love they shared - go get the book. This book showed me what I truly want in love. I do recommend this book to anyone, even if you don't really like romantic books."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I do not usualy like to watch a movie before I read the book, but this time I made an exception and went to see the movie with my best friend.

If so you should read the Notebook. It's probably the closest thing you could ever get to the perfect romance.This book is bout how Ally and Noah find how strong their love is for each other. They go through this long journey that started back when they were 17. They met at the fair and the way he got her to date him was amazing. Later on when her parents realized that she was dating him, they didn't approve of him. It was because she was rich and he wasn't. Later on he gets sent to war. Her mother hid the letters he sent to her, so Ally had no clue. While he was at war Ally ended up getting engaged to another man she met as a nurse. When Noah found this out he built the house she wanted to see if she would come back and of course she did. They got married and grew old together.I thought this book was an excellent book. Nicholas Sparks is an excellent writer. He has many other books on the market that you should probably check out. The wedding would be the sequel to the Notebook."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Sometimes following your heart is not the easiest thing to do. People tend to follow their mind rather than listening to their heart, like Allie Nelson. Through a major betrayal by her mother she had to find her true love once again.

It is fast paced and allows you to look at the effects one decision can make on your whole life.The wealthy family of Allie Nelson has moved from her summerhouse in Raleigh, North Carolina to Charleston, North Carolina. After spending the whole summer with her new love, Noah Calhoun, she is being forced by her parents to move back. Since Allie had to move back, Noah enlisted in the army and despite efforts to keep in touch, his letters go unread. He goes 15 years without a single word from Allie, and then she shows up one day, only to inform him that she is engaged. Although Allie is engaged, spending a couple of days together was all it took for them to fall in love once again. Allie's fianc&eacute;, Lonny shows up, and she leaves Noah only guessing if he will win her over in the end.It is through this surprising event that Allie is forced to choose between her first true love, Noah, or her current fianc&eacute;, Lonny. She finds that only her heart can make the decision of whose heart she is going to break so that she can move forward with her life.Sometimes some of the most important lessons are learned through the expense of heartache. Nicholas Sparks gives us a chance to reflect on how following your heart is the best thing to do, even if it isn't the easiest. As you are reading this book, you feel as though you are the one falling in love and making all the tough decisions. This book will really touch your heart. It touched mine, and I wont lie, this book made me cry, more than once. It is such a magnificent book that I would definitely read it again.This book is great for high school students who are beginning to have relationships and are falling in love. It is also a good book for adults to read by showing what companionship and love really means. If you like exciting love stories with happy endings, then you will definitely love this book. After reading this book, you may have a new favorite book, and it will be very, very hard book to beat."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I saw the movie version of The Notebook, which I loved, before I read the book, and I expected the book to be even better than the movie, since that's the way things usually are. But this is one of the few exceptions -- the trite, cliche-ridden book just doesn't even compare to the movie, which was very moving and romantic. I really congratulate whoever read the book and made that great movie out of it.If you haven't read the book yet, I would suggest just seeing the movie."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is the best book ever! I've never read a love story as inspiring as this. It teaches us that true love, or first love, never fades over time. In Noah and Allie's case, it got stronger, only they just did't realize it. This made me wonder if love like that out there somewhere, and I believe it is. Hopefully, one day I will find someone to make me feel like Noah made Allie feel. I recommend this book to anyone! Nicholas Sparks wrote this novel wonderfully. I finished the book in a day, and I can't wait to seet the movie. So, if you are in the mood for a truly romantic classic, you have to read this book!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is the most romantic story that I have ever read. The detail and description the Nicholas Sparks used was amazing. You can picture anything and everything he describes. Although the book isn't as organized as the movie, it still serves its purpose of being a romantic story. This book made me think, \\"When does this actually happen?\\" I would love to be swept off my feet like Allie was by Noah."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book went straight into the trash as soon as I was finished with it--it needed to be recycled into a milk container. So you ask if I hated it so much why did I finish it? Because there was about an eighth of an inch left of pages and I figured oh surely there is more to this story--maybe a surprise ending, a little character development, a plot...but nooooooo. The pages were a combination interview and a preview of his NEXT BOOK!!!! AS IF!!!!This is a harlequin novel with contrived characters so in love with eachother that Sparks didn't need to bother to give them personalities. Don't bother to give this book the time of day. Now I understand what \\"save a tree\\" means."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"When a friend reccomended this to me several weeks ago, I was skeptical at first. I usually don't read love stories like this. But Sparks surprised me. Its an enchanting love story; and, although improbable, it was one I couldn't put down. I was moved and touched by the love Noah and Allie had for one another, one that survived distance and fifty years of marriage. Its heartbreaking and sad, but hopeful as yet.The story is told through a notebook- two young lovers separated by distance come together again by chance. Then, the narrator switches back to first person, through the eyes of Noah as Allie battles Altheimer's in a nursing home. His memories are what drive the story.I highly reccomend this book for anyone who wants a good yarn to warm thier insides."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read The Notebook recently and was unable to put it down. I was enraptured in the story and felt the strong love among Allie and Noah. It's a beatiful story about true love conquering everything and their love was truly meant to be. I greatly enjoyed the book and highly recommend to read it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I picked up this book because I thought the movie trailer was simply too tempting for me to not read the book before heading to the movie next weekend. First of all, I would like to point out that the book is only around 200 pages in a pocket paperback size, and the words are not that dense. There truly is not much reading to it. I would say, on the other hand, that the plot is moving, bittersweet, and very palbaly touching. This is not even a comment, but just pointing out some factual details in the book - expect one-fifth of the entire book to be phrases like &quot;I have loved you forever&quot;, &quot;I will always love you&quot;, &quot;There is eternity&quot;...Yes, yes, ok, we all love to read these sweet words now don't we? But you truly see them 2-3 times every single page, and one must start wondering where does the story lie. The book could have been so much better than it is. As a matter of fact, the movie seems to do justice to the story better than the book. There are many deeply touching dialogues between the two main characters that could be depicted in a much more tangible sense. Instead, all we get from the book are these exhanges of &quot;I love you&quot;'s over and over again. I wanted a story and unforgettable characters. Honestly, I had to do much of the imgaination and fill in the blank regarding how the characters are sitting, speaking, walking in order to complete the story scenes in any realistic sense. We all love to read (hear) &quot;I will always love you&quot;, but come on...repeat that 75 times over 200 pages does not build a solid story. Watch the movie, skip the book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book in one day while I was on vacation on a tiny island in the Bahamas. Well, I certainly picked a good &quot;beach book.&quot; I had read Sparks' &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; in the days prior to reading &quot;The Notebook.&quot; I really liked both stories, but &quot;The Notebook&quot; is the one that actually had me in tears at the end. I don't think I've cried from reading since I was a teen--and I read a lot of good tearjerkers! I can not say that Sparks' writing is fabulous, but the story that unfolds in &quot;The Notebook&quot; is really beautiful. Simple and beautiful. I won't give anything away, but this story really hit home since my grandfather...well, if you read it, you get what I mean. Maybe that's why it hit such a nerve with me. I hate to admit that I'd feel differently had a woman written this story, but the fact that a man felt such passion and had the capability to articulate it--wow. Sparks' wife is a lucky woman!! :) I think at such a low price, this book is worth a read, if only to make you believe in true love and destiny again..."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"As I read the book it made me think of a love of my youth, the love I have present day and the intense love I hope someone will feel for me in the end. I cryed so much from middle to end I could hardly read the pages. I gave it to a girlfriend with a note that in the end said &quot;Yes, I know its only a book&quot; - Well written and it really makes your think!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I loved it. First and true love. Couldn't put it down,when I did I couldn't wait to read more."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book is really good, although it isn't as good as MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE. I read this book after I got done with MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE.This book is really short, and I was able to finish this in one day (And I went to school most of that day).Nicholas Sparks writes books that have characters that actually care about each other."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book is perfect if you love a good, clean, love story. It has a few love scenes but is so tasteful and wonderful that it will warm your heart and make you love your significant other even more."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"i just find myself in love with Noah right after i finished the book. This book of Nicholas is really very touching. It tells us how real love is like and how love can even bring miracle to the world. I cried very hard when I read this book, especially when i read the last letter that Allie wrote to Noah!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks captivates the hearts of all who read this beautiful love story. I can only hope to experience love that stunning in my lifetime, and I could only dream of savoring each day in nature the way Noah Calhoun does. This is the most spectacular novel I have ever read. Nicholas Sparks is to be congratulated on this novel which epitomizes the true essensce of love."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I love how Allie handles her future once she knows what it is. Noah's support, love and strength in knowing that all will change forever is an inspiration. I hope to remember this book should I ever be faced with the same diagnosis!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This story was so sweet. We've worn out the book passing it around in our office. We all loved it!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I picked up this book at my parents thinking it would not be very good. I was wrong. This was one of the best books I have read all year. I cried over the last 50 pages. No other book has made me do that. It was such a wonderful book that I want everyone I know to read it. It may be sad but the love story was inspiring. It would be nice if people could find a fraction of the love that Noah and Allie shared. Don't think twice about buying this book. You will want to read this one over and over."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"One of the best books I ever read. I was reading it on a flight, and the flight attendent said, &quot;Great book, but don't read the last chapter on the plane.&quot; She was right. I had to stop, because the tears wouldn't. Later that night in my hotel room, I bawled my eyes out. Great love story, REAL TEAR JERKER!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This story was written by a man?!?! The story truly touched my heart! The North Carolina area was beautifully described - I could actually picture them floating among the birds on the river and see the house in its surroundings. A true storyteller, Mr.(?) Sparks has given us a glimpse into his Grandparents' lives in such a way that they become friends, characters that the reader can really care about, cheer on and grieve with through their triumphs and tragedies. This story left me feeling like I wanted to know more, and yet to leave it the way Mr. Sparks did let the reader believe in miracles. He tastefully dealt with a terrible disease that is becoming epidemic throughout the world, and is tearing apart so many families. Although this story allows the reader insight into the struggles families have when dealing with Alzheimer's, it gives a glimmer of hope, as well. I look forward to reading his next novel!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"When I first starting reading this novel, I thought it would be just another love story, but it wasn't; it was a powerful piece that juxtaposes youth and old age in a unique and magical way. I highly recommend this book. It's style is simple, but its content depicts (as Noah says what his father taught him and what he teaches us,) &quot;What matters.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I sat down this weekend thinking that I would take my time to read &quot;the Notebook&quot; but instead I devoured every page. This book touched my heart in a way that no book ever has. I felt every word, and imagined every scene. It was truely beautiful."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Best book I've ever read. I cried, no, I sobbed for the last 75 pages. Wow! I'd love to read more by this author."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"My sister begged me to read this book. I'm not one for love stories, but never have I been so moved by any piece of literature. I'm a tough one to impress. If anyone can get through this book without shedding a tear through the last chapter, you must have no heart."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"but my wife does. Usually I won't even read them. But this one looked short. And it was great! I didn't cry, but I did get choked up. She caught me, too."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook; not fully understandable in the first few pages, yet everything falls together so perfectly. Every piece of this impossible puzzle falls into place flawlessly. A true piece of work. I heard about this on CNN, then bought the book. I am so glad I did. I encourage all of you to get this book and read it. I tried VERY hard to hold back my tears and barely made it. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I have."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book is hard to put down! Warms your heart and makes you smile."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Capable to make a grown man cry, The Notebook is real. Not being one to familiar with the disease of Alzheimers, this book brought the reality home. Noah and Allie are beautifully home spun, and real. Definately a wonderful story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Beautiful love story.....makes me wish love and men like this existed all over. Today's generations could really learn something from this."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Although this is not the type of book I typically read, I thoroughly enjoyed The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks. This is a powerful love story about just how strong love can be and how when we find it, it becomes the most important thing. It is also about how we must not live our lives according to what others want for us.The main story told in the book is actually set in the past, being read by the main character himself. It occasionally flashes to the current day telling of the story, and in this way there is two stories being told. Because of this, the setting is a crucial aspect of the book. The current setting takes place in the present day at Creekside Extended Care Facility. The primary story takes place in New Bern, North Carolina 1946. The change between two different settings gives a very authentic and nostalgic feel to the story. The climax of the story is also unique in that it occurs in the current day setting, where most of the story does not. Allie has Alzheimer's, and can rarely be brought out of it. Although on this particular occasion, Noah, her husband whom she cannot remember, reads her the story of their life and love together she is brought back to him for a few brief, magical moments, remembering their life. The doctors say that the memories Allie experiences she should not be able to. It is a mystery to the doctors how this is possible. This special moment, along with when it occurs and how shocked the doctors are, emphasizes in a major way the strength of their love. It shows they have lasted together their entire lives and even broken laws of science and Allie's disease, truly emphasizing the powerful bond between them.I completely agree with Frank Wheeler on Amazon, that Sparks is very talented at writing a not too heavy, easy to read enjoyable book. He keeps his writing and story simple, and for the reason this book reads fast and doesn't loose your attention. It isn't a book you'd have reread to understand or analyze, but more for a little escapism.Spark's writing style was very sweet and simple. \\"He strummed once, adjusted the tension on two string, then strummed again. This time it sounded about right, and he began to plan. Soft music, quiet music. He hummed for a little while at first, them began to sing as night came down around him. He played and sang until the sun was gone and the sky was black.\\" (Sparks 8). This quote from the beginning of the story describing a typical night of Noah's is very reflective of Sparks writing. Much of the content of what he writes seems to be almost cheesy or stereo-typical. This could come off as annoying, although Sparks does it in a way where it's still enjoyable; he's telling us the types of things we want to hear. He also keeps the vocabulary and sentences basic to make for an easy read.Yes, I would recommend this to a friend if they wanted an easy read, or something emotional. I personally ended up enjoying this book even more than the movie."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"LOVED ITTT!!!! Its so freaking awesome. I wish I could have a love like that... best book ever. I'm going to read it again!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was so sad it made me cry so hard I could barely read. I loved it though. I would recommend to all my friends."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks keeps me so interested in what is going to happen next that I cannot put his books down. I even love the way he goes from present to past without losing my interest because he has such smooth transitionings. I only can wish that I had had a love such as this in my life."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was about true love and to never give up. Considering the obstacles one has to overcome and never give up."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I loved it. From the first page to the last. I usually don't read love story's but for some reason this one had something special to it that I didn't even get from watching the movie. It's a well written, beautiful novel that I really enjoyed. I recommend it to anyone who needs to read something that will leave them hooked from cover to cover."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"However, the sequal, &#34;The Wedding&#34; is soooo bad I couldn't even finish it. It was disappointing because I really enjoyed &#34;The Lucky One.&#34;"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is one of the best romance books I've read in a long time. The Notebook is very well written!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas sparks always takes my breath away. I have read this book many times and I have cried every time. I wish I could know what happens next."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The outline of the story is simple. A poor, young man falls in love with an upper-class lady. I could imagine easily that they would face various obstacles and that finally true love would win. However, the ending was surprising and saddening. Even love which overcame obstacles is uncertain."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"arrived quickly, thank you! Was thrilled to get the book as I loved the movie and had not been able to locate the book in stores."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I had started reading this while on travel and finished it while on the plane ride home and could not put it down. I found the story to be very moving, and I was sobbing by the time I finished it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I bought this book for only a few dollars, and it is not so bad. It was advertised as \\"Used-Like New\\" but, it's not like new at all.. It was more like, \\"Used-acceptable\\". None of the pages are torn, but, it seems a little bit water damaged. I'm glad the spine of the book is not destroyed though. All in all, a good buy. Better than paying full price.The book is VERY different from the movie, so don't get it expecting it to be like it though."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The book and the movie are totally different and the fact that I watched the movie first kind of threw me off. I was still caught up in the love that they share, but there was something about Allie in the book, that I disliked. The book started off in a different place than the movie and that I found it hard to follow, but I do like it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Wanted to rate these product so I can get it over with and do something else with my life because, these products. I cried. Hope it gives me joy like it did before! :)"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I love this book :) I have read it before but it is still so good! I recommend people read it if they want a gorgeous story, even if it is a little bit sad.It's also a great price and was even delivered earlier than it was expected to.It looks fantastic in the hard cover and I'm so glad I bought it :)"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Love, love, love this book! It is such a beautiful love story, and no one can tell a love story like Nicholas Sparks. I read this in one day, and cried like a little baby. The movie was honestly a let down (except for Ryan Gosling), but I would recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I don't get how is this book any different from millions paperbacks published by Harlequin? Similar premise, similar writing, yet, Nicholas Sparks is famous while an army of romance novelists JUST LIKE HIM perish in obscurity? The Notebook is awful. I couldn't get past first 15 pages or so and I tried several times, because I wanted to understand the MAGIC that has captivated hearts of so many readers, but it was just so poor on every level! Yeah, no words. Just a very poor book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Another hit for Mr. Sparks, actually it was his first since it was his debut novel. I must confess I was bit unsure about reading the book because I saw the movie first and I felt in love with it and I didn't want to be a I like the movie better than the book but it was not case.As usual, you know when you read a Sparks book be prepare with your Kleenex box and of course prepare yourself for Mr. Sparks take you to a ride where he tells you the story of Noah and Allie, despite all the differences and everything that kept them apart their love was stronger, so strong that it kept them together even after an a devastating illness.You know why I like about Nicholas Sparks books even though they love story even a bit sappy at times he never goes too far and he convinces you that love like this can exist and does exist.Is emotional, sometimes funny and very heart wrenching but in the end is about love and how it conquers it all.I still haven't read a book of this man that I haven't like and I know eventually it would happen but at least I got the bliss I've read one like this. So don't wait anymore and order this book I guarantee you would love it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I took this book with me to Mexico last year, and read the whole thing in the span of 3 days! To believe that there is a love out there like that, blows me away! I was crying for days...."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A great book!! I couldn't put it down! Not a boring or bland moment. I think that this book shows how love and relationships have changed over time. I am Anxiously awaiting for Mr. Sparks next book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This novel was awesome! It demonstrates how true love and devotion should be. I've never read of a couple more romantic and passionate. It creates a fantasy of how I would like my love life to follow in the same steps. My bestfriends have passed this book on to each other until it circulated between all eight of us. It's absolutely heart captivating! Mr. Sparks is a sensational writer."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book on the plane on my way to Phoenix and finished on the plane returning home. Sparks made me smile and cry. His book is perfect reading for a time when marriage and love seems unimportant in people's lives. I loved this book and love Nicholas Sparks for writing a book like this and &quot;Message In A Bottle&quot;. He's a unique writer and I'm really looking forward to &quot;A Walk To Remember&quot;. I'm definitely one of his groupies!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The critics may not consider it a literary masterpiece, but even Shakespeare wouldn't live to see his greatest glory. To me, The Notebook is a reminder of how pure and sweet love is. Sparks may not use the most profound words to describe it, but he doesn't have to. Love speaks for itself. I suggest this book to anyone who can look at his or her love and say that he/she loves them more than the day they met them. Or for those who do not know the feeling, here is a great place to find it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book in two nights! My dad (75 years old) read this book outloud to my mom while she was in the hospital. They both loved it and my father actually teared up in a few places! I've never even heard my father say he's read a romanctic book let alone being emotionally caught up in it! My mother loved it too! She had heard it had a horrible ending but agrees with me that it was a wonderful ending! Its truly a touching story for any age!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Once i picked up this book, it never left my hand untill i finished it.

A masterpiece!!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I truly believe you people that give this book less than 4 stars have no romance left in you. The great ratings people are giving this book are from the theme Sparks is using in this novel.. true romance. His story reaches out and touches the readers heart.. it is telling about a strong, dedicated love which we many of us wish we felt and he does an excellent job at communicating that to the reader. I strongly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The writing is so wonderful and loving. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. I was so touched and moved by the story that I have decided to buy copies for the rest of my female family members as a gift."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The book was short, but had everything it needed. I would recommend it to anyone who needs a good love story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Sparks is a great writer and has made another great book. I found the book, easy to get in to and didn't have a hard time picking up on the characters at all. He also makes the pace a bit slower, just as a mature love would be and how older characters interact.He also, gives us two points of view in one chapter, one paragraph, something unique but can often confuse. I didn't enjoy the concept but he did it quite well. When you are seeing and feeling what one character is feeling , you suddenly in the other characters head.My only other faults with the books were the sequence with Allie's fianc&eacute;e. He seemed to just read minds for a moment or two there and just knew his lady was going cheating on him. This is a distraction. You think he will show up, cause a scene, yet in the end, he is a tool, for her choice.Reading the book, and really getting into the ending, one can't help but think about the terms To Death Do Us Part."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I loved this book. I am now addicted to all of his books. I read them in less than a day because they capture me so much. So heart warming. I have cried at the end of all his books. The best. I can't wait until he writes more."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"My sister suggested that I read this book a while back. I said that I would read it but it took me long time to get around to picking one up at the bookstore. Now I want to kick myself for not picking it up earlier! It was soooo good! I can relate to having that one person in life who was your soulmate who &quot;got away&quot; only to be reunited again later in life. To have someone love you throughout your entire life, despite time and distance, is something that hardly ever happens in real life. This book lets you hold on to the hope that maybe there really is everlasting love!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I really felt that The Notebook was a breathtaking book. The Notebook was a love story about a man telling a story about a girl he loved. The novel always kept me in suspense and I always wanted to read more. The Notebook had great drama and a very good meaning. I exceedingly enjoyed the novel and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read love stories. Nicholas Sparks, the author, kept the book interesting but it was still easy to follow. The author did a wonderful job on his use of flashbacks in the novel. Sparks did a marvelous job on describing the love between the two characters. I truly enjoyed the book and you will, too!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is the love story of Noah and Allie. The two meet when they are teenagers and fall in love.

A love story dosen't require a fantastic, unexpected, unique ending. A love story just requires the reader to feel satisfies and touched when reading the last line of the story. Thats all I expected - and this surpassed all expectations.A story of true love, and a shocking disease, that really makes you think - how can noah be the man he is? Love that goes beyond and defeats all enemies, and one that really was a story that I'll never forget. I have given this book away to many different people, and they have liked it just as me.A beautiful love story, which is a nice - easy-going read. Enjoy the beautiful words of Nicholas Sparks.

I must say it is sad when your about done. This will make you cry. I'm 17 and I don't cry on tearjerkers but I will admit I was close to crying. I heard on his site this was going to be made into a movie. It would make a good movie. Well read this great romantic love story.

You'll cry and laugh."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"If you remember \\"The Love Story\\" with fondness this is the book for you. Nicholas Sparks proves that there are still some publishers that will take a chance on newcomers. \\"The Notebook\\" is a love story that exemplifies what that word means.

They spent one summer together, but this summer would change their lives forever. Will their love survive trying ends?Noah Calhoun, a well-rounded character, comes back to his hometown, New Bern, after being away fourteen years. In order to get over the loss of his first love, Noah moves away; he comes back in order to start over and to finally put the past, and her, behind him.After fourteen years, Allie, also a well-rounded character in the novel, returns to New Bern to see Noah on hearing of his homecoming. She feels obligated to tell Noah the news of her engagement. She knows deep in her heart he is the only one for her, but feels time has distanced them.While seeing each other again, sparks begin to fly, and they each fall in love once again. Allie is torn between Lon, her fianc&eacute;, and Noah, her first and only love. Even though she wants to stay with Noah, she feels she would be unfair to Lon and would never be able to forgive herself.Allie leaves Noah to return to Lon. Noah knows deep in his heart her choice will result in him never seeing her again. Noah's heart breaks once again, just like it did fourteen years ago, when she left the first time. Allie is torn between her head and her heart, but chooses Lon over Noah anyway.The notebook ends here, but the novel does not. Allie returns to Lon but only for a short time. She tells Lon of her true feelings for Noah. He is heartbroken and upset, but he shows his true love for her by letting her go. Allie picks her heart, chooses Noah, and returns for the last time to New Bern.Noah and Allie marry and live a complete life of forty-nine years together, but after forty-five years of marriage their lives take a terrible turn. Both Allie and Noah are diagnosed with malignant diseases. Their love for one another is ultimately tested, but their true love survives in the end.The Notebook is a formula fiction novel. Noah meets Allie. Noah loses Allie. Noah gets Allie back. The boy-girl analogy is summarized and developed through the novel's plot. Although the plot is strengthened with other analogies, the formula fiction is the most obvious.The true and pure power of love to overpower and overcome all obstacles is the reoccurring theme in The Notebook. Noah and Allie's love is evaluated many times in this novel. Their true love, as all true love does, survives in the end. The theme develops throughout the novel; though it is never stated, of course, you understand it as the plot thickens.Through love and tragedy, Sparks created a wonderful work of literature in some minds. Whether you view The Notebook as a love story or heartbreaking story, you should be intrigued none-the-less. I, personally, view this book as a wonderful escape novel and enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I'm no literary critic, so bad writing has to be plain obvious to get my attention. The characters were flat, the narrative sketchy and trite. The story was sickeningly sweet, yet, I kept reading.(After all it was \\"a New York Times Bestseller.\\")Finally I threw it down after 150 pages. I can't believe that it was published. I'm sorry I wasted my time on this book, and hope that my comments will save someone else their valuable reading time."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was a quick read. Excellent story telling that kept you wanting to get involved in the story. With enough of a plot twist to keep the less romantically inclined enjoying the book. It is well worth a read for anyone with a desire for a good tear jerker. His imagery pulls you into the beauty of the region you can feel his love for the area in his writing."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I don't like love stories. But this one is the best story I have ever read. It almost seems impossible that two people could ever love each other that much. The whole time I was reading I remembered a love I had as a young girl. A love I will probably not experience again for we parted as children and live totally separate and distant lives."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have read all of Nicholas Sparks books, and in my opinion, this is definitely his best. In this book, he really wraps you up in the characters to the point that you feel what they are feeling. He does that in his other books as well, but there's even more of it in this one. Denise and Taylor are amazing characters, and throughout the book you understand more about them and what they are going through, and you get to realize just how much they need each other. This is an incredible book, and definitely one everyone should read."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was a very fast read--it is the perfect summer book. After reading it, I sent a copy to my 85-year-old Grandma because she was all I could think about. She found her true love later in life and has kept his life's memory strong even though he can't even remember her. She enjoyed the book and passed it on to her friends. This book touches many generations (it has touched 4 generations of my family) and teaches the timeless lessons of love. If you want a book with tons of flowery words and deep descriptions, look elsewhere. The charm with this book is that it is simple, yet not so simple that you can't feel for the characters."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A quick read--almost a guilty pleasure. Without giving anything away, this story of an old love reignited will leave you in tears. For anyone who plans on growing old with someone special."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The book \\"The Notebook\\" by Nicholas Sparks was a very heart warming book and although it did not make me cry, it left me on the verge of tears. I loved this book because it is so well written and sweet. My mom recomended it to me and thought it would be a great peice of literature for me. I recommend this book to adolesents and adults everywhere. :)"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Wow! Never before have I read a book that actually brought me to tears. &quot;The Notebook&quot; did just that. It was a book that I wanted to go on and on and on. I think anyone with Grandparents or aging parents will be drawn into the emotions and a real reality that growing old isn't always what its meant to be. The love shared by the two characters withstood the test of time and this book will do the same."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was hard to put down. Little surprises kept popping up making the reader not put it down. The main character, Noah Calhoun, is very adventerous. He likes to go canoeing and play the guitar. Allison Nelson was also another main character. Her enjoyment came from painting. Noah and Allison spent a summer together and fell in love. They fell in love that one summer and haven't seen each other since. When Allison decided to come back to visit Noah, the book got very exciting and suspenseful. I found myself asking questions like &quot;Will they get married?&quot; or &quot;What will happen next?&quot; This expectably happened when I found out Allison was ingaged. although this is a great book, it is not the best book I have read. It was very suspenseful and emotional in the begining and the end, but not in the middle. The middle was dragging a little and not as suspenseful as other parts of the book. I rate this book a four out of five."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"WOW just WOWI finally can read the book or watch the movie and not cry. It only took me 10 times :) I love love love this book. highly recommend it. It's all about the true love and how you are better off with your true love rather than someone who is everything you and your parents want him to be for your ideal husband.Only true love would stay with you and hold your hands when you are even mentally out. can't say enough about this book. one of my favorites for sure!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Unfortunately I saw the movie first. I liked the movie better than the book. And that's never the case, I usually love the book over the movie. It was still a great book. I am very glad I read it. I think if you saw the movie, you would enjoy the book as well."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I believe in love that can withstand all, and this book has so poetically captured what most dream of finding. It is so well written that even though I watched the movie long before I read this book, I was astounded. The characters are well developed and the plot is easy to follow. You find yourself immersed in a world of older, simpler times and wishing you were there. The description of the surrounding area where he has rebuilt the house is awesome and truly captures some of the North Carolina coast. I have firsthand views of it as well as the toil that having a loved one with Alzheimer's can do. The direction that this took can bring hope to anyone to make them not only want a love like this but be able to love this way too. At first I wasn't so certain about the manner of reading a book of someone who wrote a book of their own story down, but its delivery was flawless."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"great bookgreat storyrecommendedtoo many words required for this reviewtoo many too many too many too many"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I'm another one surprised to find myself thinking, \\"the movie was better.\\" The book was okay. It was a short enough book that I dont feel I wasted my time. The most emotional parts were of the old couple, just the sad lot they had in their old age, not even so much the connected love story. The end was cheesy."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"not impressed with the book. I thought the movie version did a better job with the story and the characters."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This novella is really a quick and easy read. It fits together so easily it's almost prose. I could've read this book years ago, but life got in the way, so it just collected dust. I was also comparing it to Bridges of Madison Country (which was unbelievably great) the whole time. That's okay cuz it seems to be more relevant to my life now-- for all the ones I've loved before, who traveled in and out my door.... haha. It's a love story akin to... Love Story. I guess I dont really have the adjectives to put it to words. But, it is skillfully done. I found myself awash in emotions reading this. Anyone who doesn't must not have a romantic bone in their body, because this is the real deal. This is the iconic love story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I saw the movie a couple of years ago before I read the book a couple days ago. This is great love story to read, and I recommend this book to every person out there who enjoys reading romance stories."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The grat book!I always wanted to buy this book, and I was so excited when I found it on Amazon.com for a reasonable price.And I was very satisfied with the condition also."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Okay, okay, I get it now. All the hype surrounding this book and Nicholas Sparks in general totally makes sense to me now. Typically, I buck the trends and don't read the \\"popular\\" books (I still refuse to read Twilight and I've only read one book by Jodi Picoult) - I like to find the gem hidden in a pile of rocks. When it comes to Nicholas Sparks, I will now make an exception.This was probably one of the most beautiful, genuine, heartbreaking love stories I have ever read. I'm afraid to see the movie as I'm convinced it can't possibly be as good as the book (is it ever?). I felt every emotion between Noah and Allie - the longing, the sadness, the fear, the exhilaration, the ultimate love - I actually shuddered when they kissed for the first time when Allie returned to New Bern. I screamed when she left Noah to go meet Lon. I cried when Allie didn't remember who Noah was.This was a light read and I finished it in one day. I can't wait to read more books by Nicholas Sparks."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"You will smile and cry and will be so glad you read this treasure. Share it with someone you love."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book captured my heart and soul from its first paragraph to its last. Never before have I been so swept away by a story. Sparks wrote a novel that read like poetry. His story was a simple one but one that people can relate to universally...either because they have experienced a love so pure and true or because they are still looking for that love. It's a book to be read over and over and treasured for life. Reccommend it to friends of yours but don't lend it out for you will surely want it back!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was one of the best I've ever read, Sparks is my favorite author by far. The way he uses his words, it's amazing. I wish I was as good a writer as he is. His words are like poetry."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was such a good book. I cant believe how well written it was. It was so detailed and deep. I absolutely adore this book and Nicholas Sparks. I cant wait for another great book by him!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"After working with Alzheimer's patients for over three years, I found this book both touching and somewhat misleading. I enjoyed this tale and would recommend it to someone who wants a cathartic tear jerker."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"... what can be said about this book that hasn't already been said?I was given this book as a Christmas present, so I really tried to read it. Several times. But I simply wasn't interested in the first half. What did interest me was Allie's struggle with Alzheimer's and Noah's care for his wife. I have had two grandaunts who suffered from Alzheimer's and my grandmother suffered from a similar form of dementia, so I have a little experience here.There is such a phenomenon among elderly patients suffering from the various forms of dementia known as Sundowner's Syndrome. I have personally seen it in action. While what happened to Allie was unique, I refuse to believe (as some of the cynical reviewers below have) that it is beyond the realm of possibility. As the Bible reminds us, &quot;With God, all things are possible.&quot;And that's what Mr. Sparks is writing about: the possibilities; the &quot;what ifs&quot; in life; the hope and dream of every Alzheimer's patient and his family. I read fiction to dream, to smile with hope. And with the last half of his book, that's what Mr. Sparks delivers. Would that he had caught my interest and kept it throughout.For the stuffed shirts looking for great literature and who sneer at the possibilities, be my guest and go be bored out of your skull (not to mention depressed) with Hemingway. For those looking no further than mild entertainment that includes a hopeful look at a tragic illness, give THE NOTEBOOK a try."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book and shared it with my husband (Noah reminded me so much of him). He agrees, all men whether single or married will benefit from reading this book. It will give you a new understanding for what true love is all about....&quot;in good times and bad, in sickness in health...&quot;."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks has written a book that will stay with me forever. The Notebook was an amazing tale of how &quot;true love conquers all.&quot; I'm not ashamed to say I've read this book at least 20 times and I cry my eyes out every time. I can only wish that I have that kind of love in my lifetime. Everybody of all ages, male and female, should read this book for the love of love."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was looking for something to read. I pick this book up and started reading it at 3:00 pm one day and by the next day I finished it. The best book I've read this summer. Wish I could find more like this."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I found this to be a very easy story to get into. It was really heartfelt for me. I admit it - I cried. I bought the audio-book version. I have listened to it several times and it still has the same effect on me. I would recommend it. Very good &quot;listening&quot;"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I'm not sure if true love, as depicted in The Notebook, truly exists, but it sure gives me hope after reading this story.This was a wonderful novel and made me weep on more than one occasion. The love that Noah and Allie share is something special. Noah has known that he's been in love with Allie since the day he met her and that he would always be in love with her. Allie, on the other hand, is torn between what is expected of her and what she truly yearns for. It's an all too familiar of what happens far too often in our society. The tenderness these two share is simply beautiful.We also get a glimpse of the horrible disease called Alzheimer's and how it not only destroys the individual it has afflicted, but also those that much sit by and watch the destruction it causes.I have truly enjoyed the writing of Nicholas Sparks and this is now the third novel of his that I've read. As of now I'd say this just edges out \\"A Bend in the Road\\" as my favorite thus far."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I bought &quot;The Notebook&quot; after seeing previews for the movie coming out in June. I was looking forward to reading a love story set in the 1930's, your traditional 'poor-boy-meets-rich-girl' type story, where they overcome obstacles to finally find the love they've searched for all their lives. I was hoping for an in depth exploration of the main characters' personalities and lives, and a detailed description of their exploits together and what it was that made their love so special.Instead, I got one of the least held-together, least interesting and least fluid books I've ever read. I wanted to read about the love that brought Allie and Noah together in the first place, and what happened after they reunited later in life. I was not interested at all in what happens when they are old and grey and at the end of their lives.I found the narration to be overdone and somewhat diminutive. A lot of the dialogue was unrealistic, and the letters between Allie and Noah didn't seem real at all; rather than actual love letters between two people they were used to provide the reader with plot details that the author didn't seem to be bothered with explaining in detail.Basically, the story was dull and jumped around from point to point. The most disappointing part is that it COULD have been so much more interesting, it had so much more potential, but it seems like it was rushed to production.I am very disappointed and definetly want my 10$ back. This is not worth the money at all."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I finished this book in three hours and cried most of the way through. I simply could not put it down and still get teary eyed thinking about Noah and Allie. This is a must read for anyone who has ever been in love or looking for true love. Anyone can relate to this story in one way or another. It leaves you with a fresh outlook on life and a renewed understanding of what is important in this world. Love never fails..."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was terrific! I cried so hard I could not even see the pages! I had to put it down but had to keep reading. To have something move me so much emotionally puts me in awe. The love these two people share comes once in a lifetime, if at all. After reading this I purchased the rest of his books and read them also."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have read every Nicholas Sparks book and this is absolutely my favorite! I read it in one sitting and since then, have read it about 9 times! This story reveals what true love is. It will make you smile and cry, and compel you to read it one more time after you just finished."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have to say no book has surprised me as this one did. The switch in the story was just fantastic. It made it quite unique. I thought it was a work of art. Reading this book has brought me to buy every book Sparks has written and I will continue to do so. I have not seen an author as talented and inspiring as Sparks in a long time. He has brought out my desire to write again. I would recommend that anyone out there pick up every book Sparks has wrote. They are all masterpieces. And in some way or another will touch your heart."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I must admit that I am not a romantic and surely would not allow anyone to call me that but this book really warmed my heart.Noah spends 14 years away from his first love, Allie and never a day does he not think of her. When they do eventually meet up again, she was engaged but she still thought fondly of him. Their attraction to each other the 2 days they were together proved to be beyond what they could control. What would happen to them?A very simple story which is told with such ease that it made me flip page after page and never was tired of the story.The events unfolded were quite predictable and made the &quot;ideal fairy-tale&quot; story that we all hope would happen, usually. But it wasn't a drag to read. In fact, I guess it would do many of us good to read such a simple love story again for most of us are probably lost in the fast-pace world around us, never having the time to stop and savour the finer things in life - in this case, love at its ultimate.A sad tinge in the story makes one both sympathize and yearn for Noah, for the love he has and for the one that he loves.Do miracles happen? Read this gem to find out."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"When I first started reading The Notebook, I fell in love with the writing style. Although at first the story line held my attention, later I found that I couldn't wait for it to be over. I understood Noah's character, and felt his love for Allie. But Allie's character wasn't developed well, and her love for Noah seemed only slight. Just when you think you finally get to find out what happened, the story just stops and leaves you hanging. I can appreciate the mystery, but there was no climax in this book at all. I was not excited to read it, and I was not sorry that it ended. It was not a page-turner."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book typifies the best lovestory ever told. If two people are meant to be, no distance and boundaries can keep them together. It is well-written and the characters are very much alive and you can feel them with all the emotions that goes along with the story. It speaks of hope, strenght and true love amidst all of life's troubled roads. A real tear-jerker till the end, anyone who has read this book can say that this story is written for him."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"For me this is the best book Nocholas Sparks has written. It is a different type of love. I am a married young man and I would like to live that kind of love with my wife when we get older. Everyone with a heart should read this book. The way the author explain each detail is great. I also read &quot;Message in the Bottle&quot; from the same author but &quot;The Notebook&quot; has something special. I invite you to a great experience reading &quot;Notebook&quot;. A soon as you read it you will understand what I am trying to say."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have to recognize I read the book in two days. The story catches you and you cannot put the book down. You can almost feel what is happening to Allie, and worry about what desicion she will take, and feel sad about Noah... I've been reading more &quot;serious&quot; books latelt tough. Vietnam war, etc. and it seem a little too romantic for my taste. It is a book to entratain yourself a while, a romantic novel."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was one of Nicholas Sparks' best books even though i've only read two, both of which were tear jerkers. This one was a REAL tear jerker though. The way he expressed the love between the two people and how they never forgot about each other. Nicholas Sparks is one of the few authors that can create such a story that can make you feel like you know the characters. This story tells a story about a a well off family that doesn't want their daughter to fall in love with a man that, to them isn't good for her, but she already was in love with him."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I am only 17 years old, and when I set down to read this book I had in mind that it would be another futurisitc love story. But to my suprise it was aything but. It made me see that this is the way women should be treated and this is who they should marry. That the way a man makes you feel about your hopes and dreams should be the true person that they are. So if your one who loves romance novels this is the best I have read, Sparks is an incredible gifted writer. and for those who are like me and tend not to be fond of love stories just start reading The Notebook and the way you percieve the man/woman of your dreams will change forever........"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is about a story of lost lovers that found each other after fourteen years. Noah, a single male who lives by himself, falls in love with Allie when they are teenagers. They first met at a county fair and spent the day together. Gus, Noah's best friend, introduced them. Since the county fair, Noah and Allie started seeing each other. They would often meet and talk or do anything that any typical couple would do. One day when they met, they both lost their virginity. Three weeks later, Allie left him and moved. It had been fourteen years since they've seen each other. Allie is now getting married to Lon Hammond, a very respected guy with a famous family name. Three weeks before the wedding, she goes back to New Bern, North Carolina to see Noah and to see what he had been doing all the years they've been apart. Throughout the fourteen years, Noah had been sending letters to her, but she would not reply. Later on in the book, they find out that Allie's mom, Anne, had been retrieving them and keeping them away from Allie. When Allie visits Noah, she still feels the love that was once there. Finally they find that their love was lost, but now they found it. They spent the whole night together and the evening following. An unexpected visitor comes to Noah's house which is Anne. She tells Allie that she needs to choose between Lon and Noah. Allie decides to go back to Lon and meets him in town. While she was driving to town, she realized that the person she really wanted and needed was a guy like Noah, who fulfilled her needs and emotions. She then tells Lon that she's leaving him and going back to Noah. Lon accepts it like a real gentleman would and leaves New Bern to go back to Virginia, where he lives. Allie and Noah marry and stay with each other for forty-nine years. During the last three years, Allie is diagnosed with Alzeihemer's, and forgets what happens. Some days she has good days when she remember's Noah and what he tells her, but other days the &quot;thief&quot; gets her and she forgets everything and everyone. She gets afraid. The doctors say that it isn't possible for someone with Alziehemer's to remember, but they believe that the love Noah and Allie have are keeping her strong. Also within the last 2 years of the 49, Noah has a stroke, but he lives because of his love for Allie. He wants to die after his wife, not before. This book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I think that it's best that I start my review by stating the title of the book I read, The Notebook, a novel by Nicholas Sparks. The book was a very suspenseful romance, if there is such a story. The book starts out by a man named 31 year old, Noah Calhoun, speaking about how time flies and what his life has been. It also talks about an old flame that he had when he was in high school. The flame's name was Allie Nelson. He described her as being tall, slender, and beautiful (she was 29). The interesting twist about their relation ship is that when they had those moments together (not appropriate to say) Allie was engaged to a nice young man named Lon. He was a very respectable man. Lon was a lawyer and a very talented one at that. He was around eight years older than she and he was very dedicated to his work. He loved her very much. The second part of the book is where you are introduced to the fact that they are in the same nursing home together but don't realize it (Can we say dramatic irony!). The rest of the book is sort of 'a give' away so I will let all the prospering scholars read it for themselves! I would rate this book a five on a one to five star rating scale. I normally don't enjoy the sappy love stuff but Nicholas Sparks makes it so suspenseful, and enjoyable. Another reason is because it was a love story and throughout the entire thing, you always wanted to hook Allie and Noah up! A third reason is because it has a lot of vocabulary words. My last reason is something that always impresses me as a reader, the description is phenomenal. The way he writes makes you feel as if you are right there breathing the same oxygen. I would definitely recommend this book to any reader who wants a good book!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A story simple as breathe, wonderful as a sunset and eternal as the ocean. A story that tell us the things wich are really important and worth sherching and fighting for."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is certainly a good read especially for someone like me who believe in destiny and fate. I know that the world is full of cynical people - people who don't believe that love like the one Noah and Allie shared still exist. It may be rare..but it does exist. I love Noah and Allie's characters. I love the fact that they are bonded in mind, body, and soul. I've read somewhere that as it is, the world is full of mediocre things and love should not be one of them. Noah and Allie's story will make you realize that. Keep em coming Mr. Sparks..I'm truly thankful for The Notebook."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A love story for those who still believe that love can last a lifetime.

The Notebook describes an account of two star-crossed lovers, Noah and Allie, destined to be together after fourteen years of separation. Once reunited again, the two realize that their love for each other remains alive and strong, despite their life's differences.This exceptional author bases his book on the themes of &quot;Loyalty&quot; and &quot;Everlasting Love.&quot; Sparks had spent time watching his wife's grandparents, who had remained together through thick and thin for sixty-two wonderful years of marriage. In their older age, they both began to deal with a number of physical ailments. Despite all of the obstacles and hardships the elderly couple had to overcome, their love continued to grow stronger each day. Sparks was inspired by this beautiful experience. He believed this love story was a wonderful lesson to learn and felt inclined to share it with the rest of the world, especially since committment in marriage is often temporary. This heartbreaking, but uplifting romantic love story appeals to the young and old. It will always contribute a lasting value of unique, orginal love to our society.Nicholas Spark's novel consists of adequate sources, but unasked, or even unanswered questions. Did Noah and Allie continue a much longer life of never-ending love? Did Allie's father ever consent to her choice of marriage? The author asks such questions that question the reader's beliefs. Would the reader be willing to sacrifice their life merely to begin a new one? Would the reader search for their long lost soul mate, their destined lover, despite their discouragement?Apparently the author intends to inspire and encourage readers to follow their dreams. This extraordinary novel becomes an experience to remember. Sparks leaves readers with the unforgettable images created by his selective choice of words. It would be a miracle if people could find a fraction of the love that Noah and Allie share for each other. Sparks' book revokes a swirl of emotions that tug at your heart and influence your outlook on love and the miracles it can bring to the world. His novel has become a labor of love to his family and a gift to the rest of us.Although this romantic account of two courageous, determined lovers may leave readers weeping, they are left with an uplifting note on life and the true essence of love. Readers can only hope to experience love this stunning in their lifetime. In his extraordinary novel, Nicholas Sparks influences readers to never give up on life and their search for ever-lasting, pure love."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"It is obvious while reading THE NOTEBOOK that Nick Sparks agonized painfully over ever word he typed, that every sentence was a struggle in his simplistic mind. I've stepped in rainpuddles that weren't as shallow as his characters. Each character lives more in the past than in the present, and I personally found it hard to swallow that two people that met at age 15 for a month or two during the summer could wait almost 15 more years hoplessly in love with each other. And when they DO get together, they spend all their time &quot;remembering&quot; those summer months. I love a good romance, but this was just sickening. I reccomend reading it only because it is so bad, it's hard to believe. His second book was even worse..."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read Nicholas Spark's Message in a Bottle and decided I wanted to read more of his books. I loved Message in a Bottle but I enjoyed The Notebook even more. This is a heartwarming story about how love works in mysterious ways. Noah and Allie fall in love as kids and many years later they find there way back to one another. Allie found Noah in the paper and wanted to visit him one more time before she got married. When she saw him though, she feel in love all over again and it didn't even feel like many years had gone by. The end of the book has a dramatic twist and made me cry. This book seriously moved me and made me believe in having a soul mate. The moral of the story is no matter what obstical life puts in your way, true love will always find its way in. I loved how this book made me feel and if you like love stories, this is the ultimate one. Read The Notebook for a powerful love story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Being an avid reader, I was looking for a book to fill in the time I had and being a small little paperback, I picked The Notebook up. 'It won't take me long, a nice easy read' I thought. I'm not usually a romance reader but I may be a convert after reading this! I agree that the book doesn't go into too much detail about the character's backgrounds but to me I don't need all that. Nicholas hit the spot by telling a short, sweet story about something we all yearn for. Just reading about these two people and the beautiful love they had for eachother was all I needed to enjoy the book. I spent the whole time, like many others, sniffling and wondering whether I'd ever find anyone as special as Noah and who would love me as much as he did Allie or she did him...a few days later, and much to my surprise, I found my own Noah and I now feel as lucky as Allie must have felt to have found that one special person you just know you are meant to be with forever. All you cynics out there - read this, weep and believe!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I first encountered this book years ago, and have since read it again. Nicholas Sparks has produced several books since this one was published: MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE (Kevin Costner played in the movie), A WALK TO REMEMBER, and THE RESCUE. The previous books hardly do this wonderful writer justice. THE NOTEBOOK is a well-crafted love story with a plethora of tender, heart-warming moments wrapped around a plot that captures your attention from page one. The story is simple: Noah Calhoun returns from the war, and begins restoring a plantation home. While restoring the house, Noah can't escape his feelings for a girl he loved sometime earlier: Allie Nelson. Noah is content to live without her, until she returns and the emotions of the past are slowly, bit by bit, uncovered. Allie and Noah must confront their past and their future, for a decision awaits Allie; a decision that will effect the rest of their lives and bring meaning to the mysterious Notebook.Like I mentioned eariler, Nicholas Sparks is a good writer, but his later efforts pale in comparison to this gem of a book. I have read THE NOTEBOOK many times, and will read it many more. It is a rare occurrence when you can read a book numerous times and still be amazed, and touched when you come to the last word on the last page; THE NOTEBOOK is the book. Hopefully, Nicholas Sparks will write another novel with the depth of THE NOTEBOOK, but until then I will be content with reading this book again and again."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"At the heart of this novel is a lovely and romantic story. However, a book needs more than a nice plot to make it a good read.Sparks seems unable to let his characters develop naturally. Instead, characters are introduced for the sole purpose of assuring the reader that the protagonist is a good and generous fellow, then quickly dropped.Add to this Sparks' bland narrative style and you're left with a story that feels hollow. This novel could have been so much more, but I finished the book feeling like I had been the victim of a cheap attempt to tug my heartstrings."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Yeucch!! I forced myself to plow through this sugary mess because a friend loaned it to me. Lousy, stilted writing; characters thin and slick as magazine ads; not much in the way of a plot. Brevity was this book's sole virtue. Publishers, please: put a Harlequin sticker on this sort of thing so it isn't mistaken for literature."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I don't read as often as I would like, and I most certainly have never offered my opinions in the form of a book review. But I could not resist sharing my thoughts on Nicholas Sparks' &quot;The Notebook&quot;.For a southern country boy like myself, the setting could not have been more perfect, making it easy to identify with the charming subtleties of rural life. The detail is sufficiently descriptive, idyllic and romantic but not overpowering or distracting. The author remains true to his task of writing a love story, capturing the essence of what we all would like to have in our lives - the once-in-a-lifetime love that endures forever.As I'm sure many others would say, I draw many parallels between the characters and my own life. Even the details - Noah's deep, musical voice, his love of nature, the strong work ethic and easy-going style are traits that describe me, so I especially became drawn into the story. I, too, have met the one woman, very artistic and full of life, that I dream of spending the rest of my life with, yet there remains a chasm between us. I only hope I don't have to wait 14 years for her!As corny as it sounds, I am inspired by Sparks to keep alive my true feelings for the most beautiful woman I've ever met. Yes, I'm an idealist, but you realists out there need us!I devoured the book in one evening and the same night penned a poem which I SHALL one day share with my true love."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read The Notebook in 8th grade for a book report. Soon after I found out what a mistake that would be. The charachters are entirely run of the mill and the plot is totally unbeliveable and predictable. The only time something slightly changed in the whole story was when you read about the two charachters reuniting. Although I was happy to finally get to a bit of a change form the book, I'm not sure thats the kinda of change I was looking for, whcih was a full on description of the two having intercourse. Pretty much, this book consists of: balh, blah,,blah, sex, balh balh blah, sex. I cant understand why this book was so highly praised, but I would strongly reccomend not reading it. Its a whole lot of nothing rolled up into 200 pages."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book really really really is one of the most terrible books I've ever read. I first read Message in a Bottle because the previous tenant of my apartment left it. And now I know why. I decided to give Sparks another chance with The Notebook, since it seemed to get such great reviews. I was very disappointed. First of all, the characters in both books are shallow, the dialogue is just retarded (worse than a first-date conversation). And not to mention the ridiculous similarities in both books. Both female characters must be from the family since they both experience serial orgasms during the 'height' of the love scene in the novels. Oh, and what about the fact that during the first romantic night characters from both books were 'surprised at how quickly they finished their beer'? I mean, the wording is almost exactly the same in both books. Did Sparks cut and paste? Granted that these are trivial details, but it shows Sparks' lack of imagination--hardly a novel... Please, Nicholas Sparks, go back to your drafts and produce something that won't result in me kicking myself for spending the money to buy the book and for wasting the time to read it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A perfect summer read.

The sequel The Wedding, is about their children. I loved the book and only mildly enjoyed the movie. I own all Nicholas Sparks books, he is an amazing author, all his books have a different lesson on love."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I absolutely loved The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks. All of his books contain interesting characters and engaging plots, and I have yet to be disappointed by his impressive storytelling abilities. This particular piece is a heart-warming tale of Allie and Noah's relationship uniquely presented using flashbacks. I was mesmerized from the first word until the very last. Storytelling this good deserves to be made into a feature film, and luckily for us, it was. The blockbuster movie, from New Line Cinema, 2004, stars James Garner, Gena Rowlands, Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams as the main characters from different time frames. I even enjoyed the movie as much as the book, which doesn't occur too often. A Walk to Remember and Message in a Bottle, both available through Warner Bros Pictures, were additional Nicholas Sparks's books that I enjoyed and were also made into excellent movies. I would recommend The Notebook for all lovers of romantic or adventure films because it is a rare find that will satisfy both sexes. It is not your typical romance; however, having a box of tissues nearby is not a bad idea since plenty of emotions will be generated. Once experienced, this fictional tale will not soon be forgotten. If you enjoy this genre, you may also take pleasure in the movie Fried Green Tomatoes, from Universal Pictures, 1991, which was told in the same unique storytelling fashion as The Notebook. It was based on the book Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Caf&eacute;: a Novel by Fannie Flagg. Pick up a copy of The Notebook today; I promise you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is a story about relationships, passion and refound love. How can love be reborn after many years of being kept away? \\"The reason it hurts so much to separate is because our souls are connected. Maybe they always have been and will be.\\" Noah is writing this to Allie in a letter and is saying that he loves her, even though she is gone.In New Bern, North Carolina, Noah Calhoun never thought that he would find love, at least a love that would last forever and through everything. Until one summer he happens to stumble upon a rich girl named Allie. They spent a summer under the trees together, learned from each other, and best of all fell in love. But when summer ends, so does their relationship because Allie's dad didn't like Noah and forced Allie to go home with them and never see him again. They don't know if they will ever see each other again after they say their last goodbye. But 14 years later, something unexpected will happen when she comes back to New Bern.One of my favorite parts in this book is when Allie comes back to town. Her mom knows why she came back and where she would be at. Her mom comes and gets her and takes her to the mills to show her something from her past that she doesn't quite agree with. She tells Allie about this man that she had in her life and tells her of the life that she could have had if she had married him instead of Allie's father. Allie now understands where her parents were coming from when they took her away from Noah.My interpretation of the theme/message of this book is that love doesn't end when you leave and start a new life; love stays with you through everything and its there with you when you want it to come back. This is shown in the book when Allie and Noah get torn apart from each other. They didn't see or hear from each other for about 14 years, but as soon as Allie came back, they fell in love all over again.This book was really good. Most people who like love stories will love it. But people who aren't into love stories; they probably wouldn't like it as much, or even at all and should set it down and move on. The thing I liked about this book was the suspense in it, not knowing what is going to happen between Allie and Noah and for that I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"THE NOTEBOOK is the romance novel of this generation!Ali and Noah are two very different people, or characters, depending on how you think about it. Ali is from a wealthy family that thinks very highly of themselves, and Noah was raised by his father and has had to work for every penny he has. Which is not much. The characters come alive and it is almost like you personally know both of them. It's amazing! Ali takes a vacation to New Bern where Noah lives. As the summer progresses, their relationship grows stronger and stronger and they fall in love. They fight all the time, but for some crazy reason they are madly in love.Then the summer ends.Noah and Ali are devastated that she has to leave. Her parents won't let her stay because they think that she is too good for him. It's absolutely devastating. He writes her letters, which she never receives because her mother intercepts and keeps them. She thinks that Noah has forgotten her.Then World War II begins.Noah is deployed for a couple of years and comes home when the war is over. During this time, Ali gets engaged to Lon, a lawyer who her parents approve of because he is socially acceptable. Noah buys an old plantation and fixes it up, and he and the house wind up in the newspaper. So Ali decides that she needs to go see Noah before she gets married, even though she hasn't seen him in fourteen years. At their reunion, they realize that they never fell out of love.Read the book to find out who Ali chooses, Noah or Lon!Reviewed by: Taylor Rector"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I loved this book.

The book went through out my work place through many hands, and I was one of the last few to read it, and I'm glad I did. I've recomended the book to many, and will keep on recommending. It's an excellent choice. Emotions, Love, Happiness, sadness.. The book has it all. I would have to say Its a book I'd read, over and over and over again.

In one day, you fall back in love with him and realize you never even stopped. You love your fianc&eacute;, Lon, but he doesn't make you feel the way your true love does. Who do you choose? In The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks, Allie is put in this exact situation.I enjoyed this book for several reasons. First, reading it made me feel several different emotions. I cried on several different parts of the book, along with my cousin. Reading it also made me feel more appreciative that the people I love are always there for me.Second, the genre of The Notebook was interesting. According to Nicholas Sparks, some may call it a romantic book, while others will call it a tragedy. I truly believe it is both.Third, The Notebook has recently been made into a movie. The movie made millions of dollars. It was very popular and was also very touching.The final reason is because of the author. Nicholas Sparks also wrote A Walk to Remember, which was a popular book and later became a popular movie. He has also written a sequel to The Notebook, called The Wedding.Out of all the novels I've read, The Notebook is one of my favorites and one of the most memorable. As soon as I finished it, I wanted to read it again and relive the life of Noah and Allie. Anyone who is at least in sixth grade and enjoys romantic books should read The Notebook Even if you don't usually read romantic books, you'll still enjoy learning about Noah and Allie and the decision Allie makes."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"\\"The Notebook\\" can be a romantic story or a tragedy. Two young couple, Noah and Allie fell in love. This story took place in New Bern, North Carolina. Allie's parents did not approve them to be together and it caused them to seperate for fourteen years. Noah Calhoun went to World War II and Allie Nelson went to college. They reunited fourteen years later at a reunion. Allie was 29 years old and engaged to a lawyer, Lon Hammond. Noah was 31 years old who has just came back from World War II. They still find each other longing for each other. They spent a few more times together and Allie chose Noah instead. They got married for fourty-five years. At the age of 80, Allie suffers from a sickness called Alzheimer which caused her to lose her memory, hallucination, and confusion. Allie forgot who Noah was. Allie wrote their love story in a notebook and the only way for her to remember everything is to read it. Noah read the story to her everyday little by little, hoping for them to fall in love all over again.I would definitely recommend \\"The Notebook\\" to anybody who is interested in reading romance novels. This story has a lot of sadness with love and loss. If you like to read horror, mysteries, or action books, this wouldn't be a good book. This book is for those who has the patience to wait for ending. You might also put your own feelings into it and notice what Noah and Allie been through.One of the phrase in the book said by Allie's mother (Anne Nelson), \\"I can't make this decision for you, Allie, this one's all yours. You've got some decisions to make, and you don't have much time.\\" The mother never approved Allie to be with Noah but she realize that it's her daughter's choice of who she wants to be with for the rest of her life. At that time, Allie was engaged to Lon and she didn't know who to choose. This phrase keeps you thinking whether she chooses Lon or Noah. While reading this phrase, I just couldn't put the book down. Decision-making is hard, especially between two men Allie fell in love with. It keeps you guessing and while reading, there is an answer in your head and you just want to keep reading to see if it's true.Here is another phrase said by Noah while Allie was suffering from Alzheimer. \\"We spend each and every day together now, but our nights are spent alone. The doctors tell me that I'm not allowed to see her after dark. I understand the reasons completely, and though I agree with them, I sometimes break the rules. Late at night when my mood is right, I will sneak from my room and go to hers and watch her while she sleeps. Of this she knows nothing. I'll come in and see her breathe and know that had it not been for her, I would have never married.\\" While Allie is suffering a memory loss, in my point of view, Noah also suffered. Allie didn't remember who Noah was and I'm sure it hurted him really bad. This was a loss not of Allie, but of all theyears of memories shared together. But Noah never losed faith because he promised to be there by her side no matter what. This novel is very interesting and I would recommend it to everybody. Even if you're not interested in Romance, give it a shot anyways. Who knows whether or not this will change your interest."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was the first book by Nicholas Sparks that I had the pleasure to read.

I read some of the earlier low rated reviews here and the very reason it was hated by some is what made me like it so much. I don't always want to read a book where the characters &amp; plots are so complex you can't keep track of them. I LOVE that The Notebook was simply written and to the point.

Even I became misty-eyed while reading the final pages."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks has been my favorite author for a very long time now. I have read each and every one of his novels (and his recent memoir) since the original release of THE NOTEBOOK almost ten years ago.THE NOTEBOOK is Nicholas Sparks' first, and by far, the BEST of all the novels he has written. This is the book which started it all, earning Nicholas Sparks a place on Best Seller lists everywhere. When it was originally released, the HC spent more than ONE YEAR (actually, almost TWO YEARS!) on the Best Sellers list. By now, it is probably close to (or maybe even surpassed) its 50th printing!This novel is such a fan favorite, and &quot;Noah and Allie&quot; are so beloved, that Sparks was inspired to write a 'sequel' (THE WEDDING) to it just last year (the only 'sequel' he's ever written!). In fact, according to a recent poll on Sparks' website, the character of 'Noah' is by far the most popular of all the characters Sparks has created, earning more than TWICE the number of votes that the second place character earned!!The recent release of the movie has spawned a new 'generation' of readers and should (rightfully so) earn Mr. Sparks many new fans. I hope that those who have recently read THE NOTEBOOK for the very first time will continue with Noah &amp; Allie's story, by following it up with THE WEDDING, and then at least one other of the many Best Selling novels Sparks has written. (To fully appreciate the wonderful 'gift' of Nicholas Sparks and THE NOTEBOOK, I encourage readers to read his recent Best Selling memoir, THREE WEEKS WITH MY BROTHER, where readers can learn how these characters were brought to life, and what has inspired Sparks to be the author he is today!).What I love about a Nicholas Sparks novel is that most readers can identify with at least one of the many characters he has created over the years. Whether it be the lovable, sentimental 'Noah'; the sweet, innocent 'Jamie' (WALK TO REMEMBER); the strong, hero 'Taylor' (THE RESCUE); the life-saving protector 'Mike' (THE GUARDIAN); the cautious loner who rediscovers love 'Garret' (MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE); the hard-working, determined, loving mother 'Denise' (THE RESCUE); the smart-alleck young man who learns how to love 'Landon' (WALK TO REMEMBER); or any one of the many others, Nicholas Sparks creates characters which we can all find within ourselves. Readers can identify with these characters in every way - from their strong will, vulnerable hearts and determined spirit.Altho classified as a &quot;love story&quot;, THE NOTEBOOK and other Sparks' novels, are not just love stories between a man and a woman - within the pages of a Nicholas Sparks novel, readers will find the love stories of mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, friends, and neighbors. They are the inspired &quot;love stories&quot; of all of us, and are especially needed in the world we live in today.THE NOTEBOOK is a truly inspired story, and Nicholas Sparks is a gifted writer, deserving every bit of the attention &amp; praise this new movie has generated. By climbing the Best Sellers list again - nearly ten years after its original release - and capturing the hearts of a new generation of readers, THE NOTEBOOK has proven itself to be a classic, timeless love story for all ages, and Nicholas Sparks as an author to be cherished, appreciated, and read for many years to come.(If you've read THE NOTEBOOK and enjoyed it, be sure to follow it up with THE WEDDING - Noah &amp; Allie aren't &quot;complete&quot; until readers have gone full circle!)"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks' &quot;The Notebook&quot; is poetry itself. Through the sensitivity of his character, Noah, we catch a glimpse of that for which we all long: true love. The soul mate lovers in this book take us through their lives, showing us the awesome power of true love, a power that can indeed conquer all. Easy read, but be sure to savour every breath-taking word!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I've read The Notebook more than once now, and it hasn't lost it's appeal. I've sent it to friends and insisted that they read it. And now, a number of my friends are also huge fans of Sparks.Everytime Nicholas Sparks releases a new book, I buy it. I don't even wait for the paperback. I buy the hardcover as soon as it's released. And as much as I've enjoyed everything he's written, The Notebook will always be my favorite.It's a love story for the ages. Simply heart-warming."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks has hit a homerun again! This book was recommended to me by a friend who is involved in similar life experiences. This book takes the reader on a journey that wanders through loneliness, young love, love lost, and a mature love found again. More importantly, for me, this book takes you through love that endures the pain and hope of an Alzheimer's caregiver. I read the book in two sittings... I just had to put it down to recover a bit and then picked it up again because I just had to know! When I was done, I gave the book to my husband so he could read it. The book is an emotional rollercoaster. Hubby finished the book in one sitting.There is a message of love that endures in this book -- through better and worse. There is a message of hope that encourages an Alzheimer's caregiver to continue to seek and find the moments of clarity that comes with an enduring love for the patient.If you want a super read -- this is the one! You will not be disappointed! Hollybmp @ Hubby"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"While each of Spark's books are love stories, each are unique. This one might be my favorite for several reasons. It is had a beautiful North Carolina setting that is describe wonderfully. Each character is real and true. Some novels seem too predictable with their characters, but this one sports typical people. I can relate to both of the main characters, also. I read this book in three days because each chapter leaves you in suspense. I would definetly reccoment this book for a relaxing weekend of intense and emotional reading."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK, and since I have read it have passed it on to many of my friends who also loved it. It's nice to be taken back to a day when true love was strong and meaningful. This is a one night read, I couldn't put it down. OUTSTANDING!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have never cried so hard when reading a book. Sparks is an excellent writer and gets you involved with all of the characters. This is a must read for anyone that likes a true love story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book in one night. About 221 pages. I stopped to cry and sob my eyes out at least 10 times while reading. It moved me unlike anything else I've read. It has pure heart and soul in each and every word, paragraph and chapter. I thank Nicholas Sparks for the cathartic experience this book as brought me. If everyone on this Earth found the love that Noah and Allie find and keep during their lives, the world would be a better place. I feel a lump to my throat just thinking about the book and writing this review. May all of you find the love that was described so beautifully in this book. :-)"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book. Mr. Sparks can tap into our emotions like nobody else. I laughed, cried and just soaked this book up. I couldn't wait to tell people about his writing, and what is does to you while you're reading it. I can't put down any of his books and recommend these books to everyone for a good read and to make us wake up and feel."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A touching story about 2 people who were destined to be soulmates, and have been through about everything. So of course, Nicholas Sparks is at it again with another romance story. And for this one you might need a box of tissue. This couple goes through everything you can imagine. From disagreeing parents, to amnesia, but somehow they manage to hold on to their love, and get through it all. If you want a good cry, this would be a good choice. You don't want to put it down. You want to keep reading and see the outcomes of all the choices and problems that this couple faces. It keeps you on the edge of your seat."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"What a beautifully written book that tugs at the heart strings! If you don't read romance novels (which I don't) this book is for you. This is a sweet love story that you just can't put down. Just give it a try &amp; you'll be hooked!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Yes, it's a tear-jerker and a reader isn't supposed to be too picky, but give me a break. The woman's fiance is your typical WASPy bore, and our hero is such a man's man. He builds, he cares, he cries!And the ending is ridiculous. A better title would be &quot;When We Were Pimps.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have never been so moved,as I was, reading this book.His love for her is what real love is,always putting the other person above yourself,and thinking of them every second of your life.This is a book for a man or a women,and they will both cry just as much,I did.Excellence"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was undoubtedly the best description of long lost (and found love) ever written. Most books that I've read, I do not particularly like the ending.This one kept you wondering how it would end. All love should end this way, but it doesn't, which makes you wonder if all love is real love"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is a story of true love. A love that holds two lives in it's spell through time. As you are reading the book it seems to transform into one man's 'notebook'. His innermost feelings are there for us to laugh with, cry with, but most of all to be in awe of the level of emotions which Noah deals with everyday.Through it all he still sees Allie as the girl he fell in love with so many summers ago. I have not been as moved by a book in long time and recommend it to everyone who wants to now what love is"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A good, solid, enjoyable romance. Well-written, fast-paced, with very believable characters. The type of romance guys will read because it isn't written by a woman. However, this book is NOWHERE near as well- written or involving as the scores of novels written by the accomplished authors of the romance genre. A sad fact. I'm male and have read hundreds of these romances. The Notebook is only slightly above average. Try reading Judith Mcnaught, Kathleen E. Woodiwiss, Diana Gabaldon, Julie Garwood, Sandra Brown, Janelle Taylor, Virginia Henley and many others. If you're man enough to cry, try one of these"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"It was the first time I read a love story. It took me 6 hours to read it and I had to finish it while I was working, I just couldn't put it down. It was wonderfully written and the story of Noah and Allie was so touching.I'm looking forward to Nicholas Sparks' next book"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I bought this book, opened it and five hours later I was done. Never put it down. Uniquely written, the book opens with a short introduction by an old man, and then launches into a love story which you eventually determine is actually being told (as you read it) to the old man's alzheimer ravaged wife of nearly 50 years. In hopes, that she'll remember their time together. Before I read this book, I was a man stoic in the face of 'feelie' books and movies, but I'm here to tell you I couldn't stop the flood of tears by book's end. This book should be read by anyone who intends to live beyond 12 years of age. Life lessons aplenty"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I actually finished this book in four hours! It was so good I could not put in down. I loved the romance, the love, and the format in which it was written. The last page was the best!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Everyone has a first love....a &quot;what if&quot; tale to tell. And that Nicholas Sparks successfully tells that tale in &quot;The Notebook&quot; is no exception. Noah and Allie make it back to a place many of us have only dreamed of -- the chance of recapturing that first love, unspoiled by time and circumstance. It is a wonderfully true love story, well-written, vivid and engrossing...a romantic page-turner's delight! And mine story? I have only dreamed"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"If every human could have this kind of mystical loveat the core of their existance, our world would be calledheaven! The NoteBook has changed my outlook on life--the reason we are put on this earth is to love!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have read both Message in a Bottle and the Notebook and give both five stars. I have met Mr. Sparks and he is just the kind of man I thought he would be. Not only nice looking but very kind, understanding and must have a very big heart to understand so well the meaning of true love. I cannot wait for his next book this Fall. The world needs more love stories like these and less violence. If we could all love like this there would be less hurt and fighting in this world."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"i have never read a book that actually made me cry before... this story is so heartwrenching and sparks writes so beautifully that i could hardly put it down. i loved it!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I even said to the checker at the bookstore, &quot;Do you promise this is not just another 'Bridges of Madison County?' Well, she lied. It's bad. It's a harlequin romance, for heaven's sake, with the single original twist of carrying the story to old age."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Equally as wonderful as it is short. I couldn't put it down. Nicholas Sparks has a great style, and a true talent for story telling. I enjoyed it so much that I read it again a week later!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Mr. Sparks has written a book that I could not put down. The sincerity of his characters, description of setting and intimates thoughts of two lovers add a depth of wanting to all of us caught in the two job, long hours 90's rush."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I truly enjoyed this heartwarming story. Everyone should be so lucky as to share this kind of love in their lifetime. You can't read this one without a box of tissues."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book is such a tear-jerker, you won't put it down.

I reccomend it to everyone who enjoys a good love story."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have just finished Notebook and Message in a Bottle both this week. Reading is a great pasttime. To my friends who have read this book or are about to, you will thoroughly enjoy this book. The sections where Noah goes back to his beloved every day, was so moving and touching. I work in long term care and plan on displaying this one section near the end of the book of Noah's daily adventures as he reads to Ally everyday. The warmth of this book hopefully will pass on to each and every one of our employees. I am sure their reaction will have a lasting effect of what &quot;quality of life&quot; and &quot;quality of care&quot; is all about. The insight of this chapter speaks for itself. We depend on our residents equally just as our residents depend on us in helping us under stand and deal with life's everyday problems. The book is wonderful, it made me laugh and definitely cry. It's hard to age and grow old, and when you have to prepare for a disease, and know the outcome, it's scary and sad. I am a great believer in miracles and believe in such astounding love. This book is definitely recommended and deserves 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have just finished Notebook and Message in a Bottle both this week. Reading is a great pasttime.

From passion, to pain, to happiness. Truly amazing."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"You know which book this reminds me of? Sara Gruen's Water for Elephants. Very similar plot, but not nearly as exciting or romantic as hers. As far as romance novels go, The Notebook was a touching story, but not a memorable one. I wasn't too impressed with the author's writing and was really disappointed as I've heard such good things about his writing and have always wanted to read one of his books. Since The Notebook was such a phenomenal movie (I hear, as I haven't seen it yet), I was all hyped-up to read this book. It must be good if it was made into a movie, right? The story was good, somewhat romantic and its premise sounded great. The problem is, I just didn't feel it. There were beautiful scenes which had me wishing I was in Allie's shoes at that moment, especially when they went out on the lake to feed the swans and geese, but the rest of it seemed so clich&eacute;d. You know that seen-it-done-it-bought-the-t-shirt feeling you get when something isn't new to you? I had that feeling often while reading it. True, this is escapism at its finest and most of us dream of a never-ending love exactly as this one, but I seriously struggled to feel their love for each other. The characters were nice, but not great and there was nothing in the way of character development. The dialogue wasn't all that great either. I'll admit, two or three poetic sentences from Noah struck a chord with me and I went \\"awwww...\\", almost wiping away a tear or two, but that's it. Nothing profound or which would stay with me afterwards. I'd still like to watch the movie though. I hear it's much better than the book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is one of the sweetest books that I have ever read. It shows what real love is about and the closeness you get through the golden years. I have been married 47 years and I can relate to their last few moments.

Wonderful easy to like charecters make it a great story that stays with you long after you've turned the last page."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"A very special love story that few people can relate too. Their love truly passed the tests that time dealt them. Noah is a true romantic that most men could take lessons from. I highly recommend this sweet romance. I read this book in one day because once I started reading I could not put it down."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book was amazing. The perfect beginning, and exciting middle,and a broken hearted yet 'you get it' ending. If only love were this exciting.

If you like love stories this is a must read!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I picked up &quot;The Notebook&quot; on a whim. I'd heard good things about it, but it was only a hundred pages or so, it looked like it was worth checking out. I sat down and finished the book in a little over an hour. It is an extremely quick read, and you don't want to stop. The words flow seamlessly and the story pans out like a sweet and poetic waltz, which takes you off into never never land. While in the end, it wasn't very fufilling, and parts of it were farfetched, it served it's purpose and was an interesting read, never boring. I did wonder a couple of times about the time period, because it seemed that towards the beginning, Sparks forgot the story took place in the 40's...because the characters and their actions were so 90'sish. It's definitely worth your time and you probably won't regret reading it."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was disappointed in this book since I had heard good things about it. If you like love stories than maybe you would like this book. I found the story to be very lame and it never really took off. I did finish the book but I found myself thinking blah blah blah just get to the end of the story so I can start another book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The way Nicholas Sparks constructed The Notebook adds to the emotional content of the story of a life-time love. Without this structure the novel would simply be a good love story, but instead he has created an way for readers to feel the emotions of those involved and not just hear their words."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The impact of this novel is amazing. When one doubts that love conquers all, they need to pick up this book and read it. Mr. Sparks has written what we all wish for, a true love forever.

Sparks captures the essence of what is important in life."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I have never cried because of a book before, but Nicholas Sparks did it. The Notebook touched all my emotions so deeply and in such a short time. When I recommend this book to others (which I do often), I tell them it is a cross between Driving Miss Daisy and Bridges of Madision County, but much richer than both. Never in my wildest dream would I believe that my favorite romance book would be written by a man."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was a recommendation by my mom, it was awesome, I could not put this book down. Highly recommend it if you want a book that pulls at your heartstrings!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"The novel by Nicholas Sparks is the best book I have ever written. It makes you realize that you should never give up. You should follow your heart which will lead the way to happiness."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I don't usually read this type of book but I was hooked when I read the first page. I laughed and cried while reading this touching account of true love."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I read this book when it was first published, back in 1999. I was traveling and needed something to read on the long plane ride home. I had never heard of Nicholas Sparks, but it was on the New York Times Bestseller list, and I bought it on a whim.I cannot remember my initial reaction to the book beyond knowing I didn't like it because it wasn't my style of story telling and the ending was terrible. Then the film was released and I was forced into watching it.Since refreshing my memory of the story's plot, I just don't understand why people are drawn to this story. The characters are mundane--unrealistic, without personality, or any appeal. The story itself, though \\"sweet\\" with the idea that a man is writing down his memories for a wife who has none, is ruined at the end. It was as if the entire story was created to simply wrench one's gut at the tragic end.My gut wrenched too, but for a different reason.If you're a serious reader, one rarely interested in beach-side fiction, and an overly sentimental \\"love story,\\" do yourself a favor and skip this book. You'll be glad that you did. There are so many other authors who are far more talented than Sparks. Each of his stories follows a similar theme to that of the Notebook, meaning he has found a formula for cashing in on people's emotions, and their lack of desire for something to read with real sustenance.If I could, I'd give this novel less than one star. I'm glad I sold my copy to someone who'd enjoy it more than I did."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"....and I do not mean to disrespect the Harlequin Books publishers -- but I cannot believe or understand the fact that this book has been on a bestseller list for as long as it has. Are people really so desperate for an easy read that they would give this book anything more than a passing glance? Is it a status thing - to be able to say that one only reads books that make it to the bestsellers' list? Thankfully, I borrowed it from a friend who hopefully also borrowed it from someone else!It is one of the silliest books I've read since high school days when Harlequin romance novels were a step up from the comic books of elementary school days! A 'bodice ripper' masquerading as 'literature'? Oh please! The book's jacket states it is a &quot;story of miracles that will stay with you forever&quot; ...hopefully not! With descriptive words like &quot;rippling muscles&quot; and the mad and wreckless abandon of the phrases &quot;he felt her hands on his back, beckoning him&quot; and &quot;when they finally joined as one, she cried aloud&quot; ... I don't know...as a reader, I was really spent. Had to take a cold shower.....Honestly, it sounds like formula writing to me....&quot;How to Write and Get PUBLISHED in THREE, that's right! THREE Easy Lessons&quot;.The one star I gave this 'novel' is to recognize &quot;a great love&quot; that the writer says was his inspiration-his wife's grandparents' lives. Perhaps when they LIVED it, it was great; however, Mr. Sparks' interpretation of that love has lowered it to a boring, sappy and very uninspiring story. While I do not trivialize the devastation of health issues on some lives, this novel just isn't worth anyone's time or money.This is just my opinion, but I really have to wonder who started the ball rolling on this story's FIVE STAR status. I did read it, so I guess I fell for it too but geesh!?! Do we see a marketing guru before us? It's all about the hype. So sad."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I'm a junior in high school, and I checked this book out because people (including my english teacher) kept gushing about it. I truly wanted to like this book. After about thirty pages, I began to feel slightly nauseated, but read the whole thing, hoping it might redeem itself. No such luck. This book is such a waste of time that I actually feel annoyed with the people who gave it good reviews. It is full of cliches, and very poorly written. It is predictable, and sappy, and unbelievable. I would have to say it's one of the worst books I've ever read. Don't waste your time!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This book is simply horrible. I hoped the story would match the warm feeling I got when I first picked up the hardcover edition and looked at the beautiful jacket. It never happened. Yes, the plot is mundane and predictable and the cliches are numerous and the dialog is shallow and unimaginative, but the overriding dissapointment for me was the consistent lack of depth in the characters. At the end of the story I still knew almost nothing about them. I found myself wondering if Mr Sparks will someday look back on this work and be embarrased, as I certainly was for him.I guess if you are one who is deeply moved by the plot, romance, dialog and characters of daytime television soap operas, this story may just satisfy you. If you don't fall into that category, I recommend you spare your time and money and save a tree by avoiding this book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I will admit that the beginning and end of this book may work pretty well in rousing some emotions, but everything inbetween is tripe. Most of it is so cliche that I actually rolled my eyes and groaned out loud. The descriptive passages throughout the middle section the book were very unimaginative and timeworn. They actually made my eyes hurt. After struggling to get to the end (which was pretty good) I couldn't supress the thought that two very different writers worked on this book. The idea behind the story was good, but too bad the author didn't hone his writing skills better before tackling it. I would never classify this as literature. It's just too poortly written."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was a book I picked up to read on the airplane coming home from a vacation. I was laughing out loud and reading excerpts to my husband because I could not believe how poorly it is written. It will not be enjoyed by any educated cosmopolitan individual. The sweetness is so forced and the characters so bland it maked me truly believe that ANYONE can get their work published. I am shocked at the acclaim this book is getting. And I thought &quot;Titanic&quot; was bad. Please save your money and find a book that might give your brain a workout."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I love the way this story is written. I couldn't imagine the kind of grief both the girl and guy go through in this, but it's great! The Notebook is a great, quick read and the best Nicholas Sparks novel to date in my opinion."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I made it as far as page 49 and then I threw the book on the floor because of cliches like the following:\\"But God, those eyes.\\" --pg 40.I cringed but read on. Then I came across another!\\"God, he looked good.\\" --pg 49My God, Sparks's writing blows!The movie was so good, it inspired me to read the book. This is one of those rare cases in which the movie is better."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"THE NOTEBOOKThe Notebook is one of the most incredible romantic books of the twenty first century. It shows the real passion for love commitment and what a real couple should look like. They show that no matter what your going through the only thing you need in your life is a compassionate person who loves and would devote their life to being with you. Someone who will be there for you who will take care of you when your sick hold you when you're sad and stick with you forever. There is an immensely big amount of love and passion flowing through Noah and Annie for each other. They are great role models for couples with relationship problem. I love the way that Noah is so understanding and gentle with everything he does and says. He's a real man who knows something's aren't all that perfect. They both love each other very much. Their memories and times together show a bond larger then life itself. A bond in which they inspire and show the real meaning of love.I think that i and just about every woman can connect to this because we all want someone to love us and be with us. NIcholas sparks has written many romantic books but i would say that the notebook is the best.Noah is a man who cares about annie and even though she's sick he still loves her.This shows gow much commitment noah has for annie. Its a fantastic book."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is a must read for anyone interested in romance and the quest for \\"true love\\". Far better than the movie, IMO, read the book and relive all the omitted parts. As Nicholas Sparks did for me, this book will be tugging and those heart strings once again. Very few authors can really pull that off to my satisfaction."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Sparks tells a story that tugs at your heart strings, and can easily be read in a day, but this could have been a real, and more interesting novel if he'd taken the time and effort to develop the heroine and expand on her motivations."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Never have I been more touched by a character in any book than by Noah. He was as real to me as my own love, and when there aren't words to express love, there is always the Notebook to refer to."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"It's a quick read but a wonderful and touching love story. This is a nice, refreshing &quot;breather&quot; and a good break from some heavier reading. Can't wait to read the next book by Nick Sparks, Message in a Bottle."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Enjoyed the book as a quick read, with a commercialized message. Suggest for someone looking for a plane trip or something like that.Heartbreaking but uplifting."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This was one of the best books I have read since THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN by Jaquelyn Mitchard, if not better. I found every line so meaningful that I was highlighting parts I didn't want to forget.It appeals to the young and the old it begins with the reunion of 2 long lost lovers who were separated by life circumstances but have not been able to forget the other.It continues happily they continue to marry and have children until the reader realizes that the story continues in a nursing home in which the wife is suffering from alzheimers disease and can't even remember her husbands name."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Picked this short story up at the Dulles airport and was in tears while waiting for my connection in St. Louis. Sweet, young love, no lurid sex, not intellectual but very emotional. Shouda, woulda, coulda provoking.... Ending brings you back to reality quickly, but nothing endures like unconditional love, be it fictional or real."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"if you have a few hours (or days, depending on your reading speed) to spare, then this is a very appropriate book. it's sappy, sweet, and in places, corny, but overall very enjoyable. this isn't a novel that will qualify for the pulitzer, but nevertheless decent."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"My friend said me to read this book and he said it was wonderful.And when I finish to read,my desicion was'it was perfect'.I cried when I was read because I'm very emotional and I find lots of things in this book.First of all their love is very effective and her position is very hard. I'm still living this book's lines.I read it three days ago but I cannot escape from it.The title of this book is meaningful,too.I fact I want to say more than these butI am sorry because my english is not enough to tell my all idea. Thank for a lot to Nicholas Sparks..."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Simply stated, it moved me to tears. I cried through the whole second half of the book. Sometime you just need a book like this to make you appreciate the meaning of love between two people."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I was shocked to hear that some readers were disappointed in Spark's book. As a lit major, I was awestruck at his ability to paint such a vivid portrait of a true love story. This is some of the best writing I've experienced. The ability to write with such fervor and grace is not a capability of many of today's contemporary authors. I immediately wanted to meet Sparks, and learn about his writing process. The fact that this is the story of his wife's parents makes the story even more intriguing and heartwarming. The novel is a labor of love for his family and a gift to the rest of us."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Absolutely loved this book. The love between Noah and Allie felt so real....so special...a once in a lifetime type of love."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I really love everything I've read by Nicholas Sparks but this is truly one of my favorites. Also loved the movie."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I first watched the movie and than check to see if there was a book. The reviews were good. There where negative dislike comments made by others. My decision was to buy the book. I am not disappointed.It is a touching love story that starts when they are teenagers and lasts into their 90's.Allie and Noah, two young people from different backgrounds and families. Separated but never forgetting when love was young and sweet and tender. After 14 years just 3 weeks before Allie is to marry another man, she finds Noah.The marry and after many happy years they are separated again, this time by a devastating disease called Alzheimer. Before she become completely lost, she and Noah write their stories in letters to each other. When her memory is gone and she no longer knows her husband and children, he reads these to her as if a story.The end scene is touching. Best friends and lovers, love that is complete mind, body, soul, and spirit. Very few find that kind of a deep love.I have seen the devastation of this disease in my own family with a much loved aunt and uncle, siblings of my mother. That is the sad part, knowing this disease.Don't base your decision about reading any book based on the negative comments left on the review by another. Anyone reading the story is free to writing their own review."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Overall, I wasn't thrilled with it being a library previosly owned book. Pages had some wear and tear, but considering the $3 I paid for it, I can't complain. Although, I only wish that it would have been posted that it was was previously owned library book, because Amazon had it listed as in good condition; when in reality it was in average condition if that. Other than that I am pleased but would have appreciated the fair warning."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"It's as good as they say. It's a good old fashioned love story. They go against all odds and come together. It's a very sweet story a must read for anyone that loves romance."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"So I just got a kindle from my boyfriend as a surprise and I wasn't really sure what books to get on it. This was the first book I picked up since I saw the movie and loved it and always wanted to read the book. To me this is the most romantic story ever written and I cried at least three times before I finished it. I think the book is even better than the movie, but the movie is perfect too. I've read a few of Nicholas Spark's books as paperbacks years back and this is the best one. The rest seem to be just trying to achieve the greatness of this book.I think everyone should have this book. I like a lot of mysteries and experimental books my independent publishers. Usually I'm not a bestseller type of girl, but the Notebook is a classic and should be read by students across the world at least for the next century. It's amazing how a book can make you feel so sad and so warm at the same time."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This is a great book and its worth reading. I let a friend borrow it and well she has not given it back because she loved it!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"I just finished reading The Notebook. Can you say endless love? I sure can and I would love the relationship that Noah and Ally had. I never saw the movie and I can't wait to see it. I must have been living under a rock.. How did this book pass me by??!! I plan on checking out other books by this author."},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks never disappoints me. I enjoyed the book better than the movie. I would recommend either one to someone! The ending is very sad, and some people who I recommended the book/movie to said that it hit too close to home for them. So be prepared with tissues!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Nicholas Sparks never disappoints me. I enjoyed the book better than the movie. I would recommend either one to someone!

They have a love many only dream of finding. A beautiful display of committment and respect!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"Hello!! I thought this book was great!! It has become my favorite book! I loved how the author went from Ali to Noah.

This was the best!!"},{"Title":"The Notebook","review":"This love lost and then found again novel is the best I have ever read.
