Includes details on T90, T80, T70, T50, New F-1 (no old F-1 refs), AE-1 Program, AE-1, A-1, Canon-brand FD lenses, Speedlite flashes of the time (199A, 188A, 166A, 533G, 577G, &amp; ML-1), and the various system and lense accessories available from Canon. It also includes a lot of basic photography chapters found in any good photography book, along with good explanations of mechanical and electronic operation. Even though most of the Canon-specific info can be found online throughout several good websites, I am very glad I have this reference since it appears to be complete and has everything in one place. Especially useful for figuring out what Canon-branded lenses and accessories are available for my old FD cameras (through used sales), and what their specs are for easy comparison.Color and B&amp;W pictures, 208 pages.

The most interesting characters are Coral Browne as herself in &quot;An Englishman Abroad&quot; and the queen in &quot;A Question of Attribution,&quot; though Burgess and Blunt are multidimensional in ways none of the talking heads are. The scene of the queen and Blunt which was played so well by Prunella Scales and Edward (or was it James?) Fox in the BBC production is brilliantly written. Bennett is, indeed, a master at writing lines that give away or seem to give away more than the character understands-or seems to understand. The audience knows best with the &quot;artless&quot; talking heads, but neither Blunt nor the audience can be quite sure if the queen has toyed with him or is as straightforward and concerned with concrete facts as she presents herself as being. &quot;Who did what?&quot; is also very much in question in the &quot;Titians&quot; Blunt is examining and in the puzzle of who was running the spies who were eventually revealed."},{"Title":"WHERE'S WALDO NOW","review":"If you have never seen a Waldo book before, here's a short overview:\\"Where's Waldo\\" series consists of unique colorful picture books where the illustrations are filled with hundreds of tiny characters doing all kinds of funny things. Your goal as a reader is to find Waldo, a guy in red and white shirt on all those pictures. If finding Waldo gets too easy then you can spend countless hours trying to find other special characters and situations. Mentally, this activity is similar to assembling a 5000 piece jigsaw puzzle, only it's more fun.One great thing about Waldo books is that even small children can spot Waldo as well or even better than adults, it doesn't require any skills other than good eyesight and ability to pick out details. This makes it fun to read together and compete with your kids of virtually all ages, not just 4-8 as the Amazon reading level suggests.Now when you know the basic idea of Waldo books but only want to get one (just one book can keep anyone busy for days!) and don't know which one to pick, \\"Where's Waldo Now\\" is definitely the best one in my opinion, being the most educational and interesting of the series. It features Waldo traveling through time from one era to another. He has to visit cavemen, ancient Rome, Vikings, Crusaders, a Middle Age European town, Aztecs, samurais, pirates, a royal court, Wild West, and finally a space colony.Definitely worth the money."},{"Title":"WHERE'S WALDO NOW","review":"If you haven't met Waldo before, he's a funny-looking cartoon fellow who appears amid busy scenes filled with other characters and objects. Although he's always out in the open and quite distinctive, finding him takes some careful looking.The new edition of Where's Waldo Now? has a great feature. Waldo has been moved in each illustration from the first edition of this book! So if you loved these illustrations before, here's your chance to enjoy them all over again.The scenes start with cave man days, and move on to ancient Egypt, ancient Rome, Viking voyages, the Crusades, the Middle Ages in Europe, Aztecs, 1600 in Japan, 1750 as a pirate, 1900 at a Paris ball, the Gold Rush, and also a future look at a space colony.Although finding Waldo is challenging enough, this fascinating volume is filled with dozens of other people and objects to seek. There are 25 Waldo watchers, each one of whom is unique to an illustration. You also get Wenda, the Wizard Whitebeard, and Odlaw in each illustration. In addition, there's a mystery character in each illustration whom you need to find on your own. (There's a clue at the end of the book if you can't figure it out.) Woof the dog appears just as a tail in each illustration. You also have Woof's bone, Wenda's camera, Wizard Whitebeard's scroll, and Odlaw's binoculars in each illustration. At the end of the book are lists of a dozen or so characters and objects to find in each specific illustration.If you haven't seen this book before, the illustrations are done across a two-page spread filled from the edges of both pages in both directions. The characters and objects are very small. You can profitably use a magnifying glass if you have trouble seeing small things. Bright light is a must! As always, the details are filled with lots of humorous situations that will keep you amused as you search for your goals.This tininess is a plus for youngsters. The objects and characters seem like they are youngster size in each case!You can also use the illustrations to teach a little world history to your youngsters.Basically, this book can provide dozens of hours of laughter and shared fun. You can obviously set up your own searches in addition to the suggested ones.After you finish seeing how hard it is to find a needle in a haystack that is out in the open, you should think about where else the object of your searches is hard to find. How about locating loyal, considerate friends whom you enjoy? Or a great job? Or an exciting hobby? Or a life-improving book?Look for the best . . . all around you!"},{"Title":"WHERE'S WALDO NOW","review":"I love Waldo and all but in this book he is located in the same position on almost every page.

I was born when this book series first started and had the distinct pleasure of being able to read it while growing up (I had the red one). This book not only provided long hours of entertainment but also introduced my personal love for history and travel. Viewing the pyramids, seeing the crusades, and much more were incredible; even though much literal history was not present.Sometime at 12 years old or so, this book became lost and I did not own one again until just this week... at 25 years old. Not surprising it made such an impact that my BA is in Anthropology with a MA to follow! I could sit there for hours viewing the multitudes of small scenes throughout the book. Not only is there a scene on a macro level but also so many interactions occurring on micro levels which is what provides the most excitement for me. The artist spent so much time in providing these points of interest.Maybe you have never seen the book before or \\"lost\\" it for 15 years like myself, this is truly a wonder. Just as exciting as ever and much more exciting than a \\"word search book.\\" You will not be disappointed.

We really enjoyed it"},{"Title":"WHERE'S WALDO NOW","review":"I love that Candlewick is releasing the entire six book series in affordable paperback editions. Plus they have included a handy little circle in the upper left of the cover, indicating where it falls in the series. This makes it really easy for parents to keep track of the editions they already have and those that are needed to complete a collection.In addition to finding Waldo on each page, of course you must also find his four close friends hiding on each page: Odlaw (Waldo spelled backwards), Wizard Whitebeard, Wenda, and Woof. Those careless travelers have dropped five precious belongings in each scene: Waldo's key, Woof's bone, Wenda's camera, Wizard Whitebeard's scroll, and Odlaw's binoculars. I find it difficult to find Woof when all you can see is his tail, so the odds of finding Waldo's key seems like an impossible feat.This edition contains a dozen scenes to hunt in. Waldo has been reading history books, so this book is put together in a time line format. The first scene is the time of cavemen, then ancient Egyptians and their pyramids, games in ancient Rome, and so on. The last scene is meant to be the future, with space cars flying around glass domed shopping structures. Even after all that hunting, there is a bit more tucked in at the end. The last two pages contain a checklist for each scene of additional random things to search for, like an insolent statue, yellow teeth, and sunbathers in peril. Truly, this book could keep you (or small children) engaged for hours on end."},{"Title":"WHERE'S WALDO NOW","review":"I purchased \\"Where's Waldo Now?\\" for my 5 year old granddaughter, but upon receipt I felt that it was too difficult for her.

It was great fun and mind-stimulating too!"},{"Title":"WHERE'S WALDO NOW","review":"I was 6 and 7 when my mom got me the first two \\"Where's Waldo\\" books. I started to look for Waldo, the check-list of things, and at the end went back to find every item he lost(Where's Waldo) and the books he lost(Where's Waldo Now). From that moment on I was immediately hooked, and they became one of my favorite book series.I thought this one was just as good as \\"Where's Waldo\\", and I loved all of the historical places he went back into time. It was fun during those countless hours of fun looking for Waldo. I recommend these series of books to anyone who is a big bookworm like me, who likes search books, and anyone who likes books of history,comedy,fun, art, a memorable character and scenes. All of the scenes are my favorite, and I love at the end how Waldo ends up in the future...that sparked my imagination so much as a kid, and it still does.It was also amazingly fun to go Medieval England,Egypt,Ancient Japan, and so many other places. The Waldos are truly amazing, and must-have's for all. The only thing I didn't like about the re-releases was the added extra characters...it makes me grateful that I still have my first editions of the first two Waldo books, so I don't have to look for the other characters in the books they didn't appear in the first place.I give it 5 stars, because \\"Where's Waldo\\" remains one of my many favorite book series, and he is one of my favorite book characters even to this day...

There is a little plastic magnifying lens tucked into the front cover in a little pocket. Once we showed her how to take it out and look for Waldo, she does it over and over again. She walks around the house with her book, finds a nice spot to sit, takes out her magnifier, looks for Waldo, then once she finds him she finds another spot to sit in and does it all over again. It's really cute!The pictures in the book are pretty tiny though, so it's a real challenge to find Waldo. It looks like they shrunk the images from the original version so they could fit them into the small book. I'm 36 (i.e. my eyes are not that bad) and I needed to use the magnifying glass in a bright room to find Waldo! The only downside to this book is if you misplace the magnifier, it's not as fun to find Waldo, but hopefully that won't happen to you."},{"Title":"WHERE'S WALDO NOW","review":"As all you Where's Waldo fans may know. there were only a very few of these books ever made.

To me, the banning of any book shows a real lack of confidence in us, as parents, and in our children. I have looked into it, and it appears that the reason \\"Where's Waldo\\" got banned was because it features adult material such as \\"topless sunbathers,\\" and other adult \\"hidden pictures.\\" I believe that these things are a necessity for our children to find, and contemplate by themselves."},{"Title":"WHERE'S WALDO NOW","review":"The samurai picture is hilarious"},{"Title":"Death had two sons,: A novel","review":"Although I read this book many, many years ago, I never forgot it.

Salome is a simple tale of complex passion. Wilde's heroine bears no resemblance to her biblical origin. His Salome is no mere instrument of Herodias, but a dangerous and passionate young woman whose thwarted affections for John the Baptist lead to a disasterous climax for all persons involved. Wilde's script is a brilliant look at deep-rooted desires and the dangers of obsession. This edition of the play is a must for anyone building their own theatrical library."},{"Title":"Salome","review":"Oscar Wilde touches here a fundamental subject in Christian lore : Salome and John the Baptist, and through them Jesus and the prophesy that he is the Messiah. It would be a perfect subject for an opera because the events are contained in too short a time and the feelings and motivations are too simple and intensely concentrated for a dramaruc play. Salome asks for John's head out of spite because she could not possess him, because he refused to acknowledge her, and also because she knows this will mean the downfall of her step-father, the killer of her own father, and the incestuous husband of her mother. So vengeance is her second motivation. Those motivations are too simple to build up the tragical force of a play, but they are so intense that they could have inspired the most dramatic and powerful music. Oscar Wilde's language is beautiful in many ways but this beauty does not give any complexity to the simpleness of the emotions and motivations. This beautiful language could have become the carrier of a beautiful music. Actually we can hear the music of a Scarlatti, or of a Purcell behind the words, maybe even a Haendel. But as a play it is a little bit flat and without enough depth to build a beautiful performance. As a matter of fact the centrepiece of the play, the dance of the seven veils, is not a dramatic event but a visual and musical event. And we cannot in anyway escape the recollection of the fantastic little black and white film by Clive Barker on the subject. Salome is worth more than just a dramatic play. She can only find her full strength when music and dancing come into the picture, when it is fully visual and musical.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan"},{"Title":"Salome","review":"This is written in French, not English!

My only criticism is that the type is rather small, but then again I'm getting older!All in all, wonderful addition to any home library."},{"Title":"Salome","review":"Originally written in French, when Oscar Wilde was in exile in Paris, after his time in prison for having had an affair with young Alfred Douglas, alias Bosie, the future Lord Alfred Bruce Douglas (poet, author, critic and correspondent, 1870-1945), then translated by Lord Alfred Douglas, a translation that is in some editions attributed to Oscar Wilde himself. In spite of his perfect bilingualism, Oscar Wilde let a few English mistakes slip into his French text but that is minor and even attractively exotic. It is difficult to really say if the English version is Wilde's or Lord Alfred Douglas's. But the first thing we can say about this play is that the theme itself is symbolical of Oscar Wilde and his time. Oscar Wilde somewhere is John the Baptist and that metaphor is easy. We will try to go a lot farther in a while. But it is also typical of the time, the very beginning of the 20th century. A time when all the princes and princesses, queens and kings, lords and barons, bankers and industrialists were dancing on a floor thickly littered with bank notes. But a time too when people were dying in the bush in South Africa, or all kinds of natives were suffering under the whip of colonialism. It was a time of hypocrisy in which those who wanted to be truthful to themselves, their beliefs, and at times their gods, be they God himself, or herself, the working class or artistic creation, were running against the thick wall of absolute lack of understanding, of mediocrity and bigotry. It was the time when exploitation was an understatement for what was happening in the mines or the factories of the industrialized countries. It was the time when all kinds of fundamentalist ethics were imposed on the world: hemp was banned from our fields because of the competition its leaves represented to tobacco and the empire that was behind. Absinth was banned for no reason at all, except that it was a heavy competition against wine or other alcoholic beverages that represented big industrial and financial interests. All kinds of sexual abnormality was condemned and persecuted in Great Britain, though France was slightly more liberal. This society was qualified as Victorian, though it was reviving the deep roots of puritan England, the heritage of the old Commonwealth of Oliver Cromwell. Puritanism was one of the fundamental characteristic of this time, with tantalizers and teetotalers and other torturous and tortuous social devices. It was the time of Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, the time of Dorian Gray in Wilde's own imagination. It was a time when well behaved people did not call a spade a spade, did not even call a spade anything at all because well behaved people had no commerce with that thing and had no word for that thing. It was the time of what was to be illustrated later as Lady Chatterley's lover or Maurice, or so many other intrigues and affairs crossing social classes, the acme of criminal activity in Great Britain at the time. And it is that drama Oscar Wilde lives in Salome. The fact that her society rejects the seer, the prophet, the announcer of the future, the liberator, and at the same time does not have the courage to execute him. And in this society she is the daughter of the Queen and step daughter and niece of the present King who imprisoned and put to death his brother, her father, the former king, and remarried his sister in law, Salome's mother, and by being all that, in two words a female Hamlet, she represents the upheaval which will bring the end of that rotten society. She falls in love with the imprisoned prophet, not because he is a lovable man in any way, not because she feels any sentimental attachment to him, but just because she is fascinated by the negation of her society he carries in himself, in his eyes and his body and his voice in a first ternary grouping of vision, doom and apocalypse, and then with his body and his hair and his mouth in a second grouping of sensual flesh, snakes and kissable lips, rebuilding like that the number of Solomon beyond the Christian trinity, the Jew beyond the Christian saint, the flesh of carnal life beyond the vision of the de-carnalized Christian trinity. And Oscar Wilde pushes this very metaphor to the extreme of transforming Salome from a sensual, sensitive and possessive lover into a vengeful, inflexible and purely animal executioner. Since John did not want to kiss her, she will have his head delivered to her on a silver platter just for the pleasure of kissing it, and, to her dismay, finding out that there is no pleasure in kissing a dead mouth and a dead tongue. The dance of the seven veils she paid for that head, that kiss, was of no avail since it did not deliver the sensual pleasure she was expecting in her foolish blindness. And the step father will have her slain by a plain soldier, like an unimportant piece of trash that has to be discarded and disposed of now she has brought the end of this world into being. How could Oscar Wilde be more visionary and see better the catastrophe of the big war, and all that will follow, being brought up in the future by the soul-less enjoyment of material goods and pleasures, wines and dances that are felling not only the tree that could hide the forest, but the forest itself that could have been hidden by the tree of a prophet, since a voice is only prophetic when you bring it to a dead end, the dead end of its own sacrifice, execution, martyrdom.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"},{"Title":"Salome","review":"At this inexpensive price this much sought for and cherished book deserves a space on your trophy-book shelf.

It sounds rather dated and is very abridged, but it's interesting nonetheless."},{"Title":"Creation in the Old Testament (Issues in Religion and Theology)","review":"This is by far the best book for anyone who wishes to examine the creation texts in the Old Testament and many of the things scholars have said about them. It is an anthology of scholarly writings, from old Hermann Gunkel (1895) to 1983, when the book was published. The other authors are Bernhard W. Anderson, Gerhard von Rad, Walter Eichrodt, Dennis J. McCarthy, S.J., Claus Westermann, H. H. Schmid, Hans-Jurgen Hermisson, and George M. Landes.As is well known, the interpretation of creation has long been affected by scientific publications, the most spectacular being Darwin's &quot;Origin of Species&quot; in 1859. However, in the world of ancient scholarship, there were also major developments. One was the translation of the old Babylonian creation story, the Enuma Elish (found in 1853), published in 1876. A second was the Canaanite literature found at Ras Shamra in 1929, containing the Baal epic. There is other literature as well.The parallels of the Enuma Elish with the first creation story in Genesis (1:1-2:4a) became too evident to ignore, and Gunkel's groundbreaking work (1895) provides many references. Here we are introduced to &quot;Chaoskampf,&quot; the mythological divine battle with chaos, the result of which is the world we live in.In his excellent article on the Chaoskampf divine battle imagery in ancient Hebrew poetry, Dennis McCarthy, S. J. (1967, rev. 1983), argues that they relates to the establishment of social and political order, rather than creation, despite the creation imagery. McCarthy accepts a common view that creation refers to a vast, long ago, cosmic event.Is this common view of creation in the Bible correct? I don't think so. One must decide what a creation text is, not just our own conception (Butterfield's Whig conception of history), but in history. Creation texts certainly include stories (there are four major creation stories in the OT, Gen. 1:1-2:4a; 2:4b-24; Prov. 8:22-31, and finally, the Chaoskampf type, found in scattered passages such as Pss, 74:12-17, 89:9-14; Isa. 51:9-10). But, there are also many texts containing creation images, themes, doctrines, and words. This vastly increases the number of creation texts, most of which are NOT in creation stories. Anderson himself considers many of the texts McCarthy dealt with as belonging to the Mosaic Covenant tradition's conception of the 'creation of a people', mentioned below.As John L. McKenzie, S.J., has long argued, it would appear that the dominant presentation of creation is not an event, but as a continuing process. The great historian of Church doctrines, Jaroslav Pelikan has also pointed out that creation as a continuing process has a long history in the Bible and the Christian churches, noting especially Ps. 104.One of the most influential interpretations was that of the great Gerhard von Rad (1936), who, looking at Yahweh as Creator and Redeemer, decided that the latter was primary and first. This idea infected scholarship for decades, including such excellent works as philosopher Donald W. Evans' &quot;The Logic of Self-Involvment&quot; a wonderful source for texts.There are a number of arguments against von Rad on this. As McKenzie pointed out many years ago, there are no strata in Hebrew literature without creation elements. Indeed, the cultures of the ancient Middle East, from which the ancient Hebrews came, were full of creation theologies. H. H. Schmid (1973) forcefully argues in an article included in the volume, creation theology is the &quot;broad horizon&quot; of all biblical theology. Hans-Jurgen Hermisson (1978) shows that theology in the Wisdom literature is creation theology.My own argument is simply that redemption presupposes creation: you can't save something that hasn't been created.Anderson's Introduction to the anthology is not terribly well written, but it finally puts some order into much diverse material. For this alone the book would deserve a top rating. Anderson divides the material under five headings, corresponding to different traditions (these are not all the same as JEDP). I shall indicate the traditon, along with some texts, in brackets:1. Creation of a People (Mosaic Covenant tradition, i.e. Dt. 32:6b)2. Creation and Order (Royal or Davidic Covenant tradition, i.e. Ps. 89:9-14)3. Creation and Creaturely Dependence (Wisdom Tradition, i.e. Ps. 104)4. Creation and Origination (Priestly tradition, i.e. Gen. 1:1-2:4a)5. Creation and New Creation (Prophetic Traditon, chiefly Second Isaiah, i.e Isa. 42:5-9, Ps. 51:10-12)These traditions are not mutually exclusive, and indeed, Second Isaiah unites them, in effect, making redemption as a mode of creation. Neither do these divisions cover every creation text, but they do make the whole subject much more intelligible.As for modern controversies, it can be seen that the ancient authors were not interested in either prehistory or in a modern concept like evolution. The first creation story is quite evidently a counterstatement to the Babylonian &quot;Enuma Elish&quot; and similar stories, for example. The texts primarily addressed the concerns of their times. As human beings, we can also find meaning in these texts, but there is no point in creating oppositions where there are none.In my own opinion, the notion of creation as an event is religiously irrelevant, as it has nothing to do with our lives. Continuing creation, however, can be given many dimensions in our personal lives, in mystical contemplation, in social and political affairs, in in struggles for liberation, and in ecology.Anderson's anthology provides a great opportunity to gain a more comprehensive view of the great variety of creation themes in the Old Testament. The limitation to the OT is not as severe as it might seem, as the New Testament added mainly a Christological dimension to the majaor themes. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Business Of Love (Arabesque)","review":"&quot;The Business of Love&quot; was a good book. Maya Woodson was involved in her deceased father's business of running a hotel chain along with her father's partner, Jerome Newman. Jerome was not only a partner, but Maya considered Jerome as family, her mentor, whom she thought of as her second father.Trajan Matthews is hired to help Maya and Jerome publicize the Pharaoh Hotel Corporation chain in other cities. Maya and Trajan get off to a bad start, each getting the wrong impression of the other. However, their feelings gradually change from dislike to love for each other while working in the business together.Angela Winters has combined suspense with romance in the form of what is originally thought to be one murder, but turns out to be several murders.Maya's life is changed dramatically not only with meeting and working with Trajan, but with the murder of an elderly friend, Elaine, who lived in the hotel. Maya is not satisfied with the way the case is going, so she becomes involved in finding the murderer. Maya's searching takes her onto a path that is unbelievable to Maya and when the truth is displayed to Maya, she still has trouble accepting it.Trajan's friend he grew up with in the neighborhood, George, is now a detective and is working on Elaine's case. George and Trajan renew their relationship. Tre (Trajan) at first cannot think of anything except business and keeping the image he has managed to make for himself since escaping his original life of poverty. However, when he becomes involved with Maya, he realizes that there is more to life than money. He has developed feelings of love, support, and protection for Maya.Maya and Tre's relationship is steamy, but eventually, they both have to face their true feelings for each other.&quot;The Business of Love&quot; is a good book and the suspense will keep the reader turning the pages to see how the story eventually end. Also, the relationship between Maya and Tre will keep the reader enthralled."},{"Title":"The Business Of Love (Arabesque)","review":"I still don't quite understand why Arabesque/BET still publishes books with 250 pages. It seems the authors are forced to include so much territority in such a short length of time. Well, based on the 250 pages that I read of this suspense romance story by Angela Winters, I enjoyed it very much.The plot: I enjoyed the combination of the private owned company deciding to go public with its stock. Although it seemed at times throughout this book, the authors' technical details of the business dynamics was over-bearing. But upon completion of the story, I appreciated the through work because it gave me a better perspective. The major characters: Maya Woodson and Trajan &quot;Tre&quot; Matthews, I thought they definitely matched well especially for the overall plot itself. The hard driven career oriented man Trajan really works the nerves and patience of Maya.The minor characters: I loved George, the police-officer who is the good friend of Trajan and the significant role he plays for always providing the right advice he gives to both Tre and Maya. George, Alisa and even Jerome all enhance this story so well with the major characters.If you don't mind dealing with the technical parts about the world of stocks, which takes up alot of space in this story, you will be able to deal with the developing sparks and relationship between Maya and Tre; solve the murder that takes place; figure out who-done-it and why? and finally the after-math of it all. You should enjoy this book, hey it's a short read and has some interesting twists."},{"Title":"The Business Of Love (Arabesque)","review":"Ok, I really liked this story. It had mystery, passion, and a love out of this world. Trajan and Maya are crazy together. In the beginning, I was wondering how these two people are going to fall in love with each other! I for one personally liked Trajan's name. But I must say at times during the novel it was hard to follow. But overall it was an enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"The Business Of Love (Arabesque)","review":"Maya Woodson was trying to find out who killed an elderly woman who lived in the hotel she owned. Never in a million years did she think finding the woman's killer would reveal the truth about her own father's death. Maya worked with her father's partner in getting the company to go public. Along with that she had to work with the handsome Trajan Matthews. Maya despised this man.Trajan came up poor. His mother loved him, but all she had for him was love. Trajan decided he would make something of himself and leave the neighborhood he grew up in and never look back. He was a successful investor relations expert. He thought he had everything he needed until he met Maya.After the inital denial of being attracted to her, he gave into his feelings. I think this book could have been longer. It seems something was kind of missing.

These two were meant to be, although Maya, the heroine, fought it the most.

They had nothing in common for one and the 98% of the book focused on the crime or the IPO or something else.Even when the author tried to insert some conversations between the two heroes, it was fight after fight- or in the rare cases when they don't fight, they keep quiet (eg: not exchanging a word after they made love twice only to start fighting as soon as they start talking).What a very tiring book! The beginning was boring, there were a lot of technical terms that can be hard if you are not familiar with all the business jargon. Half way it was still ok but once I figured out who the murderer was I didn't really care about what happened afterwards.I wanted to give 1 as rating but since the mystery part was interesting I gave it 2. I really expected a lot of romance. I've read other Arabesque books in which the authors blended in the mystery well with the romance. Here I feel like she wanted to add too many elements and got lost in the way of doing so.I was disappointed by this book but I think I will give the author another try however not soon in the future."},{"Title":"The Business Of Love (Arabesque)","review":"This story about Maya and Trajan was pretty good, although it could have been longer.

I will not say it was love at first sight but there were sparks.Trying to find out who murdered her friend in her hotel suite reveals some hidden issues of not only the murder victim and her family but also Maya's family.There were some unanswered questions with this book.

Did medieval towns stink? Did 17th century clothes itch? Unfortunately we don't know the answer to any of these curious questions, David Lowenthal points out in his book Possessed by the Past, because no one at the time felt such commonplaces worth recording (114). Heritage, however, has become all too commonplace, at the expense of history, Lowenthal chides in his follow-up volume to the sometimes praised, often controversial The Past is a Foreign Country.Many of Lowenthal's arguments are intriguing. He explains that heritage now pervades modern society, especially in the West. He contends that heritage to many is escapist, permitting a person to hold on to something more stable in an uncertain world and often sentiments towards that stability override substantial concerns. Technophobia nurtures heritage and its growth reflects fears of a menacing future (10-11). Possessed by the Past shows that heritage, like history, faces continuous shifting attitudes and reinterpretations. Commemoration has transferred from personal to collective, elite to popular subjects (63). For instance, statues worldwide pay homage to the anonymous fallen, such as the tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery, rather than generals and admirals. Formerly taboo to come from a commoner background, these days such lineage has morphed to the chic (16).While discussing the upsurge of heritage nowadays, Lowenthal at times contradicts himself. The first chapter describes a current \\"heritage glut,\\" saying that archivists, specifically, keep everything, which causes chaos by making \\"augmented heritage\\" less accessible and \\"suffocatingly unmanageable\\" (12). Later in the book he seems to advocate saving everything and encourages an emotional attachment to the items saved to make them more meaningful for heirs, saying, \\"self-regard supplants intergenerational generosity (52).In an underlying disagreeable tone, Lowenthal asserts that heritage is the antithesis of history, but unfortunately it takes him until Chapter five to concretely define heritage, though the book focuses on the word from its first page. At that point, he muses that heritage is \\"a declaration of faith in that past\\" (121). Heritage to him \\"uses historical traces and tells historical tales,\\" but \\"exaggerates and omits, candidly invents and frankly forgets, and thrives on ignorance and error\\" (121). Succinctly, what counts in heritage \\"is not checkable fact but credulous allegiance,\\" while history's chief hallmark is testable truth (120-121). His arguments would be more easily understood and interpreted had he made the reader know how he defined heritage from the very beginning.Group solidarity is innate to forming and fostering heritage; Lowenthal ruminates in his conclusion (248). Heritage in his eyes builds collective pride and purpose (249). However, in the first chapter of the volume he expressly states that heritage is self-defeating, that loving things too much destroys them (27). So, in essence, heritage brings people together to destroy what they love. In the vernacular of many a student in today's age, Lowenthal concludes through the pages of Possessed by the Past: \\"Heritage bites, but dude, at least it brings people together once in a while.\\""},{"Title":"POSSESSED BY THE PAST: The Heritage Crusade and the Spoils of History","review":"I first became interested in the issue of heritage during the preparations for the centennial of flight of the Wrights brothers celebrated in 2003. This book explores the rise of commemorations and heritage, and what it portends for the serious study of history. In one form or another commemorations of important historical events have been with us since humans have counted time. Always serving several objectives at once, in the United States these have often taken the form of publicly-recognized national holidays that enhance civic pride and national unity. The Fourth of July, Memorial Day, Veteran's Day, and the like are official commemorations designed explicitly to serve the decidedly nationalistic purpose of forging and reinforcing the cohesiveness of a people within a common memory. Memory of the past reigns supreme in such commemorations, it represents the personification of what David Lowenthal calls \\"heritage.\\" His definition of heritage, and its relationship to history, is instructive: \\"History is the past that actually happened, heritage a partisan perversion, the past manipulated for some present aim\\" (p. 102)As Lowenthal comments, the differences between this heritage--essentially what we choose to remember about the past, what some have called the \\"digested past\\"--and the unrecoverable past that is never truly knowable at all because of the inexactitude with which historians are able to discover it, sets up an enormous difficulty for historians involved in public commemoration. Heritage provides the glue that holds together the group in an instable world. Like a predator stalking weak members of a herd dissension seems to range freely over the landscape, and in a multicultural nation such as the United States the cacophony of competing ideas and issues, priorities and prerogatives thrive. Heritage, of course, helps to forge a unique identity that is real and powerful and all-encompassing, and in the processing helps define ourselves and our nation.As a nation, Americans seem enthralled with their past and deploy it at every opportunity to achieve benefits defined differently by different groups and times. Those may range from lofty principles identifiable as such by all too crass economic motives to sinister objectives based on self-regarding chauvinism and hatred of other groups. In such a climate commemorations of historical events become the tools, or perhaps weapons, used in contorting historical truth to the ends of the group supervising the commemoration. This is, at a fundamental level, the concern that Lowenthal voices throughout \\"Possessed by the Past.\\" Such activities, he warns, falsify history by succumbing to \\"chauvinist, shallow, vulgar, commercial, and mendacious perversions\\" (p. 104). As he puts it, history \\"differs from heritage not, as people generally supposed, in telling the truth, but in trying to do so despite being aware that truth is a chameleon and its chroniclers fallible beings. The most crucial distinction is that truth in heritage commits us to some present creed; truth in history is a flawed effort to understand the past on its own terms\\" (p. 119).In \\"Possessed by the Past\\" Lowenthal ranges from special commemorations to the battle over Disney's \\"Historyland,\\" the frenzied search for Elvis memorabilia, the challenges of Colonial Williamsburg, the lack of historical understanding displayed in the animated Disney film \\"Pocahontas,\\" and a host of other skirmishes in the heritage wars of the 1990s. He notes that these activities pose a threat to historical understanding. \\"Such acts,\\" he insists, \\"undeniably deform history for heritage aims; and heritage is further corrupted by being popularized, commoditized, and politicized\\" (p. 87).At sum, Lowenthal can see no middle ground in what he contends is, as his subtitle notes, \\"the heritage crusade and the spoils of history.\\" History as a discipline and a body of knowledge arrived at through a distinct methodology must hold a line that ensures its credibility as it faces an onslaught from popularizers, pundits, politicians, and partnerships that seek to use it for their own ends. He believes that the heritage industry is less interested in reality and verifiable concepts than in popular recreations that capture \\"the spirit of the age.\\" So while history and heritage are intertwined Lowenthal does not see them as the same thing and those differences need to be made clear to all and guarded carefully in the future.\\"Possessed by the Past\\" is a powerfully evocative book that sounds an alarm for the historical profession. At times, however, I found it infuriating, even as I found it always provocative and reflective. Lowenthal has a rather bitter perspective on the history/heritage debate. No doubt that is the result of wounds suffered in numerous battles. I am sympathetic to that situation, having experienced a few myself, but sometimes he displays his own sullenness too aggressively. For example, his \\"pox on both your houses\\" commentary is over the top. \\"To bolster heritage faith with historical scholarship, as is now the fashion, smudges the line between fact and faith,\\" he writes, and \\"to embrace heritage as history cedes it a credence it neither asks for nor deserves\\" (p. 250). I believe that withdrawal from the field of battle into the proverbial ivory towers of academia does not represent a strategy for success in combating the \\"heritage movement\\" in the United States. Engagement, and offering course corrections for heritage efforts, is the only appropriate answer. To do otherwise ensures victory for those who would use history inappropriately for their own ends."},{"Title":"Red River Requiem","review":"I enjoyed \\"Red River Requiem\\" very much.

I sort of wanted to shake Mrs. Oliver and Poirot and ask them how they could be so obtuse and not realize the solution. The quirks our beloved Poirot typically display are all gone here; all that is left is rather dry prose and a mystery that should have been shortened by about sixty pages. Having said all of that, it does make for a quick read that does not require much thinking.

Personally, I enjoyed this book. Christies narrative is top notch and the solution to the mystery is neatly tied up and intuitive. I tought Christie did an excellent job of taking the reader from point A to point B and all the way to the end. Little clues were dropped along the way, as well as a few blind turns.

This book proves a theory though; there's a significant change in Mrs. Christies writing over the years; the nice young lady who writes well-puzzled, crafted, formula, to-the-point murder mystery; and the old lady who's slightly bitter to the modern world, but writes more real and cozy books, about peoples lives. More relaxed and less upthight books. This book falls into the latter category. That doesn't mean it' a bad book, no-no! It's good, but different from earlier works.

Never did she worry about the real reasons for that dramatic event, until today when she stands on the verge of getting married to Desmond Burton-Cox. Only one question suddenly seems of importance: Who killed whom, Celia's father or mother? Reason enough for Ariadne Oliver, Celia's godmother, to pay a visit to her old friend Hercule Poirot. The famous sleuth persuades Mrs. Oliver to delve -with his guidance, of course- into the past, to find the persons who are like elephants, the persons who will still remember the important details about this all-but-forgotten tragedy.Elephants Can Remember is Agatha Christie's next to last work of detection and the author shows clearly signs of age, which is understandable since she was eighty-two years old and in failing health.Elephants Can Remember is a \\"murder in retrospect\\" mystery. Although Christie has proven to fully master this format -see Sparkling Cyanide and Five Little Pigs- she now quickly looses touch with the story. She is forced to sow the narrative together with vague memories of a series of old spinsters and suddenly even events that should easily be remembered are covered by the veil of forgetfulness. No surprise that the plot is total confusion. It is less a mystery than a scrapbook of memories. Action is less important than atmosphere, which makes the story quite tedious and difficult to hang on to. Nevertheless, the experienced reader will figure out the solution to this not too mysterious mystery halfway through the book."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember - Book Club Edition (BCE)","review":"This must be the worst Agatha Christie book ever. It's her very last Hercule Poirot novel, and one can see that the writer is very old by now (82). There is no freshness left in her prose; it is stale, predictable, corny, and generally trashy. As other reviewers have said, the material contained here would barely be enough to sustain a short story. To make a full-length novel out of this really is ridiculous. The book fails at what normally is Agatha Christie's greatest strength: the plot and the denouement. With dozens of pages left to go, the reader *knows* the solution! Unheard of in the world of Christie; if for nothing else, then for this the novel cannot be rated higher than 1 star. However, the characters and dialogs are boring and cliche-ridden as well, so the book has no redeeming qualities either. Nothing ever happens on the 200 pages of this book; no crime, no mystery, no real conflict among characters; it's all just endlessly boring talk, talk, and nothing but talk about the past. The only interesting thing, perhaps, is to contemplate the autobiographical hints Christie gives us in describing one of the novel's detectives, Ariadne Oliver -- a mystery writer. But these hints are only interesting because they throw light on our favourite writer, Agatha Christie -- they are not interesting in themselves and therefore do not improve the book's literary quality. It was excruciating to have to wade through the turgid prose of this book; this title cannot be recommended to anyone except extreme Christie enthusiasts."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember - Book Club Edition (BCE)","review":"\\"Elephants Can Remember\\" does not read like a typical Hercule Poirot mystery. Agatha Christie's famed detective is drawn into an old case by his friend, the amateur sleuth and mystery writer Ariadne Oliver. The case involves what was apparently the double suicide of a loving husband and wife, and the concern that these past actions might have left a horrible impact upon their children.The story switches between the findings of Ariadne Oliver and Hercule Poirot as they each go in search of 'elephants' who might remember what happened around the time of the accident, because after all, an elephant never forgets. While there is no definite evidence as to what happened, there are those who have never accepted the double suicide theory because they couldn't answer the question why. But with Poirot and Mrs. Oliver working together, a long-unspoken truth is certain to be uncovered.\\"Elephants Can Remember\\" is classic Agatha Christie, in terms of mystery. It's central mystery has a unique, if perhaps a little predictable, twist, the denouement of which is quite evenly paced and satisfactory. However, this might be one novel where the time period of the plot is more glaring than others. The prose is heavy-handed at times and one does get a little sick of all the mentions of 'elephants'. The characters are borderline two-dimensional and, therefore, the reader does not care about them, even if they are still interested in the mystery at hand."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember - Book Club Edition (BCE)","review":"I know Christie was pretty old when she wrote this book, so it pains me to be so negative, but her age really does show. The story isn't interesting, the mystery isn't mysterious and the characters are paper-thin -- even Poirot seems like a shadow of his usual self. The exception is Ariadne Oliver, who gets a remarkable amount of development for someone who ostensibly is just a side character. This is her final appearance in a Poirot mystery, and she gets an excellent send-off. The same cannot be said for Poirot. This is the final Poirot novel that Christie wrote, though not the final one that was published, since she wrote his real finale years earlier and set it aside to be published after her death. I haven't read it yet because I cannot bear to, so I'm saving it to be the last new Christie book I ever read. I just hope it's superior to this one!In this one, Poirot and Mrs. Oliver are trying to figure out what happened to the parents of one of Mrs. Oliver's god children. They were found shot to death in the woods, but what happened? Did the father shoot the mother or vice versa? Was it a suicide pact? Mrs. Oliver is asked to investigate by a woman she meets at a luncheon, then proceeds to go about interviewing a lot of people she hasn't seen in many years, to ask questions about what was happening in the family, to try and put the pieces together with Poirot, who is busy talking to the police. It's quite similar toFive Little Pigs (Also published as Murder In Retrospect), another Poirot murder in retrospect. The difference is that you'll be able to spot the solution to this one miles off, as I was. I can now say that about only three of her books (Peril at End House: A Hercule Poirot Mystery (Agatha Christie Collection)andThe Mirror Crack'd (Miss Marple Mysteries)being the other two) and sadly, it doesn't make for a very interesting read. More annoying still is that in this book, a character writes to Poirot and tells him that in order to solve the mystery, he should find and interview person X, because she might be able to help them with the truth. And so after pages and pages of wasted time, Poirot finds and interviews X, and she KNOWS THE ENTIRE EXPLANATION TO THE MYSTERY. She is flown to England, she tells her story and then the mystery is solved. So tell me again why Poirot and Mrs. Oliver were even needed?! That guy could've talked to this character himself anytime he liked! Christie also employs a method I've seen her resort to in just one other book -- she has Poirot, the master detective . . . hire a detective! In lieu of actually writing plot development, she settles for pages of exposition as a man shows up and tells Poirot all the details he needs to know about a specific character. And she later turns out to have no bearing on the mystery whatsoever, so the entire interlude was a colossal waste of time. Normally I'd decry this as a lazy author's way to get out of writing an additional chapter of action, but in Christie's case I'm charitable enough to substitute the word \\"lazy\\" with the word \\"elderly,\\" which makes the choice understandable if not forgivable.On the whole, I have to admit that I wouldn't even recommend this book to a die-hard Christie fan. But if you're dead set and determined to read everything she ever wrote, then go for it. I am too, so I can sympathize. Just be prepared to be bored and let down big time by this one. It's just not up to Christie's usual standards. Luckily, she wrote enough phenomenal, classic stories to be sure that her legacy would remain in tact regardless of what she published, and all Christie newbies can rest assured: it gets a heck of a lot better than this."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember - Book Club Edition (BCE)","review":"I am a huge fan of Agatha Christie, but this mystery was lacking. I figured out whodunnit about halfway through the novel, but thought to myself, &quot;No...it can't be so-and-so! That would be too obvious.&quot; Well, guess what. It was. It was still a good read because I enjoy Ms. Christie's writing style and interactions between characters. If the mystery itself is not the only important part, then it's a worthwhile book."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember - Book Club Edition (BCE)","review":"Inspite of a good character analysis and settings, this book falls much much below the usual standard of A.C. The plot especially is a BIG let-down and the climax falls flat. That even A.C should resort to such predictable wool-over-the-eye is amazing. The structure is very little different from Five Little Pigs - if Elephants Can Remember then Pigs can recall much better!"},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember - Book Club Edition (BCE)","review":"It could have been solved in half the time. But it is not, and to appreciate or understand this novel, readers must place it in the proper context.The problem was at first vague; Ariadne Oliver was asked by a stranger if the mother of Ariadne's goddaughter killed the father, or was it vice-versa. The deaths were actually some twenty years or more before. As the stranger was the mother to a man who was contemplating marriage to Ariadne's goddaughter, she could be partially forgiven for her apparent concern. Of course one of the things Ariadne did was to call on Hercule Poirot, and together they embarked on elephant-chase to pry for secrets from the past.&quot;Elephants can remember&quot; was published in 1972, that is 52 years after the first Poirot novel &quot;The Mysterious Affairs at Styles&quot;. Many people did not even live that long. Agatha Christie aged her characters along with the years, and therefore there were cases that were different from bodies being found all over the place.Other similar novels before this whereby Christie's detectives investigate deaths long in the past included Dumb Witness, Five Little Pigs, Mrs McGinty's Dead, Ordeal By Innocence, and Nemesis. The common theme among them was that the investigator(s) had to depend on memories of various people who might not even be present; but from their recollections, clues were found to provide either the definitive picture of the culprits or the definitive picture of the crime. What a lot of impatient readers would find irritating was having to sift through the useful information from the useless. Elephants is such another tale.Mystery veterans would probably have been able to jump to the solution before Poirot's grand finale, but would they have been able to unravel the threads in the manner necessary? Proofs have to be gathered, and evidence, motivation, etc were all the necessary persuasions for Elephants before they would give up their secrets.The meat and drink of this novel is more than solving the mystery of who killed who, but to recapture the atmosphere, the mood, the aura of that time in the past, and to be able to put events in their proper perspectives. Also no less important was Poirot's being able to relate the past (in its correct perspective) and its impact on the present in order for persuade the elephants to give up their secrets."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember - Book Club Edition (BCE)","review":"This novel written in the twilight of Dame Agatha's long and illustrious career (1972) would have been better left on the cutting room floor. It was especially painful for me to read because I not long ago re-read her vibrant, lively and completely mystifying \\"Murder at the Vicarage\\" which was written in 1927. The comparison was depressing.Hercule Poirot is teamed with Mrs. Oliver, a crime novelist, to find the truth of a 15-20 year old murder/suicide. Mrs. Oliver's goddaughter, Celia is the daughter of the couple who supposedly entered this pact. For the first one-half of the book, we are not advanced an inch in any direction. Many people are interviewed (the \\"elephants\\" of the title) and most have vague memories of the couple, as does Mrs. Oliver herself. Mrs. O's dithering is not artlessly charming, for we are as confused as she. Saddest cut of all, the red herrings are not \\"herrings\\" at all. They are giant signposts. Rather than Poirot gracefully unraveling the mystery on the last page, the reader has left him in the dust 50 pages ago. The prose has a distinctly purplish hue.According to the publisher, \\"Elephants Can Remember\\" was originally published as \\"Five Little Pigs.\\" I do not recommend this book, because it does not do Dame Agatha justice. There are 75 titles to choose that will far better reflect her abilities and why she earned the title \\"Queen of Crime.\\""},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember - Book Club Edition (BCE)","review":"Whose work are we actually reading at this point? There were major differences in punctuation, word choices, and scene breaks between the original Collins and Dodd Mead editions of this novel. There were further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket. There are further additions still in the recent Signet, Berkley, and Leventhal and Black editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. Here the publishers at Collins, dissatisfied with their own earlier efforts, put still more distance between author and public with a \\"New Ed\\" edition. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now?

The officer who had been in charge of the case, a wig stylist, two French governesses, and a family friend each remember some piece of information that Poirot can collect and assemble as he uncovers secrets long buried and brings the truth to light.This is Mrs. Oliver's final appearance in a Christie novel and also the last Poirot book Agatha Christie wrote, although readers will see him again in &quot;Curtain&quot; which she wrote during the 1940's but was not published until 1975."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember - Book Club Edition (BCE)","review":"Will not buy any more harrper books because of thier partnership with Chic fil a.

The plot line involves a murder mystery that happened in the past. Much of the novel is devoted to unraveling what happened through conversations with various people who knew the people involved. There is so much repetitiveness as the chatty Ms Oliver talks to all those people, hashes things out in her mind, then tells Poirot what she was told, then he hashes things in his own mind, then he tells others, ... Uh! The same \\"fact\\" or \\"theory\\" is repeated in many places, to the point of insulting the reader's intelligence. This is so unlike Christie where every word had its purpose. Perhaps one better think of this novel as a study of human memory. Overall I give it 2.5 stars."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember - Book Club Edition (BCE)","review":"Elephants Can Remember is Dame Christie's last Poiret full-length story according to most sources and written when the author was clearly playing the back nine. This is one of the few detective novels that even I could figure out who had done it and most of the methods long before the Belgian detective assembled the remaining characters at the scene of the crime.Some will say this is Christie's weakest product. I have not read them all so I will not make that judgement but it clearly suffers from a worn out plot and formulaic proceedings. We all know that elephants are claimed in nursery rhymes to never forget but this seems to be a revelation to Poiret and the aging writer Miss Oliver. As Christie's alter-ego, Miss Oliver is suffering the foibles of age, including total inability to recall anything or anyone, and stress over shortcomings in one's career, such as writer's block, and fear of crowds and public speaking.In a clever construct, both Poiret and Miss Oliver set out simultaneously to determine the relevant facts in a decade-old case of murder, suicide, or accidental death. Poiret warns all at the on-set that nothing good will come from this painstaking re-enactment but it seems there are always some things that daughters and odious in-laws need to know. Unfortunately for Miss Christie's reputation, she relies on a tired method of including twins in the mix so we all can see where this is going, especially when it becomes clear that the late husband had been in love with both twins."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember - Book Club Edition (BCE)","review":"Hugh Fraser is the perfect narrator for Agatha Christie books. Hercule Poirot and Ariadne Oliver banter back and forth and it is a delight to listen to this story. It kept me riveted from start to finish."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember - Book Club Edition (BCE)","review":"It was with a certain sense of sadness that I read \\"Elephants Can Remember\\", knowing that it was the last book Agatha Christie ever wrote that featured the beloved characters of Hercule Poirot and Ariadne Oliver. Of course, there isCurtain, which stars Poirot and takes us to the end of his career as a detective, but this had been written several years prior in order to give Poirot a proper send-off and published after Christie's death.So this, for all intents and purposes, is one of the last Poirot mysteries, and certainly the last appearance of Ariadne Oliver, the mystery novelist that Christie often used as a self-insert to convey her own experiences and frustrations as an author. These would range from Ariadne's irritation with her literary protagonist (as Christie similarly held toward Poirot), to her habit of eating apples while she worked, to her bemusement at certain readers who would write to her in order to point out her mistakes. Here, she expresses her awkwardness concerning fans that gush excessively over her work.At a literary lunch Ariadne is approached by a compete stranger and asked a question about a godchild she hasn't seen in years. The woman who introduces herself as Mrs Burton-Cox asked Ariadne an incredibly personal question concerning her god-daughter Celia Ravenscroft's deceased parents: was it Celia's mother who killed her father, or Celia's father who killed her mother? It takes a while for Ariadne to remember the circumstances that she's referring to, but finally recalls that Alistair and Margaret Ravenscroft were found shot dead near their house, in such a way that made it impossible for the police to tell whether it was a double suicide or a murder/suicide.Ariadne discovers that Mrs Burton-Cox's son is engaged to be married to Celia Ravenscroft, and suspects that his mother is trying to form a wedge between the two of them by insinuating that Celia may have inherited murderous impulses from one of her parents. But Ariadne seeks out her god-daughter's permission to investigate the deaths further, and wanting to know more about her parents' demise, Celia agrees. Naturally, it is to Hercule Poirot that Ariadne turns, and together the two of them go on the hunt for \\"elephants.\\"The witnesses are all elderly now, and it all happened so long ago, but Ariadne has faith in the \\"elephants\\" of the old saying; and Poirot agrees, believing that even little details and false assumptions may prove valuable. Together the two of them try to piece together the mystery of the past, in a book that relies heavily on oral testimony and the memories of those present.As a book written near the end of Christie's life, it's clear that she's slowing down. \\"Elephants Can Remember\\" has a few recycled concepts, several flat characters, and is one of only two of her books (thus far) in which I've been able to guess the conclusion far in advance. And trust me, if I can guess it, anyone can! There are lots of meandering speeches, some inconsistencies regarding the time-line, and many obvious details are held back simply because they would telegraph the ending too soon. Finally, solving the case has less to do with deduction than it does with finding the person who knew what happened all along.Yet there's a lingering presence of melancholy present that makes the story more important for its context than its content. Christie knew that she was nearing the end of her life when she wrote it, and so there's an emphasis on lost love, putting the past to rest, and young couples looking forward to the future with hope. Likewise, the fact that Christie may have been in the first stages of Alzheimer's disease brings certain bittersweetness to the fact that the novel relies so heavily on the importance of memory.It's rather sad to read, but impossible to dismiss if you are lasting fan of the author, especially since it's clear that Christie was getting ready to say goodbye."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember - Book Club Edition (BCE)","review":"It is quite obvious, early on in this book, that the author was advanced in years. The math is off, so badly, and so often, whenever the subject of years comes up: how many years ago did it happen? How old is so-and-so now? etc. Also, the only character who remains essentially himself is Poirot, pretty much; Ariadne Oliver, though only supposedly middle-aged here, is more muddled than most eighty-year-olds I know. Even the victims' ages: 60 and 35? Pretty unusual, that. If the wife/victim were only 35, why was she so worried about her advancing age?So, if the reader can get past all the muddle, it is still an entertaining read, IF, as I say, the reader is a die-hard fan. I am, so it was worth it to me.PARTIAL SPOILER ALERT: Christie's denouement of the crime is about as unrealistic as it can get. She really hearkens back to very early Christie, in her inability to understand, much less handle, romantic love in any sort of realistic manner."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember - Book Club Edition (BCE)","review":"I re-read this one recently, as it was one of the first Christie novels I read as a teen. Something about it had always stuck in my mind. It is interesting re-reading all her novels now and especially interesting to see the reviews of this one.Funnily enough I agree that it has several weaknesses and the fact that this is a \\"later Christie\\" shows. There are some points (a couple of children mentioned that I thought would at least be interviewed are only mentioned, no present-day action etc) that make this book compare unfavourably to her better ones. Also, Poirot doesn't quite sound like himself in this one and if Ariadne Oliver irritates you, you may want to pass anyway!Having said that, there is something quite melancholy and haunting about the ultimate resolution.

Mrs. Oliver was quite shocked by the rudeness of the encounter and troubled about what to do about it so she contacted her friend, Hercule Poirot, for guidance in the matter. Soon the pair, each in their own unique way, begin to tackle the problems, re-establishing contact with Celia, investigating the old tragedy and finding out just why Mrs. Burton-Cox is so insistance on knowing the answer.For fans of Ariadne Oliver this is a particular treat, giving the reader more information into her (and perhaps Christie's) personal life, than any previous stories. It is interesting to see Oliver's and Poirot's different approaches to investigation, even to the point of different interpretations of what the actual problem is.This is not the cleverest mystery that Christie ever wrote, nor even the best written but it is a very enjoyable one none the less and is a definite must read for any Poirot or Oliver fan."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember - Book Club Edition (BCE)","review":"Christie books never disappoint.

First, there is a marked lack of action of any kind. Elephants Can Remember is concerned with an investigation into deaths that happened entirely in the past. Therefore, the whole book consists of conversations. There is never any danger or threat to anyone living, so there is no element of \\"excitement\\" as in most of Christie's other books.The second weakness that I would point out is that the solution of the mystery, as it were, becomes fairly apparent to the reader about mid-way through; the rest of the time is spent waiting for Hercule Poirot's amazing gray cells to figure it out and catch up to what the reader/listener already knows. The third weakness is that the solution to the mystery involved actions that I found entirely unbelievable. I won't expand any further than that so as to not spoil the story for anyone who hasn't yet read it, but Christie had a couple of characters behave in ways that were quite reprehensible, but that is never called into question.

When I was thinking of getting a Conure, I bought one book, it told me SO little, then I bought another, same stuff said, in a different form, THEN I found this book, and that made me deicide on a Sun Conure, I would recommend it to people who are considering getting a bird the most, it tells you what might happen if you get a Conure, it doesn't try to mask the fact that Conures are VERY high need birds, if there is anything wrong with it is that the author doesn't seem to call a bird a he or a she, its weird, but WHO(???) cares, sometimes when I write I make it them problems, and it is understood, so that didn't bother me, but I had to find at least 1 thing wrong with it, and that was all I could think of!Hope this helps!!!"},{"Title":"The Conure: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet","review":"When I bought this book, I also purchased Conure books by Anne Watkins and Matthew Vriends. GUIDE TO CONURE is not the best of the three, in my opinion. However, that said, if this is the book you can find then get it and use it. The book is a hard back whereas the others are soft covered books (if that matters), and Rach covers all the basics regarding food, shelter, health issues, etc. In fact, you could use much of the material in her book for any bird's care. She also includes a nice section on the various types of Conures and sections on Conure health that cover issues of concern to this species in particular as well as things to beware of if your Conure is a \\"free-flight\\" bird.Rach includes a nice long section on cage selection as does Watkins. If you haven't given much thought to the cage you should. Conures can be messy birds and you want to buy something big enough to house your guy made of a substance he can't dismantle that is relatively easy to clean. This means you must think about the cage in terms of space considerations and weight. When the FedEX guy delivered my conure's cage he accused me of ruining his health. There are great cages available, but you should consider the cost of the cage and it's accessories when you buy your bird. Rach's book will help you reflect on these and other issues"},{"Title":"The Conure: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet","review":"This book is an A to Z guide to the happy life of all sorts of Conures. From cages to diseases, a new owner can read about the day to day encounters that a conure faces and how to properly deal with such problems or situations."},{"Title":"The Conure: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet","review":"This is a great intro to Conures for people who are thinking of adopting one. It gives a write up on 25 different species of Conures. It gives a nice over view of what Conure species might be right for you by mentioning noise levels and habits like prone to chewing or feather plucking. It is pretty good in mentioning the responsibilites that come with bird ownership. I think this is important for everyone to know before getting a bird of any kind! The book did get into all kinds of care items to from medical to feeding to grooming and even some tricks & games training.My favorite part was learning that some Conures will actually sleep on their backs in their food dishes! (HAHA) Other good tips included how to administer meds if you have a sick bird. It gave me some good basic tips.Things I didn't agree with is not kissing your bird on it's beak and feeding it some low-fat dairy (I don't give my birds any dairy) but to be fair the book did say only a tiny bit because they lack the enzymes to digest dairy. As for the beak thing, I understand the point about human siliva being bad for birds but I certainly don't slobber on my birds!Overall, I would recommend reading this book if you are thinking of getting a Conure, you just got a Conure and you need to know what to do, or you have one and just can't get enough info on them. It is somewhat basic for any of you that are already experience bird owners though.Note: Consider visiting a local bird rescue if you are considering a pet bird!"},{"Title":"The Conure: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet","review":"The book was rather vague.

It covers most of the major topics that are important for terrorism today. The contributors to the volume are generally experts in the field. To its credit the book does not focus overly much on either the Middle East or Islam; it considers other types of terrorism in other geographical regions. The book is nicely balanced in this regard."},{"Title":"Root Causes of Terrorism: Myths, Reality and Ways Forward","review":"What this well written academic book does, is that it gives the reader insight into the broad spectrum of the phenomena of terrorism and the theories behind its roots causes--utilizing several international academics whom incorporate, overall, sound methodologies that support and challenge various terrorism theories that have emerged over the last several decades. The only negative critique I propose is that its contributing scholars are predominantly liberal in orientation (which is not necessarily inaccurate in and of itself)--but the contributions of such leading American experts, the likes of Brian Jenkins and Bruce Hoffman, are missing."},{"Title":"Speak What We Feel (Not What We Ought to Say): Reflections on Literature and Faith","review":"I recently got this book out of the library in order to teach a poem on Gerard Manley Hopkins, one of the writers Buechner discusses in the text. I was astonished at Buechner's incredible diction, phrasing, and word pictures. I had not read anything else of his before, but now I want to buy this book! His writing has an incredibly mysitcal quality, which he uses to broaden our knowledge of ability to enjoy four notable authors, while showcasing his own unique vision and humility. The book is moving and gritty - it put me in tears on several occasions, and I do not cry easily. If you are at all a fan of Hopkins, Twain, Chesterton, or Shakeapeare you must read this book!"},{"Title":"Speak What We Feel (Not What We Ought to Say): Reflections on Literature and Faith","review":"In this book, Buechner describes the lives and discusses some of the literary works of four well-known writers.Each of the four has incorporated into his writing clues to some of the lessons learnt from the harsh realities of life. Buechner has always been a strong advocate of \\"telling it like it is\\", in contrast to a tendency in parts of the Christian Church to \\"say what we ought to say\\".If you're looking for a writer who's prepared to face up to the sometimes very difficult aspects of life, but who maintains an active faith, this book (and Buechner's other books as well) should prove richly rewarding.Strongly recommended!"},{"Title":"Speak What We Feel (Not What We Ought to Say): Reflections on Literature and Faith","review":"If you love Fredrick Buechner's writing, and you love literature in more than just an analytical (though he is wonderful at that too) way... then this book is for you.It changed my life, my perspective on literature and story and writing (and I'm a literature and theology major). It is a beautiful and moving piece of writing, like all his works."},{"Title":"Speak What We Feel (Not What We Ought to Say): Reflections on Literature and Faith","review":"I've read this book a couple times over, picking it up when I'm looking for something enjoyable to re-read. Chapter by chapter, Buechner takes four writers and their stories (Gerard Manley Hopkins' later sonnets, Mark Twain'sThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, G.K. Chesterton'sThe Man Who Was Thursday, and William Shakespeare'sKing Lear) and weaves a discussion around their lives and works, showing how part of the lasting value of these stories comes from the way in which the authors spoke out of the dark parts of their lives.I highly recommend this book as a life-giving reflection on the challenges of life and literature."},{"Title":"Unlocking the Secrets of Successful Women in Business (Unlocking the Secrets Series)","review":"Every once in a while we find a book that is well-meaning, has lots of good information, but was written by consultants who were just a bit too commercial. It's obvious that Anna Wildermuth wants to help you with your appearance and Linda Brakefall wants to help you with your empowerment, professionalism, and effectiveness. Their addresses, phone numbers, and e-mail addresses are easy-too easy for this reviewer-to find in the book. OK, let's get past the commercial and the authors introducing themselves at the beginning of the book. Let's get into the meat.The book is organized into 26 Keys for success. Each key is a chapter with text written by the authors and a wide range of guest columnists-cameo appearances, if you will, by people with expertise in the subject matter. These contributions, in a smaller type size, are a bit of a stopper as you read the book, but build a sort of sense of community. Hmmm. Stopper. Like a speed bump or a curve in the road.Actually, the whole book is designed with curves and speed bumps that slow the reader's pace so more can be absorbed. The pages are filled with tips and quizzes and quotes and questions to answer. Quite a bit to absorb-like the authors mixed a stew and threw everything in that would add to the &quot;body.&quot; The &quot;body&quot; of this book is loaded. It's a potpourri of information and advice about being taken seriously, rising to the top, charm and charisma, personal and professional style, approachability, color, clothing, business travel, image, and working with your shape. You will find helpful information on business make-up, hair and grooming, business etiquette, interviewing for a job, presentation skills, and public speaking.The authors cover a wide range of topics, though I'm not sure that I agree with all they suggest. Being a man, I asked a couple of businesswomen to look at this book with me so I could be sure to be fair. Their response included words like &quot;inconsistent,&quot; &quot;unprofessional,&quot; and &quot;very basic.&quot;There's a section in the back of the book offering resources for additional learning. By category, you will find what I believe are book titles and authors. There is insufficient detail for those who might want to access additional information, but readers could use search engines on the world wide web to do their research.The authors are, no doubt, fine professionals in their fields. Unfortunately, while it offers valuable content, this book is not as professional as it could be. Advertisements at the end of every chapter is a bit much. The publishing of this book was managed by The Jenkins Group, says a statement on the back cover. They should have been more deeply involved to keep this stew from becoming stone soup."},{"Title":"Unlocking the Secrets of Successful Women in Business (Unlocking the Secrets Series)","review":"Collaboratively written by experienced business woman and public speaker Linda Breakeall and certified professional image consultant Anna Wildermuth, Unlocking The Secrets Of Successful Women In Business is a thoroughly &quot;reader friendly&quot; how-to, self-help guide written especially for women seeking to develop an effective and successful business career for themselves.

The majority of his work, dating from the early 30s to the mid 1950s, is ironically ignored inverse proportion to the degree his conclusions are proven accurate.The beauty of this seventy-one page book, however, is the egoless nature of it all. A mental giant and world traveler, J.A.

That James Halliday endorsed this effort in his foreword to this work,by itself, convinced me of its worth and objectivity.It provides an essential reference and updated guide to data and critical reviews of any part of the world where wine making now takes place. It provides an insight into how this industry has become a part of the new worldwide economy and how winemakers now share and exchange their talents, skills and technological expertise. The old regional snobberies are now proven irrelevant with new and greater quality wines emerging across the planet.Many of the old and false paradigms of both price and quality are now being shattered, and all oenophiles,whether new or highly experienced,need to continuously update their education to merely keep pace with new technologies,changes in market preferences,and newly-emerging sources of excellence in winemaking.I, for one, want my knowledge of wines to exceed the partial perspectives of one major wine rating(and price affecting) magazine interested in selling advertising and peddling cigars,indulging Hollywood and pseudo-society snobbery than objectivity; I also want to transcend the petty regional favoritisms whether it be Francophiles,Californians,the local state wine board,chamber of commerce or whoever.Many reviewers and periodicals show this in subtle ways by their condescending recognition of &quot;emerging&quot;sources of quality wine (but infer&quot;--but they ain't there quite yet.&quot;).Countries like Chile and New Zealand have moved quite beyond Great wines are now made across the world;it's time our publications recognize this."},{"Title":"The Global Encyclopedia of Wine","review":"This book is a treasure, and it lives up to its name as a global resource for wine. The book comes with a CD that is quite good, is organzed in a rational way, and designed for ease of access. The bright, clear, glossy photos in the book are truly exceptional, and they are suggestive of an attractive coffee table book. But behind the pictures is a throughly researched book. Essentially, you get a graduate level course on wine in 900 pages of readable prose. Of course everything about wine is about taste, and as tastes vary, so do opinions. The book has 36 contributors, so the reader enjoys a variety of views as well as a variety of writing styles. While most of the book is organized geographically, there is an excellent opening chapter titled \\"The World of Wine,\\" which will tell you more than you ever thought you'd ever know about the winemaker's craft. Then follows the geographic chapters, where the jumping off point, appropriately enough, is France. By the time our journey is ended, we have met all of the wines of the world face to face. Well, not all, actually. The index omits many wines that are popular in their own backyards, but have yet to make in impact in the global marketplace. But overall, you cannot be disappointed with editor Peter Forrestal's monumental book. You'll be delighted by the book's complexity, balance, and clarity."},{"Title":"The Global Encyclopedia of Wine","review":"I have always enjoyed drinking wine but I have never had the necessarybackground and information about how to distinguish a good wine from a badone, which are the most famous wine regions in the world and what are themost famous wine denominations. That was before my friend gave me this bookas a gift and I must say it was exactly what I needed.It helped me understand about the different types of grapes and wines,their specific characteristics, how to taste a wine, which wines are to beconsumed younger and which ones are to be left for aging. I also found outabout the influence of the soil on the vine's growing, the harvest time foreach type of wine, etc.I think this book is a good start for someone who would like to beinitiated in the amazing world of wines and also for those who already knowwell wines.This book is very detailed and discusses every wine region of the world(Europe, South Africa, Australia, new Zealand, South America, etc.),mentioning its wine producers, the history of the area, the climate and incertain parts it also gives suggestions about specific food that can becombined with the wine of the area.Regions like France, South Africa, Germany, USA, Australia, are verydetailed presented, with maps and informations about every single producerin the area. If you want to take a vacation and visit some wine areas, thisbook is everything you need.Unfortunately, regions like Eastern Europe don't offer so muchinformation, despite the fact that they have a big potential, but are nothistorically so well known.This is not something to read once and then put it aside. It is meant tobe kept within easy reach and read from it every time you taste a new wineand want to find more about its origin and history. Knowing all thesethings, it will make you understand better its personality and perhaps youwill enjoy it more.I'm sure you will like the experience of reading from this book."},{"Title":"The Global Encyclopedia of Wine","review":"The fact is unbelievable to most, and maybe a little consternating to some, but every spot on the globe that calls itself a state has some bastion of wine making. Most get little to zero print. There is a world of wine out there. It's at 6,000 feet on a perched periphery surrounding Mexico City. It's rooted in common ground at Tel Aviv and Beirut. It sustains in the heat of arid East Africa. Wine is a shared international trait without a single abstention. \\"Wine is rooted in history, and it has a dynamic relationship to both those cultures who have drunk it for a millennia and those who have enjoyed it for less than 100 years,\\" writes Steve Charters MW, in THE GLOBAL ENCYCLOPEDIA OF WINE, a new book now offered to North America by The Wine Appreciation Guild, and a work that is stunning in scope. GLOBAL touches on every wine-producing region on earth, something no one has ever had the temerity to try. The book doesn't stop there, it takes the reader back to the supposed accidental discovery of wine in Europe, into the vineyards of the old missions of the New World, and finally to the sterile gray of the modern lab.Sound impossible? Editor Peter Forrestal convinced 36 of the world's best wine minds from Europe, the U.S., Australia, Canada and New Zealand to pick up their collective pens and put the wine world down on paper. The book is a massive accomplishment and a most comprehensive and fascinating experience. GLOBAL is a pleasure to wrap your head around.In GLOBAL's line up of wine authors, the U.S. is well represented by author and journalist Rebecca Chapa, Catherine Fallis MS, the fifth woman in the world to earn the title Master Sommelier, and Dr. Patrick Farrell MW, one of only a handful of masters of wine in the U.S.The regional section of the book delineates the major wine producers and their history, the respective regional wine making methods and the distinction of each wine unique to the winemaker and the climatic character of the region. A complete and concise colored map accompanies most regions. National and regional wine laws are reviewed in detail. A \`Wine Reference Table', 100 pages of select wines from each country, their flavorful qualities, and a pairing of wines to complimentary food, and a glossary of wine jargon fill out the final pages of the book."},{"Title":"The Global Encyclopedia of Wine","review":"There are currently several major wine reference books available in the English language. Originally, there were the definitive Schoonmaker Encyclopedia of Wine and the entertaining Encyclopedia of Wines and Spirits by Alexis Lichine. These were the reliable wine reference books 20-30 years ago. Then there were the beautiful World Atlas of Wine by Hugh Johnson and the Oxford Companion to Wine by Jancis Robinson., These were the standards 10-20 years ago. NOW THERE IS THE GLOBAL ENCYCLOPEDIA OF WINE which eclipses them all! Current, timely and with 33 diverse authors all respected in their fields. Complete with full color photos and maps as well as reliable wine ratings. This is the one book that can replace many wine books in your wine book collection."},{"Title":"The Global Encyclopedia of Wine","review":"We purchased this book on recommendation from a friend and have fallen in love with it. Many similar books into our search, this one provides plentiful beautiful and illustrative pictures to accompany well-written and knowledgeable prose. This combination and organization allows me to quickly introduce myself to a new wine or region, but also then spend more time to gain a greater insight should the need or desire arise. I would definitely highly recommend it!!"},{"Title":"The Global Encyclopedia of Wine","review":"The fact is unbelievable to most, and maybe a little consternating to some, but every spot on the globe that calls itself a state has some bastion of wine making. Most get little to zero print. There is a world of wine out there. It's at 6,000 feet on a perched periphery surrounding Mexico City. It's rooted in common ground at Tel Aviv and Beirut. It sustains in the heat of arid East Africa. Wine is a shared international trait without a single abstention. \\"Wine is rooted in history, and it has a dynamic relationship to both those cultures who have drunk it for a millennia and those who have enjoyed it for less than 100 years,\\" writes Steve Charters MW, in THE GLOBAL ENCYCLOPEDIA OF WINE, a new book now offered to North America by The Wine Appreciation Guild, and a work that is stunning in scope. GLOBAL touches on every wine-producing region on earth, something no one has ever had the temerity to try. The book doesn't stop there, it takes the reader back to the supposed accidental discovery of wine in Europe, into the vineyards of the old missions of the New World, and finally to the sterile gray of the modern lab.Sound impossible?

The accompanying CD is more or less useless as a wine guide or a wine record. The text is illegible. Very frustrating to work with."},{"Title":"The People of Providence: A Housing Estate and Some of Its Inhabitants","review":"An incredible insight into the lives of some very ordinary working class people living in a South London housing estate the late seventies and early eighties. A series of around 40 interviews of people living in conditions which are difficult for much of &quot;Middle England&quot; to believe, let alone understand. The histories of these people, from the desperate and depressed (&quot;An end sixteen floors below&quot;) to those delighted to be given the opportunities to live a life (&quot;Love it, this little place&quot;), are enough to make the reader cry and laugh, depending on the interview.The way Tony Parker gets people to talk is incredible, and the unwinding of the people's lives over the series of interviews is both awful and totally compelling.In an age where docu-soaps are all the rage on television, this book should still be in print. The written word acts a deeper record of the lives of these people than any screen could ever do, and the stories told are sufficient to deeply move the reader.Anyone serious about understanding the behaviour of people in the UK, and the problems that the working (and not-working) classes face, must read this book. Whether Left-wing or Right-wing in outlook, the reader will be challenged and encouraged by this portrait of urban life in the latter half of the twentieth century"},{"Title":"Recovering From Rape","review":"This book provided statistics and stories of rape. It does not provide positive steps for recovery. It states that you should visualize the rape in a way so that you are in control. This is not helpful at all.The book also states that you should not forgive. Horrible Advice.Forgiveness is about giving the judgement & condemnation of the rapist to God. Forgiveness is letting go of your hatred even though the rapist did something terribly wrong to you. Forgiveness frees you from the person who raped you. If you hold on to your anger you are a prisoner of your anger and remain linked to your rapist.I do not recommend this book at all."},{"Title":"Recovering From Rape","review":"Rape is one of those many real things in the life of humans that shatter good old time notions like \\"God never gives you more than you can handle\\" or \\"Everything happens for a reason\\", implying a \\"good\\" reason if we're bright enough to learn from it. What's to be gained from such an experience as rape? Just punishment? A sense of satisfaction for the rest of us because it didn't happen to us? Support for the notion \\"God works in mysterious ways\\"? Such adolescent ideas are one of the many reasons rape victims are further humiliated as made clear by this author.Having encountered a woman who suffered rape I realized this was something I knew nothing about. As a male raised in a pre-60s atmosphere where respect for women was still taught to boys by parents - not by absent parents allowing Emenim to do the teaching - rape was too foreign for me to comprehend. In addition the advantages ambulance-chasing lawyers and fanatic feminists have taken by inventing rape victims made me suspicious of some claims made, including the now infamous assertion that all human males are born rapists and murderers. This author defines even \\"undress you looks\\" and catcalls as \\"small rapes\\". Thus not only reducing those who have been truly raped, but losing credibility by such ridiculous claims. Are we to believe that 1 in 4 women will be raped? Naturally, if definitions become as flimsy as those purported in this book then anything is rape so numbers become stratospheric. How can we know? By the time the author has made this reference the critical reader is long pondering agendas.Human males are not generally born evil, but some become that way. By the numbers such males are fabulously rare, but they exist and perhaps more than most suspect. Like a single CFC responsible for the destruction of countless ozone molecules, a single rapist can cause irreconcilable damage to many and, as this book clarifies, to more than the rape victim. Which is not to take priority from the one most in need of assistance. That assistance comes in two forms - understanding and justice. The text goes some distance in directing how to assist understanding and warns about the typical response - \\"it's the victims fault\\". She is right about rape myths maintaining views of social order. Humans embrace what makes us comfortable, regardless of truth. It's clear to anyone with a brain that rape is not a crime of passion but rather one of violence and the author makes this clear for those who don't already know it.This book shows the rest of us what rape is like from numerous examples of modern women facing Medieval minds on the matter, painting the event on the inside of our skull. Once done, anger clouds our view but the author does, finally, keep us on track to recovery and not for us but for the survivor. Despite indicting males through sweeping generalizations this book is likely to assist those in need, hopefully without additional damage by the author's personal axe to grind.One day, when America becomes wise enough to intelligently combat evil at home, not simply abroad, one hopes this evil will undergo its own campaign of eradication. Violent boys, inadequate and inferior, may need counseling but they respond to threats from their own quiver. The threat of certain execution through lethal injection for rapes with DNA evidence, proven in a court of law might go far in containing homeland terrorists and remove parasites less than animals from society."},{"Title":"Recovering From Rape","review":"With respects to significant others, friends and family, this book covers a sufficient beginnings on what a victim may need for understanding. A victim? I'll have to sign-on under that category for what happened a long time ago. When I was in recovery counseling, individual and group, this book helped me to leap into higher levels of coping skills. When I was healing, I was hunting for genuine helpful knowledge under every rock and around every aisle. I didn't need alphabet-soup authors who published nonsense, empty hypothesis, trying to impress their awed students. I needed help.Linda Ledray, Dr. Ledray knows the subject matter, rape recovery. She knows the will that we victims whisper inside--the one that wants for a better level in life, perhaps a happy one. GO FOR IT! This book is not a panacea. If you are a victim, there will always be more issues on your hunt, like there was with mine. We are individuals, each experience is different.I am back today, to purchase a third copy of this book. A young woman is going through the early stages of recovery. She's remembering the monsters and is plenty on the: &quot;Why me?&quot; &quot;What did I do to...&quot; She could use a little solid matter to peruse. I'm just a friend. My best choice was to shut my thoughts and get her this book. It was the best book resource among my hunt.God bless you, all and all who care. Having your personality crunched-down and your soul invaded is not a matter to take lightly for a woman or a man or a boy or a girl or an infant. Dr. Ledray will cover that. Maybe someday, the law will reflect realistic trial proceedures and sentences. IN the end, God will always know the tally."},{"Title":"Recovering From Rape","review":"I bought this book after my first assault and am now re-reading it for a 3rd time, having been raped again. It is a GREAT book for the &quot;basics&quot;. On the survivor's side, Dr. Ledray reminds you that you are not alone and you are not going crazy. She discusses the steps in everything from complete denial to going to court to STD's. For the secondary victim's (signifigant others), this book is not going to tell you everything that you want to know, but it can at least get you moving in the right direction.Dr. Ledray does know survivors and that may be why she comes across as a &quot;fear all men&quot; kind of woman. But what she is truly expressing is that most survivors fear all men.When I met my fiance, one year after my first rape, he had never known anyone who had been raped before. I kept asking him to read the book, because I couldn't explain to him what I needed or make him understand how I felt. About 3 months before my second rape, he read the book and he and I both saw a change in our relationship. After I came home from the hospital, he didn't ask why I felt a certain way or why I couldn't let it go. He had some sense of how I felt and how traumatizing it was for me.Just don't buy this book to be the &quot;fix&quot; for everything. It's not, but it is a step in the right direction."},{"Title":"Recovering From Rape","review":"I bought this book shortly after I was sexually assaulted by a stranger last year. It has helped me greatly and also my new partner who did not know me at the time of the attack as he was able to read all the sections for 'the significant other'.It provides good, hands on advice on how to take control of your life again. I suffered from terrible depression after the attack and this book provided lots of tips on how to get through this. My only reservations about the book are that it is for an American audience, (I think a British version coudl be written) and the descriptions of other cases I found too upsetting shortly after the attack.On the whole though, an excellent book and I have recommended to all people I have met who have had a similar experience to mine."},{"Title":"Recovering From Rape","review":"My girlfriend is a rape victim and I was looking for a book that could help me help her, understand her, without me going insane--it's very tough :(I kind of liked the book (that's why 3 stars), but it lacks information that focuses on &quot;friends, family and loved ones.&quot; Granted, each little topic has a small section for such people, but it's not enough.If you're looking for an [I'm the partner of a rape victim and want to know what to do and how to react from a psychological, intimate, and love/affection point of view] book, then this one is clearly not what you're looking for."},{"Title":"Recovering From Rape","review":"As a clinical psychologist working in a college counseling center, I often recommend this book to clients who have been victims of rape/sexual assault. It provides excellent educational material, including a review of rape myths, information on typical effects of a rape (very useful for helping survivors feel they are not alone), and much more. Plus, Ledray takes her readers through the legal process of prosecuting a rapist in a step-by-step fashion. A final valuable addition is the inclusion of guidelines for significant others at the end of every chapter. My only caveat is that this book focuses on stranger rape rather than the much more prevalent date rape, but despite this, it is an extremely valuable resource."},{"Title":"Recovering From Rape","review":"This book is an excellent choice for survivors, friends and family, and professionals going through the recovery process. It goes step by step through the recovery process for both the survivor and his/her family and friends. I actually first read this book in a course on Violence Against Women. I later found out that it is also used in the Sexual Assualt program at the Women's Crisis Center I work at. Now that I have taken the position as Sexual Assault Advocate, I will continue to use it in my work and reccommend it to my clients."},{"Title":"Recovering From Rape","review":"This book was one of the first I read after my rape a little over 2 years ago. I read this book in one day and handed it to my boyfriend to read it. It really helped me understand what I was going through and why. My boyfriend, at the time, was able to read it and was bale to further understand my anger, guilt-- all of the feelings that I was dealing with. Although one cannot fully understand those feelings unless you have gone through it yourself; this book does help family members, friends, and lovers understand as much as they can. I really recommend this book especially if you were recently raped. Please, also remember though that just reading a book and not seeking therapy will not help you recover fully. Seeking help from a person with experience in rape and sexual assault will help as well as reading, journaling, and speaking to friends and family."},{"Title":"Recovering From Rape","review":"I am Victim's Advocate at a domestic violence and sexual assault crisis center, and I am also a survivor of sexual assault. I read this book as part of my training in 1994, and I use it frequently to help my clients. When I read the book, it seemed that the author was writing about me! It made me understand many feelings I had as a child, teenager, and adult, and it made me feel more \\"normal\\".It has helped so many of my clients to work through their feelings as victims and to help them become survivors. The simple language and order of the chapters allows them to start anywhere in the book, put the book down for a while to process their feelings, and pick it back up when they are ready to continue. I order several copies of this book every year so I can let clients take a copy of the book home with them. This allows them to move at their own speed. Sometimes we read the book together in counseling if their feelings are too overwhelming to process by themselves.

But the immigrants in &quot;Two Cities&quot; have nothing to do with the United States. They are exiled from Lvov, an ancient Polish town incorporated to the Soviet Union as a result of World War II, and sent to the post-German city of Gliwice in southern Poland. Everything that comes from Lvov or reminds them of Lvov is sacred while everything else is worthless. A child growing in the dual world of imaginary Lvov and real Gliwice has trouble finding his identity. He returns to the past, examines and questions the drama of the war, and struggles to reconcile his life with the semi-imaginative world that surrounds him.

But experience tells him that it isn't going to be easy to find a woman who's going to want to settle down and have children right away. Until he meets Peta. She's just come off a very disastrous relationship; she'd been lied to in the most awful way. She wants desperately to have a family of her own, and is willing to grab the first decent guy and go for it. The chemistry between Matt and Peta is electric right from the start. Matt convinces Peta that he's really a great catch and that they should give this a go. Once married, they find that life is wonderful. They have so much in common, and not just in the bedroom. Matt's been in love with Peta from the moment he seen her. He hopes that his love will be enough and that someday she may return that love. But when tragedy strikes, Matt's love isn't enough.Man Talk is a series of HP's written mostly from the male point of view. The beginning of the book was actually quite witty and fun, but once the marriage took off, real emotions started to play. Ms. Darcy sucked me right in on this one. I almost hated Peta for her behaviour, but was satisfied with the way Ms. Darcy redeemed her and made it all wonderful again!

The young women speak from their own voice and experience as they share uncommon events like cancer, birth defects, surgery, and organ transplant. They talk about the life changing events of going to a new school, being in foster care, living with disabled family members, divorce, and the death of a parent. Above it all, they dream, they help others, and they want to make the world a better place. And after reading their stories, I'm sure they will.

When Mary cried at the tomb, I cried with her, and when she saw Jesus, her joy was so real, that I felt like I was right there with her, seeing Him and believing that He was raised from the dead, just as He had promised.

I was going to read it for a book talk/paper thingy....but since it dwells upon relgion, and i just got a new LA teacher in the middle/near end of the school year, i went with another H.G Wells book. (this book is so captivating though, there is no way im gonna stop reading it) This means that im not finished with it...but i want to encourage anyone who stumbles across this book to pick it up. (i'll do a much better review when im done with the book, never fear)Alright, so like i said, this book is based upon religion. At first i was cautious at buying this...because it does deal with the christian god, and i myself follow no religion. And personally, i didnt want to get stuck reading a bunch of stuff that i have already deemed irrelevant and end up wasting my money. Nothing of the sorts has happened, and let me tell you why.1) i had faith in Wells. I wouldnt call myself a huge science fiction fan and i certainly do not take to most book well. The style in which he writes is just....breath taking, i love it, if thats a strong enough word.2) I decided to buy this book, because i do believe Wells wasnt a 100% christian. He believed in the christian god, but he had his own viewpoints, which i very much wanted to see.3) the convos had in the story are....truly insightful. Many a times have the same thoughts run through my head, have i argued with myself, and only to return emptyhanded. No matter which side you take on the story, the arguements are supported to the fullest. Its like sitting down to a meal that feeds your eternal hunger. Not much in this world can satisfy that hunger.4)When i started reading this, i tried to keep an open mind...just because i dont believe in a god does not mean there is nothing worthwhile in this book. If people never review their beliefs and try to understand the other viewpoint, they are just as ignorant as the next.4) alright, i know i really didnt do well in this review, but please, if the thoughts of life have ever trickled through your mind, grab this book: i can assure you that regrets you'll have none, i know i didnt.and i'll leave off with a quote (which was very hard to choose...theres so many of them....i write down page numbers as i read, just so i can go back and reread some of them...)&quot;It is a commonplace of pietistic works that natural things are perfect things, and that the whole world of life, if it were not for the sinfulness of man, would be perfect. Paley, you will remember, Sir Eliphaz, in his 'Evidences of Christianity,' for which we have both suffered, declares that this earth is manifestly made for the happiness of the sentient beings living thereon.

Nothing strange there - lots of music books are written by fans. The difference is that Nester - also a New York poet - takes his fandom seriously; he considers it a suitable topic for poetry. And why not? Post-baby-boomers tend to define themselves by their cultural affiliations - whether you like the Smiths or System of a Down, pop taste articulates your personality, your stance towards the world. Nester's prose poems - one for every Queen song - go well beyond the traditional tribute. They explore the odd, obsessive mindset of the fan, the curious distance and closeness he feels towards his chosen object. The poems are madly associative in the Beat tradition but also toy with a pedantic scholarly bent, particularly in the hilarious footnotes. This bold work deserves to be read and discussed."},{"Title":"God Save My Queen: A Tribute","review":"I'm a Queen fan, so I went online to look for a few books about the band, and I found this. I'm not really into poetry, but this book rocked. There were a few times I laughed out loud when I was reading it. This guy is funny and sincere. I'm 30, and there was something about this book that reminded me of when I was 12 or 13 and first getting into music. It's more about being a weirdo teenager than anything else. I really liked it. Also, it's the size of a 45, which is cool."},{"Title":"God Save My Queen: A Tribute","review":"I loved this book! These short pieces have an impressive breadth--the copious footnotes reference everything from a WWII era letter from the author's grandfather, to the guitarist Brian May's Phd thesis. Captures the singular obsession of fandom and the desire to write this peculiar catelogue of knowledge into one's own biography. A personal allegory for a media-driven consumer age. Not what I expected, but very cool indeed!"},{"Title":"God Save My Queen: A Tribute","review":"I believe that any music obsessive can always identify another. Just by casually glancing at this book I immediately recognized the author as a genuine fanatic. But the book isn't merely the ramblings of a Queen junkie (that would hardly be enough). It is a carefully crafted trip down the author's own memory lane with Queen as the singular, all-consuming soundtrack. The result is so infectious that I could hardly believe that I was anxious to read it again (rare for a book of poetry). It also made me anxious to revisit the Queen canon. A perfectly fitting tribute to a great (and sometimes underrated) band."},{"Title":"God Save My Queen: A Tribute","review":"I came of age (and to music) around the same time as the author. My band of choice was the Canadian art power trio RUSH. The band QUEEN was right up there, though, and I was as sad as any other fan to learn of the band's premature demise and lead singer Freddie Mercury's tragic death.Daniel Nester writes clearly and well. He fuses a fan's energy with the full power and importance of QUEEN, both as a musical and pop culture phenomena. Each QUEEN song receives a careful treatment that combines the &quot;everyfan&quot; experience of the author with specific details of the song itself. This approach succeeds and has created a user's guide to QUEEN as well as a backstage pass to a collective generational memory. Read this book, and Dan Nester will indeed rock you!"},{"Title":"God Save My Queen: A Tribute","review":"God Save My Queen is a sexy, sweaty, hardrocking party with Freddie, Brian, Roger and John. But maybe I'm biased. As I did--as so many of us did--Nester grew up listening to the greatest band of all time and in this unique book shares not only his memories and experiences but his genuine love for Queen. The \\"riffs\\" (as the jacket copy describes them) are short and catchy as riffs should be. They look a little like poems, but read like interior monologue sometimes, dialogue sometimes, free-association sometimes, nostalgic narrative sometimes. And there's enough rock-n-roll trivia in here to stump the Music Nerd. One of the coolest things about God Save My Queen, it that it is so refreshing to see a straight man (the dedication is to the love of Nester's life, a woman, so I'm extrapolating here) write with such candor, warmth and even doe-eyed crush-puppy love about the bucktoothed homosexual hero of his youth. Anybody who listened (or still listens!) to Queen will love this book. Actually, anybody who survived adolescence as a chunky, nerdy misfit is in for a genuine treat. I hope this weird little book brings Nester lots of success. Rock on!"},{"Title":"God Save My Queen: A Tribute","review":"...because it's a strange book, and we don't have enough strange things these days. I like the footnotes, and the poems are strange, but I like them. I like Queen fine, and Nester brings back memories of listening to music passionately. There's a lot of \\"too much information\\" here, a lot of sex, but that may be a plus for some people!"},{"Title":"God Save My Queen: A Tribute","review":"I was disappointed. I bought this book because it was interesting for me to read what a New-York poet can tell me about Queen poetry, Queen meaning for the world. But instead it I found a live journal of 12-years old teenager who even cannot tell what he want to say. Today I eat my soup and thought about Brian May. Looking to my picture disk -how are you, Roger? And this kind of thoughts from the beginning to the end. If it's good tribute from American writer -my condolences to modern American literature. Queen didn't deserved so poor tribute. Shame."},{"Title":"God Save My Queen: A Tribute","review":"This book is amazing. Any Queen fan who has felt at some point some surreal connection with the band will benefit greatly from reading this and its companion. It puts into words the abstract forms of things I'd never thought to try and describe. Parts of it brought tears to my eyes; parts of it made me laugh out loud. There are few things I can say that express what the book is, let alone its greatness. In any case, it is not a fan biography; it isn't a review; it is simply a genre in itself as something completely unique from anything else I've ever read. And it rocks."},{"Title":"God Save My Queen: A Tribute","review":"Someone gave me this book--why, I'll never know. I liked Queen a lot once. Do the remaining members know a supremely bad poet has written a tedious book about them? Someone should let them know.The writer seems to be one of those guys who obsessively remembers stuff about marginal subjects and likes to spout that info.

So now he can footnote bad poetry with obscure references and call it a book."},{"Title":"Fillets of Plaice","review":"Well, I may have mangled the quote for this review's title but I am right about the rating of this book. This was such a good book that I actually felt a bit sad after turning the last page! Many of the encounters in this book of short stories shares the same wit, keen observation, and gentle spirit of My Family and Other Animals . . .then there are a few surprises.

The name stuck and this book contains some wonderful and evocative stories. Best of all I think are the two horror stories at the end. I never realised Gerald had such a dark side."},{"Title":"Fillets of Plaice","review":"Fillets of Plaice is a delightful memoir by Gerald Durrell consisting of five tales from various times of his life. The first is from his childhood on Corfu concerning a birthday celebration for his mother that, like everything else his family did, goes a bit wrong with unpredictable results. The next piece takes place shortly after Durrell and his family returned to London from Corfu. The author got a job working in a pet shop and met some interesting and very memorable people as a consequence. In the next story, Gerald Durrell has grown up and is collecting animals in East Africa. The story takes place when the British has a colonial empire in Africa and the Foreign Service was running the affairs of the natives. The story is concerted with a Foreign Service Office named Martin who is expecting a visit from his superior and is desperate to create a good impression so he can be promoted to a higher (and better) position. In an earlier visit made by his superior, Martin had an embarrassing situation and had been sent to the Devil's Island of postings in Africa and he is desperate to avoid any problems this time.The final two stories are later in time but how soon after Gerald Durrell left East Africa is not mentioned. In the fourth story Mr. Durrell is front and center as his doctor puts him is a rest home as he is at the point of exhaustion. The story centers around a medical problem Mr. Durrell is having - his nose keeps bleeding. The final story is about a woman to whom Mr. Durrell is attracted and repelled. Her name is Ursula and by his account she is very beautiful but also extremely maddening. She drops many malapropisms and has a character that is disruptive in the extreme. If you have ever been to a concert or movie where someone talks in a normal voice, you will have an idea what Ursula is like.Gerald Durrell is a great story teller and fleshes out his characters and situations with concise and direct language. He is perhaps at his most amusing in the birthday party story where he picks up from his earlier books about his childhood in Corfu. I think it would be best two read My Family and Other Animals (and Birds, Beasts and Relative, if you like) prior to this book so a clear idea of the people in the story is reached. Fillets of Plaice is the kind of book that you will recommend to your relatives and friends to read for the sheer pleasure of the humor and Mr. Durrell's excellent writing."},{"Title":"Fillets of Plaice","review":"This book caused me to make sounds I didn't know I could make as I attempted to stifle my laughter at work!!

Why? Because it delivers on its promise of being a simple yet compelling process to help each of us achieve our goals. What Drs. Cox and Sanders have done is to distill into four easy to remember words, the four things that we all do to get in our own way. These four words--Catastrophizing, Rationalizing, Agonizing and (my favoritie) Procrastinating--are explained in detail both as to what they are and how they act as obstacles to success. For example, if you are deeply in debt, it is primarily related to rationalizing. If you are still in the same job after 10 years, it is probably due to agonizing. And, of course, if that degree program isn't yet completed, it is probably due to procrastinating.The exercises are really helpful and I liked the way the authors recommend that you read the book first, then go back through and do the exercises. In summary, if you let it, this book can really make a difference in your life."},{"Title":"Cut the CRAP and Resolve Your Problems","review":"Brilliant Book, teaching you your not stuck and how to relive the problems of every day life. Absolute must reading for those who unsatisfied in their daily lives but have no idea on how to change this. Written in everyday language without the common psycho babble. Easy to read. Close to a 12 Step Program for every day life."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Many readers have panned Cornwell's Point of Origin as not keeping within the genre' and being too involved with character development. To my way of thinking, this is precisely what the author intended. Those of us who have read all of the Scarpetta episodes, and have any sort of memory, do not need fresh starts and predictable thrillings. We have unanswered questions from the past and this book nicely ties up loose ends and gives us an update on the principle characters. Kay and Lucy are the pivotal personalities and it is gratifying to watch them behaving in a realistically unfinished manner. Those who focus in on picky little details and find fault with occasionally inaccurate nits are missing the whole reason for this series. Whether or not Cornwell wants to admit it, we are watching the evolution of the author's personality as she reflects upon the adventures of her characters. True growth occurs only through reflection. Even though the incidents portrayed in the novel are fictional, we need to realize that all writing is irrevocably filtered through the experience and world view of the author. A few hours spent with Kay and Lucy, every year or so, gives us an update on Patricia Cornwell who has been so gracious as to share her opinions about things that matter to her. Unlike authors who grind out thrillers with no particular personal involvement, Cornwell has the courage to invite us into her home. The person of Kay Scarpetta may seem to make snap decisions and jump to conclusions on occasion and for those readers who do not know her, she may seem to be incompletely formed and her reasoning, flawed. Cornwell has been criticized for moving too rapidly in these instances. In my opinion, she is giving her long-time readers the benefit of brevity where it is appropriate. I could go on but you get the point (no pun intended). I give this book two thumbs up, using both hands, and say to Patricia Cornwell: keep up the good work, I enjoyed our time together and I am looking forward to our next meeting."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"What a huge disappointment, I eagerly awaitied the publication of this book &amp; managed to beg a copy off someone which I sat down to devour. What can I say without ruining the plot for those of you who haven't read it (unlike some of the other reviewers listed)? Firstly, how stupid can Benton be? Secondly why does everyone Scarpetta gets involved with meet a very gruesome end? She should come with a public warning - 'do not get involved with me or you will face certain death by scalping or a terrorist bomb'. Thirdly, like other reviewers I did not like the recycling of former baddies, it takes away the suspense, which after all is the whole purpose of reading books of this genre &amp; I have had enough of Carrie Grethen and her 'evilness'.Lucy is just SO unbelieveably irritating, I find it a struggle to read about her. And enough is enough, Scarpetta's worship of her neice borders on the obsessive &amp; is totally unhealthy. It's a shame that she has escaped the fate of all the other characters who've been associated with Aunt Kay. In previous books we were subjected to endless unecessary detail about computers. Lucy the genious, has managed to transform herself into an expert on helicopters &amp; points of origin -argh. Please why must she continually be the main feature of the storyline, why can't we see her on the periphery for a change? Lucy is a dull, tedious, one dimensional humnourless nerd. Scarpetta isn't much better, the pair of them are real social misfits. The best characterisation by far must be Marino although it's clear that Cornwell sees him as an object of fun &amp; ridicule.Scarpetta at times behaves like some religious nut, condeming smoking, disapproving of Marino's lifestyle &amp; caffeine intake &amp; forever ranting on about evil. She is SO moralistic it's galling to read. In fact she gets more judgemental, pious &amp; sanctimonious by the book.I think I'll give Black Notice a miss unless Lucy has done a vanishing act &amp; there are some new more rounded, three dimensional charcaters.Like some of the other reviewers, I also wonder whether the seeds of some same sex experiences are being sown for Scarpetta."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I'm using my Compaq V75 to write this negative review as I drink my Coca-Cola... I got so tired of brand names as I forced myself through this! Other reviewers here have accurately mentioned that the fires were poorly explained, the horse issue is never clarified. It's fairly obvious that, since Carrie's body was never recovered, that she'll rise from the dead in the next book. Ho hum. I was so consistently annoyed with the lack of craft in this book that I'll never read another of her books again."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot more than the previous installment to the Kay-Lance-Carrie death triangle. It was darker and grittier and dealt with more personal issues. I enjoyed the technical details and did not find it any gorier than any of her others. I do not think that it would be a good place for newbie fans of Cornwell to start their association with Dr Scarpetta - start at the beginning and follow the character development and see what you think. I am looking forward to the next book as I am dying to know (no pun intended :-) how they take up the story after all the traumatic events in Point of Origin but I am hoping that things are going to be a bit more upbeat and positive for Kay. I would hate to walk around as depressed as herself and Lucy seem to be all the time! All in all, a good read with as satisfying an ending as could be expected in the circumstances. PS. Delighted with the Irish reference!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Like some of the other reviewers, I'm really disappointed with this latest from PC. Her early books were worthy of a best-seller list, but certainly not her latest few, this one included. I'm really sick of the Benton angle...why can't we have people who work together without the romantic angle? In the early books, he was happily married...suddenly we find him and Kay with grand passion for each other which takes away from the suspense angle. I liked her early books for the suspense. If I want romance, I'll read romance novels. I'm also sick of the Lucy angle. Kay is really neurotic about Lucy. She's grown and has her own life; PC, give it a break. I think PC needs to develop new characters. Marino is the only one I still like. Fortunately, I checked this one out from the library and didn't waste my money. It's not worth it. Post Mortem was a great book. What happened to you, PC? Fame catch up with you?"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"The book was a real page turner, in the sense that I couldn't turn pages fast enough in a scan for a break in the tedium. Where was the story? Exquisite villianess Carrie could have saved this book, and yet I don't think she was given a full paragraph.What once was fascinating narrative has become interminable forensic techno-babble. Marino remains the only halfway interesting character, and now, horrifyingly, his inner child seems poised to emerge. And PC, if you need to get rid of somebody, next time how about the insufferable, ever sullen, tortured Lucy."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Pat, Pat, Pat! I know life hasn't been a barrel of laughs lately but does Kay Scarpetta have to suffer as well? Not to mention your readers! We are constantly having Kay and Lucy's insight/ brilliance praised to the skies, don't they have any personal resources? Or doctors?I'm almost too bored by all this emotional self-gratification to ask - How did those fires get so hot? Maybe Scarpetta's personal black cloud obscured my view when I read that bit!As for you-know-who's demise --- better dead than stuck with that self-involved woman.Sorry Pat, cheer up! I'm willing to give you another try. I've enjoyed your books in the past. Could Kay and Lucy please have some fun? Could we also have some new crimes committed by people we haven't already met? If the obvious sequel to Point comes into being, could you please explain the fires- I lie awake for minutes each night.....just wondering."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"When some authors become popular their writing lacks. This is the case with Patricia Cornwell. With the publication of each of her novels they seem to be getting worse. The characters are 2 demensional. The plot is contrived. The writing is juvenile. Dr. Scarpetta is no longer growing. I think Ms. Cornwell needs to lose Kay and find a new career. This book is a waste of time."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Cornwell has become the new Anne Rice, as far as I'm concerned. You can't help wanting to read her because she grabbed you in the past, but what she's offering us is such a diluted form of what she used to write that it doesn't make sense to continue the habit. I didn't read Hornet's Nest because others told me it wasn't worth the paper it was printed on -- but I didn't want to believe that another Kay Scarpetta novel would follow suit. Patricia, it's time to rethink your plots and characters!!! Habit only lasts so long before it becomes a form of compulsion. Since I'm not a compulsive person, Cornwell, I fear, has lost me."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed in Cornwell's latest effort. The plot is a recycled one as are the characters. Cornwell didn't even tie up the loose ends in the technical explanations of the fires' fuel sources. The ending reminded me of a bad soap opera,where without a body to identify one knows that the character will return..... Enough already...I thoroughly enjoyed her first books. However the last three seemed to have been &quot;phoned in&quot;. &quot;Point of Origin&quot; reminded me of a screenplay for a &quot;Summer Blockbuster&quot; gone bad complete with one dimensional characters and lots of fire and explosions! Given the high quality of Cornwell's early works, this effort deserves less than one star."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I just discovered this series a few years ago. I enjoyed the first few books immensely and thought Cornwell had a good series started. However, I took a long hiatus from the series before picking up this particular book. I find the protagonist hard to relate to and the Lucy storyline not relevant to the plot in any way. I have to agree with some other reviewers when they said this would have been a good place to end the series. I will continue to read the series for now, but am finding them increasingly harder and harder to get into."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have always loved Patricia Cornwell's writing and herbooks. She is a sharp woman with great writing skills, and her knowledge of forensic science is certainly part of the reason people come back to read her again and again. This book was extremely depressing, more than frightening...because we've been through these same things with Scarpetta and her niece before. How many times can one person deal with such tragedy and loss in their lives. At a certain point, this becomes unbelieveable (except for the Kennedy family), and the reader loses interest. Yes, the author is aging her protagonist and life does change, but must it always be so negative? I get the feeling Cornwell wants to be rid of this character, with this book being not up to her usual standards and with the introduction of other characters in books such as &quot;Southern Cross&quot;. If this is true then I should think the author would want this character to go out with a good plot behind her. Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh, klsst23@pitt.edu"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Patricia Cornwell is a very capable writer who has provided us with many enjoyable reads but the repetitive angst over niece Lucy gets too much for this reader. This time Dr. Scarpetta is too much in touch with her feelings."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"(1) I am not interested in Patricia Cornwell's political views, which seem to erupt from every character's mouth, esp. Scarpetta's. Is it possible she's changed editors? That would explain this phenomenon, as well as the (strange) new books w/o Scarpetta as a hero, all of which are in desperate need of editing. It's fairly typical for a bestselling author to suffer under bad editing b/c people feel they can't say anything to her.(2). Why kill Benton Wesley? He was the only thing that made Scarpetta seem even vaguely human.(3). What is the purpose of the Lucy character? She seems to be getting weirder and weirder. If the point is to show that political conservatives (Scarpetta) can accept and lesbians, even though lesbians are inherently screwy and constitute a serious security risk, well, I am still not convinced."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I HAD TO SAY THAT AFTER BEING &quot;TREATED&quot; TO SEVERAL OF THE FOLLOWING REVIEWS THAT SPOIL ONE OF THE MAJOR EVENTS OF THE NOVEL. HOW DISPPOINTING! With that said, I really enjoyed POINT OF ORIGIN. I'd nearly given up on Cornwell, after the past three disappointing Scarpetta novels. My criticisms of those hold true for POINT; (a) frankly, I don't care as much about Lucy as Cornwell obviously does. I just don't see the purpose served by all the text devoted to her. She spouts technobabble and explains it to Scarpetta and Marino. The rest of it, well, I find her a poorly-sketched character even after all these novels. (b) second, the Marino character is growing tiresome. I still care about him much more than I do Lucy, but, the device (and that's what he seems like now) is OLD now (but, to Cornwell's credit, it's been imitated ad nauseum). HOWEVER, yes, I enjoyed this book. The focus is on VICTIMS, not on getting-in-the-heads of serial killers. We see the devastating effects the events of past novels have taken on the stalwart Scarpetta. This adds to her believable traits. Then, there's the triumphant return to what gets THIS reader turning pages, the descriptions, from Scarpetta, of all the deliciously grisly little procedures and details and such. (come ON, I'm not reading this for the love scenes!)Cornwell walks a fine line with this stuff, and she walks it as surely as she did way back in THE BODY FARM. My faith has been renewed a bit, less written-for-contract-and-film-op schlock, and more poetic contrasts of death and life..."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This is the second book I have read that is written by Cornwell and it will be the last.

Don't waste your $$ on this trash. However, if you are really desperate to read Cornwell - check the book out of the library."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I gave up on Cornwell several books ago, but picked this one up at the library for one more shot. My initial annoyance with the heroine was that she is such a belly-acher: ain't it awful what I have to do, dealing with dead bodies and all. I disliked the token love story with Wesley, who had a perfectly nice wife and family, as being introduced for people who are more interested in sex than in mysteries. Her preoccupation with her niece is obsessive. So I find that this book is worse in all the above. If Kay Scarpetta finds her job so disagreeable, why doesn't she just quit and do something else? I'd like to see a positive attitude here. I am not dazzled by all the techno-garbage. Let's have a heroine I can care about. Scarpetta, resign and get a job in a factory and let Lucy live her own life."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This is my second Patricia Cornwell book, also my last. Kay is a totally unlikeable character. She is self-involved, arrogant, humourless, and totally one dimensional. I could never understand why Benton (hate that name) would be interested in her.I agree with everyone else's reviews on the gigantic plot holes.Also I find it very hard to believe that a ME would get so involved in every case in the state. I have never heard of a criminal blaming the ME and then going after her.I kept reading just to finish it and was so disappointed I said never again."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This book is what I consider the last good Scarpetta novel; all the books that follow it (The Last Precinct, Blowfly, Predator, et al) are hardly worth the paper they're printed on.The plot centers on the suspected arson of a media magnate's home which resulted in the death of one female and several prize horses. A new villain enters the picture (Newton Joyce), and he's aided by serial killer Carrie Grethen, newly escaped from prison. There's a subplot involving Benton Wesley, Scarpetta's FBI paramour, which turns into the mother of all plot twists in her later novel 'Blowfly'. I felt that Cornwell didn't give her characters enough chance: she rapidly ditches both Joyce and Grethen in favor of Le Loup-Garou, her villain of 'Black Notice' and 'The Last Precinct', which in my opinion was a mistake.The supporting characters are back: Lt. Pete Marino (I swear if she kills him off I will never touch one of her novels again), FBI agent Lucy Farinelli, Scarpetta's neice (although too much of a deal is made of her lesbianism), and one of the best villains in contemporary thrillers, Carrie Grethen. Carrie can be placed easily next to Hannibal Lecter in terms of fictional villains.As you read, you'll learn about how arson fires are investigated and, incidentally, how fires work in terms of accelerants and point(s) of origin (where the fire initially begins); you'll also learn a little bit about how a scanning electron microscope (SEM) works. Cornwell's science is always dead-on, and this book is no exception."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I liked this installment in the Kay Scarpetta series. The forensics are detailed and graphic, and by now I feel I know her characters well, both their good aspects and their faults. The only issue I have with the series is that they skip major changes in the character's lives. For example, in the last book, Benton was still at the FBI, and when this one opens, he is retired. We don't get to know what led up to that decision and how he feels about it. Lucy was last with the FBI and in the process of having her career ruined. In this book, all of a sudden that is over and she is with the ATF.Regardless of those deficits, I still enjoy the series. Carrie Grethen is back and the book starts with a poem she writes to Kay. I won't give away spoilers, but this one has an ending that shocks, and is a heartbreaker.If you plan to read more of the Kay Scarpetta series, don't skip this one. It is needed in my opinion to fully understand at least the next two books. (that is as far as I've gotten in the series)"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"A bitter middle aged self righteous medical examiner Kay, a bitter pathetic crying baby Lucy who can an access database and fly helicopter, a bitter foul mouthed cop with profanity in every single sentence, together were looking for a bitter psychopath Carrie who liked to kill with knife and fire.I wish Carrie killed them all half way into the book.Other reviewers have said enough..."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I know it had nothing to do with the overall story of the book, but when PC was describing the process of shoeing a horse - and had the farrier sitting on a stool while doing it - I had to put the book down - for days. I have owned horses for years, used several different farriers, in different states and they all use the same basic technique and NONE of them have used a stool - I can't even fathom how they could correctly shoe a horse while seated. It wouldn't have taken but a few minutes to phone a local farrier in her area, maybe even visit a stable while the farrier was working. It seems in all her other books she has taken such pains to give accurate details, so the reader really feels like they are there (or Kay is really there), but she missed the mark this time. I also felt she placed too much emphasis on Lucy's lesbianism in this book. Fine, she's gay, let's just get on with the story already! This was not one of her best efforts."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Usually a Cornwell fan who finishes within a couple of days or a week, but took me nearly 3 months to wade through this one. I am not sure why I even plugged along! The murder/arsonist storyline seemed intriguing and filled with hope. The book got too caught up in tedious details of the personal lives of Kay, Lucy, et al. Interesting characters deserve much more interesting dialogue, actions, and lives! A potentially suspenseful plot with a few new twists got dumped for scenes such as visiting Lucy's apartment? Maybe Cornwell has written one too many books! I want the suspense and mystery back, but only if she can come up with new motives, new perpetrators, and a whole new outlook on life for Kay."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"As a pure mystery story, I would rate the book as 3 stars, especially because the climax was very short, and some things were left unexplained. It doesn't seem that Cornwell is that interested in writing a typical mystery.For me, though, reading Point of Origin was time well spent. Just because a story is depressing doesn't make it worthless. In fact, I found it ultimately cathartic--wasn't that the purpose of the ancient Greek tragedies?"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Having read each KS novel, I am impressed with how PC has tended and nurtured each of her characters like fragile seedlings. While I do not agree with the direction each character takes, it is not important. The issue is believability. Like close friends who do not heed our advice, I am caught up with each characters' energies, triumphs, and short-comings. Kudos, PC for daring to risk change. You bring empathy and sensitivity to an otherwise cold science. Victims have your voice to express their outrage and surviving friends and family have your moral indignation to commune with theirs when the rest of the world is too busy watching soap operas and Wheel of Fortune."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have just finished reading &quot;Point of Origin&quot;, and it was quite a disappointment. When I first started reading Cornwell (&quot;Post Mortem&quot;), I loved her books. They kept me in suspense, and I could not put them down until I was finished. My only complaint was that she would take the reader through this very intricate mystery, only to fabricate some killer within the last few pages. She didn't give the reader a chance to guess who the killer was. I didn't like that style of mystery.Now she's gone the opposite direction, and has been recycling past villians. How many more times will we have to read about Temple Gault? How many books ago did he appear?The three stars I give her are for the technical details of the plot. It's the characters I'm disappointed with this time. Not just the villians, but Kay Scarpetta herself.I think this latest effort was better than some of her others (e.g. &quot;Cause of Death&quot;), but the only reason this one was a page turner was because I was anxious to get it over with."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Once again, Patricia Cornwell has come up with a first rate mystery. It will probably be the last one by her that I read, because frankly, I'm weary of the angst of her characters. Kay Scarpetta is a lonely, driven, sad woman who has a lonely, driven, sad niece. Neither of them seems quite real. Is there any joy or love in their lives? Doesn't seem so, and it's tiring.The villain of the piece -- Carrie Grethem -- will undoubtedly turn up again in the next novel. Her demise was not certified, and I can't read one more word about a woman who can manipulate any and all circumstances at her pleasure.As I said, the mystery was a good one, if a bit gory. But nothing good, or fun happens to any of the protagonists. When we leave them this time, it's at the scene of a funeral, and I can't help but believe that their sad lives will just go on in this vein as long as we buy the books. I've bought my last one."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Patricia Cornwell can definitely match, and usually outdo, any mystery writer I've ever read, bar none. I have read every novel she has written, and have been disappointed only once, and that was when she strayed from her usual format (&quot;Hornet's Nest&quot;). Her forensic knowledge is intriguing, if not amazing. This one missed the mark only slightly. But, the lesser of one of the best surely beats the best of the lesser."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I almost gave up on the book about one third of the way through, but because of loyalty to the author, I kept plugging along. Although it does get a bit more like a Cornwell story, the Lucy plot line is basically not interesting."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"In the past I have enjoyed how Cornwell mixed the technical with the mystery of why a death occurred. This kept my interest from page one, but this time it took me until around page 200 to care about this book and then I didn't care that much. Usually with a KS book I want to do nothing else but read. With this edition I had to force myself to continue. From Cornwell's overdone descriptive to set a scene , &quot;the antique French oak breakfast table.&quot;(pg2), &quot;stainless steel Breitling Aerospace watch&quot;(pg2), to the incorrect descriptions &quot;flapping&quot; blades of the helicopter (pg21),&amp; &quot;My beer bottle was limp&quot;(pg63), to her cliched vision of Lucy as Carrie's &quot;supple, hungry lover&quot; (pg58). I didn't get all the anger Kay was feeling toward .Lucy's lifestyle, Benton's love, McGovern's connections with Lucy? What is Cornwell telling us, that Kay is coming out of the closet and is in love with Lucy? I figured Cornwell was going through some major personal stuff during the writing of this book and vented on the page. I think her editor should have helped her out and revised the relentless whining and anger about every character KS has in her life. She use to be more faceted. Hopefully Scarpetta's Winter Table, will be back on track. Cornwell books have always been a must buy for me, but at this moment I have one more book in me, before I start waiting for reviews or maybe paperback or maybe James Lee Burke."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Some of the other reviewers have grown tired of Lucy. I have grown tired of Gault and the aftermath of killing him. We may need for Lucy to grow up, but what we need much much more is for PC to find a new villan. I think this was a poor execution of what could have been a good story. PC can write a good book. This is not one, and she hasn't managed it in her last couple or three. I am going to quit reading PC for the same reason I quit reading Ludlum. PC is hung up on Gault as Ludlum got hung up on Bourne. NOW if you want to read a GOOD author READ NEVADA BARR!!!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I am a great fan of Kay Scarpetta novels. I have readeveryone. I liked Kay because she was a strong, sure woman. I alsoloved the powerfulness of Benton Wesley. This book took us on a different trip completely and one that was not enjoyable. The relationship between Kay and Benton deteriorated from very romantic in previous novels, to &quot;comfortable&quot;. They didn't even share bedrooms anymore. Is the way Ms. Cornwall sees long term relationships? As becoming comfortable with each other, and no romance exists any longer. Sex becomes an act that these people do to satisfy a basic hunger, not because they feel genuine emotion. However, I will say the book was interesting and held my attention until the final chapters. What happened to Benton is unforgivable... Too much! And the ending left little doubt as to who we would see in the next book... I was not impressed this time around."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"While I like the plot -- and especially the fire aspect -- the lack of face-to-face contact with Carrie made Carrie's appearance in &quot;Point of Origin&quot; somewhat pointless. I also didn't like what happened to a main character in the Scarpetta novels. I do like the depth of Kay Scarpetta -- readers know a lot of her quirks and mindset. Her tragic romatic life has simply got to take a turn for the better -- no one can have the run of bad luck she's had!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I found this book to be one of her better ones. Although I do agree with the other comments about the whining. I was also sorry to see that she can not keep a relationship. I was also wondering what happened to Lucy which caused the move from FBI. There really was no explanation. I was not as impressed with the ending. Too many open issues."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I enjoyed Point of Origin, however felt that her previous novels were much better. I enjoy Patricia Cornwell's stories, so will continue to be a fan. However, I feel that she could have done alot more character development and gotton into areas of Kay Scarpetta's life that needed more exploring."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"PC has brought back Scarpetta's nemesis, Carrie Grethen, to bind this tale's plot together. Unfortunately, Carrie's escape is totally unbelievable and PC must have realized this herself because she uses a convenient plot-hole plug by explaining that it was unexplainable. The narration and dialogue are both stiff--a PC characteristic--but it's improving and after two or three more novels she may write like a novelist instead of a case worker. Irritations? Kay is the unhappiest character I've ever met in a novel. There is no warmth to her; she has no interests beyond sticking her hands into a cold body. Even so, I would recommend this title to others--though it will likely be my last PC read. Sorry."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I found the plot keeping me on the edge of my seat. The best plot in the last several books. Surprises were around every corner and the plot most original. The one thing I do miss is her earlier writing ability. It seems that as authors get well known the publishers want books as quickly as possible and the writing suffers. I think the publishers need to realize that the public is willing to wait for a well written novel."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"More vintage Scarpetta from the new mistress of mystery. This is the best thriller from Cornwell for some time and is a real cliffhanger to the end. The character of Carrie Grethen is Scarpetta's most chilling adversary and fans know from the start that something startling and disturbing can only come of her re-appearance. Keeps you guessing to the end and die-hard fans will applaud another masterpiece. New book due soon? If it's anything like this, can't wait...!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have read every book by Patricia Cornwell. Point of Origin was interesting for me because I had no idea of what goes on to determine how and where a fire starts. As for the story, it was her typical style, but I had some disappointments regarding Dr. Kay Scarpetta's relationship with Benton. But maybe she and Marino can hook-up now.....LOL. I guess I will have to wait for the next book. If you are a follower of these books, do not hesitate to read it. bye"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Having read all the Patricia Cornwell's previous Kay Scarpetta books, I was nonetheless ambivalent about starting her new one, Point of Origin. Although they are dark of necessity, the series had become depressing because nothing good ever happens to anyone! All of Kay's relationships -- whether with coworkers, her sister and mother, significant other Wesley Benton, investigative sidekick Marino, or beloved niece Lucy -- are fraught with tension and mistrust. Everyone seems depressed and unhappy, including Kay herself. And for good reason -- life is always dealing Kay, her friends and family, a low blow. Before I started this book, I told my husband that if something good doesn't happen to somebody in this one, I wouldn't be reading another one. I closed the cover today -- Kay Scarpetta, adios!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I'm almost finished with this book and don't even know if I want to continue reading it. This has been thoroughly disappointing. As an addition to an extremely strong series it's weak at best. As a stand alone book if you've never read any of the other books in the series, it's almost unpublishable. The entire plotline took an excruciating amount of pages to develop and when it finally did it was anti-climactic. Not a page turner by any means.By the way, the introduction of the Teun character is about as see-through as it gets. Okay, Patricia, we all get it. Kay is going to make it all the way to midlife and then discover she's bi-sexual. Before reading this book I would have given the author more credit than to borrow so heavily from her own life instead of relying on creativity and imagination. Sad. I will not be racing out to buy anymore Kay Scarpetta books."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Kay Scarpetta has been a favorite of mine (Lucy also). Until this book! Unfortunately feel that Cornwell is going the way of &quot;Dianelle Steel&quot; &amp; others: simply writing to publish. Such a shame! This book spends Way too much time on medical details; little or no plot; have about fifteen/twenty pages to go right now and frankly, do NOT care how she finishes. Writer appears to be so negative and hostile throughout this book, I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Is this mystery or soap opera? Or Grand Opera? I have read all the other Kay Scarpetta novels and they are becoming ever more angst-filled. I'm surprised Dr. S has not given up her job, given how miserable it seems to make her. Now another lover lost? Does it never end??!! I, on the other hand, am severing my ties with this depressed and depressing old friend."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I found this to be one my favorite of the Scarpetta series. The details in the fire forensics were excellent. Details such as these can often be boring but in this case, they added significantly to the realism. I like that Cornwell makes Kay a strong woman in most ways but with some weaknesses to make her related to us normal women."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This is my third Patricia Cornwell novel and she's 3 for 3. You can't say I haven't tried. Stupid story, meandering plot and a testament to the mediocre tastes that make a book a best seller."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I agree with some of the comments that Kay Scarpetta needs to lighten up. She's been a little more depressed and gloomy with each new Cornwell novel, so much so that I'm beginning to blame Lucy who needs to start growing up. I was teary-eyed at the end. I have read all of Pat's novels and they're all good but my favorite and I think the scariest was From Potter's Field. Temple Gault was something else but when Carrie teamed up with him it was even scarier."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"i'm a big fan of cornwell's, but this book didn't do it for me. i didn't buy the fact that carrie is so brilliant that every single thing she does is on purpose so that scarpetta finds out about it. lucy needs a kick in the head."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I ordered Point of Origin, Triumph and the Glory, and Left Behind three weeks ago and finally got time to read them. Point of Origin was the best of the three, probably because I like mysteries better than anything else. Kay Scarpetta is one of the great fictional characters of the last several years, I can really relate to her. The plot is pretty contrived in spots but Cornwell is so skilled at what she does that the overall effect of the book is still laudatory. I just ordered her new one and am primed to read it next."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have been a fan of Patricia Cornwell since her first book, but lately her plots are weak. She turned Kay into an unlikable character. She does not act like the public offical that she is supposed to be. Her plot lines are also getting similar; Kay loves a character then he dies. The book does provide some good medical information, but the characters are getting too strange. If you want to read some good medical trillers, read the previous books. They have better plots and characters."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I loved the gore, but Cornwell has this disturbing habit of bringing in the heinous murderer right in the last 10 of the 300 pages. The fun is in kicking yourself for not having known all along that X was the bad guy, not in finding him at the very end and having him dashed to pieces."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I loved the gore, but Cornwell has this disturbing habit ofbringing in the heinous murderer right in the last 10 of the 300pages. The fun is in kicking yourself, and not having known all along that X was the bad guy, not in finding him at the very end."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Point of Origin has got to be the BEST Patricia Cornwell book Ihave read to date. It was fast-moving with twists and turns that kept me thinking from the first to the last page. Get this book....you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Point of Origin was the first Kay Scarpetta novel to make mecry. I don't think I can forgive Patricia Cornwell for 'killing' one of the main characters, but that doesn't mean that I didn't think this was yet another brilliant story. It's amazing how Patricia Cornwell manages to grab my attention from the first few sentences of every book she writes. Everytime she publishes a new Scarpetta novel, it's like meeting up with old friends, Kay, Lucy and Marino. Point of Origin is a sort of cry for more humanity in the world, and this message is wrapped up and spoken out by Kay, who is heartbroken throughout most of the book. The scene in which she discovers the body in the burnt-down house made me cry so much, especially as, as every reader knows, this man meant so much to Kay. I am now reading 'Black Notice' and the letter at the beginning of the book made this feeling come back and I cried again."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have always looked upon Patricia Cornwell's novels as arelease. They are never intellectually demanding but, generally, are guaranteed to provide an interesting plot, good characterization etc.While there was nothing wrong with &quot;Point of Origin&quot;, there was nothing in it to rave about either. Once again, the protagonist, medical examiner Kay Scarpetta, is faced with a baffling series of murders but, once again (and I am giving absolutely nothing away by saying this) she faces the same nemesis that we have seen in previous novels. In reading the novel, I could not help that Cornwell has become too comfortable with Carrie Grethen to be willing to branch out and create a new villain who resorts to methods other than those made so familiar by Dr. Hannibal Lecter in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs.&quot;Where Cornwell succeeds, however, is in her mastery of medical detail. The success of the Scarpetta novels hinged greatly on the fact that the reader was actually able to picture themselves at the crime scene and in the morgue as a criminal investigation was conducted. The descriptions that Cornwell makes are admittedly gory but no more so than what medical examiners are, presumably, faced with every day. One is not left with the impression that the gore is gratuitous and that is why I have kept coming back to the Scarpetta novels.&quot;Point of Origin&quot; is an improvement over some of Cornwell's other more recent Scarpetta novels. If only she were willing to experiment with new characters and plot lines, rather than stick to what is becoming the same formulaic plot, her readership would only continue to grow."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This book is just as good as her previous ones. Unfortunately,when a friend introduced me to this author she loaned me her books out of order of publication. I highly recommend that anyone who wants to read these awesome novels, read them in order of when they were published as one book builds on the previous. While each one can stand alone, I feel I would have enjoyed them more had I read them in order!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I really liked this book, though not as much as others like Postmortem and Unnatural Exposure. I thought she could have went more into the some of the charcters, but on the morbidity level....it was awesome"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I liked it because it was fast-paced and interesting. The main characters from all the Scarpetta novels continued to grow, change and evolve. It was more &quot;glitzy&quot;, like a big blockbuster movie, than many of the earlier books in the series but it was still REALLY entertaining."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"While, I'm not familiar with Patricia Cornwell's previous work, I really liked this book. It took me a little bit to get over the gore, but I imagine that must be expected when reading a book with a medical examiner as the main character. It's certainly not for the weak at heart."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I found this book to be a great improvement when compared to recent works by PC. It was nice to see Marino show some emotion. Lucy is getting to be a bore, though. The unexpected loss of a vital character was heart-breaking. Very few books have brought me to tears like this did. I was disappointed with the lack of face-to-face confrontation with the &quot;bad guy&quot;. Carrie's character could have used some more depth and inclusion. We never even got to meet her partner! The &quot;Point of Origin&quot; for the fires was never really explained. The focus was centered on the other aspect of the crimes. The ending could have been developed a little better. It left much to be desired. I look forward to reading her latest release, hoping the improvement trend continues."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"(1) I am not interested in Patricia Cornwell's political views, which seem to erupt from every character's mouth, esp. Scarpetta's. Is it possible she's changed editors? That would explain this phenomenon, as well as the (strange) new books w/o Scarpetta as a hero, all of which are in desperate need of editing. It's fairly typical for a bestselling author to suffer under bad editing b/c people feel they can't say anything to her.(2). Why kill Benton Wesley? He was the only thing that made Scarpetta seem even vaguely human.(3). What is the purpose of the Lucy character? She seems to be getting weirder and weirder. If the point is to show that political conservatives (Scarpetta) can accept and lesbians, even though lesbians are inherently screwy and constitute a serious security risk, well, I am still not convinced."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Kay really takes control of your emotions as this thriller is one that you just can't put down. Carrie is on a mission, and Kay is as well. Their collision is like two freight trains clashing into Patricia's best ever. Is it me, or are there other readers who put Patricia's face from the back of the book and picture Kay with that slick smile?"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Point of Origin, by Patricia Daniels Cornwell, was just as good as the others were. This book has Kay, a Virginia Medical Examiner, and Benton, a profiler, together as a couple. Kay is called to the scene of a fire along with her niece, Lucy. Kay&#8217;s office is located in Richmond, Virginig while the crime scene happened in Warrenton, Virginia. Lucy is struggling with her lesbian lifestyle. Her ex-girlfriend, Carrie Grethen, broke out of jail and is coming after anyone in connection with Lucy. (...) This book brings to realization the truths of how inhuman humans can be."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"...but I'm glad that I read it. I enjoy Cornwell's Scarpetta series because it is thrilling and interesting. I am a big forensics fan. However, I felt as though Point of Origin was more like a technical manual than a story. I feel that From Potter's Field was her best book."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Cornwell's Kay Scapetta series is wonderful. This book was definitely up to par with the others. In this book Kay is trying to solve various murders that are masked by arson. She and her niece Lucy work together on trying to unravel the mystery. For those who follow the series, Carrie Grethen is back and badder than ever. The final chapters of the book are quick paced and exciting - the ending is unexpected!!!Once again, PC has done a wonderful job of bringing Kay to life and bringing the reader into the story. I can't wait for the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Patricia Cornwell has once again dazzled me with her inspirational heroin Kay Scarpetta. She captured every feeling imaginable for every character(Kay, Lucy, Marino, and Benton).She explains all the details so that you can get a real vivid picture in your mind, between the forensics and crime scenes. Absolutely outstanding. The only thing that disappoints me is one of the beloved characters will no longer entertain us. I am looking forward to her next book that I am going to purchase as soon as I can find a copy. Thank you Patricia, KEEP UP TO GOOD WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This outing of Dr. Kay and her unfortunate niece has some genuinely shocking plot twists that are both saddening and unforgettable. Faced with the ongoing battle with crazy lady Carrie Grethen, the feminine duo face hostile attorneys, judges,fires, and career hurdles as they match wits with cold and deadly killers. From riveting beginning to heartbreaking end, this horrific page turner is totally compelling."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This was my first Patricia Cornwell book, and I should have read Body Farm first. The characters and plotline are a carryover from Body Farm. The book was a quick read, and for the most part, the action intrigued me. The autopsy details were fascinating. However, the ending was unrealistic and dissappointing. I cannot believe the psycho killer could possibly get into the head of Kay Scarpetta and anticipate her every move. There were also some unanswered questions that left me unsatisfied. I did appreciate most of the locale, however, since I have been to most of the sites."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I found this book to be much better than unatural exposure. I agree with the reader who stated that the Kay novels should end at this point. Point got a little more personal than Unatural did. There are definetly more issues to deal with personally. I agree with the fact that Pat did not embelish on the foal or the actual point of origin. I am inspired to read the previous Kay novels, to really get a feel for Unatural and Point."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have read most of Ms. Cornwell's novels and was sadly disappointed in this one. While I usually enjoy the scientific detail in her books, I found this one tedious and hard to follow. I didn't even shed a tear over you-know-who! At any rate, hopefully the next one will be better!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This was my first Patricia Cornwell and I assure you, it will not be the last. This amazing and very knowledgeable author is not only a pleasure but a priviledge to read. Her plot is very well developed (having accidently listened to the last tape first I was able to get a sense of how she built her plot) I like best her excruciating attention to detail, right down to the physical landmarks of the settings for scenes in the book. She must research these details exhaustively and in addition to her medical knowledge makes for a very enlightening read. I felt as if I were at every place, peering over the investigators hands as she performed autopsy's and sifted through physical and logical evidence. I was riveted!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Ms. Cornwell brings us her 9th thriller featuring ME Dr. Kay Scarpetta. In &quot;Point Of Origin&quot;, there are several plots twisting and turning the reader. Sick psycho Carrie returns from &quot;Body Farm&quot; to threaten Kay and retired FBI boyfriend Benton Wesley. Add a special assignment from the government, to now help forensically in the case of a burnt to the ground horse farm...including a body, and Dr. Kay has her hands full.I enjoyed this book. However, at times I felt the scenes were perhaps overwritten, clogging down the penned rich rhythms we are accustomed to. Or, maybe there was just TOO much going on.....rather dizzying, like several kittens bouncing about with frazzled balls of colorful yarn.Ms. Cornwell apparently was getting EVERYTHING in to complete this series. And for Scarpetta fans, there are some sad endings besides the series.Still a classic Cornwell chiller.Thanks for your interests &amp; comments--CDS"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This Scarpetta novel is far darker than the previous books, and yet is one you will be unable to put down. Cornwell is at her best with further exploration of the main characters that give the reader a real insight into their minds. As ever, if you have not read a Scarpetta before, it doesn't matter as the gaps are filled in for you, but it will compell you to read the rest, so be prepared to get your money out. The storyline is original and fast moving, leaving you to guess and wonder. The finale is gripping, disturbing, but ulitmately satisfying,(well as satisfying as mystery novel endings ever are). I would definitely recommend this book, it is the best cornwell I have read yet, and I eagerly await the next one!!!!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"If you like the type of woman Scarpetta is, like to connect with the darker side of yourself, and like good food, this is for you.For those familiar with Scarpetta and crew, this book is much darker than any of the previous ones. The crimes are brought much closer home, so to speak. Not only does Scarpetta have to do brilliant forensic pathology and semi-intuitive detective work, but also this time it's deeply, intensely personal.I also much like the fact that most of the characters seem to have grown, and not just physically.I'm looking forward to my next fix of Scarpetta."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Hi there surfers! Well, I feel proud to comment this book, can't loose this opportunity (die hard fan or not!). If my english is poor: sorry, I'm not from an english speaking country. Now to the book. Like I mentioned abov: a 3-day adventure. As usual, I couldn't stop. It was good because all the carachters stand out in a superb way. Also, I think it's always good to deal with old enemies once and for all. It made me think, laugh, cry, dream, shiver and love Cornwell even more. Miss Cornwell, thanx for your work. And Amazon.com: thanx for the space here!!!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Although the book may have been well written, better than a lot of the drivel out there, I was disappointed in PC. Do relatives of gays/lesbians really dwell that much on the subject? Who cares? I think I liked Lucy better when she was an unbelievable child prodigy.This book would have been better if she could have just come up with an original villian. The forensics and investigation of the fire scenes were great.I have read Cornwell for years, but if this doesn't pick up..."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I agree with an earlier comment: I'm tired of Scarpetta's perfection (and seemingly endless list of accomplishments -- lawyer, doctor, scuba diver, gourmet cook, helicopter pilot, law enforcer ...) Her whining egotism is annoying and makes me wish for her death. Then maybe the fat, sloppy Marino could reveal that he has been the brains behind all of her cases. PC's Scarpetta and Lucy characters seem created to illustrate that if one is female and brillant then she is doomed to a depressing life of unstable relationships and must suffer the jealousy of the all the uneducated, ignorant people around her. Even in PC's earlier and better books Scarpetta's arrogance was somewhat offsetting, but many 'famous' detectives suffer that flaw. The recycled villians are tiring. The plot is thin and unbelievable. Certainly, we must have an evil villian, but must we brood forever about evil -- some one actually happy in one of PC's novels would be novel. I would not recommend this book. I have already donated mine to a recycling center."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I think PC shot herself in the foot by getting rid of Benton. He served as the needed balance to the three other emotionally charged main characters. Logical, sensitive and calm. They turned to him in trouble. Another point, he was professional and smart. Old FBI. He was too well trained to go into a situation without backup. Remember, he was a profiler."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This entry in the series was the least enjoyable in recent memory. So much death and blood it is no wonder everybody seems on the verge of suicide. Kay clearly hates her work but continues to be attracted to death like a moth to a flame. She really needs to do something different. Maybe a good family practice for the next book will set her straight. Ms Cornwell is still among the best of this genre and I will await the next book to see if Kate plunges further into depression but I do long for some of the fresh originality of the earlier efforts."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I thought this a great book. It is one of her best. when I started reding it I couldn't put it down, It was moving and intriguing"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"My condolences to those who read about Benton's death in reviews rather than in the book, but as a long time Cornwell fan, I too felt the need to declare my heartache and disappointment at Benton's demise. Point of Origin has all the ingredients of another engaging Scarpetta mystery. But then end is a huge let-down. The final confrontation with Carrie the psycho-bitch has a blind intensity and master of description Cornwell loses the reader in a helicopter ride over the sea. I read this book in three days, as I read all my Cornwell books like I'm savoring last meal. And I have never cried while reading a book, until P of O. I crave a new installment to the Scarpetta stories, although I hope Pat Cornwell will mend our hearts and restore our faith in her as an author in July."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"IS THIS THE LAST OF DOC K ALL THOSE LITTLE LOOSE ENDS AND BITS OF CASES DURING THE OTHER BOOKS OUR BROUGHT TOGETHER IN WHAT SHOULD BE THE BEST STORY YET . BUT IT ISNT I GET THE FEELING THAT PC IS GETTING LAZY RIDING THE WAVE OF HER PAST SUCCESSES. ALTHOUGH HAVING SAID THAT THE BOOK DOES PICK UP ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH ALMOST GETTING BACK TO THE PC OF OLD. I THINK IT WILL BE A WHILE BEFORE ANOTHER DOC K STORY ARRIVES DUE TO THE ENDING IN P OF O OR IT COULD BE THE LAST . BUT LETS HOPE NOT."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I thought the book was excellent, however, after reading all the other Scarpetta mysteries, this one didn't keep my interest as well. So, instead of only taking 2 or 3 days to read, it took 5! She is an awesome writer! I was very disappointed that Benton died. He could have become a bigger part in her series. Surely even Dr. Scarpetta deserves some happiness! I have to say I have never been so engrossed by books like I have these! I love her and hope Kay Scarpetta books will keep coming for a long time!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"After being somewhat disappointed by recent Cornwell efforts, I almost didn't pick this one up, but I have to say that I'm glad I did. In fact, I read it in one sitting! My only gripe was the ending. It read like it was thrown together as an afterthought, no real excitement. But hey, they are her characters! I'm looking forward to Black Notice."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"As intense and suspenseful as The Triumph and the Glory&quot;, as fast-paced as anything Cornwell has ever given us, and as satisfying at the end as one could ask, Point of Origin is a must-read. I really enjoyed it and I'm pretty hard to please."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Her best yet! I laughed and cried while reading this book. However, if you haven't read any of her other &quot;Scarpetta&quot; series, DO NOT read this one first. It seemed to be the grand finale of the scarpetta series, and was my favorite by far. Brilliant and heart felt writing! I felt as if I personally knew the characters. Start with some other of her Scarpetta novels and you'll be hooked!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I really enjoyed Patricia Cornwell's first few books. I found Scarpetta engaging, even though she seems somewhat right wing to me, supporting guns, capital punishment and worshiping various law enforcement agencies as though they can do no wrong.However as the books have continued I have found them less and less enjoyable. This business of carrying baddies over several books is tedious and predictable. The love interest with Benson is, for me, a complete turn off. The best thing as far as I am concerned is towards the end of the book - I think some reviewers have unfairly blown the gaff on this one but I will remain vague.Lucy is a pain."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I love all Patricia's books and hopefully someday we'll see movies made out of them???"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Point of Origin contains the usual Cornwell trademarks - technical detail, action, and suspense. The author also includes past characters , creating a link to other books, thereby giving the reader a feeling that he is part of the story. However, the ending left me dissatisfied. Ms Cornwell seemed in a hurry to get rid of the antagonists. The final confrontation could not actually be called a &quot;face off,&quot; since they do not meet face to face. Even with this small discrepancy, though, Point of Origin still kept me reading when I should have been working."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Only &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot; kept me as spellbound as Cornwell's newest book. &quot;Point of Origin&quot; is very, very good, I think it is her best in several years, and you would do well to give it a try. I hope you do, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Just finished Point of Origin and was totally exhausted. This was a truly amazing, gut wrenching, suspenseful book. Once I started I had to force myself to take a break at 3:00 a.m. I always come away learning something and slightly terrified.....ABSOLUTELY GREAT!!!I can't wait to get the next book but until then I will definitely re-read this one, slower this time to digest all the little clues and atmosphere the author so expertly provides.I recommend starting at the beginning of the Scarpetta series to get to know her and the circle of characters that surround her."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I was excited, obsessed, devastated, and elated, and those are just a few of my emotions. I really felt that this book portrayed a more human side to Kay Scarpetta. This book was far more clinical and graphic than some of it's predecesors, but it was really important to the whole storyline. Patricia Cornwell has become one of my favorite authors, and I think that she really has outdone herself with this book. I anxiously await the next."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"As usual, Patricia Cornwell has written a wonderfully exciting medical mystery that kept me glued from beginning to end. I enjoyed this book because of its plot direction and end-of-my-seat suspense. Additionally, the reappearance of a previous character, Carrie, brings an entirely new element to this story - previous readers know this character and want some type of resolution, especially me! Patricia Cornwell resurrects previous characters, namely Benton, Marino and her niece, Lucy. I, for one, love these characters and always want to read more about them. Furthermore, this book truly rounded out these characters for me, as I learned more about them in this particular novel. Finally, the author is not afraid to take chances with her work; while I may not always agree with her plot twists on a personally emotional level, Patricia Cornwell definitely knows what she's doing!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"After Unatural Causes I was hesitant to buy Point of Origin,eventhough I find Kay Scarpetta so intriguing. But PoO is super, agreat read, could not put it down."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Cornwall is backing herself into a corner with her misery - aren't any of her characters allowed any happiness? She's only got Lucy, Marino or herslf to kill off - lighten up - writer,"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Point of Origin is in keeping with the Cornwell we have come to know and love. Her best book still remains Post Mortem. This book rates a very close second. I found the ending to be alittle weak and lacking in satisfaction; anti-climatic. There were also changes in the characters that went without explanation, such as Lucy's resignation from the FBI. Carrie's partner preformed unspeakable atrocities, yet the character was neither introduced or developed. He was simply alluded to. Temple Gault was much more horrifying. When does the next book hit the stands?"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"She's done it again. Just when I think that Cornwell couldn't repeat a triumph with Kay Scarpetta, she blows me over again. I can just visualize Kay doing the autopsy on the young woman who dies in the first fire, I can feel her love and protectiveness towards her niece Lucy, and I held off my grief until the very end, until Kay had finished the job. Cornwell knows how to get the reader involved in and caring about her characters. I wish it had ended differently in one respect but I understand why it didn't and I respect Cornwell's integrity towards her characters. She is always true to them, no matter what. Kay Scarpetta is someone who I wish were real and I would enjoy being her friend."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Ever since I read my first Patricia Cornwell novel, which happened to be &quot;Body of Evidence&quot;, I have eagerly anticipated her books. I then read &quot;Postmortem&quot; and every one since. I cannot tell you how much I love her books. &quot;Point of Origin&quot; was wonderful. I read it in two days. I couldn't put it down. Her style of writing makes you want to start reading it all over again. When's the next one coming out again?"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"One of the best Scarpetta books so far. I have to tell you I have been waiting for her next scarpetta book to come out. I really didn't think she could write another Scarpetta book as well as she did the others. I stand corrected, by far this is one of her best. If you haven't read it you should. If you have read it read it again. Cornwell is my favorite author because of books like this. Go out and get a copy today."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Good authors build characters until they become alive to thereader. Kay became a selfish autocratic person in this episodeIf idea is to introduce new romance interest forget it, or go for it, I don't care. I will not be buying anymore."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I feel that PC has touched up on certain aspects of her plot (like her habit of always making Kay out into Wonderwoman), and as she said in her Amazon interview, PoO is sinister, a lot darker than the rest of the series. Yet I could not help but feel a tad disappointed at the way she chose to solve the 'main mystery' this time round, and yes, I did think some parts were rather contrived and well am I going to say this - commercialised. Still, if you are a PC fan, like I am, you will buy the book and you should too!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I enjoy PCornwell's writing. I've read all her novels and find that while the technical stuff I enjoy is still present, there are pages of introspective, depressing thoughts from the character that bogs down the story. No one has even a halfway decent life to look forward to. I like to read to escape. After I read this, I felt like I was on my way to a morgue somewhere."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I couldn't wait to get my hands on the latest Scarpetta novel. I have read all of the Scarpetta books, and I have to say this was a bit disappointing. I enjoyed the technical aspects of the story, and found that interesting. The characters however, have not grown much over the years. Kay is still insecure about her status with Benton and seems stingy with the emotional follow-through in that relationship. Lucy is still the lonely genius with an attitude. Speaking of Lucy, why is it still such an issue that she is gay? Wasn't that covered in the last few books? Marino is still the cynical cop, looking for love when we all know it's Kay he truly wants. I would like to see these characters move forward a little. The plot was fine. Overall, this was not my favorite, but being a Cornwell fan....I had to finish it. Hopefully the next book in the series gets back to Cornwell's earlier work - which was much more interesting and left me intrigued."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I usually look forward to Ms. Cornwell's books but this one,although a very quick read, left me saying &quot;so, where's thebeef?&quot; . It'a slmost like Ms. Cornwell is running out of ideas...."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"The most suspenseful thing about this book was waiting for it to arrive in the mail. I am a longtime Cornwell fan and have been looking forward to the next Scarpetta novel for a while now. However, I was disappointed in this one. All of the major characters, without exception, seem to be getting old and tired. I halfway expected them to all be killed off by the end of the book, because it seemed like the author didn't like them anymore. Cornwell still includes the elements that I love such as all the forensic information, but it seems she got more caught up in the prose this time. The &quot;climax&quot; of the novel (getting the bad guy) was too easy. Had it been a movie, it would have been over in 2 minutes flat. Overall, this book felt like a character development novel. I felt like the only reason there was an antagonist and a gruesome crime was to give the characters a reason to talk about themselves and how they feel. The plot got lost in the prose. Sorr! ! y, Patricia. However, I'll still be waiting for the next one."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I really enjoyed Point of Origin. There is no sentimentality, Scarpetta still cannot enjoy a happy love life and i enjoyed this realism. It was great to see Lucy back and i look forward to when Lucy can start to take on her own cases."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I'm not sure if it's because Cornwell has written (and I've read) everything there is to know about Kay Scarpetta, or if Cornwell has fallen a victim to her own success, but she's lost me as a reader.I miss the tight writing and real tension of the past. This book is overwritten, full of stupid phrases, and Kay Scarpetta has become a laughable caricature of her former self. And in typical &quot;I'm out of good ideas&quot; behavior, Cornwell resorts to bringing back a tired villan to try and spice things up. It doesn't work. Yawn."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"As a Corwell addict, I too rushed to grab her latest effort,Point of Origin. At first the new MO of fire appealed to me. I wasdetermined to devour this book as I had all the previous ones.I felt a bit let down by Point. All started out well, sharing developments in the personal lives of Benton, Lucy, etc. What followed was a long chasm of non-activity through the middle of the book. Still having faith, I hung in there, waiting for another strong climactic ending like From Potter's Field. The ending came very late, and lacked strong build up, and certainly details. Quite frankly, it was so open ended that it reminded me of a soap opera.Also, there were several doors left open for future developments and some new characters, which would breathe much needed life into the series.I do! ! recommend reading the books in order, as well as Hornet's Nest. Reading HN just before Point was fun. Quite frankly, I could see a series developing from HN. Would be time away from Kay and Co. to approach crime from a new angle."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I just finished Point of Origin and have to admit that it was darker than most of her others. I hated Hornets Nest, so I figured Ms Cornwell could only improve with this one. Like another reader, I would have liked to learn more about how the fires started, burned so hot, etc. Her technical stuff was top notch, as always. I think Ms. Cornwell needs to lighten up a bit, though. Look forward to her next Scarpetta novel."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This is probably not the best Cornwell, but she has constructed a story packed with interesting, intimate technical information and insights of a coroner's office and on pyrography. The story builds well and, for the most part, is engrossing -- only occasionally enmired in minutia (and even that can be overlooked). Crusty old Detective Marino, Chief Medical Examiner Kay Scarpetta and her brilliant niece Lucy are back and up to their good deeds. Point of Origin is both entertaining and intelligent, although the ending is too fast and more contrived than should be acceptable in a story such as this. Otherwise, certainly worth the time."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Can't really discuss certain things of how I felt without giving away certain things. It was a wonderful book and as usual you can't put it down. Once you open the book to the last page you are riveted to your seat."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Congratulations to Cornwell on her latest work! I was grabbed from the beginning and couldn't put it down. The investigations are, as always, surprisingly accurate and edge of the seat suspense while you're thinking &quot;What will turn up next.&quot;"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"First, I must warn you that some of the reviews that follow reveal major plot points. I am still angry at the &quot;reader from Brooklyn&quot; who spoiled what would have been a suprise for me. If you don't want the plot spoiled for you, read cautiously!I have read all the Scarpetta novels, and I am afraid I am disappointed in this one. Definately NOT one of her better efforts. It is somewhat revisionist and very dark and grim. It is not something I would recommend if you are already depressed.I'm hoping Patricia gets into a better mood for the next one!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have actually not read this book yet, and now probably won't because of what I've just read in some of your reviews. I am an avid reader and I would like to remind all who send in reviews that many times potential buyers (like myself) read these reviews to see if this is a book worth purchasing. By revealing endings and pertinent facts/events in your review, you ruin it for those of us who might otherwise have purchased the book. If you feel you MUST include these things in your review, please be considerate and alert the reader first, so we can stop reading and not get information that would ruin it for us, possibly causing us to miss out on a book we might otherwise have gotten great enjoyment from. Thank you."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This book kept me personally on the edge of my seat. It was refered to me by a friend and I thouroughly enjoyed it. It was an action packed mystery that included &quot;adventures&quot; of Dr. Kay Scarpetta and her Antagonist Carrie Gretchen. It really puts you ine setting...(It kept me up at night). Point of Origin was the first Cornwell book i have read and it led me to enjoy others such as From Potter's Feild and Bodycount. I inquire those of you who are Mystery or Patricia Cornwell bluffs to read it.~A new found Patricia Cornwell Bluff in Arizona"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"THIS IS THE THIRD PATRICIA CORNWELLBOOK I'VE READ.

Skip them if you want to enjoy the book. I read the reviews, and was really upset that so much of the plot was given away. This is a good book, darker than usual, and much more depressing. I have been a Scarpetta fan, and I liked it."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I am still reeling from this book. Truly, the most dark and depressing book I have ever read. I like others who read and reviewed, I only finished hoping that &quot;all was not doomed&quot;. Not so. I really like the &quot;Sipowitz-type&quot; character of Pete Marino and the honesty he and Kay Scarpetta shared. This book was morbid and forboding with numerous loose ends to questions never answered. What happened to Kenneth Sparkes? How did that colt survive and why? This book focused so much on the lesbian relationship of Lucy. Do all aunts get this involved with their niece's personal lives? Why kill off Benton when it was the only bright spot in Kay's life? I am not a forensic pathologist, but Kay definitely needs to find another line of work. The blood and gore is getting to her. I will not be reading Cornwell's next novel. I read for escape and frankly, these characters have gotten way too depressing for me. Something in Ms. Cornwell's personal life must be very dark and tragic. It shows in this book."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I've loved the Kay Scarpetta series, but this one felt old, angry, and tired. Lucy should be beyond the rebellious years, and her constant struggles with Kay are a bit too much clash for my liking. It feels as if the series is in decline. Although the storyline was intriguing and the plot intense, I am not looking forward to the next (if there is one) Kay Scarpetta novel."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I'd heard of Patricia Cornwell and her medical examiner protagonist before, but hadn't read one of the series until this one. Perhaps the previous books were better, but frankly, I don't think this book would have been accepted by a publisher if it wasn't &quot;Halloween XVXIII&quot; so to speak. Nothing really made sense. Why was one colt spared the fire? How did the fires start anyway (we learn that they're ignited with magnesium, which is conveniently incorporated into cuts on the victims, but not what continues to feed them). What ever becomes of Kenneth Sparkes? What about the morning phone calls (Scarpetta &quot;just knows&quot; all of a sudden that they're from the parents of a boy who died for lack of medical care, and that clairvoyant knowledge is meant to satisfy us as much as it evidently satisfies Scarpetta). And so on. And so on. To say that the plot is weak is too generous - it scarcely has a plot at all. Nor is it a novel of character. Benton shows up briefly, smelling good, and then vanishes again. We're told he's too samrt to get careless, but although he knows that he's being stalked by a psycho killer who has a male accomplice, when a male calls and says he has info about the psycho killer, Benton goes off to meet him in a dark and lonely place. &quot;Hey, Benton! When you hear something eerie in the basement in a horror movie, don't go down there&quot;! But this is all third hand - the man only has two brief scenes and about three lines of dialogue. Then there's Lucy, who just walks around in a sort of perpetual huff. And Marino, who sweats mostly. And finally there's Scarpetta, who has Dark Emotion. We are told so, more or less, just as we're told that she's a genius. But she never thinks any particularly ingenious thoughts, and her insight into her own or any other emotion is about as deep as Dr. Laura Schlesinger's - mostly, she disapproves of stuff, just in general. And although some readers seem to find &quot;the technical details&quot; compelling, all of them are extremely superficial, and amount to little more than canned quotes pasted onto the page. As &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; demonstrated, there is an audience that is content just to be given stage directions. &quot;Kay is suffering. Kay feels pain. Kay has a brilliant insight&quot;. But if you expect to be convinced or instructed rather than just told, and if you like a plot that makes a bit more sense than a disorganised morbid daydream, skip this book."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Fair warning to Cornwell fans: I have enjoyed the Kay Scarpetta series for years, but this one was so excessively gory that I won't buy another Cornwell book. If you're new to reading Patricia Cornwell, I would recommend starting at the beginning of the series and skipping this one."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have found the relationship between Lucy and Aunt Kay very intriguing and tight from the start, thus I'm glad that Cornwell has put more weight on the emotional configurations of the characters in this book. Glad that Marino is still hanging around, as I have found him to be a superb comic relief compared to the charged characterization of the wonderful female characters. However, Benton's gruesome death seems tear jerking, and would have been much better if he were to be missing etc. rather than being charred and grilled. All in all, it kept me awake through the night and was a good read. Looking forward to more Lucy and Kay."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I did not like this book, Dr. Scarpetta's character is very negative of everything and everyone, including her friends and family. I have been a fan for a long time and I was really suprised and disappointed by this book."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Naturally, a book dealing with a medical examiner's office will be gruesome to a degree, but some of the violent acts committed by the killers was on par with Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal. While some may feel upset about a certain character's death, I felt that it added to the novel; gave a sense of reality that life doesn't always have a happy ending, and that people in crime novels aren't always invincible. Certain parts of this book were downright creepy, and kept me from getting to bed...I was too busy turning the pages. I feel it's one of her best."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"My tastes run more to mainstream fiction like &quot;Stones From the River&quot; or &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot;, but Cornwell's skill with this genre she pretty much invented herself establishes her books as must reads for anyone who loves great novels no matter what their focus. I found &quot;Point of Origin&quot; a little uneven, and the ending was off a bit, but all in all I was very entertained by it. It is not as good as her earlier novels but still a four star effort in my book."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Scarpetta's emotional roller coaster totally obscures the plot. It seems that she can't move forward on any evidence, or have any conversation without dragging out her concerns for Lucy or herself or Benton and on and on and on. She bores me. I skipped and skimmed through at least half of this book. 300 pages of dragging emotional baggage (through bad writing), and then WHAM! the last 100 pages has Scarpetta single-handedly solving EVERYTHING! Come on! The worst of the series (and considering the last few entries, that makes this one pretty bad)."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have read all of the Kay Scarpetta books and have to say that this one was the most depressing blow to Kay. It was too much when Benton was killed off. Kay's entire existence seems to be based on her work and nothing of her personal life. She needs to have more to her character. Also, there were too many questions left unanswered in the end. It seems repetitive to keep having the same villains in the stories."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Not the best of her books, but definitely the most emotional of the books. Cornwell has become one of my favorite writers, but this novel fell short. The plot was good, but not well developed. The relationships between her characters seem strained. Dr. Scarpetta seems unusually overprotective and overbearing toward her niece, Lucy, and the exit of Benton was a poor choice especially since their relationship was just starting to take off. Hopefully the next book will pull her out of the rut of her last few bad efforts."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I've read ALL her previous books, and just loved the first few. But the last few have gotten so trite and poorly-written that I'm tempted to think that she hired a ghostwriter in those early years.I had no problem with the gory technical details - in fact they were the best parts of the book, but I was dismayed by the relentless self-involvement of Scarpetta, the annoying and stale rebelliousness of Lucy, the constant use of brand names and acronyms as a band-aid for much-needed verisimulitude, the stupid plot, loose ends (the lone colt? how did the magnesium get into the wounds?), recycling of an uninteresting and old nemesis, and again the bad guy has this PERSONAL thing with Scarpetta. She's much more interesting when the cases she's working are NOT so directly related to her personal life. Marino was always a cardboard stock figure, but now Lucy and Benton are completely predictable too.This is the last of the series for me. My reading time is too precious to waste on swill. What a tragedy that PC has allowed this to happen."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Whilst the story might have been very good, the narration was disappointing. Often it was monotone and difficult to follow."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I am totally hooked on the Scarpetta series. Point of Origin was the first book I have read. A page turner from start to finish, I highly reccomend it and I am eagerly awaiting the delivery of the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I literally could NOT put this down! I was reading at stoplights, in line at the DMV, EVERYWHERE I COULD! This is one of the best yet from Cornwell! I enjoy her relationships with the recurring characters. I think these relationships help humanize Scarpetta. We don't just see her as a doctor, but as a person, too. Cornwell does a great job integrating the stresses and difficulties of Scarpetta's professional life with the stresses and difficulties of her personal life. The elements of this story-line worked great combining information from previous books with the new crimes being committed, the crimes being original and fresh compared to the usual slaugherings."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I just finished Point of Origin last night, and am still feeling the pain of the gut-renching ending this morning. Cornwell really outdid herself this time, delving as she did deeper and deeper into Scarpetta's emotional turmoil. It just seems so real to me, its kind of hard to explain. I've come to know and respect Scarpetta through all of PC's books, and now just feel so darn bad for her! The book is as quick a read as are all of PC's (with the possible exception of Hornet's Nest which I haven't read), and I predict many loyal Scarpetta fans, when they finish the book, will feel as hollow as I do this morning....."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This book did hold my interest, although her earlier books were more thrilling. Dr. Kay Scarpetta should have her own network televison show (like Quincy)."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I am a dedicated P. Cornwell fan, but was somewhat disappointed when I read &quot;Point of Origin&quot;. The CONTINUED story line of Lucy's trials and tribulations regarding her lesbian lover and the characters of Carrie Grethen and Temple Gault have been exhausted. I definitely think Scarpetta, Marino, and Benton Wesley need to move on. They're such great characters, but have gotten bogged down. Still, I'm eagerly awaiting the next Scarpetta novel."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed Cornwell's main characters in all of her Scarpetta books. They are very human and have problems just like the rest of us. Point of Origin brought back these characters I feel like I've gotten to know. I thought the plot was invigorating and found it difficult to put the book down. The fires, being again with Scarpetta in the morgue, deducing from the forensic clues, and having her persevere even in a time of tremendous personal tragedy make for a great read. And I'll just admit it--I think it's splendid for a woman to be a doctor and a lawyer. Cornwell's Scarpetta books are among the few I purchase in hardback--just can't wait for a library copy or the paperback. I'm anticipating another one--hope it will be soon."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Point of Origin is Patricia Cornwell's best effort in some time. After finding her last few Scarpetta books good but less compelling than the earlier works, I was pleased to find myself very drawn into this book. Too many readers think it is fashionable to bash Cornwell, when in fact they keep buying her books."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Definitely a page turner, one becomes totally involved; psychological processes and beautiful insights into real live people makes one want to re-define life's deep meaning. Kate is like a next door neighbor but, how can she take so much? Her strength, intelligence and character tend to make her a &quot;role model&quot; of sorts. This story has to have a continuation..., soon!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I enjoyed the continuation of the characters developed in the previous novels. The seeming loss of vigor and joy of life is very realistic since the loss is the result of slaying so many demons. Kay's determination and doubts are at odds in a very human way.If the novel reflects a declining joy on the part of the author to resurrect the characters for each new novel, I guess I can respect that and applaud her efforts. I know I have read and enjoyed all of her novels(Hornets Nest the least)."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I had to ask myself, after the impact this book had on me, why I would want to be subjected to such realistic depictions of horror and bottomless grief, but I was with Cornwell all the way on this one. Her emotional life seemed raw and real. I've never related to the character so much or been as caught up in the suspense and horror of one of her tales. I did find the description of the animals' suffering almost unreadable. As with the particularly cruel murder of a child in a previous story, I found myself wishing, if you'll excuse the overused expression, she wouldn't go there. Ditto the reader's having to picture the sadistic killing of one of the main characters (and aren't we all being responsible not to say which one). It was almost too wrenching. I'm still giving P.O.O. (!) five stars because I thought she reached a new level in every important way. I'm taken aback by the negative appraisals I've read. Just goes to show you how subjective it all is."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book and I was not disappointed. It was fast-paced and full of action. Cornwell's writing gets better with each new novel. I am already eagerly awaiting another one."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Postmortem, which won the Edgar award, was a great, intriguing mystery, with a somewhat disappointing ending. Sadly, each of Cornwell's subsequent books has been progressively worse, with Hornet's Nest nearing rock bottom. Point of Origin is at best a marginal improvement. After her miserable attempt at creating new characters in Hornet's Nest, Cornwell apparently decides to retread all too familiar ground. In her latest installment, she simply falls back on (ad nauseum) relationships and plots (even killers and their crimes) that she has already mangled. Perhaps she thought the additional gore would mask the fetid stench of her decaying storyline. -- Hey, if she can mix her melodramatic metaphors, so can I."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I enjoy the novels of Patricia Cornwell. When one comes out, I rush to buy it. After this one, I am not so sure that I will be in such a hurry next time. I feel sorry for Kay Scarpetta. She has no husband, no children, and an all-consuming job that no one in their right mind would want. After this novel, I feel even sorrier for her. She should have gone to Hilton Head. That was her first mistake. She should get some psychiatric help after this book. She is always putting down Marino, but that guy, at least, knows how to enjoy himself. Kay needs a life, a new man/woman, and a new career (teaching college or something). She's burning out."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I hounded the library until they got this book on the shelf. Once I got it, I didn't put it down until I finished it. Overall, I think this book was far and above Hornet's Nest, but not as good as her earlier work. Kay has become a familiar character, kind of like an old friend. However, I can't really evaluate this book fairly because of the terrible twist it takes. We know from the dust jacket that Carrie does something terrible to Kay on a personal level. However, when I read what it was, it just stopped me dead in my tracks and everything else after that just seemed to be so unimportant. I would recommend this book to any Cornwell fan. It will be very interesting to see where Ms. Cornwell takes us from here."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I finished reading Point of Origin two days ago, but didn't get a chance to get to the computer until today. I read the other reviews before I put fingers to keyboard. I get tired of reading about people who expect more from authors than a good, page turner of a story. If you want to cure the evils of the world, don't look to fiction for the answers.Patricia did a good job, and I for one am interested in what happens to the villains as time passes. It's a sad statement that Carrie was able to manipulate the system and do the things she does in the story.And as to the comment about the end of the main story from one reader, who knows what really happened? I seem to remember that appearances can be deceiving...Please keep up the good work. I'm recommending this to my pals."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"As a Cornwell fan who has read all of her books (other than the Ruth Bell Graham biography), I have been disappointed with the latest in the series. I must agree with other comments made here that I am tired of Temple and Carrie and would like to see some fresh villains. I was unsatisfied with the ending feeling that she left it too &quot;open&quot; for use in future books.I will continue to read her series and hope that she continues to write &quot;Scarpetta&quot; books because I feel so familiar with the characters. I do miss the feelings that I was left with after reading &quot;Body of Evidence&quot; and &quot;Postmortem&quot;."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Honestly, can't she come up with new villians?? Her killers come back to haunt Kay Scarpetta so often, I just want to giggle. Cornwell's writing is always fun to read; I just wish she'd give her villians other motives than a vendetta against Scarpetta and Benton Wesley. Cornwell seems too enamored of her own creation--Scarpetta should solve crimes, not be the cause of them (it's quite tiresome to hear Scarpetta bemoan her fate as a super-competent person--there are moments that I'd like to murder her too.) My advice-read if you must, but wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Patricia Cornwell has another winner with Point of Origin. The plot twists and turns, and as always takes her readers along for the thrilling, sometimes heartstopping ride. My only regret is that I could not put this book down, and it was over in a matter of hours! I am anxiously waiting to see what's next for Kay Scarpetta. I might just have to re-read some of my Scarpetta novels just so I don't have withdrawl while I wait! Kay come back soon!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Patrica Cornwell is the best mystery writer working today. A bad Scarpetta novel is still more entertaining than 9 out of 10 other novels. I was disapponited in the last three Scarpetta novels but I believe she is getting back on track. Point of Origin moved quickly and I could not put it down. I still prefer the first four novels, they seemed to have more emphasis on the crime and less on Kay's personal life. I would like for her to go back to more original storeylines. Hopefully this is really the end of Gualt and Carrie. Now if the tiresome Lucy would just be sent elsewhere once in awhile, we might be getting somewhere again. Marino is the best thing that ever happened to Kay do you think she will ever notice?"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"As a fan of Ms. Cornwell's previous work, this book was a big disappointment. This is a book that seems like it was intended to be a movie -- particularly the final &quot;confrontation&quot; (if it can be called that) between the &quot;good guys&quot; and the &quot;bad guys.&quot; The book has a good basic concept, similar to one Cornwell has used before, but fails in its execution. In particular, difficult points are glossed over rather than explained. This book is, at best, a good summer read. And it probably will make a decent movie."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Patricia Cornwell's last novel is her best since From Potter's Field. She weaves a web of intrigue and suspense that keeps you up late at night. The crimes and the reasons behind them are chilling and the truth sends a shiver up your spine. The book was all I expected and more. Point of Origin keeps pace with the technical detail aspect of her books that Cornwell fans expect. Also Point of Origin makes the reader realize, to a greater extent, the painful impact that Temple Gault and Carrie Grethen both had on the lives of Scarpetta and the ones she loves. It is the final chapter in the torment that Gault began in Cruel and Unusual. Point of Origin has fear, love, remorse, hate, and an array of other emotions that carry the reader into the lives of Scarpetta, Lucy, Marino, and Benton. When you finish the book you are ready for the next chapter in the lives of these characters. Point of Origin is Cornwell at the top of her game and is everything and so much more that her ! ! readers have come to expect over the years."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This book was not as captivating as some of the Cornwell books in this series; however, I was glad to see a hopeful end to some old villians and thought the personal tragedies suffered were a bit much. The readers have worked so hard to follow the personal relationships that have evolved and would like to see some stability in the personal side and more on the criminal side as Kay is a brillant character and should go back to her beginnings and get us more involved in the cases."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I can not recall the last time when I actually stopped readinga book I had bought because it was so bad. This series has gotten progressively worse over the past few years until it has reached a point where it is practically unreadable. Kay Scarpetta has become totally unlikeable, the dialogue stilted and unbelievable. Do yourself a favor and give this one a pass."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"this was a bog standard novel with a poor story which was not even properly explained in the end and it left loads of plot holes and red herrings just hanging in the air. It was full of poor spelling and even poorer grammar. It was also full of brand name dropping and bad characters. A friend recommended this book but I won't be passing on that dubious priviledge. We never even got to see the baddie in this book, after 400 pages! Though it is obvious this story is ripe for a sequel. Cornwell is also a sicko, killing off benton and those horses, and what about that horse that lived. The five star reviews must be from the official fan club, the one star reviews are from people who have read more widely than their local airport stockist."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I am stunned that anyone can praise this book and describe it as excellent or even good. I appreciate Cornwell's descriptions of the techniques used during autopsy as well as her ability to create an atmosphere of foreboding, but there must be something more than that to inspire adulation. Cornwell seems bent on using her novels as a soapbox for various social-political issues, with Scarpetta, Marino, and occasionally &quot;visiting characters&quot; as the mouthpieces. This is certainly the prerogative of any writer and is often managed by other writers with adroit skill--the weaving of elements into the fabric of the whole to present seamless transitions--but of late Cornwell does this with little finesse, sometimes stitching a diatribe into the story like an incongruous patch. Also irritatingly facile are those one-dimensionally corrupt characters, such as the lawyer in the psychiatric facility with her frumpy clothing, heavy body, wild frizzy hair, and ponderous breasts--characteristics seemingly meant to convey as much as the woman's cold arrogance and misdeeds how despicable she is. I have read and enjoyed the earlier Scarpetta novels, but will no longer waste my time with any new novels unless I hear that Cornwell has rediscovered the inspiration that made the first volumes so absorbing."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I really did not like this book for many reasons. I especially hated the ending. Lucy continues to get on my nerves. I will definitely read her earlier books again since I liked them better than these newer ones."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I really don't like to criticize as I think it takes a great deal of talent to write to begin with. However, I feel compelled to do so due to the amount of effort that I've put into starting Ms. Cornwell's books. I have spent many months looking for her first book and finally chose this one instead. Bad choice! This book will be my &quot;first&quot; and last. I've read the other reviews and am flabergasted over the &quot;great&quot; comments - some of them claiming it to be the &quot;best&quot;! Wow! PC actually introduced a clue without any follow-up! The clue was never mentioned again (can YOU remember what it was?)! PoO was not THE most mind-knumbing book I've had the dubious privilege of plodding through, but it certainly ranks right up there. The ME's character did a lot of nerve-grating whining throughout the chapters and the plot didn't really have any direction...This piece of &quot;factual&quot; fiction put me into such a state that I can't even tell you how the thing ended because I was comotose by then. Now that time has passed, my coma has lifted and I hope to overcome Cornwell's miasma. The fact that I feel this way is a great sadness to me."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I thought that this book lack what every other book did. Cornwell did not fully explain the point of origins of the fires. I also did not like the fact that Kay had finally found someone she truly loved and loved her and was cut from the series. there was no point. Is she going to pine away as a lonely divorcee? Lucy is becoming a more interesting character though. As the series has progressed, Lucy has slowly become a real character, not just the smart niece."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Point of Origin was my second Cornwell novel. It was without doubt the best book I have read all year, and inspired me to read all the other Cornwell books. I agree that Cornwell's plots and characters can be predictable and that the narration can leave a lot to be desired. However, nobody can match Cornwell for the sheer tension in her novels, and the insight she gives into her lead character - Scarpetta's demons become our demons. We share her world and her fears, right down to the medical details in the autopsy rooms. When Benton dies, we feel her grief. Those who say Scarpetta is depressing miss the point. I cried when Benton died. I have not found another book to affect me so profoundly."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Point of Origin got off to a good start, but at some point Patricia Cornwell seemed to get lost in her own plot. The conclusion has an almost &quot;deus ex machina&quot; effect as Cornwell finds her culprit in a character who is mentioned but never actually introduced. To link this culprit to murders introduced in an earlier work without any evident association is stretching the reader's credulity to the breaking point. And to simply &quot;kill off&quot; a major recurring character -- unforgiveable! I have long been a fan of Ms Cornwell's books -- have read all of them -- but Point of Origin was indeed a disappointment."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"The early Kay Scarpetta novels are quite good, but by this point Cornwell's just going through the motions. This novel lacks for just about everything. I think it was only inertia which kept me going to its completely unsatisfactory ending."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I was going to Colo on a late-summer family reunion. I hate to fly. I asked a fellow teacher abt. what's good in mystery bks. these days and she said &quot;Patricia Cornwell.&quot; I bought it and a re-issue of Raymond Chandler, but I packed Cornwell in my carry-on.She seduced me. Attractive, older, smart (an M.E.after all),committed, etc. I couldn't put it down until I wished I had. . . at the end. It pissed me off. C'mon. I followed Kay from one end of the East coast to the other; I worried with her about Lucy; I commiserated with Lucy and Benton about the FBI; and at the end I don't even get to see!!!!!!!!!!! my (our) enemy?! It's a cop-out on Cornwell's part. She's writing to get screened-up and filmed. The last scene with the helos? Right out of _________! You name it, &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; Van Damme, Schwartzeneiger.But &quot;once bitten, twice shy&quot; no mo' money on Kay.And while I'm at it, Tom Wolfe did the same thing with &quot;A Man In Full.&quot; What's wrong with these guys? Once they get it up, they can't keep it up till the story's over?Shi' man, it's all just chewin' gum."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I really, really wanted to enjoy this book -- I bought it to read on a 23-hour flight! The fact that I have picked it up again, two months after getting home, and find a boarding pass marking page 33 (when I gave up on it) tells the story. This book is so over-written and completely lacking in humanity and humor that it could not even while a plane journey away. I thought at the time that I was perhaps not being fair, being jetlagged already, so have picked it up several times since getting back home. But so far I have not got much farther than the boarding pass. This book does not even read as if it was written by Patricia Cornwell. I loved her first few books, and physician friends agree that she never put a foot wrong in her description of autopsies, but boy, this one is really bad. Give it a miss, if you are a new Cornwell reader; read the earlier ones instead."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Point of Origin was the first Kay Scarpetta novel to make me cry. I don't think I can forgive Patricia Cornwell for 'killing' one of the main characters, but that doesn't mean that I didn't think this was yet another brilliant story. It's amazing how Patricia Cornwell manages to grab my attention from the first few sentences of every book she writes. Everytime she publishes a new Scarpetta novel, it's like meeting up with old friends, Kay, Lucy and Marino. Point of Origin is a sort of cry for more humanity in the world, and this message is wrapped up and spoken out by Kay, who is heartbroken throughout most of the book. The scene in which she discovers the body in the burnt-down house made me cry so much, especially as, as every reader knows, this man meant so much to Kay. I am now reading 'Black Notice' and the letter at the beginning of the book made this feeling come back and I cried again."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have enjoyed the previous books with Dr. Scarpetta but thethrill is wearing off. The character is really starting to work on mynerves. Cornwell has created a saintly snob. The good doctor can do no wrong while the people around her have many flaws. The story gets off track with constant attention being given to Lucy and her lesbian lover. I felt like Cornwell was preaching instead of entertaining. The constant references to money were annoying. Expensive house, car, watch, etc. I wanted more suspense and interesting crime solving techniques. This book became a &quot;poor Lucy&quot; story with Kay whinning about Benton. To love or not to love! ... Carrie's accomplice was hard to believe. I hope the next book will stick more to the crime. Better luck next time Cornwell!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This is my last Patricia Cornwell book, or at least the last &quot;Kay Scarpetta, M.E.&quot; book. Patricia Cornwell makes this character so pretentious it's hard to concentrate on the plot. I really tired of reading long descriptive passages about her perfectly appointed house, her car, the vintage wines she drinks, Benton's watch, and on and on. The story lines are usually interesting and exciting, but not worth suffering through endless accounts of Dr. Kay's wealth and privileged lifestyle ad nauseum. Not only is everything she has the best, most expensive, rare, etc., but things are described in minute detail. This is not Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. Goodbye, doc."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"In \`Point of Origin' Patricia Cornwell is following the lead of James Patterson's protagonist Alex Cross. Once again we are confronted with the essence of evil in the guise of a manipulative serial killer that works her way from one book to the next. By comparing the Scarpetta series with the Cross you would be right to leap to the conclusion that I am laying a major insult on Cornwell. Patterson has proven himself to be the most craven and laziest author at work today, concerned only with making a quick buck on the hapless reader. But where Patterson has utterly destroyed the credibility of a once interesting character in Cross, Cornwell has fashioned a more thoughtful approach to the same problem. This book works well, but only just barely.As much as I am enjoying reading the Scarpetta series, it is becoming frayed at the seams a bit. I am hoping that Cornwell will leave behind this character who has seemingly been explored to about her furthest point. Scarpetta cant battle a new serial killer every book and confront that person in such a personal one on one struggle every time with out getting a little tiring. After all, most of the growth Scarpetta attained was in the first few books of this series, and now it feels like she is becoming a stereotype of herself. I think that Cornwell is such a gifted author that she could, if she wished, write a novel on par with Jim Harrison's better books, or \`Mystic River' or \`Motherless Brooklyn.'"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"After totally losing the plot with 'Cause Of Death', Cornwell got the Scarpetta series sort-of back on track with 'Unnatural Exposure', and it's pleasing to see that 'Point Of Origin' continues the trend. An investigation into a fire at the home of media personality Kenneth Sparkes turns up the dead body of a young woman, and immediately raises many puzzling questions. Accident or homicide? Is Sparkes the killer or victim? Is there a connection to other unsolved arson deaths? What about the baffling trace evidence adhering to the body? And is Carrie Grethen, who continues to torment Scarpetta and Co from behind the walls of her asylum, involved in some way?The best thing about 'Point Of Origin' is that there's a strong focus on the forensic science, in particular key trace evidence such as metal particles adhering to open wounds, a silicone substance on the head, and odd cuts on the skull. There is also quite a detailed investigation into the fire itself, trying to unravel the mystery of how such a ferocious blaze could be started in a low-fuel area such as a bathroom. Woven through the book are investigations into previous and subsequent blazes, plus the continuing story of Carrie.There are also some very strong character developments. At the time, I felt the series \\"reboot\\" that occurred with 'Last Precinct' and 'Blow Fly' was jarringly abrupt, but looking back, it is clear that Cornwell is laying the foundations as early as this book. Scarpetta laments how the FBI is no longer calling on her services, Lucy gets shunted sideways into ATF, and a resigned, worn-out Marino ruminates on retirement from the force. There is of course also a gut-punch of a twist involving Benton, which gives this book a considerable emotional pull, despite that fact that Cornwell undid it in later books.\`Point Of Origin' is an important book in the series, both for its own sake and because it concludes storylines from earlier books (\`From Potters Field' and \`Unnatural Exposure'), so it's essential for all Scarpetta fans. Fortunately, it's also one of the stronger books in the series as well."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have read all of Cornwells Scarpettas books in order and this one was the best so far. I found this to be more suspenseful and heartfelt then the previous ones. If you are a Scarpetta fan then you won't be dissappointed."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"The knowledge that Patricia Cornwell has in forensic science and inside knowledge of the FBI and ATF is incredible. Reading this book, (along with the others) you are opening yourself up to an incredible education in the science of a forensic pathologist. I often have to remind myself that these characters are fictional, although i guess that is what a good author should make you do. I should hope that someday these books would be made into a TV miniseries or even a huge movie series. It would be a huge blockbuster and reach out to other audiences that perhaps do not read so much.You're doing an increible job, Patricia Cornwell, I hope there is only more to come.Leah"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"After a promising beginning, the plot quickly becomes cluttered and unfocused. There are too many unanswered questions -- the lone surviving horse for example -- or its owner's involvement -- the final denouement is simply not satisfying after taking the plot in so many possible directions. I am always intrigued by the author's thorough research, and I have enjoyed her other books, but in this case she tried too hard to cram every ounce of information into the developing storyline. I felt that the author simply ran the plot into the ground in its complexity and couldn't come up with an ending that pulled it all together."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Patricia Cornwell's books have been falling off in quality over time, but the drop here is particularly steep. Part of the problem is her always haphazard plotting -- half of the problems and red herrings thrown up here never get explained. But her prose -- so alive and vibrant in those early books -- has become choked with cliches, so embarrassing to read that you wonder whether she's even assigned an editor nowadays. As for Scarpetta herself, well, Cornwell must suffer the most extreme case of 'I love my character' since Dorothy L Sayers. Kay Scarpetta isn't a character anymore, she's a Superhero: omnipotent, with Godlike wisdom, telling us all What's Wrong With The World. Lucy continues her decline from a sympathetic character to Wronged Genius Who Can Do Anything. She desperately needs killing off. Avoid at all costs and go back to those marvellous early books instead."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I was really excited when I bought this book, I was told that Scarpetta was a brilliant charicter and the books were really good. I bought it, I took it home and I tried so hard to get into the book, even half way through I wasn't engrossed. The charicters lacked emotion and the whole book dragged on and on going into to much detail about nothing at all.Some of the pathology was interesting to read about but on the whole this book was very poor."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"It is unfortunate that Benton had to die. I didn't see it coming. Marino and Lucy were their usual selves. What got me was the ending. I felt that there wasn't a clear ending to the book. Ok, Lucy shoots down the other chopper. But the reader isn't given a CLEAR impression that Newton and Carrie were in the chopper. That all seems to be presumed by the writer. How can you end a book like that? It's like there is no closure."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Being a first time reader of Patricia Cornwell, I didn't know what to expect from the author. I was sorely disappointed in Point of Origin. The writing was something from a first-year college English class with a plot that left a lot to be desired. The characters had zero depth and the ending was uneventful. To me the book would only appeal to either a feminist and/or a lesbian."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I've been an avid fan of Patricia Cornwell for many years and especially enjoyed the Scarpetta series. However, this last book, Point of Origin, left me feeling betrayed and disappointed. PC let her personal [life] bitterness, anger and disappointment of the FBI community insinuate itself into the plot of POO to the point that the novel became more of an FBI bashing event than anything else. Hence, the dangling ending to an otherwise good read. (I'm not defending the FBI) Her underlying anger towards them foreshadows the death of the FBI in future novels and the birth of DEA in them, which is okay with me. We need some new &quot;blood&quot; in the series. Also, in my humble opinion, PC needs to drop Lucy from the Scarpetta series (perhaps create a new series featuring only Lucy). To much time and energy was spent on defending Lucy's alternative lifestyle. There is no need to keep giving us Lucy's &quot;bio&quot; in every new book - your current fans already know it! . If new readers don't know about Lucy, this would be an incentive for them to go back and read your previous books. I felt like the whole book presented PC's defense of her last unpleasantness with the FBI, as if she had to defend herself to her fans. I am a fan no matter what and I believe the rest of her fans feel the same way. Take a sabatical PC and come back to us with the kind of writing you are capable of - and have shown us in the past. I'm waiting for your next book and hope the original Patricia Cornwell of past novels is back."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Although I wouldn't go as far as to say that this is the best I've read in the Scarpetta series, it is just as good as the others.I wouldn't recommend it to those who have not read the other books though - because it refers to cases in which torsos are found (from the book before this one) & a character introduced much earlier, Carrie Grethen, plays a much bigger part in this.There is a lot of character development in this one - especially at the begining of the book. As usual, a lot of it is about Lucy. Benton also plays a huge part.I wont go over the plot much - because really, a lot happens. But in the end they do find thier killer, along with Carrie, who escapes from the assylum earlier on. The modus operandi is especially terrible in this case, making it all the more intriging. It isn't really spelled out in the end exactly what happened when the victims were killed - because everybody's too busy chasing the killer. But what they find in his house is what makes it all clear - although by now it's a little late. He & Carrie knew they would find it.What's really sad in this one is the death of Benton. You feel like you knew him, & the funeral is so deppressing! But if you read the next book you'll get a surprise.."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"...no, not with the book, but with Patricia Cornwell. Done, done, done. Psychotic deranged serial killers who can keep it together enough to outwit, outfox, outplay and outlive the entire FBI and ATF? What is this Carrie person -- the boogey woman? Kaiser Soze? And Lucy -- no, no more please. Uncle! She is such a high maintenance whiny pill, like Meadow Soprano. Am I the only one who finds the aunt-niece relationship between Lucy the Pill and Kay the Wonder Woman to be a little -- well -- ooky?This book was so lame I can't believe Patricia Cornwall actually wrote it, but I am going to finish it so I'll give it 3 stars."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This is my first Patricia Cornwell book. Her character development was fine, but her insistence on delving totally into the depths of fire investigation and forensic testing was for me extremely tiresome. I think a little examination of fire investigation and forensic testing is fine, but the degree that she goes into it is sort of like asking someone what time it is and they tell you how to build a watch. Finally, the demise of Carrie and her boyfriend was just too easy."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"After reading this book, I am ashamed to say I was once a Cornwell fan who read all of the previous eight books out of the 'Scarpetta series' and even liked most of them.Besides being severely underdeveloped, unfinished and confused, my biggest disappointment is the fact that this book makes it painfully obvious Mrs. Cornwell has lost all of her regard for the reader and has stooped to preaching quasi-tolerance (i.e. Lucy) and feminism in a way that has to offend, if not the reader, than at least his or her intelligence.At first I loved the fact that Kay is a highly-successful, highly paid, self-sufficient professional woman, who knows what she wants and is aware of the sacrifices she has to make in order to get it. She is ambitious but makes no excuses for it, she is strong, but still feminine, and even though she doesn't really have a life, that doesn't mean she is cold or uncapable of love.Now, one would think that after eight books we have established all that. And we have. Except Mrs. Cornwell seems to think of her readers as mental equivalents of an average five-year-old, so she finds it necessary to spend pages and pages on tedious descriptions of Kay's house and car and paintings and whatnots, losing herself in boring detail and succeeding only in making Kay grow more and more unsympathetic and self-involved in each new book.Practically her only redeeming quality, and the only one that made Kay uniuqely human despite all of her growing self-righteousness and moralism, was Benton Wesley.So, when Mrs. Cornwell gets rid of a main male character - the only even remotely realistic male in the entire nine-book series - in such a silly and unoriginal, although disturbingly frightening (it's nice to see Mrs. Cornwell at least has not lost her touch there) manner, it seems a bit of an overkill. What bothers me most about it, however, is the underlying message that Kay could not be a feminist example if she was married, or she allowed herself the luxury of loving and being loved. What next?!Do yourselves a favor, folks, and if you have to go Cornwell, pick up one of her earlier Scarpetta books, or you'll be left none the wiser and with an extremely bitter taste in your mouth!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Say what you will--you either like or dislike Kay Scarpetta, but you can always expect to be drawn into a sensational murder mystery. Sure, Kay seems unhappy all the time, Lucy (her niece) seems belligerent and Pete Marino an endless drunk, but if you read these mysteries from the beginning you will drawn into each of their lives and begin to savor them like an old soap opera. You will find yourself wondering if Kay will ever find true love, Lucy will settle down, and Marino will find a life.All this is happening while the next mystery is unfolding, and what a mystery it is! A horse farm has been completely gutted by a horrendous fire destroying everything on it, including several thoroughbred horses. Then, suddenly in the fire's ashes a body has been found that has not been destroyed by the fire due to the fact that a large plate glass has fallen on it, protecting it from the heat. It is up to Kay now to found out how the fire started and how; and who was the girl and who would want her murdered.At the same time, psycho killer Carrie Gretchen has escaped from the psychiatric facility where she was imprisoned for her serial killer spree. Now she wants revenge on Kay and everyone connected with her.This book is wonderfully written as usual with extreme detail on the arson investigations and burn victims. There are surprise twists and unsuspecting turns. All in all, it is a great mystery."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Out of all the Scarpetta novels, this one is the absolute best. they are all faultless, yes, but Point of Origin contains that little extra something which just lifts it above the rest.The plot is brilliant, an absolute stunner. Bleak, depressing, brooding, slightly scary, full of atmosphere. The characters are all brilliant. Ever since the first novel, i have fallen in love with all of them. Marino is incredibly likeable, slightly over the top, but a rather human, bitter, not treated too well by life, resigned man. Lucy Is now a grown woman. When we first met her in Postmortem she was but a young girl...since than she has grown, with the influence upon her of vicious killers. Coming into contact with such people in your youth is going to affect how you grow up, and your attitudes...the people who complain that Lucy has changed are naive. She has not exactly changed, she has merely grown. She is now a grown up woman, whose character has been affected by her relationship with Carrie Grethen and Temple Gault, and by being so close to her aunt, who deals daily in gruesome death.Scarpetta is wonderful once again...Outwardly a competent professional, but inside she is just as insecure and vulnerable as the next person, no matter how hard she tries to convince us otherwise. She has been criticised for having no faults...Again, people misunderstand. Scarpettas fault is that she has no faults. It sets her apart from other people...Makes her inaccessible to people...makes her lonely. It changes the way people look at her and feel about her...makes people wary of her. Which is just as much a curse as it would be to be entirely faulted.I digress...This is a superb book. Cornwell's prose is addictive and at times beautiful. Her ways of description (people, places, effects, events) are wonderful and evocative. She writes about fear and paranoia very well, so that the reader can really feel it themselves...the isolation and fright.The plot is a real cracker...Carrie Grethen is a great villain, pure evil. the way she manipulates everyone is superb. And the way the final solution links in to \\"Unnatural Exposure\\" is brilliant...it links the books in, into a tapestry. They are not just individual novels, they are set in a real world, they intertwine and connect, as events in real life. It is an ongoing story, not a catalogue of seperate novels. A body of work.The climax is exciting, and there are many a twist packed into the book right up until it. The final chapter is moving.This is the best book in the entire series (some fascinating forensics, too)...i reccomend it very highly to everyone. Not only is it the best Scarpetta, it is one of the best mystery novels i have ever come across.To not read it is to miss out."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Patricia Cornwell is not a good writer. She has succeeded in the past because she's developed a couple of interesting characters and has been able to parlay her knowledge of forensics into some fascinating plot situations. But, she's done all she can do and this book is stale and boring."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"As a resident of Virginia and a fervent Patricia Cornwell fan, I believe that Point of Origin is her best addition yet to the Kay Scarpetta series. Moving portrayals of Lucy, Benton and Lucy kept me reading until the last page. The unlikely ending was both a surprise and a cliffhanger. Feelings, more than pure science dictated this novel. Kay Scarpetta was at not only her sharpest, but also at her most vulnerable. I am eager to read the next in this riveting series."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I keep waiting for Kay to decide the lifestyle Lucy leads is the one for her....and it seems the plot is heading that way. This was her worst book and I am not glad to say I read it...just that it is my last to read."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"An average, yet thin storyline gets lost in characters, particulary KS and Lucy, spending far too much time feeling sorry for themselves and their inabilities to cope with life as a whole. With emotional instability such as Lucy's, it's not surprising she got the punt from the Fed's. A helicopter shootout as a climax - get real. Cornwell, put some serious effort into the next book and stop conning us."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Seems like the author is setting up a &quot;coming out&quot; book. She promotes homosexuality more than the plot of the story. This book was definitely not her best and the ending was a letdown."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This was definately the best book of the series yet. Although many people have complained how dark and depressing this book is I beg to differ. When you pick up a book about Kay Scarpetta you HAVE to expect dark and depressing. All of these books deal with death. I can't wait for the next novel...&quot;Bring on the dark and depressing&quot;"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I thought this book was geat and could not put it down.Granted it was not one of her better books but I have read worse. there were a few loose ends that I thought should have been tied up but this did not spoil my enjoyment for this book. I liked finding out more about her personal life and Lucy's. Look forward to her next book."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Although I like KS novels--this one is much too dark and depressing. I'm sick to death of Lucy and her problems. The biggest source of my dissapointment with this novel, is her treatment of Kay's personal life and her relationship with Wesley and Marino."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I was disappointed in this book, but not as much as the last one. (KS was so arrogant-she completely turned me off!) This is really dark and depressing. I've read every book in the KS series and my favorites remain Postmortem and Body of Evidence. PC seems to have lost that ability to make us do double-takes over seemingly everyday, innocuous people and events. Get back to your old style of writing, PC. I miss those suspenseful, sleepless nights."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I am a huge Scarpetta fan and count down to the next book's release. This book made me feel so sad that these characters I have grown to care about are completely downhearted and negative about life. Even though Kay cheerleads about why they do it, it is hard to believe anyone with their attitudes would stay in law enforcement.I was very disgusted with the treatment of Benton in this book. I can't believe their relationship--two brilliant people-- was reduced to such a low level. He was one of Cornwell's best characters and I cared for him, unlike Lucy who needs a major attitude adjustment.Cornwell writes so well, but this plot had its problems. I am glad I read it, but still wonder why it ended the way it did with so many unanswered questions about the fires. And, how exactly did Carrie team up with her accomplice? That was a stretch with blame put on the internet once again. Please let this be the last of Carrie."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"While I enjoyed this book, it was not the sit on the edge ofyour chair book. Nothing new, no new villians, not an original story.Some of the story line is very sketchy. I do like the returning characters, Pete Marino, who is very down to earth... While this book is not as good as the rest, I will still look for future Cornwell books, but hope for more excitement, as in her earlier works."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Though Patricia Cornwell's latest Scarpetta novel is perhaps not as tightly spun in plot development as some of the earlier books, it offers intense interest to those fans of the series who find the inner lives of the main characters as compelling as the forensic detail. Cornwell's fictional universe has never offered easy escape from the real terrors of life -- be they criminal, political, or interpersonal -- and I think this unflinching moral seriousness has always been among the greatest strengths in her work (as it is, not coincidentally, among Dr. Scarpetta's greatest strengths as a character). Though there's a very wrenching death in this novel (expect to find yourself in major mourning, readers, for the character in question is very dear to our hearts!!) I suspect that the greatest discomfort will be felt by readers who are uneasy with Kay's profound concern for and engagement with her troubled niece Lucy; and frankly, that seems to me to say more about readers' prejudices than any weakness in the representation. I say prejudices, plural, because I think it's not only that homophobia is triggered when a major character in a series is a lesbian, but something maybe even more discouraging to an author like Cornwell, whose career suggests she is as intellectually gifted as her protagonists. Many of us who consider ourselves less gifted have a hard time taking seriously, let alone permitting ourselves to empathize with, the very real agony -- and often dysfunctionality -- that's unfortunately endemic to the lives of people born with genius-level intellect, especially if they're female in a culture that still hasn't quite worked through its heritage of male dominance. (One element of Kay's and Benton Wesley's relationship that has been especially poignant is his brave and tender patience when Kay lashes out at him in for male privilege he did not ask to be born with.) And one of the most powerful ongoing relationships in the Scarpetta series IS the one between Lucy and her accomplished aunt, because at the heart of it is, of course, their tendency both to attack and to cling to the self each sees painfully reflected in the other. Yes, they're very privileged people; but they're also, and I think very understandably, very troubled and lonely people. Point of Origin features dialogues between Kay and Lucy that are strikingly powerful in conception and execution, which ring exactly true in expressing the psychological dynamic between them. Speaking of loneliness, consider Pete Marino, who despite the stereotypical elements of his initial presentation in Postmortem, has developed into a more and more poignant character with each novel, as he soldiers on in a lifelong professional partnership with a woman who returns his love but not his desire. It's lonely being a woman who is brilliant: even lonelier to be less brilliant and hopelessly in love with her. I expect there'll be further developments here as well, and look forward to them. (Put that boy on a Pritikin diet and get him a nicotine patch, if necessary, for he is dearly loved, and I don't know if I can stand it if the ever-threatening stroke takes him from us.) The novel's not perfectly wrought -- exposition's a little sluggish this time out, and there are potentially gripping elements in the scenario (especially the fires themselves, one of which Kay might've found herself caught in for great dramatic effect) that Cornwell doesn't choose to exploit. But this is a haunting book with genuine depth and bite to it, in the tradition of The Body Farm and From Potter's Field, which I'd consider among her very best."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have read and loved Cornwell's books from the first one she wrote, but with each one she seems to be losing her touch. This latest one was the times because of the unnecessary blood and gore she seemed to find necessary to throw in just any old time!!!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Patricia Cornwell has produced yet another suspenseful and dynamic novel. Her books have always been terrific reading for me and I for one have a significantly hard time putting them down. The suspense and weaved web of clues keeps you guessing. Another great suspense thriller!!! She has become my favorite author and I have recommended her books to all my friends!!!!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"After reading ALL of PC's prior Scarpetta books starting with Postmortem, this is the very first one where I found myself reading ANOTHER book in the process! Pretty much a complete waste of time and effort. It's a good thing PC doesn't make alot of California book signing appearance, because after reading Point of Origin, I wouldn't bother getting it signed...I think I'll start reading more M. Connelly, RN Patterson, James Patterson, Caleb Carr, Ridley Pearson, and P. Margolian etc."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Did all the law enforcement agencies investigating the fire drop the ball or what? I could not believe the denoument in this one. The connection between murderer and victim been made much earlier. And Kay, I knew enough to not look in the freezer, and you are much smarter than me. I enjoyed the read until I realized who the murderers were - then I was shocked at the lack of basic investigative skills by all these experts. Too unbelieveable to be a Cornwell novel."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Ms. Cornwell should have stayed with the field she knew best...the FBI and forensic pathology. In this book, she has moved her characters over to the ATF National Response Team. No reason is given, and we are supposed to believe that Kay, Marino et al were allowed to this elite team since Lucy joined ATF. In addition, she makes it look like the ATF National Response Team runs to nearly every fatal fire around. This, I can assure you, is not the case. Other faults include having ATF agents baffled by how a fire started, even when a piece of magnesium is found at the scene. Come on...Give the ATF some credit for having some brains.She also showed her lack of knowledge of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in almost every area where PA was involved.In total, the book was a fair read, but was so off the mark with factual items, it made it hard to believe anything."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I found this book of Ms. Cornwall's to technical, especially flying the helicopter with her niece. The real moving part of the novel did not come until the very end. I know many of her books are like that but this one had no &quot;real story&quot; going for it from the beginning until just to the end. You could guess the ending on your own-or pretty close to it-no mystery to this one."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Having just finished PC's newest release I find myself somewhat disappointed. There are several loose ends (horse farm), a very bitter Dr. Kay and look out, a shocking twist that will leave the reader stunned and dismayed. At the same time, I absolutely love all of PC's novels and will continue to buy them as soon as the new release hits the shelf. A lot more feelings came out of Kay this time around, can we blame her? As always, I didn't want the book to end and slowly read the last few pages, savoring every word. Overall, a good read."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"If one can overlook some loose ends and a very poignant plot twist, this is actually one of Cornwells better novels of late. It certainly is better than Cause of Death or Hornet's Nest. A novel with Kay Scarpetta may be a bit predictable, but it's like sitting down with an old friend. I'd recommend it."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"As a Professor of English literature at Victoria University, Irecommended my students read this book as an example of a standard potboiler bereft of real ideas and characterisation. The style is basic, the grammar poor and vocabulary range limited. The main variety comes in trying to spot all the references to brand names. The plot meanders along introducing pointless elements like Marino's christmas lights and the escaped foal which goes unexplained. The characters are surprisingly unappealing as Scarpetta rants most of the time and, as other readers have commented, Lucy is a bizarre character and I suspect the alter ego of the author. In spite of those comments, POO does succeed in being a page-turner, and that is all it needs to be, and it is a very easy read. Butany enjoyment is entirely negated at the end when the denouement is tied up in about 15 lines and leaves it open for an obvious sequel. Given that very little of the point of origin was in fact explained, having the book tied in such a mediocre fashion was disappointing. Nevertheless, it keeps her fans and her bank manager happy."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"We found 'Point Of Origin' another one of Cornwell's excellent reading of and about Scarpetta's intriguing case load. Again once we got started we couldn't stop. We went from Hornest's Nest to Point of Origin so we know we are missing inbetween as some of the story didn't make sense and we had a feeling we had missed something. (Benton's &amp; Scarpetta's affair and Benton's marriage breakup.) Hopefully this author will continue this story (no bodies found!) and now the 3 main characters will continue on with the struggle of trying to make a difference in their world. We won't give away the ending, but we all felt Kay's pain like we were right there at Hilton Head Island. Great reading 4 Christmas or 4 a gift."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"We found 'Point Of Origin' another one of Cornwell's excellentreading of and about Scarpetta's intriguing case load.

There is only a very thin story line, which could be told in much less than the 400 or so pages the book has now. It's just more of the same, and it seems like Cornwell's inspiration has run dry."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Eventhough this was a page-turner which I didn't want to end, this was not as good as some of Cornwell's other novels.

In this book, Kay Scarpetta battles evil yet again, with her forensic expertize. This time she's up against Carrie Grethren, ex lover of Kay's niece Lucy, and full time psychopath. The characters are all expecting a murder trial, in which Carrie will plead insanity, but Carrie has other plans... This book has a very good plot line that is easy to follow and flows naturally from one step of the puzzle to the next. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes murder mysteries or suspense thrillers because this book has both. 430 pages of pure suspense and tragic loss of life. It was so good that I read it instead of reviewing for my finals."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I loved this audiocassette and I listened to the UNABRIDGEDversion. It was slow at first but then, I never wanted it to end. Cornwell has a great way of enticing readers to read her other books by using the reoccuring characters. I love her explicit descriptions. I like how she is not afraid to kill off her main characters. You never know what to expect! I am going right out to buy another Kay Scarpetta novel in the series."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I too feel that her books have gotten progressively lessintriguing and a LOT more disgustingly descriptive.

However, I view \\"Last Precinct\\" as the last Sharpetta novel worth reading. After that she stops writing in first person, the plot takes an unbelieveable twist, and everything just seems \\"turning out books to get paid.\\"NOT to take away from Point of Origin, Black Notice and Last Precinct, a three book trilogy not to be missed! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This was a heart touching book. See you have the Hornets Nest that made you laugh and this one that brought tear's. What a great author you are Ms. Cornwell! We get to see the character's like we've never seen them before. I hope one day that your book's are made into movies that we can sit and watch instead of just seeing them in our mind's. You did so well with all the character's, a lot of people think Kay Scarpetta is this person that has no feelings, but she is human too and can be hurt. Cornwell I believe goes to great lenghts to write her books and I feel she researches everything before she puts it down on paper. This was a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I am an avid fan of Patricia Cornwell and have never read a Kay Scarpetta mystery I didn't like and this includes my most recent purchase Point of Origin. A fast-paced, page turner I completely enjoyed."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"The large number of reviews previously posted for Point of Origin sum up the majority of my disappointments with the book. Scarpetta is a basket case throughout the book, is totally obsessed with her niece and whines constantly about her job (why does she do it). In addition, multiple threads surface unexpectedly or are dropped without any attempt at resolution. A point that I struggled with constantly was Cornwell's apparent total lack of comprehension of how a horse farm works. With over 20 high priced horses, the farm only had one old caretaker who quit an unstated amount of time prior to the fire. The owner (an extremely busy man) has supposedly been taking care of these horses himself, but decides to take off for a few days without making any arrangements for their care. Anyone with any basic knowledge of horses would also be aware that this is as likely as leaving an infant in a crib while the parents leave for a getaway weekend. The credibility of the investigation rang totally hollow for me with this lack of research."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Patricia Cornwell had always sent me running to the bookstore to get another of her books, this one is no exception. It begins when a house burns to the ground, and they find a body in there. All evidence points to the fact that the girl was murdered before the fire burned. As Scarpetta searches for the answer, word comes that Carrie Grethen, her old enemy that threatened her niece and all those around her, escapes from a prison for the criminally insane and has now joined the threat. Now Scarpetta must work fast, before someone important to her is lost...Patricia has done a great job with this book. She never seems to run out of ideas, and I recommend it to anyone who loves to read horror. If you have a queasy stomach, find another book. If you don't, pick up this book and knock yourself out, like I did."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I don't consider myself a big fan of hers, though given this I sure have read enough of her books. The are well written, well researched, great plots. I don't even mind that all her female characters are all superstars (a lot of women are superstars ). The negative for me was the whining, the doctor and her neice are big whiners. I will read another book by her."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I don't like to read many books, but this book I could not put down. It starts of with Kay, The main character, having to go check out a farm that had just burnt down. She arrives shortly after being notified and she went right to work. The house, and just about everything around had been burnt. Sparks, the owner of the farm, had left the day before on vacation. He was notified that his house and many horses had been burnt to the grown.The entire house had collapsed into the basement, so Kay had to scramble threw the ruble. she found a women's body in the basement, but Sparks said there was know one supposed to be in the house. She had been killed before the fire had started and was in the bathtub with the glass door melted around her.This book gets better and better as you read. I recommend this book to everyone"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have to agree with the reviewer who complained about the loose ends and unexplained elements. I also found the end of the book to be rushed, and rather contrived.In many ways, this book feels more like an outline. Detail about Carrie's personality disorder should go here, more details about Kay's inner feelings about Benton should go there, an investigation of how Carrie got involved with another maniac belongs in this chapter, a resolution for the colt belongs in that chapter.... In other words, the plot is good, but not fleshed out into a story."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I am sick of descriptions of the smell of boiling human bones and the looks of melted faces! I bought the audio book for a drive to a dog show, and the ending was so depressing, sickening, and empty. This was a stupid plot too."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"My first Cornwell novel and my last. This book was absolutely ludicrous. What a waste of trees. It was not the heinous nature of the crimes involved that bothered me. It was the lack of a cohesive plot and distinctive narrative. By the time I finished, I did not care who lived or died."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This book stands up to all of Patricia Corwell's writting. I've read every book she has written and am very disappointed that she hasn't written another. The way the characters always relate to the previous book keeps you looking forward to the next. Great reading, can't wait for the another."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have been increasingly disappointed in Cornwell's more recent books (loved the earlier ones); Kay Scarpetta comes off as cold and humorless (What did Benton see in her anyway?), but this time Cornwell went way too far. Killing Benton off, and doing it in the gruesome way she did, was sadistic, cruel and unnecessary. Ditto, burning the stables and all those horses. The interesting thing about Scarpetta's work has been the investigation process itself. But why do the crimes themselves have to be so horrific? This is my last Cornwell book."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Definetely not one of her better books in the series, but not as silly as Cause of Death (where Kay singlehandedly stops a group of nuclear terrorists...please). The writing however was appalling. Some things made me laugh out loud (how she sat in her ergonomically correct chair), other things were just confusing. SHe would bring up someone's nickname, but not tell you who this nickname related to until several paragraphs later, etc. My biggest complaint would be the end, and of course the big plot holes (just how were the fires made so hot without accelerant, the foal, how did Carrie escape in the chopper on the island with no one noticing, etc). ANd of course the characters were horrible. Kay needs to stop obsessing about her neice, she is a grown woman. And yes, I wondered if Kay was becoming lesbian as well....and wouldn't McGovern make an ideal mate for her? I am not sure if I want to read the next one...well, I know I will, but I will borrow the next one that I read. The series has gone into decline. Her story was alright, but the horrible horrible writing style made it hard to follow, and not as enjoyable read as previous efforts."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I'm a faithful reader of all of Cornwell's novels, and as muchas I love her characters Marino, Scarpetta, Lucy and others, I thinkthe cast and storyline has been beaten a few too many times. It'd be refreshing to read some new characters with a new plot, though I don't mind the medical part of it at all :)"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I think this is by far her BEST. When I read her books I can't wait until the end and then I wish I had more pages to devour. I have relatives in Virginia and have been in several of the locations that she writes about. This makes me feel that the story is unraveling around me. Patricia Cornwell is &quot; THE BEST&quot;. I'm eagerly waiting for more Dr. Kay Scarpetta thrillers."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I found POINT OF ORIGIN to be Patricia Cornwell's best novel since the early ones in the Scarpetta series. It's interesting to me that the very things other readers do not like are what make me feel this is her strongest novel in years. I see great improvement in her main characters' depth. It's quite clear that Cornwell's harshest critics are letting their personal prejudices detract from what should be considered tremendous growth in the author's writing. I think it's great how Cornwell is allowing Scarpetta and Lucy to reveal &quot;true to life&quot; thoughts and emotions. They're becoming more human before our very eyes! In addition, the pacing of this installment is exceptional, and the dialogue is her most captivating and realistic yet. The only weakness I detect is the ending--the helicopter chase is too abrupt, with it ending before the reader is even aware of what's going on. But, overall, POINT OF ORIGIN is a real page-turner. Keep your chin up, Ms. Cornwell. You've been on the receiving end of some hard knocks recently, but your hard work on this novel was very much appreciated by this reader!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"It seems that in the recent books Dr. Scarpetta is more detective than medical examiner. The early books were better. Also, Dr. Scarpetta's personal life is getting boring. Too much type being spent on Lucy, who is a mediocre character at best. Too much time is spent on Lucy's relations with other women. I used to look forward to reading Cornwell's books, now I am starting to wonder if I'll even bother with the next one... Oh, I probably will but I miss the suspense and good writing from the early books."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This book has it all. It takes you into places of yourself that you didn't know were there. I felt all extreme emotions one right behind the other. I was both curious, horrified, sympathetic, angry, sad. This is by far one of her greatest works. Sadly enough though, one of my favorite people die in this book (I won't give it away) and at first I was angry at Cornwell for that. BUT, it is true in life that the good die horrible early deaths."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Having enjoyed some of the prior books by Ms. Cornwell, I found this one to be a great letdown. The characters were shallow, the dialog weak and the settings tired and worn. Ms. Cornwell seems to have fallen into a general state of lethargy and is perhaps at the stage with her writing that she expects the fans to buy just anything she presents. Not! This is the end of the line for me and this author!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"An incredibly intense novel that was so good I read it in one weekend. It's the first time a Scarpetta novel made me weep. I'm just glad I didn't check the reviews until AFTER I was done."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I couldn't put the book down but can't believe Benton was killed. They were a team! Why? I can't believe PC would do that without having something in store for KS in the future. Please more books on Scarpetta and the sooner the better!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"People who read reviews generally have not read the book yet; so what would possess a book reviewer to give up key details, such as the death of one of the beloved main characters? Now I'll be reluctant to ever read a review again. Thanks, everyone, for ruining that part of the book for me."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Patricia Cornwell is one of the best thriller writers and Kay Scarpetta is very fascinating, anyway, this last book is not as good as the fisrt ones."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Yet again another Patricia Cornwell book that I couldn't put down. I feel that this book brought the reader closer to Dr Kay Scarpetta because of the heartache she went through in losing Benton, it was a twist that I did not expect. Keep up the good work Patricia, looking forward to the next Scarpetta case, and hope there are many more to come."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Being 15, and being somewhat of an addict (ok that's an understatement) to Patricia Cornwell books is one of the biggest obstacles I have had to deal with, (I know pretty sad, huh?). Let me tell you, if you think its hard to scrounge around for 25 bucks when you have a steady income, it's ten times harder at my age. I had to wait 6 months until Christmas and drop more than a thousand hints..... and still didn't get it until the middle of January. My point is that this book is worth the time and money, even if its hard to justify 25 bucks for a book to your parent or yourself. This book was a pleasing addtion to my 20 book PC collection (hard and soft cover). I was, I must say a little miffed about the death of Benton Wesley as he was one of my favourite characters (I cried from the time of his death to the end of the book). I mean as soon as scarpetta begins to find a stable and loving (although somewhat complicated) relationship, he gets knocked off. But this aspect also helped to make Scarpetta more human to her readers. It allowed the reader to make a connection to the soul of her character, and to realize the agony she must go through daily. It was one of the only times Scarpetta became a vulnerable character. the vulnerability she felt because of how deeply she loved him was, not to sound cliche, a chink in her armor. This book was well written, and executed. Yet another bestseller. If you like Scarpetta you will love this. PC I will forever be a fan! Though I do have one question when is The Body Farm movie coming out?"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"As a Patricia Cornwell fan, I have anxiously awaited the arrival of each publication. When &quot;Point of Origin&quot; was released I could not wait to get my hands on it. After reading it I could not help but wonder what is going on in Conwell's life that would motivate her to write such a depressing, dark, disturbing novel. Kay Scarpetta is at odds with every character in the book. She seems at odds even with herself! The plot is grisly and graphic, not lightened with any humor or levity - a downward ghastly sprial. The book held my interest but left a bad taste in my mouth. I personally don't know why Kay was in fear of Carrie. If my life was that depressing, I would have welcomed the relief."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I started reading her series two years ago and while the endings are still rushed the story lines get better. I cried while reading this book and that is one of the reasons that I loved it. We got a very good insight into Kay Scarpetta's heart, as well as PC's. I wish she would stay away from the Hornet's Nest storyline and stick with Scarpetta."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have been a KS fan since the beginning. Your latest book was great. Just do me a favor???? Next time you want to go on a tangent, &quot; Hornet's Nest&quot; please think about all of your fans. We want more KS. Keep up the good work."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"one of her best when you read this story you just couldnt wait to turn next page when she wrote this story you felt all the happiness and sadness hope they make a movies out of sone of her stories hope this one"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"one of her best when you read this story you just couldnt wait to turn next page when she wrote this story you felt all the happiness and sadness hope they make a movies out of sone of her stories hope this one"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This book was great. The plot keeps going on, and leaves you wondering if your first theory was right or wrong. Point of Origin kept me captivated as the story put me in the moods of each charactor. To be scarred, laughing, and crying in one book is amazing.Way to go Ms. Cornwell!!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"The book is loaded with all the scientific mumbo jumbo and law enforcement acronyms, ERT, ESA, ... Although I am familiar with her style of writing, having read most of her books, I found myself having to go back and forth trying to find out the explanation for all the acronyms she threw at the reader. Her novel is loaded with references to all kinds of brand name goods. Kay Scarpetta is full of self-adulation and self importance and can't seeem to see anyone but herself. The plot is old and ill conceived, just as the bad guys are. The author spent a of time building up the &quot;plot&quot; describing unneccessary things, talking too much about her neice, but tied up all the loose ends in a page. It is obvious that the bad guys will crop up in the next novel. I started reading her novels a few years back because of the fact that I liked Kay Scarpetta and that the novels were written from an unusual perspective, i.e. the medical examiner. Benson's role in the book seem to fulfill the need to have a romantic side for Scarpetta. This book was terribly disappointing."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Alhtough I enjoyed reading the book, I have not enjoyed the listening to the audio version as read by Kate Reading. I can't tell if Reading has a British accept or just pronounces long &quot;o's&quot; (her &quot;home&quot; rhymes with &quot;whom&quot;) unusually, but Scarpetta was born in Florida and has spent most of her life in the south, and the accept is off-putting to me. Plus she overaccentuates almost every consonant. IMHO."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This was my first Cornwell book. I don't usually get into mystery books, but I loved this one! The graphic descriptions of the crime scene, excellent dialogue, and detail transported me as a reader to the setting of the book! After the first couple of chapters, I couldn't put it down, but I tried to pace myself, because I didn't want it to end! Excellent work! I will be back for more of PC's book!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Point of Origin was the last drop for me. I am now so sick and tired of the 'heroine' that I can hardly stomach another try. The touchy-feely writing and the hugely dissapointing ending of this book is too much. I have read all of Cornwell's books, and have enjoyed some of them, but this is it. And I say that WITH FEELING!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Ms Cornwall is getting very lazy... her style is now reduced to laying on the mood with a trowel, foreshadowing events so clearly that you wonder why you continue reading. She's clearly getting rid of some personal enmity toward the FBI in this book, which rather spoils the mystery itself. Following the poor quality of &quot;Unnatural Causes,&quot; she's going to have to pull her socks up pretty quickly if she hopes to retain her readers."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have thought that every Patricia Cornwell novel I have read was amazing, especially this one. Her topics hit home, her details are amazing. She writes out of expoerience. Point of Origin was espcially intriguing because of the characters and setting. PC twists and turns through out her writing and continues to keep me on my toes. I have pre-ordered her next novel and can not wait until it arrives. She is my all time favorite author. I reccommend her books to everyone."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Once again Patricia Cornwell has out done herself. This was the best book that I have ever read. Patricia's vivid imagination, and use of detail was the heart and soul to this book. The characters made you feel as if you were a part of the book, and experiencing every incident that happened. The battle between good and evil is a never ending saga. Once you are done with this book you will finally feel that the fight is over."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Ok, I'm 14 and most people don't see 14yr olds reading this stuff, but I do. I must say of the books that I've read from her, this is by far her best. To be completely honest, I have four more pages and i will be finished, my fourth P.C. book in the last two weeks. I love her style of writing and will definitely be ordering still more of her books in the future... all in all... I, by all means, reccommend this book to any and everyone!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I can live with a Barbara bush dedication, although it's no big draw for me.The adverb syntax is cumbersome. &quot;She sweetly said&quot; could be &quot;She lilted,&quot; &quot;She sang,&quot; &quot;She chirped,&quot; etc.However, the book is worth reading given the successful use of reverse foreshadowing--we obsess with her about Marino's health, then Benton bites it.Still, Cornwell should spend more time constructing her verbs so she doesn't have to bog us down with her adverbs."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Despite a few predictable pitfalls (Scarpetta's increasingly tragic personal life, Marino's chronic under-use, and the typicality of someone of importance croaking in a nasty if novel way), the incredible use of arson investigation detail made the novel excessively readable and enjoyable. Interestingly enough, I walked away with numerous fire-related facts &quot;burned&quot; into my memory and, as a scientifically minded reader, these plot additions proved both critical and necessary to my understanding of the book. On the critique side, two irksome points; 1) No investigative team as elite as this team is drawn to be would forget to continue to look for the doctor who's car is found in the primary fire. That piece of evidence was conveniently thrown aside far too early and not quite slickly enough for the reader to avoid picking up on it as significant to the resolution. 2) I doubt highly that magnesium scraps would befuddle a trained arson investigator. Every hack-camper knows that Mg stones are used to ignite camp fires.All in all, however, well worth the time, a good page-turning distraction from the mundane real world, and nicely done."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I'm beginning to find it's getting harder and harder to tell the Scarpetta novels apart. However, this was by far and away the best of the most recent offerings. I think that I must be the only person in the world who was disappointed with the ending. I honestly recommend that the books be read in order to those who haven't read any as yet."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Enjoyed Point of Origin though not as much as some previous books by Cornwell. Thought the face scalping was a little wacky from her usual writings. Have always enjoyed Cornwells' use of technical language . . . shows a lot of research/work on her part. For people who don't like the terminology, they can skim it or skip it but the rest of us, it lends credibility to the writing."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"The technical details are so good. I appreciate the authors research"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I found this book a thriller and at the same time I cried especially at the end when Lucy positioned the helicopter to spray Bentons ashes. This book was both emotional and mind-boggling at the same time.If there is anyone who feels that any of the Scarpella books can be better - write one yourself with the same amount of passion that Cornwell puts into hers..."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Cornwell outdoes herself. Carrie Grethen is back and the horrible tension is gut-wrenching. The psychological terror has been ratched up by tightly focusing on threats to Scarpetta, but that is becoming tiresomely predictable. I AM disappointed how ME Scarpetta has become the terrorized center of the plots, with her intelligent sleuthing receding into the background, and horror stories coming to the fore. I'm afraid how far crazed she'll go in the next book (both Scarpetta and Cornwell--they both need to take a break!). A new co-heroine is introduced, and a hero knocked off (wholly unexpected, that): Is Scarpetta being set up to become still another unhappy lesbian character in these novels? The ending is wonderfully set up: Cornwell had me beginning to mentally wonder off, thinking the story was to be continued later, when the twist hit like a fist in the kidneys. Wonderful effect, if a bit too abrupt."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Well Ms.Cornwell has once again given us the treat of yetanother novel with all our favorite characters, right down to CarrieGretchen. as I gazed at the book in the store and took notice of the new back cover photo (her in flight jacket w/heli in background) how did I know that she or Lucy would be a pilot. It is a well written book which as always, I had trouble putting down but some of the plot line, kind of out there. And the rubber swimmers cap come on, I dont think so. Semi-Kudos to you Ms. Cornwell and yes I will continue to read your novels even this one didnt keep you on the edge of your seat like your past one's. Just glad I waited for paperback version."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Scarpetta needs to unload that weird niece of hers, who refuses to be happy, and get rid of that pathetic Marino, who will never quit smoking no matter how many autopsies he his forced to witness. And Kay - well she needs a new job that does not force her to arm her home like a fortress. Cornwell's cast of characters lack hope and optimism - an unpardonable offense to the reader. Former fans would be better served if Scarpetta were to forsake her scalpels and invest in a good set of carving knives so she good more fully attend to her prowess as a kitchen maven. Perhaps she could play on her noteriety as a Medical Examiner to build a following for a cooking school.By the way - just out of curiosity - how many of you know the name of the medical examiner in your hometown??"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Perhaps the author is depressed about something. It seems so because Dr. Scarpetta is so down in the dumps about life and everything around her that she drags this novel down with her. The woman is having no fun. She ought to change jobs and get a life so readers won't go away from this one so unhappy. The pace is slow. The climax unbelievable. Ms. Cornwell's new love of flying helicopters obviously flew parts of this book into places it should never have gone."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I am a fan of Patricia Cornwell and the earlier books are far better. I enjoyed this book it showed a more sensitive side to Kay. I am looking forward to the next one hopefully the plot will be fresh and a new romantic interest will enter Kay's life so she can let Lucy go. I love her writing and Kay is far from retirement. Hurry up with the next one."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I still think Scarpetta is a great character and that Cornwell is an above average writer but I get so fustrated that these books are so hit or miss. I've really loved most of them even though I feel all her endings are lacking. They come too abrubtly and are unsatisfying. This book however was just not as absorbing or exciting as most of her previous ones. I had to force myself to finish it because I figured out who was doing the bad stuff early on and yes, it was depressing. It left me in a bad mood. If Cornwell writes another one, yes I will read it. I do have hope that there is another great Scarpetta book in her."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I think you will enjoy the usual technical aspects however Ihope Carrie will not return in your next body of work. Kay is always- terrific....."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Inside these pages is pain. And horrific violence that sadly feels real. I tried to stop reading, but felt compelled to finish. I've enjoyed all the books in the series, but I'm not sure if I'll read another."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Point of Origin by Patricia Cornwell is a vivid description ofthe origins of blazes and the horror we all feel at the way a life canbe destroyed in a matter of minutes or even seconds. A gripping tale of mystery from the fires at Warrenton to Lehigh County, PA to Dr. Kay Scarpetta and the cast of characers losing one of their own. Point of Origin leaves you on the edge of your seat and wanting yourself to catch Carrie Grethen. In the end you stil don't know if Carrie is still alive and will show up in the next Scarpetta series, but you can't wait until the next book."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Well the ending upset me somewhat I greatly enjoyed this book. Scarpetta is at her best again along with her merry band of follwers her neice Lucy, Marino, Benton and more. Great writing and a thriller until the end."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have been an avid fan of Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta novels from the first book. However, I was disappointed with Point of Origin for several reasons. First, the characters have become uninteresting to me. The past few books have featured Scarpetta, Marino, Benton, and Lucy all moving in their own isolated circles of pain. There's no change in this situation in Point of Origin. While I appreciate the fact that this might reflect reality, I was disappointed that there was no further character development in this book. Second, the book was gruesome in a way that seemed different to me than in previous books. I felt that many of the scenes in this novel were sickening just for the sake of being so. Finally, I felt that the ending was sloppy and completely inconsistent with how Cornwell had developed the characters involved. It mostly seemed to simply leave the door open for yet another novel in which the main characters sink even lower into their pain and ! anguish. I'll be the first to admit that I didn't put this book down until I finished it, but when I did, I felt largely unsatisfied and put off."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I can remember the excitement I experienced when I read my first Patricia Cornwell book, BODY OF EVIDENCE. How exciting, refreshing , and informative. Kay was great and her strength and vonunerability (sp?) balanced the character so very well. How I long for the htroine fo those early books. How I long for the plots of those earlier ones. After CAUSE OF DEATH I promised myself I would never buy another Cornwell in hardback, but, untrue to my promise, I purchased HORNET' NEST. Big mistake. Not one to learn by my mistakes, I got PoO the day it came out. Frankly, having just finished it, I am depressed. Poor Kay! This woman has become a heavy , bogged down in her work that seems to gove her little satisfaction, overwelmed in her relationship with the equally tiring niece, Lucy, a neat kid who has grown into a sucidal, though brilliant, young woman, and unappreciative of the care that Marino shows her, to say nothing of the people she comes into contact with! daily. Couldn&quot;t she have given Marino a hug as she was leaving his home, one of the more touching scenes in the whole book? I sincerely wish Kay (cornwell?) could chill for a long while, maybe with Lucy by her side, and forget about the technicalities of autopsies, sexual politics, etc. And does anyone elst have the feeling that Teun will be in the next book, possibly as Kay's new love interest? If so, I'll read about on Amazon reviews, etc., because this time I'm REALLY NOT gonna buy the next Cornwell hardback, maybe not even the soft cover. I miss the old Kay."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Finally, another Scarpetta book that kept me on the edge of my sofa. Definitely not a relaxed read however. Find something lighter for the beach. By the end I was seriously depressed, but longing for the next in the series to see just how things work out for our favorite medical examiner ... in her new morgue no less."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This book reminded me why I used to love to read for fun. I couldn't put it down and found myself waking up in the middle of the night trying to figure out the plot."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Point of Origin is filled with the fast paced, detail oriented writing fans of other Scarpetta books (I among them) have come come to relish. Details that would be gruesome are related in a &quot;clinical&quot; manner that renders them emotionally acceptable. In PoO, the horrific death of a character we have come to care about &quot;personalizes&quot; the crime to an extent I found disturbing. It smacks of an attempt to emotionally manipulate the reader in an unpleasant way. The book's ending is quite implausible--statistically, a murderer would do well to stay away from Kay. (By my count in 7 books I've read, murderer has been killed in 6, often by Kay. . .)"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Somewhat disappointed by the heavy detail in the beginning of the book. I love the characters and have enjoyed all of the Scarpetta books. I felt as if there was a rush to explain the impossible and more loose ends than I care to ponder.... but over all...i liked it and will be the first to buy the next Scarpetta book"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have read all of Cornwell's books. I know that I will keep reading them as long as she keeps writing them. I found Point of Origin to be good but not great. I had a hard time getting into this book, but once I did, I knew I was hooked. This book in particular had a lot of jargon that the average person does not understand nor really care about. (i.e. the flying of the helicopter,etc.) I do think that Cornwell can make Dr. Scarpetta more interesting by not making her seem so &quot;stuffy&quot;. I did like it when she showed her more &quot;human&quot; side when she was dealing with people that are very close to her. The ending of this book raises alot of possiblities for the new characters that were introduced. I hope that she uses them in her future books. It was nice to read about Lucy and Marino. They are pretty intersting characters that are vital to Dr. Scarpetta's life. I am looking forward to Patricia Cornwell's next book because I always find something to like ! no matter what she writes about."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I've read all of Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta books. I like the idea of a strong, professional woman character, who can take care of herself. I find the forensic details of her books, this one particularly, fascinating. However, I think that Scarpetta's choices of not having any life are becoming old. I can't believe that a woman of this strength could be so helpless about having a life outside of work, and in finding SOME happiness someplace. (Does anyone else picture Benton as the Admiral on JAG, or Duchovny's supervisor on X-FILES?) Also, the reason as to the particular intensity of the fires is never disclosed - or did I miss something? I'm looking forward to the next book."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Having read every one of Cornwell's books, I keep stumbling over the fact that they end poorly. After all the tense and suspenseful build-up, I was let down again with the finale. It was similar to Temple Gault's death in the NY subway tunnel...anti-climatic and disappointing.However, before the final 50 pages, this book IS suspenseful and fulfilling. Cornwell does a fabulous job of developing the charcters. As a reader, I appreciate her willingness to have vulnerable characters and allowing them to even be killed...in varying fashions.I am hooked and will buy the next Scarpetta adventure. But unlike Robert Harris' fabulous ending to Silence of the Lambs, Kay Scarpetta gets off easy again."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have been an avid fan of Patricia Cornwell's books for many years. This latest book though, left me somewhat disappointed. Lucy was not as pivotal as she usually is in the plot and what little we glimpsed of her was mostly through third-party observations of her behavior (past and recent). The fires, which were the main point of the book for at least 15 chapters, were never explained fully. How did those fires find the fuel they needed in those spartan and almost sterile bathrooms? Finally, I would have been happy to have the book end one chapter earlier than Cornwell did. It almost seemed like Cornwell lost momentum at the end and, like Anne Rice, just threw in a scene at the end to ensure a sequel. The last chapter with the helicopters battling in mid-air was NOT fully developed and left me wondering why she had bothered at all. I would rather believe that Carrie and her new pal were gone to plot more death and destruction instead of ambushing Lucy and Dr. Sca! rpetta in mid-air. Overall, Point of Origin seemed to be of lesser quality than some of her previous work."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This novel is best of Kay Sacrpetta's adventures! Keeps you on the edge of your seat and you don't know how the events unfold, unti your actually there! Hope her next novel comes out soon!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Point of Origin is definately one of the best Kay Scarpetta novels. It kept me guessing until the end. The loss of one of the main characters was disapointing, but opens up a whole new area of adventure for our heroine!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"To her usual blend of supense, mystery and fascinating autopsies, Patricia Cornwell adds strength to her story telling skills with a superb probing of Scarpetta's character. Both author and protagonist seem to have reached a state of maturity. Any reader who has followed Kay Scarpetta's story from the early days when niece Lucy was a mere child and Marino was much healthier, will not be disappointed with the latest chapter in Scarpetta's life. The heroine's weaknesses and fears are realistically defined and the story is brought to a surprising, emotional and skilful conclusion."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This is the most depressing, grisly Kay Scarpetta book of all"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"i just finished reading point of origin for the secondtime. like all patricia cornwell's novels, i read it feverishly, inone sitting, to the very end and then went back to savor it... cornwell doesn't get wrapped up with planting false clues to mislead the reader; rather, she concentrates on beautifully-written, descriptive imagery and too real, complex emotions of her heroine. Scarpetta is growing world-weary, Lucy is facing some hard personal truths and Marino is living with the irony of abusing his body with junk food and nicotine and still outliving his health-conscious friend. Carrie seems less psychotic than vindictive, but i think it makes her more believable. i found the book to be really enjoyable, not as full of technical information as her previous works, but streaked with humanity and emotion. i care about her characters and her stories stay with me long after i close the book. i do recommend reading them in order, especially to get the background on carrie-lucy and carrie-temple, but even if you haven't read her other books, this one is good on its' own."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"PC novels have been a favorite read over the last few years. But with each release of a new KS novel, the tension is less and less and it comes further and further into the story. This one is no exception."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Patrica Cornwell has come and gone and unfortunately we are left with yet another book that fails to deliver the goods. Lacking in the fundamental teeth nashing, nail biting suspense of a good thriller, Point of Origin might well have been Point of No Return."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"i enjoyed &quot;point of origin&quot;. i have read all of her books, however, i am getting tired of temple and carrie and lucy. i don't mind some connections to other characters but i think that it is time to bury temple gault and carrie grethen once and for all and give us some new, fresh villians. also, i would have liked a better explanation of how the fires started and how they became so intense so quickly. maybe i read too fast, but i still have some questions about the way the fires happened. and what is with the mcgovern character? to me she was not a very attractive character at all."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"After Hornets Nest tanked with readers and reviewers, Cornwell obviously needed to bring back Kay Scarpetta in a blockbuster to justify her $24 million two-book advance. This book doesn't make the grade. It's a typical Scarpetta in every sense. The more of these books Cornwell writes, the worse they become. The early ones were at least entertaining, if often unintentionally amusing for their blatant technical errors. The later ones have become fomulaic. Cornwell fans will like this book, but it's obvious that Ms. Cornwell is fresh out of ideas."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I couldn't wait for Patricia Cornwell's new book &quot;Pointof Origin&quot; to be released so as soon as it was released I wentout and bought it.

I hope somebody out there enjoys the book more than I did."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Ms Cornwall seems to be in trouble. Each book is getting more depressing and more unbelievable. Is she just churning them out (waiting for a film script perhaps?) or is there no life left in Scarpetta? Point of Origin was more readable then the terrible Hornet's Nest but was no where near as good as the earlier books. Scarpetta needs to find a new case, a new villian and get on with what she does best"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Just finished Point of Origin, will probably re-read veryshortly just to absorb the technical details with which itabounds. POO is dark to Hornets Nest's light and PC is a woman on a mission .. she absolutely must warn us about the danger out there. While not quite as suspenseful as From Potters Field, I still enjoyed it more than her last two Scarpetta novels...What is apparent is that there are apparently problems between the various agencies in the US and the Ms Cornwell feels very deeply about this...A brilliantly written novel ... my only complaint, that it's a little too depressing, life is a little too real with in these covers, the mission too urgent ... banter is lacking, the fun of Hornets Nest, except for one brief paragraph is missing."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"It was very good.....left me wanting more. It was very suspenseful."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have always rated Patricia Cornwell highly, but her books are definitely on a downward curve. I think that after the first two or three she ran out of ideas and new villains. In her new book coincidences abound, departed villains return to terrorise and the usual right wing platitudes abound. I think it is time to retire Scarpetta and think of something new. If Paretsky could do it so can Cornwell."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Cornwell is back. After a subpar Unnatural Exposure, she has naturally exposed real human emotions of evil, greed and private glimpses of fragile human hearts. Cornwell is maturing and her readers will absorb her new depths."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Dr. Kay Scarpetta is still the Chief Medical Officer for the Commonwealth of Virginia. When needed, she is loaned to other agencies due to her deservedly sterling reputation. Life has dramatically changed for both Kay's lover (Benton Wesley) and her niece Lucy. Unable to cope with the intense scrutiny that the FBI provides to a gay woman working on a top secret project, Lucy transfers to the ATF. Benton has also left the agency to become a private consultant.Just when Kay and Lucy are happy with their significant others, a shadow from their past descends on them. Sociopath Carrie Grithen, Lucy's first lover, has escaped from a maximum security mental facility. She gives notice that she plans to obtain revenge from the three people who sent her up (Kay, Benton, and Lucy).As soon as the reader becomes complacent that Patricia Cornwell could not possibly surprise them anymore, the talented author releases POINT OF ORIGIN, a novel that contains one of the most unexpected but plausible twists in years. With a simple action, the focus of the characters radically change as the more vulnerable side of Kay surfaces.Harriet Klausner END"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"POINT OF ORIGIN is better than the last Cornwell novel, and I liked the last one. I was lucky to get an advance copy of POINT OF ORIGIN (my uncle works at a newspaper that gets review copies). The book involves murder and intrigue, and I had to keep guessing what was going to happen. It is the best thriller novel I've read since THE SHAPE: A NOVEL OF INTERNATIONAL SUSPENSE by Craig Furnas. Patricia Cornwell is supposed to be a real unlikable person, and so that always makes me hesitant to partake of an artist's work if the artist is a jerk. But Cornwell's skill as a suspense master makes me set that &quot;rule&quot; aside. It's good POINT OF ORIGIN is coming out in the summer, because POINT OF ORIGIN is perfect summer reading."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Thank goodness I only borrowed this stinker from a friend. Iagree with other reviewers - Cornwell is not up to form. There hasbeen a steady decline of quality since 'From Potters Field'.Herdevelopment of Scarpetta has become tiresome. Kay is a whiny, self-important, annoying shrew who has no chance of connecting with human beings on any level. And Lucy, well, the less said the better. She's beyond intolerable.My main problem with the book, besides the obvious plot holes, was the text that was dedicated to absolutely unrelated events. When Kay and Marino eat at the Old Ebbitt Grill in DC, the author spends at least two pages reviewing conversations being held by various patrons at the restaurant. And I need to read about this because....? Cornwell employed this abysmal style in the unreadable Hornet's Nest.Another annoyance is the shameless brand name dropping. Do I care that Rose wears an Armani suit? Not really. Also, why does Cornwell need to specify that Kay uses and ergonomically correct chair? These are all useless details that only seem to take up extra text.If she wants to return to the business of writing taut, suspenseful novels, then it is time for Cornwell to perform an attitude adjustment on her main characters, and FIND A BETTER EDITOR!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Boring. Predictable. Unfinished. In the end, too many unresolved issues that at one time in the book were critical and all-consuming. This was a book I simply struggled to pick back up. It took about six actual reading hours spent over about a 3 week period. I only finished it out of my own stubborn persistence. It was like dieting or working out, I just forced it.What about the darn loose horse?What about the fire starter and the silicon? (This actually was shaping up to be interesting, but then was completely forgotten.)The relationship between the niece, McGovern and Scarpetta is totally silly, not important to the story and completely unbelievable, yet received about 100+ pages of dialogue. Annoying.This book broke too many fundamentals of good story writing to have even been published. Unreadable. Disappointing."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Warning, some of this may be a spoiler.The book is full of stereotypes. The young brilliant lesbian helicopter pilot/computer genius/cop. The male slob police captain. The overweight public defender who could have used a bra and is Jewish to boot (it apparently doesn't occur to Cornwell that some people who are accused are innocent, or that everyone has the right to counsel so defense counsel are all villains in her view. Racially stereotyped villians.)Worse than that, the plot doesn't hold water. A foal survives a fire in the stable. A lot is made of that early in the book. Then it's dropped. An escaped mental patient is able to follow and anticipate Scarpetta's every move. How did that happen? Worst of all is the stupidity of the police. A horse ranch burns. A burned car is found on the premises. A body that does not belong to the ranch or the car is found in the bathroom. The owner of the ranch early on tells Scarpetta who the person killed likely is. No attempt is made, apparently, to trace this woman's life or look for connections (such as did anyone she know own such a car) for a few weeks until Scarpetta goes out and does it herself. In fact no one ever attempts to find out who the car belongs to until it just happens that, when they find who the killer is they realize (wow!) that, hey -- this person owns that type of car. But, of course, if the police had any sense and, in investigating a murder by arson looked for who owned the car that didn't belong there, they would have found the killer in a few hours and this long book would have ended without the endless whining of Scarpetta about the state of the world and how horrible it is that people are in it that cause her to do what she does for a living.But of course, it's hard to credit the criminal genius Scarpetta is pursuing with being diabolically clever when that person leaves an auto at the scene of the crime.Give me a break!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I read a lot of the reviews for this book, and I really don't agree with most of them. I think that this book is an extremely good example of Ms. Cornwell's chilling writing. The dialogue and the plot are crisp and the detail is incredible. We find out a lot about fire investigation in this book. Yes, I admit Ms. Cornwell does get rather graphic and &quot;over-the-top&quot; in her violence, but that is what makes a Kay Scarpetta book so Unputdownable. I do agree with others, that readers must read this series in order. A lot of what happens in each book is a take off from what happened in a previous one. It would be confusing if you started partway through. Also, the character development progesses with each book, so the reader needs to get inside Kay's head and see things in the way she would have. In this book, we see a previous villain come back to haunt Kay and the people that she loves. Kay is called in to a fire investigation where a body is found burned beyond recognition. The more she digs into the case, the more disturbed she becomes and she realizes that she is dealing with true monster who probably had committed many murders before this one. Also, the more she digs, the more it becomes apparent that an old nemesis (Carrie Grethen) is somehow behind these terrible crimes. Her, Benton, Lucy and Marino set out to find a killer and one of the truly evil people that she has ever encountered. Before the final twist of the plot at the end, Kay suffers a very personal tragedy. We will have to read how that has affected her in the next installment."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"You will love this book. Patricia Cornwell does again in &quot;Point Of Origin!&quot; I have always been a fan and have yet to be disappointed in her series. This book is full of twists and will definitely keep you guessing. The ending is very suprising and some what disappointing at the same time. I love Kay, Lucy, Marino and Benton and am sad that we are now minus one of them. I will continue to read Patrica's series of books and highly recommend that you buy this book."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Out of all of the Kay Scarpetta novel's i liked this one the best. To me this novel explains all of Kay's experiences in one book. You can read this one book without having to read all of the Scarpetta series. I read this one real fast because i needed to know if Carrie Grethen would finally be defeated. I feel like Kay is a real person and can be related to someone in real life. When i had finally found out about Benton, i almost felt like i could cry. I loved Benton's character in all of these novel's and was sad to see him go.I would and have reccomended Dr.Kay Scarpetta to all of my friends and family.We all love her and hope to read more!!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Point of Origin by Patricia Cornwell is another of herbrilliant, and technically well-researched novels. For me, it was goodto be back with Dr. Kay, Marino, Benton and Lucy. This book, for me, was a welcome return to Richmond, after Hornet's Nest -- which was good but not as much fun to read because I missed Cornwell's well-developed characters from Virginia's capital city. There's definitely a surprise in this novel -- if you've read the others, which I have. Cornwell has done her usual extraordinary job of building on characters which are well known and liked -- and this won't disappoint you. Point of Origin is scary, but anchored in reality -- right down to the hair-raising helicopter scene at the climax. I will give you one hint -- I bet Kenneth Sparkes (the media guy) will appear in future novels -- at least, I hope so. Let me know what you think! Hey, I have no financial interest in my recommendations, but I'll tell you one thing. amazon.com's got it, so get it! I did!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"The charcaters in a series should bring some consistency from one installment to another. The protagonist in this series, Dr. Kay Scarpetta, has degenerated into a paranoid BORING one dimensional irrational person. Her behaviors are simply not believable. A person who thinks and acts this way could not hold a job as a mortician, let alone a state's Chief Medical Examiner. This book was a struggle to work through. Its plot contrivances seemed to be thought up on the fly and slapped into the manuscript. At times, I was wondering if the author simply grabbed an old character (The evil Carrie) and tried to re-work her for the sake of meeting some kind of publishing requirement. I could never really get &quot;into&quot; the story...whenever I was slipping into the fictional world created by the author, the sloppiness or preposterousness of that world jarred me back into my own. A true disappointment and the last Cornwell book I'll ever read."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I loved this book. I sob everytime I read it. It was the first book that showed us that Kay is human and can be hurt. I love the Scarpetta series because it has so much detail and you really learn a lot from the books. I finally found a connection to Kay because it showed us her human side, not the machine she normally is. This book made me go back and reread them all in order. I am on the edge of my seat waiting for the next one after Black Notice!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"While I read this book I had a lot of different feelings for Patricia Cornwells Kay Scarpetta. At last I just thought that I am sick of the dying of all of her friends. Mark, Benton...I couldn't believe his dead, I had to read the pages serveral times until I recognized that Patricia Cornwell is without any feelings for the readers who just liked the love between Kay and Benton, even if they had problems. That was one of the only points in Kays life that was happiness. It was not necessary to destroy it. It does not helpany furhter. The dark side of the books are now dominating, there is nothing left for loving. I am just waiting for the dead of Pete. Why has it to be so? the books are intense, thrilling and facinating but with the bad things and moods dominating they just get on my nerves. I will just stop reading these books. Faye Kellerman, Elizabeth George and other female writers are just more pleasant and as fascinating as Cornwell. good bye...."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This is where Cornwell should have stopped the series. She's now stretching it out for every dollar. Give me a break. It's done. Stop reading here if you don't want me to ruin a surprise in the book.......Still here? Killed off a very important character and then brings that character back to life in the next one. Reminds me of the season of the show \\"Dallas\\" where the writers changed their minds about killing off J.R. and made the whole season a dream. PLEASE. Lets see more of the characters in Southern Cross, etc."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books and love the Kay Scarpetta series. I cannot wait to read &quot; Black Notice &quot; and her new novel &quot;The Last Precinct&quot; due to be published in November 2000. I was saddened by Benton's death and just hope the great Marino does not meet an untimely death. I love his character and I love Lucy, which will shock some people out there as you all seem to hate her! I can identify to her being a young, moody and lesbian girl. The forensic detail is mind-blowing and I believe Patricia Cornwell goes to great lengths to research her locations and details. Buy this book but start with the first Kay Scarpetta novel - &quot;Post-Mortem&quot; before you read &quot;Point of origin&quot;."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I can not recall the last time when I actually stopped reading a book I had bought because it was so bad. This series has gotten progressively worse over the past few years until it has reached a point where it is practically unreadable. Kay Scarpetta has become totally unlikeable, the dialogue stilted and unbelievable. Do yourself a favor and give this one a pass."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"In some ways, I have to agree with some reviewer that Ms. Cornwell is loosing a little of her touch. But not to the point that this is an awful book or that I'm going to stop reading her Scarpetta series. I have to admit that I did stop reading her for awhile, but not because I didn't like the series. I just got into other series and had to \\"catch up\\" in them. First off, one should never just jump into the middle of a series. This series is the number one reason for not doing that. Ms. Cornwell has always left story lines open for the next book. That is part of the fun of her books. It makes you hungry for the next book. I love reading several in a row; the flow from one book to the next is incredible. I think that is another reason why I got behind in this series. So if you want to read Ms. Cornwell, take some money out of savings or eat beans for a week or so and get them all. Stack them in order by your favorite reading spot and start in on them. They are just like potato chips, can't stop with just one.Enough said about the series, on to this one book. I thought \\"Point Of Origin\\" was an excellent book. I enjoyed reading it very much. I ran the gamut of emotions through out this book. You know that it takes a tight well-written book to make a reader feel for the characters. Ms. Cornwell makes you feel her character's emotions very well. This book reminds me of a \\"wrap up\\" book. Ms. Cornwell is closing some chapters in her character's lives. Things change in life and so does the characters in this series. As the main plot goes, Ms. Cornwell moves it at very fast clipped pace. As thrillers should written. No fat in this book, it is just lean, trim and fit. She does a wonderful job of tying this book and Unnatural Exposure together. After I read Unnatural Exposure, I Thought, \\"wait a minute, what about this other part of the plot\\"? (Don't want to give anything away.) Well, I found out about it. Ms. Cornwell does a great job of telling you what you need to know and explaining it in terms that the average person can understand. I have fully enjoyed reading about Dr. Kay Scarpetta and her family and friends. I'm looking forward to taking on \\"Black Notice\\". I'll let you know if I like that one too. So hope you enjoy this wonderful series, by one of America's best writers."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"My first ( and probably last ) Cornwell novel. I mean, come on. First a big fire, affecting Kenneth Sparkes, who is quickly made a minor character. A bunch of horses die, but one survives, why? Never explained. The bad guy appears almost as an afterthought. And the scary &quot;Carrie&quot; doesn't even get any facetime with Scarpetta! After all that worrying. And her niece, Lucy, belongs in a superhero comic book; FBI/ATF agent, Computer genius, Helicopter pilot, foxy woman. Yeah, right. I think Cornwell wrote this book as she was taking flying lesson, since the helicopter seems to be the main ( and most believable ) character. Great dialog, weak plot, boring details, messy ending."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I read this thing trapped in a Days Inn in NC whilst a hurricane went over; frankly I should have tossed it up into the eye. PC's own personal events have so transparently marched into this book: she dumps her FBI squeeze and squeezes up with his wife, so KS's FBI lurver has to get the elbow (or in this case a scalpel and a box of matches). What a dumb plot: a six yr old could have followed leads better than the idiots in this. The only redeeming features were that a few annoying people met their unsavoury ends. Second hand copy, as new, first edition, available here. Free."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Plenty of ferenics and sharp dialogue. I highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"A very enjoyable read in the Kay Scarpetta series, although a bit weaker story than some of the others. Still, well worth your time to read."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Reading Patricia Cornwell's books makes me feel as if I am a member of a special club. I know other fans must be as enamored as I am with the forensic detail and fascinating storylines. I feel as if I know her personally. I am not surprised she discovered who the true Jack the Ripper is and will tell anyone who will listen about it.I will purchase her cookbook next!Lisa"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Patricia Cornwell has once again dazzled me with her inspirational heroine Kay Scarpetta. She captured every feeling imaginable for every character(Kay, Lucy, Marino, and Benton).She explains all the details so that you can get a real vivid picture in your mind, between the forensics and crime scenes. Absolutely outstanding. The only thing that disappoints me is one of the beloved characters will no longer entertain us. I am looking forward to her next book that I am going to purchase as soon as I can find a copy. Thank you Patricia, KEEP UP TO GOOD WORK!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have read and enjoyed a few Patricia Cornwell novels.Point Of Origin seemed rather flat in comparison. I never really got pulled into this story and the ending fizzled. The reason I jumped onto Amazon today was to look up her earlier works I may have missed. I wanted to get back to the &quot;good stuff&quot;."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Now I understand that in a series the key is to leave questions at the end so that people would buy the next book. But part of the key is also to explain things in the beginning so that people who have never read the series could pick up some of the important facts. This book did not do that and I, as a first time reader, was left wondering who in the world Carrie was and why she was a major player. It wasn't until halfway thru the book that I got a real sense of the horror that this young woman could inflict. I found Dr. Kay Scarpetta to be a likeable person who was having the troubles that we all have. Her romance with Benton was fading and they were trying to hang on. Her relationship with her niece was on the rocks, but hey whoes isn't from one time to another. Then she is called in on a weird fire that killed not only a woman, but a bunch of prized horses. I am still not sure what the point of killing the horses and letting the one escape was...it was never explained. I also agree with other readers that The Point of Origin was never fully explained. I know it has something to so with the silver box fire starter, but I was never really sure. All in all, it was a well written book, just holes in the plot."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Point of Origin was a great book to pass the time. It had everything people expect from Patricia Cornwell: Technical morgue scenes, great characterazation, a crazy killer on the loose and plenty of twists and turns. I've read books from other authors about evil killers, but Ms.Cornwell seems to make them even more evil. She kept winding the suspense tighter and tighter as Carrie gets closer to Kay and begins to endager not only her life but the lives of those closest to her. The other plot is that of a serial arsonist who uses fire to mask his murders. As the book goes along the two plots become intertwined when Kay discovers that Carrie is involved in these fires in one way or another. The only problem for me was getting through the first 100 pgs. which were relatively slow and delt too much on Lucy and her problems."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Read this one in less than a day. Another great Cornwell thriller. I would have to agree that the &quot;Point of Origin&quot; was never thoroughly explained and the death of Benton was hard to believe. Honestly, I can wait to see where she takes the good Dr. in the next one."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Point of Origin was a good thriller as most of Patricia Cornwells books are. I really liked the storyline of the burning horse farm and that Kay Scarpetta and boyfriend Wesley are back to solve things. I read the reviews and agree with most of them, but who is the nerd not saying anything about the book and just putting someone down? We don't need people like that in our community on Amazon. Think I will write to them. Buy this book, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Normally I really enjoy Patricia Cornwell's books, in fact, I'dconsider her one of my favorite authors, but Point of Origin falls so far short of any of her other works. My first complaint, too many references to earlier books, one of which I haven't read. This makes the book terribly confusing at some points, and if you haven's read Cruel and Unusual, you're really going to be lost. Second, since most of the characters do appear in other books, she neglects to introduce us to them in Point of Origin properly. For instance, it took me pages to figure out that Sparkes is African American. Vital information to racheting up the suspense and interest in &quot;who-dun-it&quot;. Third, enough with Carrie Grethen and Temple Gault. They were interesting the first time (first couple times for Gault), but give it a rest. They're just too invincible. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if Carrie appeared again. Disappointed, but not surprised. Finally, the story itself could have been so much better. I agree with an earlier reviewer who reacted to the helicopter shoot out...lame. And with the Fire Marshall, because I can't believe it took that long to figure out how they were starting the fires. You would think an ATF investigator and FBI officers would be able to figure out where the magnesium came from, if they've had any training at all. SO, all in all I was very disappointed. I wouldn't recommend this book to old fans, and I DEFINITELY would advise new Cornwell readers to pass on Point of Origin."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"this book has a really arousing heart beat. it thrilled me and it's an action. mostly women were involved and you're gonna think about the things that would happen next. it includes thrillers, murders, research, and love.i really liked this book because it helped me think a lot and gives you the skill to predict what will happen next."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"A good Scarpetta, I was scared and hidden under my blanket, I couldn't help reading the novel from the beginnig to the end in one night.

Are you leaving room for yet another sequel...haven't you found out yet that your sequels usually fail. I was totally disappointed in this book altogether. I suppose killing Benton off was a way in which to introduce another lover (perhaps Lucy's new boss)? Perhaps Kay and Marino should just hook up and get it over with. In between making love, Kay could nag him to death. Cornwell's first few books were truly her best.

Good effort, I say, I'll be recommending the book to my friends."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Point of Origin started out a little slow...but it didn't take long to grab me and not let go. By the time I got to the last page, I was virtually in tears for Scarpetta's enormous loss in her life (again). I keep hoping that Cornwell will give this character someone worthwhile in her life that will live long enough to appreciate Scarpetta for the incredible woman that she is."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Patricia Daniels Cornwell has out done herself before, this book makes for excellent reading.

Aflimsy plot: as another reviewer has already said, not &quot;intellectually challenging.&quot; The characters are not credible: the women are overachieving amazons, the men are all cardboard cut-out cliches; even when the heroine's live-in is murdered, there's little genuine sense of loss.... The arsonist's methods take far too long to figure out -- a pointless &quot;mystery&quot; (I'm a Fire Marshal). The motivation of the serial killer is clinically wrong, an unabashed lift from &quot;The Silence of the Lambs,&quot; where the motivation was also wrong.... (See John Douglas, ANATOMY OF MOTIVE.) The final confrontation, fought with handguns between helicopters, is not credible, either -- in fact, downright Hollywood &quot;silly&quot; (I'm a pilot, too). The novel is a waste of time and money."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"the usual blood-letting and psychological agony forscarpetta.

Why not try a female author? I read Southern Cross four weeks ago and since that time I've read Body of Evidence, Cause of Death, From Potter's Field, Body Farm, Hornet's Nest,Unnatural Exposure, and Point of Origin (lots of time to read at work). Although the books are rather interesting, I've found that the finale is rushed. In Point of Origin, for example, there is this cheesy James Bond style ending.Cornwell's male characters are mostly jerks or underlings.I enjoy reading the tales of Scarpetta.

I was truly hoping Lucy would turn the gun on her aunt and end the series. Everybody she writes about is tired, sick, depressed, paranoid, and a constant target. And what's with the helicopter chase? Why must Cornwell turn Scarpetta into an action hero? Can't we just have a good forensic mystery without terrorists, plagues, NY Times Front Page Headlines, and ridiculous action sequences to end the books? Read Post-Mortem again, if you've forgotten how good she used to be. Please Ms. Cornwell, give me a book that doesn't make me want to kill myself after I've read it."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This has to be one of the worst PC books I've read. The characters have become shallow and caught up in personal problems that weigh down the book. I am most disappointed in the way PC handled the whole plot of Wesley Benton. KS had lost her touch in this book....why so concerned with Lucy...why the lack of concern and care for Benton???? Please, PC, hear what Amazon readers are saying! Handle the characters with more care. Whatever personal problems you might be having....leave them out of KS lives. Find a way to undo the Benton plot....SMILE"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"From the first couple of pages,this is not what P. Cornwell fans expect. She gets you in her story and graphically weeds you through the plot. I liked reading it, I can't say I enjoyed it as much as others. I couldn't put it down because I had to find out what happens next. Her familiar characters arrive and disappear.There's a thread that takes you from her previous novels and keeps you on the lookout for more.Again, this is not what readers expect from Ms.Cornwell."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I think that this book was very well writen. The direction that Kay is heading is a depressing one, but after all she's been through I don't blame her. I hope that in the next book, things will start to look up. I can't wait to read the new one. I am a die hard fan and will read every book even if might not be as good as some of the others."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I had never read a murder mystery in my life until &quot;Point of Origin&quot;...I heard about Ms. Cornwell in our mailroom one morning and did some investigating and questioned some co-workers. Boom!I bought the book, found it a refreshing change from the facts and figures of my usual business fare and now am finishing &quot;Body Farm&quot; which is moving along a little quicker for me...although I hate already knowing the future from &quot;Point... If you like massive details and some pretty good believable realism, anyone not familiar with the author should be..."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"As a long-time fan of Patricia Cornwell and a woman who appreciates a wonderfully strong female character as Kay Scarpetta, I was severly disappointed in Ms. Cornwell's latest addition.I felt that there were some gaps in her solution of the crime and I felt that although Ms. Cornwell is once again supurb in her research,(I don't think anyone can top her there), there were certain items that I felt were lacking in explanation.I cannot but get the feeling that Mr. Cornwell may either be getting tired of her Scarpetta character or was pressured by her publishers to turn out a new &quot;Scarpetta&quot; for her fans. I, personally, would rather have waited for her usual excellence rather than this example of mediocrity.While I found the ending rather exciting, it did not make the drudgery preceding it worthwhile.I must be honest, usually it takes me two days TOPS to finish a Patricia Cornwell - this one seemed to drag on and on (it actually took me two weeks rather than two days to finish).Actually, as I think of it - the 3 stars which I gave this book was generous."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I very much enjoy KS and her very active and interesting world and work. I did not like the ending to POO. I thought maybe Benton and Kay would finelly make a go of their relationship. KS seemed cold, egotisical, and totally unconcerned with anyone except Lucy, who I think should GROW UP.Come on PC...KS isn't getting any younger. She is a bring and intellegent person. Certainly she must see that she needs an attitude adjustment before time runs out."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I am a very devoted Cornwell, or maybe Kay Scarpetta fan -- I'm not sure as her deviation from the KS format two books ago was so awful. There was no need to kill off Benton -- if Ms. Cornwell is so devoted to KS living a miserable and lifeless existence, please stick to writing the church bulletin. You can do all your preaching there. I don't know if I can bring myself to read another of Ms. Cornwell's books, she took my love for her writing and flushed it down the toilet, with a &quot;good riddance&quot; in the process."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Pat Cornwell is a terrific author. I anxiously await each new book. She's the only author I buy in hardcover. I love her warmth. She has a way of reaching inside her readers and leaving us wanting more!!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I love Patricia Cornwell's books, especially the Kay Scarpetta novels, but I found this book to be depressing. I wish she would go back to the good hunt and chase books of the past and give Kay and Lucy a better outlook on their careers and lives. With their type of work I know it can get depressing but they always lose in their private lives. I hope she writes more of these books but uses the formula of her previous books like the Body Farm. This book is worth reading but I hope she lightens up in the future."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I thought this book was the best of all her books, although I thought the hate toward the FBI a little forced and phony. She needs to seperate out her personal life from her writing.It kept me riveted and I did not want to stop until it was over."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"What a disappointment to a big fan !! ... It was very slow to get started , and obviously the ending wasleft wide open so we will get to have another book full of Carrie thenext time. Boring!!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"In reading the other reviews, I read where someone referred to Kay as an iceberg. I couldn't have said it better myself. I was not too jazzed on POO at the beginning. I feel that PC is letting her excellent plots get lost in too much personal melodrama. We know the impact Grethen and Gault had on KS and those around her. Constant reminders aren't necessary. I also thought that Kay liked her job, but of late it seems to be more of a burden than the profession that so fascinated her at the beginning of the series. However, despite the aforementioned, I really got into this book. The plot involving the fires was very interesting. I loved the part where she goes shopping for &quot;cookware&quot;! The more frantic and driven Kay became, the more I got into the story, so that by the time I got to the infamous freezer, I was speechless. Bravo! Please have Marino lose some weight or something. No one expects him to become a vigilant health buff, but he is to cool of a character to have every observation of him center around his red and sweaty face, and his big, unhealthy gut. I wish she would give him some dignity and focus on his strengths. He is awesome! Finally, doesn't everyone agree that Lucy needs to seriously lighten up. I have grown to dread the storylines that feature her. If she isn't complaining about something, Kay is doing it for her!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"While I finished PC's latest tome, I generally found it kind of boring and uninteresting. In fact, I actually took a break in the middle to read something else (William Diehl's _Reign in Hell_....VERY GOOD.) Unlike previous Kay Scarpatta novels, I found I didn't like her very much. She was much less sure of herself than previously and really pretty depressing in fact, I found her to be pretty bitchy. Her relationship with Benton was edgy at best and her relationship with her niece was almost combative. Marino was downright morbid...so much so that I see him as the next to get killed off. Possibly by eating his gun! Several issues were left unresolved and, as a previous commentator mentioned, the lack of a face-to-face confrontation with Carrie and her accomplice by ANYONE was unsatisfying. And who was that other guy anyway...where did he come from and how did she hook up with him?I won't reveal the plot or ending as others who have posted have done (SHAME ON YOU!!! DON'T YOU KNOW BETTER THAN TO REVEAL CRUCIAL PLOT ELEMENTS PLOT IN A REVIEW!!! PLEASE REVIEW THE &quot;REVIEW GUIDELINES BEFORE YOU POST!!) Hopefully, people considering the purchase of this book will read my review and realize that other commentators have &quot;let the cat out of the bag&quot; and be careful about reading the other reviews."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I am kind of a beginer reader and found this to be the best book I have ever read. The fact that the main caracter is female adds emotion that male characters seem to be lacking. The use of similes and metophores are lick no other. I am a freshman in college which means I have been exposed to words for the last thirteen years constintly and never have I seen such a discriptive book."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Dispite many bad reviews that I have read, I fully enjoyed this book! I have been reading PC books since September, I have read everyone. My mistake was to read the reviews on PO before I bought the book ( BIG MISTAKE ) because i almost did not by it. A very good friend of mine gave it to me as a gift, THANK GOD ....it was great!!! Full of suspence , I loved it. Sorry to see one of our main charaters leave."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"As the wife of an ATF agent, I can say that Cornwell did an excellent job of researching this book--she's got the details correct, including the megalomaniac atitude of the FBI. The story was compelling, sad, honest and intense, and the law enforcement agents were exactly true-to-life. I would love, however, to read a Cornwell book and find that Scarpetta has a good day."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I agree with all of the reviews. After having read all of PC's books and realizing that some are always going to be better than others, I hope that PC does not fall the way of John Grisham and churn out stories so fast she losses her readership. We still need tight stories, neat plots and some new characters every once in a while. I know you can do it Pat!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Interesting concept, but choppy and hurried. Although muchtime was spent in describing causes of fires, etc.....how this booksfires were actually &quot;started&quot; was not explained... the &quot;killing&quot; of so many fine animals did not really seem tied in anywhere. Only took 5 hours to read (which is not good!)."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I really enjoyed the book, but I was a little disapointed that it was a pretty slow in the begining. The twists that she put into it were a little risky to do, but I think that over all it was a good book to read, esp. if you fallow her books. Definatly recomend."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"the story is slow and the narrorator is absolutley horrible"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I found PC's latest not as dark and foreboding as the others in the series, but I certainly enjoyed it as much as any of the other Scarpetta books. Perhaps Carrie could have entered into the plot more than she did. I eagerly await the next Scarpetta book."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Cornwell has been increasingly sloppy in her recent novels, but POINT OF ORIGIN takes the cake. Where was her editor?? In addition to a plot that is way too dependent upon an earlier novel, there are numerous inaccuracies and untied loose ends. Examples: A character is an international mogul with a stable full of 12 horses, yet we are to believe that he takes care of them HIMSELF, with no on-site stablehands, grooms, etc. We are to believe that the farrier cuts away a horse's frog, and that 14 hands is a big horse. We are to believe that someone could mistake a foal for a yearling. Cornwell should have called Rita Mae Brown, fellow mystery writer and an equestrian who lives in the area Cornwell is writing about. The trouble with this sort of sloppy inaccuracy is that the reader finds it difficult to believe ANYTHING in the novel. If Cornwell gets it so wrong with horses, why should we believe she knows her way around arson sites or stryker saws? Equally troubling, th! ere are numerous loose ends (including that yearling) that are never tied up or explained, including a BIG problem with explaining the facts behind the &quot;point of origin&quot; of the arson of the title.All in all, disappointing. Her novels have been showing an increasing dependence upon deus ex machina endings, as well as increasing lack of care about details, and this is the culmination."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"having read every novel she's written , I find this one is back up to her high standards.This is another&quot;page turner&quot;. Don't read this if you want to go to sleep quickly ."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Each book seems to make Dr. Scarpetta a more egotistical, self-centered, difficult person---I would hate to work for the coroner. I found this book rather dull----the crimes lacked pizzazz, characters were left dangling, and it did not hold my interest in the least."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"PC has done it again. I loved the book and am anxiously looking forward to the next in the series. I think the interpersonal dynamics are as powerful as the science and I personally think PC is a genious. I hope the hints about Kay's next love interest come to fruition -- what fun!!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"The writing is definitely stronger here, but the plot has some gaping holes that are never really addressed. Scarpetta doesn't spend much time solving the mystery; mostly, she's running around and fussing about Lucy, reacting to events instead of affecting them. Most disappointing was the &quot;climax&quot; which was outlandish and a rip-off, never giving readers the long awaited face-to-face showdown between Scarpetta and Carrie, or even between Lucy and Carrie. Carrie remains a shadow villain to the end: felt, but never seen or heard. Very unsatisfying in that respect. On the other hand, Cornwell's exploration of Kay's psyche contains some of the best writing since her early Scarpetta novels. The final chapter on the beach is simple, direct and moving, as Kay asks herself the inevitable questions of regret. What's next? Who knows, but I hope the focus returns to Scarpetta and her work, instead of Lucy's various upheavals."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I always hate it when the book ends! Scarpetta finds herself in an unusual situation once again, and manages to keep your attention right up to the last pages. Keep up the good work and keep those novels coming!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"And, argues with Benton and regrets it, again...and whatever Lucy says to her wounds her, again....and Marino is still fat, smoking and drinking and she is worried about him dying, again. This is what happens in this new novel. More of the same old same old. This was not a page turner. I only wanted to finish it because I wanted to see what character Cornwell was going to kill off. But, I actually cheated and read the last chapter. That was it for me. The part about Benton being kidnapped was so sketchy and incomplete. Truthfully, the whole book was sketchy and incomplete. I guess you can tell I DID NOT LIKE THIS BOOK. Cornwell has said she is going to give Kay a rest and work on other projects. Good. Give us a rest. Maybe Kay willl come back as a human being."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Kay Scarpetta is my hero. She is great at solving mystery's. Read this book!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This was my first Scarpetta novel; it will be my last. A flimsy plot: as another reviewer has already said, not &quot;intellectually challenging.&quot; The characters are not credible: the women are overachieving amazons, the men are all cardboard cut-out cliches; even when the heroine's live-in is murdered, there's little genuine sense of loss.... The arsonist's methods take far too long to figure out -- a pointless &quot;mystery&quot; (I'm a Fire Marshal). The motivation of the serial killer is clinically wrong, an unabashed lift from &quot;The Silence of the Lambs,&quot; where the motivation was also wrong.... (See John Douglas, ANATOMY OF MOTIVE.) The final confrontation, fought with handguns between helicopters, is not credible, either -- in fact, downright Hollywood &quot;silly&quot; (I'm a pilot, too). The novel is a waste of time and money."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This book is just as good as her previous ones. Unfortunately, when a friend introduced me to this author she loaned me her books out of order of publication. I highly recommend that anyone who wants to read these awesome novels, read them in order of when they were published as one book builds on the previous. While each one can stand alone, I feel I would have enjoyed them more had I read them in order!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Kay Scarpetta, the gun-toting, classical-music loving, brilliant, beautiful and seemingly ageless (by my calculations she should be about 88 years old by now) medical- examiner-one-woman-crime-buster from Virginia is back and involved in another intricate over-the-top-you-gotta-be-kidding-me story involving helicopters, fire, metal shavings, bathing caps, an escaped loony bent on revenge, sexy weapons and of course, her troubled genius-of-a-niece Lucy, who with each book seems to be more of a walking screw-up than a genius. The usual lengthy and unnecessary explanations of scientific and technical procedures abound, as do the unintentionally hilarious philosophical exchanges between the ever-crusty Pete &quot;Yo&quot; Marino and Dr Kay about good and evil (always with the just right amount of self-righteous indignation). The prose is workmanlike, the books read more like research papers and the proffered psychological insights are nowhere near as penetrating as they first sound. Nothing new here unless you count Kay's lusty appraisals of her niece's bod-is there some wierd lesbotic incest thing happening here? No doubt there will be another book on its way that will probably explore this further. She's also tired, whiny and bitter. Personally I think the good doctor should just slap some oestrogen patches on her butt and give it up. END"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Patricia Cornwall's same depressing formula is getting very boring. Dr Scarpetti will once again not be allowed a shred of happiness. Her only long term relationship is with her equally long suffering niece. If you've read one, you've basically read them all."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I love Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series! Every book is so interesting. This book is as terrific as the rest, however, I was just as shattered as Kay, Lucy and Marino regarding the final victim of Carrie Grethen (or it is her final victim after all???). I was so angry and hurt! A testimony to the affect and quality of these novels on this reader, and, I'm trying to say this without giving anything away, is that I cried unabashedly for the last three chapters and then, was unable to even start the next book. I may have to wait a few months to take on Black Notice without, again, sobbing through the book. I am easily sucked into the worlds presented in books, but rarely are my reactions this intense.One thing, though... Hey Patricia Cornwell! Is Kay Scarpetta EVER going to be happy???"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This is my first Cornwell book ever I ever read (listened to - UNABRIDGED audio book version) and I was hooked by the first page. I came into the Kay Scarpetta series in the middle of her books, so I really did not know much about Kay. The level of detail in which Cornwell writes is astounding. I learned so much about many different things form listening to this book.I suppose this review is not so much about the content of the book, which I did enjoy thoroughly, it is about how the character of Kay Scarpetta and her right-hand man Marino made an impression on me to the point that I came to Amazon.com halfway though the book to start listening to the books in order. You really DO have to listen to them in order. One story takes bits and pieces from the last one, especially with the 3 books before the Last Precinct.The one thing that I did not like about the story is that people got to where they had to go in astounding time and effortlessly. Never held up at an airport, or stuck in traffic. Scarpetta would say she had to fly to here and there and all of a sudden, she was there. It reminded me of Oz that people came and went so quickly there! But the story was awesome and Carrie's ending was worth a cheer.Since this was my first time listening to anything by Cornwell, the narrator, Kate Reading, set the 'tone' so to speak of my 'feeling' of Kay Scarpetta and certainly Marino. She has a very distinctive voice and can play both male and female voices nicely - switching gears flawlessly. Going from Scarpetta to Marino is fun to hear, especially when they are sparing or Marino has had too much to drink. None of the other narrators of Cornwell's books can come close to feeling of 'Kay Scarpetta' as Kate Reading can.One thing I strongly recommend: don't bother listening to the ABRIDGED version of Cornwell's books. She puts an extraordinary amount of work into he details of her skills and knowledge in the field of forensic science, and the ABRIDGED versions cuts all of that out. I listened to the ABRIDGED version some time after listening to the UNABRIDGED, and since it was my first Cornwell book, I don't think I would have listened to any more after that. Too many fast jumps in the ABRIDGED version that it is hard to follow. And there are no intimate details to be heard when Scarpetta is alone with her thoughts.This is a good book with characters that you want to know, and YOH... you gotta love Pete Marino!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have not finished reading this book but it is excellent.

(could have been faster but when you have kids...hmmm responsiblities! ) Hope you like it as much as me!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have always loved Patricia Cornwell's writing and her books. She is a sharp woman with great writing skills, and her knowledge of forensic science is certainly part of the reason people come back to read her again and again. This book was extremely depressing, more than frightening...because we've been through these same things with Scarpetta and her niece before. How many times can one person deal with such tragedy and loss in their lives. At a certain point, this becomes unbelieveable (except for the Kennedy family), and the reader loses interest. Yes, the author is aging her protagonist and life does change, but must it always be so negative? I get the feeling Cornwell wants to be rid of this character, with this book being not up to her usual standards and with the introduction of other characters in books such as &quot;Southern Cross&quot;. If this is true then I should think the author would want this character to go out with a good plot behind her.

I just regret to see Lucy go down so much ..."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This is my last Patricia Cornwell book, or at least the last&quot;Kay Scarpetta, M.E.&quot; book. Patricia Cornwell makes this character so pretentious it's hard to concentrate on the plot. I really tired of reading long descriptive passages about her perfectly appointed house, her car, the vintage wines she drinks, Benton's watch, and on and on. The story lines are usually interesting and exciting, but not worth suffering through endless accounts of Dr. Kay's wealth and privileged lifestyle ad nauseum. Not only is everything she has the best, most expensive, rare, etc., but things are described in minute detail. This is not Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. Goodbye, doc."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This is my second Patricia Cornwell book, also my last. Kay isa totally unlikeable character. She is self-involved, arrogant, humourless, and totally one dimensional. I could never understand why Benton (hate that name) would be interested in her.I agree with everyone else's reviews on the gigantic plot holes.Also I find it very hard to believe that a ME would get so involved in every case in the state. I have never heard of a criminal blaming the ME and then going after her.I kept reading just to finish it and was so disappointed I said never again."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Cornwell's early novels were very entertaining. They alsoshowed a great deal of insight in how an ME operates (no pun intended). However, she seems to be in a rut. First of all, someone has to follow Kay Scarpatta around and keep her from dating. Her boyfriends all seem to die violently. Can't Cornwell write a break up scene or a decent Dear John letter? And what is her fascination with niece Lucy's past, present, and future lovelife? It isn't titalating or even interesting. (Of course neither were Cornwell's own alleged misadventures walking down that particular street.) Most of all, the ending is downright stupid. To invest five to six hours reading a book only to have everything resolved by a plot connivance (and not for the first time I might add) because an author can't come up with anything better, cheats the reader. Maybe we should all demand our money back. Maybe Cornwell should do us all a favor in her next book by letting the boyfriend live and having Scarpatta get killed off."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I loved this audiocassette and I listened to the UNABRIDGED version. It was slow at first but then, I never wanted it to end. Cornwell has a great way of enticing readers to read her other books by using the reoccuring characters. I love her explicit descriptions. I like how she is not afraid to kill off her main characters. You never know what to expect! I am going right out to buy another Kay Scarpetta novel in the series."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I've read all of Cornwell's books up to this one, and I found this sad, sad, sad -- as well as wonderfully done. As usual, Cornwell's characters are so real the reader feels like we know them personally. In Point of Origin, Cornwell gives the morbidly curious her usual dose of the gross but very real aspect of death. Most people don't think of the cutting open of bodies as part of murder investigations, but as a writer and reporter, I have come across medical investigators and crime myself. I have grown so fond of her character, Dr. Kay Scarpetta, that I can see her with my own eyes. (In fact, I picture her as looking exactly like Cornwell, from her descriptions of Scarpetta and Cornwell's own photographs and Cornwell's experience). Scarpetta and myself savored the last moments of a dying relationship through this book. Cornwell never gives you an ending you'd expect. In fact, this one shocked me, and I'm pretty unshockable. Putting emotion aside, it was the best possible ending she could have done. I think Scarpetta would agree, although in an ironic, unhappy sense. The book serves up horrendous death and a lesson readers can take with them in their own lives -- not to take anything for granted. Bravo, Cornwell!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Once again, I disagree with a lot of the 'armchair' reviewers on their 'too harsh' of a review of a writer's book. I think it is in poor taste and tiring. Tonight, every book I click on has had more negetive reviews than good ones. What's up with that?Again, I read a book for the fun and entertainment and of course the engaging plot (like in this wonderfully entertaining story) by Patricia Cornwell 'Point of Orgin.'Point Of Orgin is a story that will have the reader swiftly turning the pages as quickly as possible with the story's many surprising twists ans turns.The characters are engaging, and entertaining, and the plot suspensful, and surprising. I could also tell in the creating of Ms. Cornwells' story she had apparently spent many man hours in research to provide her loyal fans with both a knowledgable and professional account of forensic science.One woman's opinion, buy the book and see for yourself, 'Point of Orgin' is a must read, you will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Wow!

Yes, at one point while reading, I had to wipe tears off of my face and rub my eyes so I could see the printed words. Ok, so I may be emotional, but Patricia Cornwell knows how to bring the sentiments of her readers to the surface. And just to clarify a major point (and save a little of my credibility) I've had others admit that they shed a few tears while reading this book too! So there, you can be assured that I'm not a crybaby (at least most of the time) it's just that this book really moves people.Dr. Kay Scarpetta is again on the trail of Temple Gault and his one time accomplice Carrie Grethen. This is a personal thing with Scarpetta since the dastardly duo tried to set up her niece Lucy and used Lucy's passion as part of a psychotic game in THE BODY FARM. Scarpetta has a new role, one of consulting forensic pathologist for the federal government (just how many hats can that lady possibly wear?). She's called to investigate a horse ranch that had been burned to the ground, and a body found in the ruins. As Scarpetta is on the heels of this pyromania killer (Gault and Grethen or someone else?), her usual cast of support characters surrounds her. We again see Benton, Lucy, and Marino at their best (and worse) so that a vivid picture of who they are and what makes them tick is forever established in our imaginations.The main thing that makes this book memorable is the emotions this story brings to the surface. We see each of the characters as we've never seen them before and it makes it much easier to relate to some that Cornwell has kept at arm's length from the reader.True to her fans, Patricia Cornwell doesn't disappoint with this work. It's graphic, emotional and thrilling, as we've come to expect from this writer who is setting the standard for mysteries in the future. It's almost impossible to put this book down and turn the light off to go to bed!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"There is a guideline among play/screenwriters that says if a gun is on the table in the first act, it must be fired by act three. So when the villain's threatening letter appears on the first page of the book, a reader can reasonably expect a person-to-person confrontation by the end of the book. Don't hold your breath, it never happens. The ending clearly points to a continuation of Carrie the Villain in another Kay Scarpetta book, but disappointed fans may not pick up the next installment.Kay Scarpetta fans will have to be devoted and loyal to love this book. The quality if a far cry from the tensely plotted, intriguingly detailed books that Cornwell wrote at the beginning of the series. The result is a main character who has shed all her flaws, leaving an unsympathetic, driven, workaholic superhero in her place.Kay's niece, in this plot installment, is fast following the character of her aunt. In other books this young woman was brittle, smart, sympathetic, and on the brink of self-understanding. Now she is just another lesbian computer genius, athlete, and expert helicopter pilot who comes complete with incredible intuition and brilliant firefighting skills and who regularly falls in love with her supervisors. Oh, and she was the villain's former lover, too. But it wasn't her fault. She was young. And dumb. Her character just doesn't add up.Readers can't sympathize with someone they don't understand, let alone identify with. A good book editor would have made sure to create a character transition for those who have not read every Kay Scarpetta book in order.And that's the major problem with the book--it's not badly written, it has a lot of potential to be another stay-up-all-night-and-read-Cornwell book, but it is badly damaged by sloppy work that could have been easily fixed by a shrewd book editor. An editor would have also made sure the escaped colt that received a big buildup was explained instead of forgotten; that Mr. Sparks either had a name change or at least a more finished role in the second half of the book; that people vital to the plot line would have been introduced before the plot line is exhausted; that the dialogue flows less awkwardly; that the non-word &quot;ironical&quot; never appeared at all; and that the ending explained better why no chemical ingniter was found in the tests when it suddenly becomes an important factor in the book.Let's hope plot details get fixed by the next installment, or it won't be a mystery that Kay Scarpetta fans begin to vanish."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"As a Professor of English literature at Victoria University, I recommended my students read this book as an example of a standard potboiler bereft of real ideas and characterisation. The style is basic, the grammar poor and vocabulary range limited. The main variety comes in trying to spot all the references to brand names. The plot meanders along introducing pointless elements like Marino's christmas lights and the escaped foal which goes unexplained. The characters are surprisingly unappealing as Scarpetta rants most of the time and, as other readers have commented, Lucy is a bizarre character and I suspect the alter ego of the author. In spite of those comments, POO does succeed in being a page-turner, and that is all it needs to be, and it is a very easy read. But any enjoyment is entirely negated at the end when the denouement is tied up in about 15 lines and leaves it open for an obvious sequel. Given that very little of the point of origin was in fact explained, having the book tied in such a mediocre fashion was disappointing. Nevertheless, it keeps her fans and her bank manager happy."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Like many popular novels, this one is an easy and fairly quick read despite the fact that Cornwell often gives way too much detail and information in places. Near the beginning of this work she introduces a manager at a local motel that has red hair and a cat named &quot;Pickles&quot;. She tells us why the cat is named Pickles, and if I could ask her, I'd wonder why she bothered. Somebody apparently likes Vidalia onions too, so what? I think some of the attention to detail, like what's for dinner and what color a meaningless characters shirt is, could have been left out.Cornwell does a good job of back story and I was surprised to find that a character from 'All That Remains', the only other novel of hers I've read, had died off in one of the previous books. By the end of this one, I decided that there was a plot line that Cornwell doesn't seem to escape from; Scarpetta is a bit of a loner and lots of her friends die including one in the the book I just mentioned. I suppose it propels readers into the next book, who will die next? But I find it too contrived. I never liked the premise of that tv show 'Murder She Wrote' either, how many people have someone around them get murdered all the time?In 'All That Remains' we have too many coincidences. Perhaps that is often how crimes are solved, through lucky breaks and the like, but here it was too much. And I really didn't care for the ending, it was too sudden and didn't have much suspense. It seemed like she decided it was time to end the book, so the killers just showed up and started shooting.Another complaint I have is simply that she leaves some issues unresolved. In the beginning of the novel, there is a black foal that has mysteriously escaped death and we are lead to believe this is some kind of foreshadowing, but it never gets resolved. Also the character that seems to be important at the beginning, the big-wig rich guy, ends up being almost meaningless, even though we are lead to believe he has some importance.A huge issue in trying to solve the crime, how the fires started and how they get so big, gets tons of play, but we never get told what actually happened. This was the biggest error of the book, I felt, there was all this drama building up about how they couldn't figure out how the fires got started and then we are never told what actually happened. One of the problems of writing from only one viewpoint, in the first person, is that it is sometimes awkward to describe events that the protagonist doesn't know about first hand. I'd give Cornwell an &quot;A&quot; for how she handles this technique, but to leave out something so important seems unforgivable. She does explain how the fire starts, but it is akin to saying they &quot;used a match&quot; she left out how they got so hot when that question was a huge story point to the fire detectives.And of course the characterization of Lucy was too much. If Cornwell wants to write about a computer genius, beautiful and perfect, able to do calculations in her head that everyone else needs a calculator for, able to fly helicopters, be a fire investigator, FBI agent, and so forth, perhaps she should make her the protagonist as she is almost like a female James Bond and she shouldn't be playing second fiddle.Despite my complaints, being picky and looking for faults is a character trait of mine, I'm still going to give this book a 4. In the field that it is written in, it is above average. I'd recommend, however, starting in the beginning of the series, unlike myself, as I think that would make the stories run together more smoothly. I'd also point out that this type of writing probably appeals more to female readers, but I'd venture to say I'll read more, they are certainly entertaining."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Cornwell's early novels were very entertaining. They also showed a great deal of insight in how an ME operates (no pun intended). However, she seems to be in a rut. First of all, someone has to follow Kay Scarpatta around and keep her from dating. Her boyfriends all seem to die violently. Can't Cornwell write a break up scene or a decent Dear John letter? And what is her fascination with niece Lucy's past, present, and future lovelife? It isn't titalating or even interesting. (Of course neither were Cornwell's own alleged misadventures walking down that particular street.) Most of all, the ending is downright stupid. To invest five to six hours reading a book only to have everything resolved by a plot connivance (and not for the first time I might add) because an author can't come up with anything better, cheats the reader. Maybe we should all demand our money back. Maybe Cornwell should do us all a favor in her next book by letting the boyfriend live and having Scarpatta get killed off."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have always looked upon Patricia Cornwell's novels as a release. They are never intellectually demanding but, generally, are guaranteed to provide an interesting plot, good characterization etc.While there was nothing wrong with &quot;Point of Origin&quot;, there was nothing in it to rave about either. Once again, the protagonist, medical examiner Kay Scarpetta, is faced with a baffling series of murders but, once again (and I am giving absolutely nothing away by saying this) she faces the same nemesis that we have seen in previous novels. In reading the novel, I could not help that Cornwell has become too comfortable with Carrie Grethen to be willing to branch out and create a new villain who resorts to methods other than those made so familiar by Dr. Hannibal Lecter in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs.&quot;Where Cornwell succeeds, however, is in her mastery of medical detail. The success of the Scarpetta novels hinged greatly on the fact that the reader was actually able to picture themselves at the crime scene and in the morgue as a criminal investigation was conducted. The descriptions that Cornwell makes are admittedly gory but no more so than what medical examiners are, presumably, faced with every day. One is not left with the impression that the gore is gratuitous and that is why I have kept coming back to the Scarpetta novels.&quot;Point of Origin&quot; is an improvement over some of Cornwell's other more recent Scarpetta novels. If only she were willing to experiment with new characters and plot lines, rather than stick to what is becoming the same formulaic plot, her readership would only continue to grow."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I'm not sure what really made me not like the most. Either the ending or Lucy.The ending reminded me of a soap opera. Someone dies, however he will be resurrected... I just can't get past the ridiculous soap operatic ending. If only Lucy could have been killed too (although, then she would have to be resurrected too).I'm sooooo very weary of Lucy (a.k.a Supergirl) the obnoxious genius has gone from computer wiz kid to a FBI agent, helicopter pilot, undercover drug agent, fire expert & the list keeps growing in future novels. Then having to constantly read about Lucy's lifestyle choice & complications. I don't care if Lucy is a lesbian.I'm also disappoint that the escaped colt that received such big buildup was forgotten. I mean, a bunch of horses die in this fire, but one survives, why?????? Who knows it's never explained.Cornwell's books drastically go downhill after \\"Point of Origin\\" & if you must continue to read the series, go to the Library."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Normally I really enjoy Patricia Cornwell's books, in fact, I'd consider her one of my favorite authors, but Point of Origin falls so far short of any of her other works. My first complaint, too many references to earlier books, one of which I haven't read. This makes the book terribly confusing at some points, and if you haven's read Cruel and Unusual, you're really going to be lost. Second, since most of the characters do appear in other books, she neglects to introduce us to them in Point of Origin properly. For instance, it took me pages to figure out that Sparkes is African American. Vital information to racheting up the suspense and interest in &quot;who-dun-it&quot;. Third, enough with Carrie Grethen and Temple Gault. They were interesting the first time (first couple times for Gault), but give it a rest. They're just too invincible. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if Carrie appeared again. Disappointed, but not surprised. Finally, the story itself could have been so much better. I agree with an earlier reviewer who reacted to the helicopter shoot out...lame. And with the Fire Marshall, because I can't believe it took that long to figure out how they were starting the fires. You would think an ATF investigator and FBI officers would be able to figure out where the magnesium came from, if they've had any training at all. SO, all in all I was very disappointed. I wouldn't recommend this book to old fans, and I DEFINITELY would advise new Cornwell readers to pass on Point of Origin."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I must say this was my favorite of the Patricia Cornwell books I've read. I've read all of them except for Black Notice and Southern Cross. I love them all. This book had my attention completely and I never wanted to put it down! I was shocked with every chapter and kept in total suspense. I thought the ending was exciting and I couldn't wait to get to the end to find out what happened. I was a little disappointed with the unexpected death, but that's probably one of the items which made the book so good. I can't wait to read Black Notice and I love Patricia Cornwell's books!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"In her usual style, Patricia Cornwell, brings forensic pathology to life. In this book, Kay Scarpetta battles evil yet again, with her forensic expertize. This time she's up against Carrie Grethren, ex lover of Kay's niece Lucy, and full time psychopath. The characters are all expecting a murder trial, in which Carrie will plead insanity, but Carrie has other plans... This book has a very good plot line that is easy to follow and flows naturally from one step of the puzzle to the next. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes murder mysteries or suspense thrillers because this book has both. 430 pages of pure suspense and tragic loss of life. It was so good that I read it instead of reviewing for my finals."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I liked this book as I did others of Patricia Cornwell. However, being someone who likes when everything ends on a positive note, I was disappointed at the ending."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I don't believe this book was written by Patricia Cornwell. I think she just put her name to it. It's like a soap opera of all her regular actors and she doesn't seem to know them anymore. Captain Marino is a cartoon character, a dark one, pathetic and out of control. Okay, so he's always been out of control, but everyone loves him. Marino is my favorite character. But not for this writer. If this was the first book you ever read of this group, you would not like him at all. Suddenly he's touchy-feely and terriblly PC--that's NOT MARINO..DUH I don't think so.The main character, Scarpetta, all she does the whole book is walk around in a haze, mooning over her beloved husband who was killed in a previous book. Someone said it picked up when they went to Paris. No it didn't . It never picked up. It stunk, all the way through. But, I finished it, finally, not out of enjoyment. What drudgery. Then, at the end, the horrific monster-looking man, the Werewolf,who no one has ever spotted until now????, really?, shows up The whole book depends on the 'premise' that a scary guy exists. Page after endless page talks about him but you don't see him until about 4 or so pages to the end, but his hideousness is no surprise by then. And what does Scarpetta do? Flops around like a salmon out of water.. So careful and then, suddenly, so sloppy. Spoiler---don't read further if you want to read this awful book. Here it is. OF COURSE, the bad guy goes after Kay Scarpetta. Millions of people around and, the bad guy knows cops are all around her but he go after her anyway. And you get a chance to blow that sucker out of the water but noooooo--Not PC.. Let the scoundrel off. Maybe years ago, 1950's, this would have passed the bar. Now it is just the same old formula she always uses lately. Talking about all her relationships with people for 99% of the book---we know none of them did it, and then she has something actually happen besides talk on the last few pages. What a drudgery. Why do I read her books? Because she used to be good, really good. BTW, I don't appreciate a book with so llittle comprehension of the English language that it can barely fulfill a sentence that isn't an F____ing something. Is it a way to &#34;modern it up&#34; because when everybody uses the F word constantly, actual description takes a hit all the way through every page. Cop out, another reason I don't think she wrote it--somebody younger did. It's not her style. Whoever actually wrote this book, they need to find their own niche. And if the writer can't do any more books, she should hang it up now before she ruins her name as a great writer forever. This book was trash, and you know it pretty soon into it. Now if I had just said the book is F____ing bad, you wouldn't know anything about it, would you?"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"One of the worst books I have ever read.

The conclusion has an almost &quot;deus ex machina&quot; effect as Cornwell finds her culprit in a character who is mentioned but never actually introduced. To link this culprit to murders introduced in an earlier work without any evident association is stretching the reader's credulity to the breaking point. And to simply &quot;kill off&quot; a major recurring character -- unforgiveable!

I cannot get enough of Patricia Cornwell books, they're so good and that is something I rarely say because I find reading boring, however Cornwell has given me a new outlook on literature, unforutnately it will be hard to find a more shocking and impressive piece of writing written by another living human being, can't wait for the next"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Patricia Cornwell does well with her forensic thrillers. Good story and plot formation. Thrilling suspense and graphic details."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I empathised with Kay's growing older and like me, her language gets worse with age. I became increasingly bored with selfish and spoilt Lucy. I was itching to give her a slap! I was fascinated with Marino's Christmas Lights fetish, it's widespread in the UK, we've got some of those in Dudley. Benton is (was) a cardboard cutout character - what a great and gruesome way to finish him off! Even Kay's poor mother has had disfiguring surgery. Now come on Patricia, you can do even better with Lucy in the next novel, no-one knows how to suffer like our Kay! Overall, I thought this book was the most interesting so far, full of snippets about fire and forensics and helicopters. In short I thought it was a highly entertaining read."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I could identify with the lead character, who is aging and becoming somewhat disillusioned with her earlier goals and ideals. (Loved the purse full of Immodium, Tums, Motrin and Aspirin.)This was a compelling read, hard to put down.However, in at least two places, I totally lost the author as to where the characters were located. One moment they were in the morgue and the next, playing Amadeus on the CD.

As usual, Cornwell's characters are so real the reader feels like we know them personally. In Point of Origin, Cornwell gives the morbidly curious her usual dose of the gross but very real aspect of death. Most people don't think of the cutting open of bodies as part of murder investigations, but as a writer and reporter, I have come across medical investigators and crime myself. I have grown so fond of her character, Dr. Kay Scarpetta, that I can see her with my own eyes. (In fact, I picture her as looking exactly like Cornwell, from her descriptions of Scarpetta and Cornwell's own photographs and Cornwell's experience). Scarpetta and myself savored the last moments of a dying relationship through this book. Cornwell never gives you an ending you'd expect. In fact, this one shocked me, and I'm pretty unshockable. Putting emotion aside, it was the best possible ending she could have done. I think Scarpetta would agree, although in an ironic, unhappy sense. The book serves up horrendous death and a lesson readers can take with them in their own lives -- not to take anything for granted. Bravo, Cornwell!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Thank goodness I only borrowed this stinker from a friend.Iagree with other reviewers - Cornwell is not up to form. There hasbeen a steady decline of quality since 'From Potters Field'.Her development of Scarpetta has become tiresome. Kay is a whiny, self-important, annoying shrew who has no chance of connecting with human beings on any level. And Lucy, well, the less said the better. She's beyond intolerable.My main problem with the book, besides the obvious plot holes, was the text that was dedicated to absolutely unrelated events. When Kay and Marino eat at the Old Ebbitt Grill in DC, the author spends at least two pages reviewing conversations being held by various patrons at the restaurant. And I need to read about this because....? Cornwell employed this abysmal style in the unreadable Hornet's Nest.Another annoyance is the shameless brand name dropping. Do I care that Rose wears an Armani suit? Not really. Also, why does Cornwell need to specify that Kay uses and ergonomically correct chair? These are all useless details that only seem to take up extra text.If she wants to return to the business of writing taut, suspenseful novels, then it is time for Cornwell to perform an attitude adjustment on her main characters, and FIND A BETTER EDITOR!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I was really excited when I bought this book, I was told thatScarpetta was a brilliant charicter and the books were really good.

Secondly, the story takes the first 2/3 of the book to develop and then you get socked in the stomach with the twist. Frankly, there are a couple of other main characters who I would like to have seen end up like him after their incessant whining in the first part of the book. Third, is there anyone out there who can't see Kay's burgeoning mid-life sexual identity crisis coming in the next book?After Patricia Cornwell's first few (excellent) Scarpetta books I would have never thought I'd stop reading this character or even want to stop.

The story was great, and the unbelievableconception and committing of these crimes. I was still compelled to read it anyway! I would like to hear from anyone who has mixed emotions about her books."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"AS a dedicated P.Cornwell reader, I must say this was not one of her better novels. She unexpectedly leads one of her main characters onto a course that leaves the reader dumbstruck. She portrays Scarpetta and the crew as a bunch of &quot;has-beens&quot; with the courage of scared dogs. The story seems choppy and not as well put together as her other Scarpetta novels, although it keeps the reader's interest. I was disappointed in the specific storyline in this book, as other Patrica Cornwell readers will understand once they have read it. Although my opinion of this book is not as high as it is with all the others, I would still recommend fans read this book...but be aware of the unexpected..."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Having read all of Ms. Cornwell's books, I found this one very disappointing. Some of the plot is really stretching things, I am getting tired of all these psychos reappearing in subsequent novels, and am getting to dislike Kay Scarpetta more with each novel."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"The story of Dr Kay Scarpella is realistic due in part to the authors actual work history. I enjoyed this book as I have all the other books about Kay, Lucy, Benton and of course Mariono. I expected at some point a changed in the characters, I hope this isn't the end of a good mystery series.I think anyone one of these novels would make an excellent movie.I also enjoy author, James Patterson same story line fast and with a surprise.I would like to know what Patricia Cornwell is planning on doing for future novels.Thank you"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This book got me right from the start! A favorite author of mine, but she fell into a slump for a while. This book does have some areas that drag; there are some characters that you wish she would have developed more; there is sadness concerning a main character with whom we have been involved through several book,but all in all it is a page turner and has you hanging on til the very end! As is usual with PC, I hated for this book to end and now can hardly wait for the next one to come out!!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Would someone tell Patricia Cornwell to get a grip or at least RELAX! Jeeze! This author has some of the absolute best research TOTALLY destroyed by Kay's constant breast beating and whining. Did I say WHINING? Want some cheese with that? Listen, the book is good, not as good as some of the eariler novels, but I, a FAN, an getting really tired of Patricia venting her own life through Kay Scarpetta. Kay needs to become a WHOLE lot less icebergish. She wasn't in earlier novels. What happened? C'mon, Pat, ease up. Kay was a pretty good heroine who has become entangled in the morass of your personal life. Let HER breathe again."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Yet another great book from Cornwell. Although I must admit that this book dragged on a little in parts, the overall was great. Lots of details and keeping you on the edge of your seat. I look forward to her next."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"No it's not her best &quot;Thriller&quot; but it is her best &quot;Tragedy&quot;! I CRIED, THEREFORE I LIVED!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I thought the author came across as a very depressed and disturbed person. I have read all of her previous books and really enjoyed most of them. This book had nothing new in it, a lot of rehashing of her earlier plots. The ending was very ho-hum. This is the third boyfriend she has killed off in her books, no wonder she is depressed."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have read all of PC's books in the last couple of months. I really loved them until this last book. I have gotten tired of Lucy, tolerable of Kay at times, frustrated with Marino and adored Benton. I found this last story line hard to follow and there is not really any closure at the ending. I probably will not read any further ones. She has a new book out, I hope she has started a new story line. Kay Scarpetta needs to be retired!!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This was PC best work yet. You need to have a stomach for it. She shows how the mentally ill can manipulate people, how the legal system excepts certain criteria. I love medicine though I honestly could NOT perform autopsy. I give credit to people who can perform this task with great detail as there is always as story as is stated in this book and PC others as well. I highly recommend this book to anyone who feels that details are a part of life. To the people who felt this story was old - I can only suggest you actually go out and look around at the world. Go to the mental hospitals and prisons. Open your eyes...I salute Patricia Cornwell....!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I'd put off buying Point of Origin because of the mixed reviews but broke down when I needed a good holiday read. I could not put it down and read it in less than a day. Cornwell is back in form. This is one of her best."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I was disappointed by this work and am getting tired of Scarpetta and Lucy -- I am particularly tired of hearing about how wonderful they are, perfect in every way, but unappreciated by everyone who is either jealous of them and/or evil. I suspect these characters are autobiographical, in which case there's a fair amount of narcissism coming out. I wish Cornwall would bring us a mystery with characters she's less in love with, and who are less condemning of everyone who falls short of her idea of perfection (that is, your average citizen)."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This is one of PC's best books. I cried when Benton was murdered by the villians. It shows that there is no such thing as a perfect world. I was hoping that KS and Benton would develop a relationship, but it makes the reader feel the sorrow and anguish that KS and Lucy feel when he dies and how Lucy thinks it's her fault. Pete Marino is a very believable character with real feelings, but he chooses to keep them inside just like most men. I love learning about how the dead can talk to people through the use of the latest modern technology. I personally can't wait for her next novel. Patricia Cornwell makes her characters come alive and jump out at you from the pages of text. Her style is of compassion, fear, hatred, love, taste, touch, and smell. Kay is all these feelings wrapped into one woman. Who among us isn't a little of all these emotions?"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I don't plan to bother with any more books in this series. At least in this one, the reader was not subjected to as many detailed descriptions of Dr. Scarpetta's culinary prowess, but there was still a lot of self indulgence. Having killed off Benton, no doubt Lucy and Marino will go down the tubes before too long. Cornwell and Scarpetta have exhausted this theme."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Though the formula may be getting a bit tired. I thought it was a wonderful read, listen actually, audio book. It had all the characters I've come to know and care about and brought closure to several issues from previous books. I am addicted."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"The pace is slow and when the mystery is solved, the result not very original. There was not much motivation for the actions of the bad guys in this book. Maybe I should have read the earlier Kay Scarpetti books."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This book was okay, but it moved very, very slow. I didn't like the ending at all. I hope she goes back to her original writing skills (Body Farm, From Potter's Field), because the new way stinks!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I LIKE TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS WITH A FEW OF THE READERS ABOUTPOINT OF ORIGIN, I TO AM A SCARPETTA FAN AND ALWAY HAVE ENJOYED PC'SBOOKS AND WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE MORE. BUT UNFORTUNATELY I WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN I READ ABOUT BENTON, I THOUGHT FOR SURE HIM AND KS WILL SOON DEVELOP A REAL ROMANCE!? ALTHOUGH THE BOOK KEPT BE GOING AND I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN, I WAS HURT AND SURPRISE ABOUT BENTON. TRY NOT TO GET RID OF ALL YOUR GOOD CHARACTERS."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Since &quot;Body Farm&quot;, I was always full of hope when I picked up a new book by PC. But yet again, I got disappointed. What really makes PC's book interesting is how she made use of her professional knowledge in pathology in dramatic plot. It seems that now she has turned her attention to politics and romance, which she is definitely not good at. If she doesn't go back to basic ASAP, her name will vanish in the best seller list very soon."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Patricia Cornwell's latest book Point of Origin contains all the aspects of a well-written mystery. Suspense, foreshadowing, and a well developed, twisting plot are all techniques Cornwell has mastered in her latest novel. Dr. Kay Scarpetta, the consulting forensic pathologist for the federal government, teams up with ex-FBI agent Benton Wesley to recapture psycopath Carrie Grethen. Scarpetta and Wesley are lovers and, along with Grethen, are characters adopted from Cornwell's previous novels. At the same time of Grethen's escape from a mental institution in New York, a fire kills twenty thoroughbred horses that belong to multi-millionare Kenneth Sparkes. The fire also destroys Sparkes's million-dollar mansion. Dr. Scarpetta is assisted by her niece Lucy, an FBI agent with a bad past, in the investigation of the fire's origin. The involved plot takes the reader through the distressed life of Kay Scarpetta. The connection readers are able to make with Dr. Scarpetta is perhaps the strongest aspect of the book. Being able to experience the sorrow, apprehension, anger, and insecurity that Dr. Scarpetta faces in her daily life makes the novel much more interesting. I looked forward to reading ahead in the book just to see what situation Dr. Scarpetta might have to deal with next. Furthermore, Ms. Cornwell's extensive technical vocabulary makes the story much more realistic and believable. For example, the explicit jargon used to describe the chemical aspects of the fire, the condition of corpses recovered from the fire, and other such scientific prodedures was truly impressive. This, in addition with the interesting characters and well-developed plot, has enabled Ms. Cornwell's most recent novel to fare well among the critics and readers. However, the weakest aspect of this book is Ms. Cornwell's lack of expanded language. The language, excluding the technical and chemical descriptions, seems to be underdeveloped. Also, I am rather unimpressed with the author's use of the English language. I feel as though she sticks in metaphors, similes, and other literary characteristics just to show the readers that possesses some form of literary aptitude. Futhermore, the literary techniques she does use are awkward and inappropriate. Nevertheless, the plot's complexity enables this book to be one of Patricia Cornwell's best. I personally thought the book was very enigmatic and entertaining."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Well, at least I wasn't TOO disappointed. Since the last few Scarpetta novels left much to be desired, I was not expecting much out of this one. But - I loved her first three so much, I kept thinking maybe she's pulled it back together. No such luck.I cannot imagine that a reader could understand this book without having read the others before it. I am so sick of Lucy and her chronic problems, and the rest of them, too. I didn't care if she killed a major character off. The book was empty. Give me a break.I enjoyed the ealier books because they were exciting, and scary, and you never knew what would happen next. The last few are just tired, like Cornwell har run out of ideas - or maybe she is exorcising demons of her own. I am bored with the series. END"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"While I'm a big Kay Scarpetta fan, I was disapointed in this latest book because of the death of one of the major characters and the overall lack of depth. for example, we never learn what the mystery accelerant was that was capable of creating such devastating fires with such a small fuel load. The ending was too neat, and because of all the unanswered questions about &quot;how&quot; the crimes were commited (which to me was always the best part) it's just too obvious that Grethen will return in a future Scarpetta adventure (yawn)."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Having been a devoted fan of all of Patricia Cornwell's novels, I was excited by the prospect of a new addition to the collection. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. Dr. Kay Scarpetta appeared incredibly one-dimensional and was insufferable in her &quot;holier-than-thou manner. I kept expecting Marino to keel over from a heart attack (probably in the next one) as she harped on his bad habits. The relationships among the characters were worn and tired. All in all, a waste of money in the hardcover edition."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Disappointed in how she dealt with one of her long term characters. Story was good though."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have copies of every book in the Kay Scarpetta series. After Point of Origin, I may donate them all to the local library. What a terrible disappointment!Kay has turned into a grasping, greedy, materialistic bitch. I am unable to enjoy a book whose main character is totally without redeeming qualities. Ms. Cornwell is showing signs of succumbing to the trend towards political correctness--lesbianism, worship of celebrities (Pricess Di, Gianni Versace) who are famous for being famous, etc. Is that why Benton was killed? He was a WASP after all. I guess the graphic horror of his death was the last straw for me. Benton and Pete Marino are the only two &quot;normal&quot;, admirable characters in the series."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"The minute a Kay Scarpeta book hits the book stores I'm there! Cornwell is outstanding! Each one is better than the last, if that's possible."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Patricia Cornwell wrote yet another masterpiece. Like all of her other books, Patricia kept me on the edge of my set througout the whole book. If you want to read a book that has an undescribable theme and plot, then Point of Origin is the book for you. Dr. Kay Scrapetta is once again a magnificent character, and is the true heart to this story. Patricia Cornwell's use of details and imagination is the heart and soul to this everlasting story. Thanks Patricia, can't wait for your next book."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I first started reading this book about a year ago and just couldn't &quot;get into it.&quot; It is a very slow starter with a more fast paced conclusion. I have read all Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series and was truly disappointed in Wesley's death. Where will she go from here? Worth a read but not in the same league as some of her earlier novels in the series."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Iloved this book. I couldn't put it down. it was so interesting and such a thriller. Iloved pages 23-45 that was the best part and was so so so (I can't describe it )..."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have been following the Kay Scarpetta/Benton Wesley romance since day #1. Not exactly the ending that I was hoping for!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I don't know why I keep reading Patricia Cornwell's books!...Probably because I started reading from the first Kay Scarpetta book, &amp; you can get hooked. The first Scarpetta books were excellent, the kind of books you read in one sitting. But &quot;Point of Origin&quot;, in my opinion, was nothing like the other books. The ending depressed me- not that the author had to chose a happy ending. But one of the most interesting characters in the series is now dead...Apart from that, I found it boring that Cornwell uses the same villain over &amp; over again. Even after being disappointed with this book though, I think I'll still read the next one! Old habits are hard to break."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I read this book about a year ago, and it didn't seem to measure up to the Scarpetta series who Cornwell has done so well with. Being a federal agent, I greatly appreciate her insight into our jobs. She has definately studied!! I was mostly impressed with Cornwell's knowledge of arson investigations. She did her homework. I was mostly let down with the story line itself. However, I will, without fail continue to read her novels with enthusiasm. Keep up the good work Ms Cornwell!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"where does one start to describe such wonderful story lines??? I will start by saying that i have read all of patricia cornwell's books and must say that i feel the series involving scarpetta and marino are by far most the best.Point of Origin as all the others had me from the first paragraph. There is non stop action and you are continually wondering what will happen next. I feel that her writing makes you feel for the characters and you actually feel like you are part of their lives. I will say that i certainly hope that there is another book coming soon, as it would be a shame to end the series that way. I will also say that i was a little upset with some of the reviews of this i read. I personally feel that Patricia Cornwell is an incredible author and will continue to read all she publishes. I also think this series would make a great movie series.....hopefully someday...keep up the good work and believe me it is good...!!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"why you ask? well she took away one of the good characters im not saying how or who in case you've never read it..so naturally im peeved...im going to keep reading them of course to see what happens but... i wont enjoy it as much.. the character was good to her series..well life goes on i suppose...any other opinions?i would type more but it would give it away. (^^)"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Just how much more misery can one woman take in life??? This was not the most enjoyable Kay Scarpetta book that I have read. The fire was not fully explained and the ending was too rushed. All loose ends were 'neatly' tied up all in one book - the return of Carrie, the torso murder cases and arson. These could all have been three different books. I just hope that this won't result in a &quot;She burned in a helicopter crash but she's not really dead&quot; story with Carrie reappearing in a later book."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I've been an avid fan of Cornwell since her first novel but find she has made her leading character unapproachable and progressively more unlikable. The main shortcoming is the inability of Scarpetta to maintain any meaningful relation be it family or love interest. With little or no fan-fare she eliminates characters by killing them off. I worry about the fate of both Lucy and Marino."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I found myself profoundly bored with the amount of time spent agonizing over niece Lucy and her lifestyle choice complications, with Scarpetta's exhaustion and depressions and with a recycled villain. Cromwell's first 3 books were excellent- fascinating, tightly crafted and just plain fun to read. It has been a downhill course since then."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Started off interesting but then bogged down for several hundred pages. From page 300 to the end was excellent but a little too little, a little too late. A sad showing from an excellent author. She wrapped up the ending without tying up loose ends or giving any answers as to why or how. Once you figured out who it was, the novel was over."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Did she lose her writing ability, her soul and her editor in the past few years, or did I just wake up to what my reading friends have been saying for years? Her characters have 1/2 dimension, her plot development doesn't, and her understanding of human behavior, systems, and cities water skis. What a jip!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I used to enjoy Patricia Cornwell...her writing was technical but interesting. She used to be able to craft a strong suspense plot and keep you guessing for awhile. This is, without a doubt, one of the worst books I have ever read. The story is rushed, the writing is abysmal (get her to a creative writing class-stat!), and the ending is so absurd that you become angry she takes her readers for such idiots. Don't waste your time or money on this one -- there is nothing of value in it whatsoever."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"When I first discovered the Kay Scarpetta series of books byauthor Patricia Cornwell, I read the first five or so in quicksuccession and eagerly awaited the next in the series to be published. However, the last couple in the series have been real disappointment. I'm glad I waited for the paperback to come out and didn't spend the money up front for a hard cover. The story was predictable. We can't expect the long-suffering Kay to actually be settled or content with life can we? There is just so much personal angst in all of her relationships - with Lucy, Pete, and of course Benton. I never got caught up in the mystery and suspense like I did in the first novels. All of the background writing focuses on Kay and her troubles, not character development of other key players. I'll wait for the paperback of the next in the series if I decide to read it at all."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"As usual, I found the trials of Kay Scarpetta to be fascinating and harrowing. I agree with the other comments....Kay is not a happy-go-lucky person. If you want a book where you can place yourself in the shoes of the hero/heroine and feel brave/exciting/brilliant/whatever, then Kay Scarpetta is definitely not for you. She is a tortured soul, as are many people we meet every day. Her relationship with Lucy continues to be fleshed out ... I want more resolution here, but only (I think) because in real life uncertain relationships are so stressful. The loss of a main character (I won't expose this important plot development, even though another already has)moved me, literally, to tears. It was wholly unexpected, but in retrospect I can see the reasoning behind it. I sense Kay will go on to new relationships in future books.I wholeheartedly recommend this book, as well as Cornwell's previous works. And I can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I don't know what is worse, being so predictable with a mystery that the reader figures it all out halfway through, or being like Patricia Cornwell and randomly pulling a suspect out of thin air at the very end. Cornwell has great strength with her forensic detail, which I find fascinating, but she's weak at building a novel with suspense and closure. I can ponder on the killer all I want, but in the end I know it will be someone random, perhaps not even previously introduced into the book."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"this is a GREAT read. Kay and Lucy's arch-nemesis, Carrie Grethen, returns! BUT, as in all Cornwell novels, the book ends before you realize what happened. if you're waiting for an actual confrontation between Kay and Carrie, stop waiting. it doesn't happen. and if I've spoiled the ending (which I actually haven't), then you will be missing a great book, classic Cornwell, just seems like the ending is only two paragraphs long..."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I've read just about everything of Cornwell's and while this was not her best work, it certainly was good."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"WHILE READING THE BOOK I FOUND MYSELF ENGROSSED FOR HOURS, UNTIL I REACHED THE PART OF BENTONS DEATH, THEN IT TOOK ME THREE DAYS TO FINISH WHAT I FEARED MOST, THE END OF ANOTHER GOOD RELATIONSHIP.IF THIS IS THE END OF BENTON, IT'S THE END OF CORNWELL FOR ME."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Anyone who has read any of Patricia Cornwellbooks will not be disappointed with Point of Orgin. It's has a few tissues points. But I myself cried at the ending."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This was the first Patricia Cornwell book I have read, but I will now read more. My friends have told me that if I liked this one, I will love the others. Every page is full of action and suspense. I couldn't put it down. The way Scarpetta put everything together at the end of the book had me on the edge of my seat."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This year's Christmas presents have been the best yet, and the element of Patricia Cornwell's &quot;magic&quot; made it possible. Let me describe to you the scenerio: &quot;gotta study for exam, but what about P.C.? Well, maybe I'll just take a little peek , 5 mins &amp; no more! ..(5 HRS. passed) GOSH! It's 3 am! But I can't put this book down! Let me finish!!&quot; Hey, who can say no to this book? :) I have read (and loved) earlier works of hers and therefore understood this sequel-like series with this last satisfying big bang. However, for someone who has never read other Kay Scarpetta books might be confused. Other than that, I would say this book is SUPBERB! It is very realistic to make one wonder if it could really happen. It makes my blood crawl with excitement. The way a thriller should be!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This is my first PC book and Ihad heard positive review of her writings from friends. I was not impressed. Although it kept my interest, the ending was a little unbelievable, and came out of left field. It was like &quot;I have to end this now, so I'll make some wild thing happen to bring it to closure&quot; I am going to try to read another of her books. This one &quot;Unnatural Exposure&quot;. If it does not get any better it will be my last."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Another story where the main character becomes the focus of a killer. What has Patrica done to Kay?. She has changed from a professional to whining and insecure person absorbed in her own feelings. Her attitude to her niece Lucy is hard to understand seeing Lucy is a professional in her own right. Kay thinks of her as a child. It would be so refreshing to read a Kay Scarpetta book in the old style where she solved the crime rather than being the target of it.Time for Kay to take the reins back and get out of the personal. You can do better, Patricia"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I had to have this book the first day and, as usual, I finished it in one day. It keeps you turning pages as PC has in her series. I only wonder how PC will continue. I only found this series a year and half ago and so I was able to read the books in order and one after the other. I enjoyed my reading during this time and have waited for her books to be released each time. I was so disappointed with the ending in this book because the ending is so sad. I wonder how PC will write the next book. It surely will not be the same without one of its best characters.I was so sad when she lost her first true love and now this. I hope she does not continue the Hornet's Nest line and drop this one. We are ready for another PC book with Kay Scarpetta and a &quot;just kidding&quot; in the past book."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Indeed the weakest of the Kay Scarpetta novels -- when did Kay become such a whiner? Predictable story line -- I've figured out the plot by chapter two of each of the last four books; where's the plot twist? the red herring? the surprise? the thrill? I threw the book across the room when I read &quot;she was stealing their beauty&quot; in aggrevation. Cornwell's writing used to be edgy and gritty. Now it seems she is more concerned with churning out a book a year rather than being a writer with a good story to tell. Her editor also fails to rise to ocassion -- it's &quot;ensure&quot; not &quot;insure.&quot; As usual, the ending is rushed. The best writing is the goodbye to Benton scene. I want the &quot;Postmortem&quot; and &quot;All That Remains&quot; caliber back. . . PLEASE!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Point of Origin was just as thrilling and suspenceful as the other Scarpetta novels. Once I started it, I couldn't put it down -- something I can always rely on when reading Cornwell's Scarpetta series. A couple of constructive comments: There was a sad and depressing undertone to this novel, so I hope the next one will be a little more uplifting; and, a new character was introduced, another woman. It seemed in Point of Origin that the majority of characters were women - I hope this doesn't become a trend because it is not realistic and something I don't want to read. The ending was very sad and I sensed closure from the author. I sincerely hope this is not the last we'll see of our character, Dr. Kay Scarpetta."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I basically found the book a good read. I agree with some of the other reviewers that Kay and Lucy are a bit too good to be true and high and mighty. One comment is that it's obvious PC doesn't like fat people much!! Notice how good Ol' Kay eats healthy all the time and is thin (same w/ Lucy, Benton).........and at the same time many of the unpleasant characters are fat (Carrie's lawyer for instance). Marino is a eat/smoke/junk food stereotype, big and jolly, good at what he does, but not as good as good ol' Kay!!! ~~Joan"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"As a great lover of all of Cornwell's other novels this one left me a little short. It seemed as if all the characters were missing what made them so good before, especially Kay Scarpetta. It was a good end to the Gault/Grethen saga but did not satisfy my brain. This is a good read for all those who have followed the series and need that ending. If you haven't followed the saga, I still recommend this book if you like a brain bender. I hope this isn't the end to Kay Scarpetta and Marino!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews out there. I love Kay Scarpetta and her niece. We now have a wonderful story..you must realize that. I'm passing this story onto my Dad...he loves Kay. We have shared Cornwell books for so many years. OK, this is an &quot;Origin&quot; book. Let,s pass it on to an 82 year old man."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This was the best book since From Potters Field. I loved the new and different side of the characters we saw. It is good to see Kay and Lucy at their weakest and to see how they go on. I loved it."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Although I have been an avid follower of Patsy Cornwell since her pre-Edgar award days, I am quickly loosing interest in the tiresome, repetitive story lines involving heroine Kay Scarpetta.Cornwell's formula, once inventive and new, is now old hat. It is time for new characters - especially the bad guys. Staying with proven foes for Cornwell has worked before - but she is not venturing into new territory here. Her plots have become too much like a James Bond novel - coincidence, luck, and improbability have overshadowed the important and pivitol role of realism that used to set Cornwell apart.I look forward to Cornwell's next work, but I do fervently hope that there is something new to be found for Scarpetta, Lucy, and Marino. I dislike the experience of deja vu that comes from this latest Cornwell effort. It's all been done before - and unfortunatly with better results."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"After having read all of Cornwells books except the biography of Ruth Graham I found this one puzzeling. As I read it I repeatedly asked myself if it was written by Cornwell or someone else. It simply doesn't have the level of sophistication in the writing, (not the technology) that her previous books have. In addition, there were several glaring typos. I agree with other reviews, it's time to do something totally fresh with Scarpetta."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Disappointed - while still a &quot;good&quot; Scarpetta novel,this one seems not as well crafted as its' predecessors. Still wortha look, but I had hoped for better. Lets hope she gets back to her first 3 books quality level before the series becomes stale."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I always look forward to a new Dr. Kay book, and wasn'tdisappointed by POINT OF ORIGIN. The plot was a total surprise, andPatricia Cornwell pulled it all together amazingly well, explaining everything and leaving no loose ends. I cried at the end and will definitely read this book again."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Kay Scarpetta, chief medical examiner for the Commonwealth ofVirginia, is called in to help investigate a deadly fire which may ormay not have been planned by the apparent victim, or a villian from a previous novel. Joining Scarpetta in her investigation is her usual supporting cast: niece Lucy (now with the ABT), Captain Marino, and her paramour Benton Wesley. The plot is relatively straight forward, as the reader knows that sooner or later the spectre of Carrie Grethen will appear to play a role in the arson/murder cases. Readers should note that a helicopter appears in the author's back cover photograph, and will will play a major role in the plot. The series has lost some of its freshness, but the technical aspects continue to keep a reader's interest to the end."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I've read all of the Dr. Kay Scarpetta books, and this one isby far her best. The plot is good, although I was a littledisappointed in the ending -somehow it seemed a little anti-climactic and possibly unresolved. But overall, I would highly recommend this - it was good, entertaining reading and I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"The phenomenal success of Ms. Cornwell's earlier books waswell deserved. However, with her success, her recent novels haveshown an apparent disinterest in her characters and she has resorted to pounding out on her computer a predictable formula-type writing style."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"A long time fan of Cornwell and Scarpetta, I found myself wondering why I'd not waited for the paperback. Kay is at her best in the autopsy suite or at the scene; too little of that here. Her personal life was always a nice subplot, but was front and center in this work. I found myself occasionally disliking the herione, who seems too good to be true. Lots of political side taking against the FBI; too much of the author's personal history taking over. It is so out of character with previous works, that it seems inconsistant and not plausable. It was a quick read, but not nearly as engrossing as earlier work. I hope Dr. Kay comes back more true to form in the next book, with a more intreging plot, with a few more unexpected twists and turns."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have always loved Patricia Cornwell's books. However, her last 2 books have really been disappointing. Lucy needs to take a job overseas and reappear sometime in the distant future, and Marino needs to get a life. The characters are not new and fresh, but the same ones we are seeing in all of her books. I, for one, did not object to the romance (if you can call it that) with Benton, but this was not allowed to develop.I am really tired of hearing how independent she is so therefore she can't share her life with anyone. Bring Kay back, but definitely give her a new attitude."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"This is more in the nature of a &quot;customer comment&quot; than a review(there are plenty of reviews already). I finished this book at 1 a.m. today and had nightmares the rest of the night. I thought it was extremely well written and one of PC's best efforts. I just read all the customer comments and now, upon reflection, it is obvious that she left some things out. How the fires started is never explained and admittedly, that is a big hole; but the quality of the writing is far superior to most books of this genre. It is hard to believe PC actually wrote Hornet's Nest which I found unreadable. Writing a series is obviously difficult, and she keeps up the quality better than most other authors do. i will recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a sophisticated, intellectually challenging read and doesn't mind the dark and sinister atmosphere."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Out of all the Kay Scarpetta books, I enjoyed this one the most. Although I felt that Cornwell evaded Scarpetta's feelings for Benton too much. The story line was great - her &quot;who done it&quot; intriguing. Cornwell seems to always find new ways to draw you in with the different ways characters die in her books, and the tools she must use to find the murderer. Again, I loved the book!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I enjoy reading Scarpetta novels, they usually are page turners. Although I read this book in just about one sitting, the ending disturbed me. It was unsatisfying. I still will stick with her though, as it is generally a good read."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"After following this author since the debut of Kay Scarpetta, MD, I have come to the conclusion that her most original work is well in her past. Kay has de-evolved into a navelgazing whiner. Kay use to be a clearsighted seeker of truth, now she is a thin skinnned complainer.If you think that the first paragraph simply says the same things 3 different ways -- and you like that style then you will love this book. If, you, after the second sentance, are saying to yourself, &quot;get on with it!!&quot; then don't plunk your money down."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I thought that point of origin was excellent. The last Scarpetta novel had left me wanting more, and it certainly forshadowed some of the coming events. Cornwall involves the reader in her novels and with her characters on a deeply emotional level. You like them, hate them, want for them, fear for them, etc. You want their lives to work out and be for the best. But she writes about real life. And that means that life is sometimes unfair, and above all, life doesn't always have happy endings. This book made me hope and fear for the characters. It hit me like a ton of bricks in the middle of the book when reality came down on Scarpetta that her world had really been touched this time by evil. And it made me hate the villain this time. I wanted Temple Gault to die, because it was the only justice that I could find for a man so evil. Cornwall pulled me into the book, because she made me buy into the characters many books ago. Yeah, I cried at the end and it was depressing, but the nobility in life let's you know that they'll go on and be strengthened by the events. Not many books or authors can pull those types of emotions out of me when I read a book. I salute Cornwall on her effort. And as a chef, I also really appreciate her attention to the details of good food and wine. Maybe there's a cookbook in her future? &quot;Scarpetta's Italian Cuisine&quot;, has a nice ring to it."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"PoO is another engaging book by a writer gifted in telling a first-person tale. I have only two complaints: First, one wonders why the ending had to have the helicopters, except for possible conversion into a movie. Second, Ms. Cornwell may have taken a day trip up the road to Wescoesville, PA, but she must not have spent much time there. Nobody ever says, &quot;I'm going up to Lehigh County&quot; or refers to the Lehigh Valley as Lehigh. I guess Scarpetta, a Virginian, can be excused, but it would have rung more true as the Lehigh Valley. And &quot;Lehigh&quot; to locals refers to Lehigh University."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I admit to reading POO in one sitting, I've read all prior Scarpetta novels and POO is by far the weakest and most frustrating. The one plot twist I COULD'NT accept was the horse farm fire. All those horses with no staff to tend them except the multi-millionaire , I wasn't able to see him cleaning out the stalls and tossing hay and then we are supposed to believe he left the country without anyone to care for his beloved horses. Along with Scarpetta's designer, brand name pretenses and her general negativity I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone other than a Cornwell fan (which I am). I will continue to buy her books with anticipation of new characters, improved plot lines and perhaps even a contented Scarpetta, perhaps Prozac is needed."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Once again Ms. Cornwell has brought us into the topsy turvey world of Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Kay Scarpetta. Things are not always nice in her world but they are alway exciting and intriguing. One of the best things about Ms. Cornwell's writing is her emphasis on detail, technologically and emotionally. The characters have always grown with each book and have continued to do so with &quot;Point of Origin&quot;. They are not infallible and do make mistakes either professionally or,especially with Kay Scarpetta,personally. I will be awaiting the next Scarpetta novel with bated breath!!!!!!!!r"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I found this book exciting, moving and simply a must buy. I would continue to buy all her books. To date the only one I did not like is Hornet's Nest which lacked the usual suspense. My only complaint is that the author does not write fast enough to churn out more books !"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have always been a fan of PC, and enjoyed all her writings, (except Hornets Nest). But with &quot;Point of Origin&quot;, many tidbits of Patricia herself have become all too obvious. The coorelations between the author's private life and her works are obvious. First, after Cornwell's unfortunate series of domestic problems with her former FBI husband, Scarpetta now is derisive of the FBI, where in previous works, the FBI vitually walked on water. It is curious also how when Scarpetta discovers an interuterine device in a murder victim, the good doctor proclaims that the victim was &quot;...obviously sexually active with males&quot;. Huh? The sexual tone here is more Cornwell than Scarpetta.Overall, a great read, and I am looking forward to more of Scarpetta, et al. Also, in the finale, the future appears almost preordained."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I bought this book hardcover and wish I hadn't. It definitely held my interest, and was more violent and gruesome, but not as suspenseful as some of her previous books. I read this on the heels of Tess Gerritson's Life Support, which was so very gripping I could not put it down! P of O was just an okay suspense novel - buy the paperback. My humble opinion."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I was really excited to read the latest adventure for Kay Scarpetta. I was pleased that it had much of the excitement and intrigue of her earlier stories and I really liked the way she had developed all of her characters to emotional beings rather than these engines of law enforcement. I was completely captivated until the last 50 pages where I think the book petered out. The ending was a bit dramatic and I found myself wishing for more heart-pounding suspense. I'm glad though, that at least this Scarpetta novel leaves me yearning for more!!"},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I have been a major fan of Patricia Cornwell and her Kay Scarpetta series and immediately ordered the book. However, I thought it was too dark and disturbing. Also I didn't thing the story line hung together, the pieces weren't woven in their normal fashion, the personal tragedy was too much and the story went down hill fast from that point. I don't anticipate reading another book in this series."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Overall, typical Cornwell, which I enjoy. but I must admit, after anticipating this work, I was disappointed. I found it very predictable and run-of-the-mill. Was hoping for some excitement/suspense. Several times, I found myself distracted such that I noticed enough grammatical errors to wonder if it had not been edited before print."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Apparently, I am not alone in the conclusion that some of the details of the fires were not wrapped up very well. But then, I had a hard time sticking with the plot of the story following the &quot;horrible personal tragedy&quot; experienced by Kay and the others. I was incredibly disappointed with that twist and would be very interested to know what Cornwell was thinking when she did this. I believe our friends in the Scarpetta series deserve better than they've gotten in this book.To her credit, Cornwell did answer an unsolved question from a previous plot, and further resolved the issue of a villian who was sure to seek revenge somehow."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I found the book to be considerably less enjoyable than herothers. The characters seemed much less real, overly bitter, and theending leaves many aspects of the Point Of Origin of the fires with too little explanation."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"I am extremely disappointed in this book. Plot points are not resolved. Villans are recycled. Cornwell kills off one of the her most attractive, appealing characters. She seems to be setting Marino up to die, and Lucy for a breakdown. The conclusion is so open-ended, I'm sure we'll see the same villanous characters again."},{"Title":"Point of Origin","review":"Point of Origin is disappointing; it lacks suspense, the characters are shallow, and its villains fail to menance us. Add to those flaws the fact that the reader who hasn't read the previous Scarpetta novels will fail to understand many of the tensions and arguments, and you've got a lackluster read.The plot fails to engage us, because Cornwell is clearly more comfortable telling us about the details of how fires build and destroy than she is in creating a believable story. Her characters, the same cast of misfits that have appeared in previous stories, have long worn out their welcome. Pete Marino seems particularly lost ...he's reduced to the role of strutting and fretting as a sidekick, helping with luggage and carry-out food orders, and asking a few questions of suspects from time to time. As for Lucy ... well, aren't we all a little tired of hearing how sad the life of this tall, beautiful, brainy, helicopter-flying, computer programming, gun toting woman is?!Cornwell also forgets that TELLING us isn't as effective as SHOWING us. Her chief nemesis these days, Carrie Grethen, frightens us only because Cornwell recites a list of her prior crimes, and has her appear on camera with dark, evil eyes. Ho hum...Finally, Cornwell's prose here not only doesn't sing, it can't even carry a tune. When Kay reacts to the photograph of a watch worn by Ken Sparkes' ex-lover,his comment is hardly worth quoting: &quot;He smiled and stared. Then he sighed.&quot;The book does have villains besides the ones toting the accelerants and knives: the FBI, lawyers, the media, Washington DC commuters, the &quot;public&quot;. One wonders what motivates Scarpetta any more ... but not enough to want to continue reading about her. Time to retire this heroine and her pals. The summer has brought heat waves everywhere but between the pages of this book."},{"Title":"Canada north (The Canadian illustrated library)","review":"This is another wonderful book written by my favorite author---all of the books he has written are superb---I always look forward to a new one"},{"Title":"Touch for Health: A Practical Guide to Natural Health Using Acupressure Touch and Massage","review":"I remember when I first came across this book many years ago. I was intrigued. I practiced what I could from the book, then took a beginner's class in TFH. Eventually I took their instructor training and I was on my way. Now after 25 years of private practice in Natural Healing I still find that I am using the applied kinesiology that I learned in this book. Even though I have gone on to advanced formal trainings and studied in many countries around the world, I can still recommend this book for people who want to learn a lot about self care from a single book.Several methods of treatment are covered including meridian therapy, stimulation of neuro-vascular points, neuro-lymphatic points and acupressure. You will find that many of the techniques shown can be utilized immediately for your health and the health of your family.One caution: This book has a tremendous amount of information packed in very concisely. It may lead you to additional studies for the rest of your life. I hope it does. It did for me."},{"Title":"Touch for Health: A Practical Guide to Natural Health Using Acupressure Touch and Massage","review":"I came across TFH in my quest to be more relaxed on stage (I am a violinist) and help back problems. I was intrigued by this because a) it is a combination of Eastern and Western medical knowlege and b) a friend had done some on me and I felt great. I took the classes and it was so easy that I immediately used what I'd learned on fellow musicians, actors, dancers, and helped my friends when they got sick. Needless to say, people soon started lining up backstage in hopes of a treatment! I recommend the classes but the book is so thorough that you don't even need them. The book is mostly very clear diagrams of the muscles, acupressure points and energy meridians, and explains what to do with them very succinctly in the beginning of the book.

I can't imagine life without it. After learning a few basic premises &amp; techniques (more readily learned with experienced assistance) it allows a lay person to utilize acupressure effectively! If that isn't enough to amaze you, the applied kinesiology allows an individual to ask the brain direct questions and to receive direct, correct, answers about the body's condition. Kinesiology can be used to determine if the body needs a substance (vitamins, minerals), and if so how much. It also can be used to determine what food items cause negative reactions. Regular practical use of Touch for Health will teach the user to better understand the interrelation between the body's different components, thereby making many health mysteries understandable. Most amazing is that nothing in this review is hyperbole, but rather, understatement!Using Touch for Health helps an individual discover one of the most important secrets of life: that human touch is so much more than just sex or punishment.

The chatty writing style obscures the simple procedures that make Touch For Health so easy to use.The quantity of information is astounding...The food testing information alone is worth the price of the book!But I definitely recommend finding a class or writing to the author to get a handle on how to use the book.

However, if I might be so bold to say so, it is not a classic due to its own strength but rather to the paucity of books that cover this topic.I have no problem with Kliebard's choice of years to write about (1893-1958) since they are the years when debate over what should be the proper curriculum in America's schools was at its most fierce, beginning with the Committee of Ten report in the 1890s, he documents several movements and ends with the federal government assuming more control over education right after the Sputnik incident caused the American government to doubt the quality of teaching science and math students were receiving.Kliebard is a professor of education. This shows when he tells this story to his readers. Although he knows his material backwards and forwards, he clearly is an apologist for John Dewey and he has little tolerance for any other education movement. He openly mocks many of them as tools for social control by the ruling class. Other times he pulls out sexist and racist quotes that are intended to excite the reader into disliking educational movements. While it is a dependable (but cheap) tactic to score a few points in a debate, it is a very poor way to write history. It also distorts the true study of some of these movements.Any history student can tell you that America in the late 1800s and early 1900s was a racist and sexist place. It serves no purpose to drag those facts into the discussions of the policy debates of the time. Rather, it clouds the issue behind the offending words and phrases. This book was the source of much discussion in my graduate level class I am taking and many of the students become upset with the words and phrases of certain educational movements and then utterly dismiss their main ideas. Thus, the true study of the philosophies of curriculum becomes obscured in the name of partisanship.The only exception to these tactics is John Dewey. Kliebard admits in one of his prefaces (he has included each preface from each of his 3 editions of his book in this edition) that he is a big fan of Dewey. Unfortunately, Kliebard does not make it entirely clear why. He talks about Dewey's University School and some of the innovations in rather vague terms. Many other times in the book he points out that Dewey is incorrectly interpeted by other movements who claim Dewey as one of their own, but he does little to explain why this well-written, widely-published educational philosopher could not clearly lay out a plan that would not be misinterpreted by so many. Mr. Kliebard, if Dewey was so great why couldn't he more clearly express himself, especially when it came to curriculum for the secondary level?So, this book gets a grade of C. He loses points for being biased in his reporting of history. He gets extra credit for being one of the few to document this facet of American history in a fairly reader-friendly format."},{"Title":"The Struggle for the American Curriculum: 1893-1958","review":"This is a fascinating and comprehensive look at the history of modern American education during its most formative time...roughly the first half of the 20th century.What is most striking to me is that the debates I see in schools and classrooms today were fought on a national scale during this time. This is an important book for anyone who wants background on the relationship among philosophy, values, methods, content, educational practices, and institutions.You can see the history of many of the fundamental elements of modern American concepts of schools (grades, subjects, testing). Looking at this history and seeing the causes, people, decisions, and debates--how our assumptions are a construct--can expand a reader's concept about what is currently possible. For example, viable models of education based on child development that are now echoed by contemporary calls for more learner-centered pedagogy were steamrolled with factory models based on calls for \\"efficiency.\\" It's grist for expanding your thinking about what is possible today in education...at least is was for me.It's a good read as well...you'll be writing in the margins and underlining passages, even if you don't have a paper due."},{"Title":"The Struggle for the American Curriculum: 1893-1958","review":"Kliebard's \\"Struggle\\", now in its third edition, is considered by most to be one of THE most important books about the history of American education. Starting in the early 1890's with the Committee of Ten, Kliebard gives the reader a coherent version of a rather complex story, the story of how four factions have competed to build American schools in their own image. Interestingly, Kliebard shows how each faction was able to have profound influnece on public education and how we think about education in general.Those who believe that schools should be a place where young people are intellectually engaged in worthwhile learning for the ultimate purpose of developing active democratic citizens may walk away from the book a little depressed since Kliebard does seem to indicate that the factions who believe schools are meant to 1) prepare young people for jobs 2)secure American hegemony in the global marketplace, or 3)indoctrinate students to be obediant patriots who conform blindly to whatever adults tell them are the ones who in the end have had the most influence on what our children are actually doing (or not doing) in public schools. Kliebard's quote of Joel Spring in the Afterword rings true for democratic educators who have dedicated their lives to improving education for the common good. Spring contends that the \\"social efficiency\\" faction has left such a deep impression on American education that any efforts at reform are hopeless because there are certain organizational features of our schools which we take for granted as normative inhibit freedom and individuality and demand social adaptation.At any rate, this book is great for anyone who wants to learn more about the deep history of why our schools look the way they do and who is patient enough to read through an intelligent and scholarly work."},{"Title":"The Struggle for the American Curriculum: 1893-1958","review":"The Struggle for the American Curriculum is not a book to entertain; it is a book to be read in order to understand the sordid history that begat today's subject-oriented, objective-laden, test-obsessed curricula. Kliebard reveals the American curriculum is not neutral. It was the results of many tense compromises (between racist pseudo-scientists and ideologues) and economic exigencies (the rise of industry, the Great Depression, and the Cold War). The curriculum that emerged from these struggles was a highly politicized animal, often divorced from actual research, teacher input, and students' needs. Perhaps the most tragic irony is how little we seem to have learned from these past struggles; in the ongoing debates on curriculum reform, we're racing back to where we started.The Struggle for the American Curriculum helped me understand the multifaceted power relationships that shape curriculum. No longer do I see American curriculum as a neutral entity. Whether it is Charles Elliot reifying the Western ethnocentrism in the Committees of 10 and 15, or the Texas Board of Education approving ethnocentric history textbooks in today's draconian test culture, we cannot shake the value-laden decisions that prize one group's knowledge over another. Most frightening is the pervasive sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu I felt in reading Kliebard's book. The curricular reforms we believe will ameliorate inequality are too often the ghosts of races already run. In our efforts to close achievement gaps, we may be stuck perpetuating them."},{"Title":"The Struggle for the American Curriculum: 1893-1958","review":"Keliebard's book introduces the readers to the long history of American education. Essentially, education was something the wealthy used to keep their places in life, but eventually as education became more widespread, it became problematic and the fight for the American Curriculum began to take shape.With its many twist and turns, the reader is given a glimpse into why education is the way it is, and the many voices and philosophies that helped shape it into its current hegemonic institution. The movement that has left the widest and most permanent imprint on education is that of social efficiency, rooted in the concepts of the Industrial Revolution - get them in and get them out. Sadly, that is the way things truly are.The battle goes on. Recommended for anyone questioning the underlying beliefs of our current educational system."},{"Title":"El Lago de Las Tinieblas (Spanish Edition)","review":"Ruth Rendell is a fabulous British author who has churned out mystery after mystery filled with dark, demented twists. This is another tautly plotted, well crafted mystery with characters that, though seemingly normal, are just a tad off the beaten path. This Spanish translation allows Spanish speakers to enjoy this wonderful author.This book features Martin Urban, a staid and somewhat stuffy young man who would have felt at home in Victorian England. Martin wins a very large sum of money in a football pool with a little help from Tim Sage, an old friend of his. Altruistic and given to some rather god-like pronouncements, Martin wishes to give the money away to the deserving poor, in order to enable them to buy a home. Poor Martin, there are none so blind, as those who will not see.Beset by subliminal homo-erotic thoughts regarding Tim Sage, he meets a mysterious young woman named Francesca, who is as demure and submissive as a Victorian maiden and captures his heart. Unfortunately, she is bound to another. All, however, is not as Martin thinks that it is.Enter Finn, the twisted son of Lena, former cleaning lady to Martin's mother. When Finn's path crosses that of Martin's, during one of Martin's fumbling attempts to give some of his winnings away, a very clever dialogue ensues between these two with some unexpected, deadly results.Fans of Ms. Rendell will not be disappointed by this book. It is filled with the slightly off-beat characters for which she is known, some of whom harbor dark twisted thoughts, while others are entirely socio-pathic. Well-written in spare, clear prose and filled with enough twists and turns to satisfy the most discerning of readers, this is another gem in Ms. Rendell's treasure trove of mysteries."},{"Title":"Swept Away","review":"Kat Spencer offered her virginity to hunky Brock Denton only to be turned down twice, then watched her unrequited obsession leave town, never to return. A decade later, she escapes to her father's private island to prepare for her upcoming nuptials while her bridal party is living it up in Vegas. Brock crashes into her island paradise, bringing smugglers and danger in his wake, and reigniting a passion that Kat thought was long buried. Brock is now an FBI agent investigating a ring of smugglers of Central American artifacts. Her boat blown to smithereens, the duo must wait it out for five days until her friends realize she is missing and come looking for her. In between dodging bullets and Brock's many advances, Kat's resolves melt. But with danger possibly returning to the island, can Brock get the woman he resisted for so long safely back to Florida.Blake sure knows how to write passion. She smartly makes readers wait and let's the tension build up between the characters, and then it's one sizzling and fun ride to the end. Realistic dialogue, plenty of action and thrills, great chemistry, and flawless writing make this a first rate romantic adventure on the spicier side.Blake writes much racier erotica under the pseudonymn Lacey Alexander."},{"Title":"The Everyday Study Bible","review":"The Everyday Study Bible is a wonderful resource to help both old and new Christians grow in their walk with Jesus. This particular version is an update of the one that came out in 1996. What Nelson publishers have done is update and expand some of the articles. The list of contributors reads like a who's who of Bible scholars. The foot notes are helpful and in the right places. There is also a handy chain reference system that links to topics and other Scriptures. What amazes me about the New Century Version is it's authority, clarity and readability. I have used the Time With God devotional for quite some time and reading from it is like hearing the Word for the first time. This combination of helpful scholarship, readability, and comfortable type (font) make this Bible a total package. Nelson has also planted some important scriptures on seperate pages prior to each book. In addition, the book outlines and introductions are fantastic. I highly reccommend the Everyday Study Bible! It's priced right, too!"},{"Title":"The Everyday Study Bible","review":"I got this Study Bible for X-Mas last year. The translation used is the New Century Version, my favorite of the thought for thought versions. It appears that Nelson has cloned Thompson's chain-reference system. In cloning the system, Nelson has tied the system to various articles that explain ideas and people in the bible. Also included are book introductions, outlines, notes, and a dictionary. The physical looks of the volume are very good. The print is very nice and very readable. However, in my copy, there were two places in the Old Testament were paper stains were present. I'm not sure this is with all copies, though. In my opinion, this is the best Study Bible that helps Christians learn the scriptures instead of being preached at like some other study bibles. I recommend it fully."},{"Title":"The Everyday Study Bible","review":"I ordered a copy of this Bible recently, and I was appalled by the quality of the book. Although the listing on Amazon states that this is a leather bound Bible (given the price, one assumes bonded leather) in reality this is a leatherflex bible. But here's the clincher--although I actually have a couple of nice, inexpensive leatherflex New Testaments, the binding on this Bible hardly qualifies as leatherflex, except for the texturing. It's bound in a thin, cheap cardboard--about the quality of cardboard found in the packaging of a shirt. The paper is about a grade better than news print and the printing of the book looks about the quality of a newspaper--with the same sort of smeared bleeding of text. Finally, the Bible has perfect bound (cut and glued) pages rather than more durable signatures. The study notes are great, but the binding and print quality is absolute garbage. Nelson should simply eliminate this edition and reissue the book in paperback form. Similarly, Amazon needs to state in their listing that this is a leatherflex and not a leather Bible."},{"Title":"The Everyday Study Bible","review":"I got this bible a year ago and I love it. The only complaint that I have is the cover isn't the greatest. But overall it is a great bible.

Since I knew what I was buying, I am very pleased with this product. It was purchased for my husband because he enjoys it, too. I didn't like having to hunt all over the house for my copy, I bought one for him. It is an easy read translation. There are inserts of information on satan, history, and other topics that lead to further study. I have used this Bible for many studies and it is so helpful in answering the questions of the studies and the heart.

I had to read this while I was working. I have to say that I really enjoyed it, even though it maybe falsely accounted just to spice up history. It was a bit sappy, but what do you expect from a love story. But what kept me interested in this book was that I knew that I was going to watch the movie. If it was a for real novel, without a movie, then I would expected it to be in more detail and I most likely would of not enjoyed this book at all. Bottom line, I'm kinda expecting this to be almost as huge as &quot;Titanic&quot;, but we'll see."},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor","review":"Two brave men.Best friends from childhood share everything, including the love of one woman. Oh, yea and their is something about the Japanese too. But who really cares about that ? Not the book.If this is the big blockbuster of the summer I think that we can all save eight dollars and just got rent some &quot;B&quot; flick from the thirties and forties."},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor","review":"To put it bluntly, this is NOT a good book. With such a shattering event for a centerpiece, I would think that any writer worth his salt would strive to create a story that would honor the sacrifices made on that day. Such is not the case here. This is sophomoric drivel at its worst - one gets more story out of the ingredient list on a box of &quot;Froot Loops!&quot;Yes, I know that this is a &quot;work&quot; of fiction (certainly the wonky history in there qualified as &quot;fiction&quot;), but it is most certainly BAD fiction. Plot development? None. Character development? None. This reads as if it were written by a hormonally-imbalanced high school student. Any story so infested with so many instances of deus ex machina is poorly conceived, poorly constructed and poorly written. (What editor let this one get out the door?) When Rafe suddenly returns from a watery grave only to find that his best girl has finally fallen for his blood brother, with the highly improbable (and under-explored) story of his rescue, the contrivance had me laughing out loud! This &quot;love triangle&quot; is obtuse, indeed.The dialogue here is stilted, artificial and shallow. I suppose that since the characters are so one-dimensional, this droning is to be expected. These are not characters, they are caricatures. They are cartoon buffoons spouting cliches.Forget, for a moment, the historical inaccuracies. This book fails even to offer a good fictionalized account of the events in the early stages of the war. (I will give credit to Wallace for the story of the mess steward, though. Most of that was true - and I suggest that you read the details of his story if you want something with substance.) It isn't even a decent &quot;love&quot; story. If you REALLY want stories that have incredible heroism, unforgettable characters, and more drama than you could sink with a torpedo, then I suggest that you read a NONFICTION history book. (Helloooo, indeed.) This will require you to do some of your own thinking to sort out the good guys from the bad guys, so consider yourself warned. If, however, you want to fill your head with mindless pap, flat characters and childish dialogue without benefit of accuracy or even a decent plot, then this is the book you should be reading.Have you gotten the idea that I don't like this book? Here's how bad it really is. Books are almost revered items to me; I keep nearly every book I buy, even the relatively bad ones, and I only lose the ones I loan out and never get back. When I finished reading this book, I promptly threw it in the trash and immediately washed my hands. Good riddance."},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor","review":"Why do I say I enjoyed the book guiltily? Well, cos' I went to watch the movie and I loved it, I guess i must be a hopeless romantic. But I stiil had to agree about the superficial aspects of the storyline. The war scenes were good but somehow reviews had taught me to beware of the love scenes. Ya right, I honestly liked that crap and that's why I feel guilty. But nevertheless read it only if you are a hopeless romantic like me. Really. don't bother wasting your time to read it and slam the book so disgustingly and give it 1 star and drag the whole rating down because there are still some people who swear by the book."},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor","review":"\\"I got em Danny!\\" Rafe said joyfully as he shot down one of the Japanese fighter planes. For those of you who don't know what book this is out of don't feel too bad. This section is based on a book that tells an event that is down in history to this day. This book is called Pearl Harbor. This book is about two country boys named Rafe and Danny that have known each other since they were young and all they ever wanted to do is fly planes. When these young boys got older they joined the military as fighter pilots but they made a promise to each other that if one went to war then the other one would go with that person so they have someone there to talk to. This promise stayed true until Rafe was chosen to go to Germany and fight. When Rafe didn't return Danny felt lonely so he started to hangout with Rafe's girlfriend. After hanging out with her they started to like each other and she ended up pregnant. Then when all this occurred Rafe shows up. Everyone celebrates his coming home so they stay up late and party. The very next day Rafe and Danny wake up to the sound of a ship being bombed. This was known as the attack on Peal Harbor. Will Rafe and Danny be able to bring back revenge on the Japanese?While reading this book I enjoyed lots of sections but the one I enjoyed most was when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and when the U.S. attacks Japan not because of the casualties but because they explained with detail and it was easy to understand and get pictures in my mind. It was very easy to tell what was happening at the bombing.Even though there's so much going on in this book I think that if you really think about it that every book has either a theme or moral. In the book of Pearl Harbor I think that the moral/theme of the book is friendship because when Danny and Rafe need each other they are there for each other to talk to and to lean on too because they are so close.What I liked most about this book is that it's a non-fiction so I learn part of history at the same time just reading. The main thing I would change is not have Danny die so I could see what would happen between him Rafe and Evelynn (Rafe's girlfriend). I think that this book is for older people because kids won't really understand what's going on in war so they will be all confused and the older people might have a clue."},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor","review":"TITLE: Pearl Harbor AUTHOR: Randall Wallace PUBLISHER: Simon & Schuster REVIEWED BY: Barbara RhoadesBOOK REVIEW: The story was well-written and related to people growing up in the depression who were scarred by the events of World War I. The main characters were young boys when the story opened. They were the best of pals &#8211; like brothers. Each grew up to become aviators in the United States Army Air Corps. They always helped and watched over each other as the events of their lives led up to Pearl Harbor where they fell in love with the same woman.Mr. Wallace&#8217;s story was historically incorrect in two areas. Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Japanese Fleet, remained on his Flag Ship in the Sea of Japan rather than with the fleet attacking Pearl Harbor. The other incorrect historical reference was that the United States did NOT declare war on the Third Reich at the same time as Japan but rather this event occurred three days later.I would recommend this book for people who enjoy historical love stories. Jay O. Sanders was an excellent reader who held my interest and I finished the book in two days."},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor","review":"I don't complain of this story being a sloppy melodrama; I love sloppy melodramas. I don't disapprove the fiction that Admiral Yamamoto leads the Japanese task force himself and sails to Hawaii ; OK, the author just wanted to perk up the story. And I can live with some peculiar things written about Japan and the Japanese; that was predictable. But why does the Pentagon exist in 1941? Why is General Marshall is appointed the chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff before the Pearl Harbor? Why is B-25 tagged as a four-engine bomber? Above all, how dare the author write that of the Dolittle raiders, &quot;all but five would make it back to the United States alive&quot;? (In reality, seven flyers could'nt get back home alive.) And what's the meaning of stating &quot;Of the five flyers who died, two were executed by the Japanese inside Japan itself&quot; (Why ignore the third flyer who was executed?) Won't this negligence scandalize American readers? There are many more inaccuracies, and most of them have nothing to do with &quot;perking up&quot; the story. If the author doesn't care about historical facts, he should write a fantasy story and refrain from preaching the significance of the Pearl Harbor Attack or fact and truth of history. Of all my forty years of reading experience I have never seen a novel that was more crowded with infamous falsehood and distortions."},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor","review":"people say its not as good because the movie relied on sound effects, but it describes more, and is a lot easier to understand. they described how people felt and they also made sure people understood the feelings... not even the movie did that. i personally would go for the movie only because it has Josh Hartnett in it, but if it didnt i would definatley go for the book."},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor","review":"I enjoyed the movie, Pearl Harbor, and expected to find the book just as entertaining. Randall Wallace's imagination is amazing, but way the words were written and formed brought down my overall liking for the book. Pearl Harbor had a wonderful plot and story, but would've been far better if not for the lack of vocabulary and word usage."},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor","review":"Based on the war at Pearl Harbor during the Second World War, the author set the scene of two childhood best friends, Rafe and Danny, who share the same interest and both have a dream of becoming an American Army Air Corps pilot. Their dream does come true and they both join the air force, and that is when Rafe falls in love with a nurse, and so does Danny. Due to his loyalty towards his friend, Danny never expresses his feeling. However, when Rafe signs up for a mission and get lost somehow, since he is asked to take care of the nurse for Rafe, Danny and the nurse, Evelyn, finally they get together. Everything seems fine, until the return of Rafe, which brings out the problems between the three of them. It is interesting to read and know how they deal with the fact that the two best friends falls in love with the same woman. At this time the author leads in the war which kind of cool down the tension between the three of them but while they both volunteer to join the mission to fight back, it is definitely risking their life. This decision had forever changed the fate of the three of them.By the involvement of the war, the author skillfully provides a gap when it actually reach the climax, which is the dilemma of the love between the three of characters, but by that the author leads the reader into another climax. With lots of description and the use of simple language, the author did a great job on publishing a book with no age limit. With a great entry and a surprising ending, this book, overall, is a well-written novel, and a good script for movie."},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor","review":"Are they really making a movie out of this dud? I was about to discuss many of the historical and technical inaccuracies that are a part of this book and then I read the review by a reader from Japan. Most of my points and several others were stated very succinctly in that review so I will not bother to restate them. To be sure, it is a &quot;Sloppy Melodrama&quot;, and perhaps the author should be excused for that. His technical and historical ignorance cannot be forgiven. How can one write a book about such an important historic event without doing extensive research? After reading the other reviews of this novel I realized that most readers who are favorably impressed with this book are neither literate nor would they know the difference between a B-25 and a four engine bomber, or that there is no such place as downtown Oahu. Most who see the movie will accept it as historical fact, and Mr. Wallace will reap the royalties. Perhaps he should spend some of his earnings on a basic history course."},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor","review":"i read the book after i saw the movie. i thought it would be a waste of time since i already know what happens but the book puts a lot more in than the movie could reveal. it talks more about the characters and what they are feeling. that is something that the movie cant show. people are saying that the book and movie arent up with the historical facts but they have to remember that the storyline isnt a history lesson. if i wanted that, i would go to a history class or watch the discovery channel! it is entertainment as all movies are."},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor","review":"This is a suspenseful book and I enjoyed reading it VERY much.

It is a story that follows Rafe and Danny from their child hood in Tennessee through there courageous battles. The suspense of the story is unbelievable. Rafe has trouble reading and spelling but the bond between the tows of them prevails over all. Later in the story Rafe goes to war will he make it out alive or will the battle over seas take his life? This book is also an action filled story, from the battles over sea, to the dreadful battle in our very own Pearl Harbor, and the bombing over Japan. This is a great book that teaches you how war can effect you and what it does to people in war or some how connected to it. This is the best historical fiction book that I've ever read.By: Chris M."},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor","review":"Upon exiting the theater after \\"Pearl Harbor,\\" I was set upon by a man who referred to the American officials portrayed in the film as \\"bumbling idiots.\\" It's a good thing he said \\"Americans,\\" because he easily could've been speaking about Rafe, Danny and Evelyn, the trio involved in a love triangle plot that is one of the movie's pitfalls. The sequence of the attack itself is magnificent, but is bookended by the development of the sappy love story and the American attack on Japan. It's not a good sign when, forty minutes into the movie, you find yourself favoring the trailer over the actual movie.Beginning a movie with character development is a good thing, but only if you know how to iron it out. The film opens in Tennessee, with childhood friends Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) playing pilots in a barn. Moving along a couple of years, they are pilots in the United States armed forces, and like most pilots do, they spend their leave chasing nurses, who are just as man-hungry as the cadets. ...The movie tries unsuccessfully to balance the love story with historical facts and events. Every now and then, we leave their happy lives together to venture to the United States War Department, where Captain Thurman (Dan Aykroyd) and President Roosevelt serve little purpose except to foreshadow the impending attack that we already know is imminent... We're also given a dosage of Japanese movements, from their planning of the bombing to Japanese naval craft and planes making their way to Hawaii. If we had more of this kind of material, the movie just might work.But instead, it loses focus from the real story behind Pearl Harbor, settling for the love story in hopes of bringing out some sort of human drama to bring out our emotions for the tragedy as a whole. This brings out the ever-present \\"Titanic\\" machinations, as it also included fiction with history. Now, I cannot begin to criticize the historical aspect of the film; I know too little about the whole sequence of events to make a comparison. But what I can tell you is that \\"Titanic\\" was able to provide us with likeable, involving characters amidst a very accurate historical setting.For some reason, the same formula applied here fails. We can't really care for Evelyn, Danny and Rafe because of the story they are given. There's too many romance clich&eacute;s which bury the characters in a mess of break-ups and budding romance similar to the switches that an everyday, stereotypical teenage girl would make. Maybe that's an audience-targeting tactic, or just an honest mistake. Either way, the love story does nothing but add on the baggage, filling the cracks with sappy one-liners and unconvincing dialogue.And the movie's turn of events after the actual bombing itself is ludicrous and draggy... It goes on for too long, and wouldn't you know it, there has to be more of the love story involved as well.Which brings me to my discussion of the actual attack portion of the movie. This is the section to see, if you are willing to stick it out until then. The intensity really does reach a high note as the planes begin descending on Hawaii, and although we know what will happen, it's quite exciting and moving to watch it all unfold onscreen. The bombing of the ships does not happen too fast, but gets it just right by taking its time in showing us the panic in and out of the ships in the bay. Another high point is the events that take place in the hospital ward, where thousands of wounded soldiers begins appearing. The movie does well with this entire sequence, not only because of some spectacular special effects, but because the love story characters are left alone to perform their real duties, leaving behind the sap and giving us a real taste of human drama.In summation, \\"Pearl Harbor\\" does not live up to the hype surrounding it. The human drama and excitement of the attack on American forces is drowned by the love story, which never reaches a level of reality, while the ending flatlines completely. I had many questions at the end of the movie: is this really the work of Randall Wallace, who also wrote the magnificent \\"Braveheart?\\" Do the filmmakers think that by ignoring the actual focus of the story, it will become more involving? I have one thing to say about the movie: the trailer is better."},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor","review":"I Think it was i great movie and i bet the book is better because the book is always better then the movie!!!!"},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor","review":"Would have been a good book if author had merely seen one of my favorite movies &quot;30 Seconds Over Tokyo&quot;."},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor","review":"Yes Titanic was a boat and it ran into something, made up the rest. &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; is as bad.Typical hollywood formula.

This book has everything from action to love and friendship. Not only is it about the tragic events of December 7 1941 but it is also about the lives of three young war volunteers, Evelyn Rafe and Danny. As you read the book \\"Pearl Harbor\\" you will connect with two children that become men in a world of emotions that they will share together during, what might be the greatest moment of their lives. It starts in Tennessee where two boys, Rafe and Danny, are using their imagination to act out a fight in the air with planes. Rafe is a good kid with always a wanting more for adventure; he is always pushing the envelope and teasing his fears. Danny is also a good kid, more obedient then Rafe, but Danny is really smart reading a grade level above is class standards. But they been best friends since the day Danny stood up for Rafe at school cause a kid was making fun of him. You see Rafe has a hard time reading and Danny punched the kid and since then Rafe and Danny had been best friends. When the Germans invaded Poland in 1939 and world war was in sight, thousands of people enlisted in the army, navy, marines, and air force, and with them Rafe and Danny. They enlisted in the air force, this is where they met Evelyn she was a nurse that took care of the wounded. The problem was that these 2 best friends fell in love. But when the war began, out of the blue Rafe decides he must leave to join Europe's fight. Swearing to Evelyn and Danny that he will return. His promise never came true because that's when Pearl Harbor comes down hard and with it Rafe did too. At the end Danny suffers the consequences and died.By: Alexis Aguilar rex."},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor","review":"\\"Pearl Harbor,\\" by Randall Wallace, is a well-rounded novel that coherently combines the tragedy of war with the greatness of romance. I chose this novel because I have particular interest learning about the past wars, and this novel tied in a love story, which gave more reason to choose this novel. When reading other reviews, many enjoyed this novel.Although Randall Wallace includes the negative aspects of bias, association, stereotyping and overgeneralization in this novel they are all cohesive with the results of war. For example, before the Japanese Admiral Yamamoto bombed Pearl Harbor he was a respected colleague, but after the bombing \\"many Americans would think of Yamamoto as blood-thirsty and murderous.\\" Stereotyping is represented within this quote because many peoples perception of Yamamoto changed based on the actions of other Japanese people.Wallace has the authority to write about the aspects of Pearl Harbor because his facts are valid and accurate. Within the novel he includes the aspect of the Great Depression, as well as the ideas of Hitler, Churchill, Stalin and Roosevelt. For example, \\"Roosevelt was speaking again. \`I'm afraid I'm on a bad mood. Churchill and Stalin are asking me what I'm asking you: how long is America going to pretend the world is not at war?'\\" Therefore, this novel thoroughly connects with the United States' history.One reader described the novel as having a great moral/theme of friendship and also learned a lot about the United States' past. Another reader suggested the novel because it had an amazing romantic plot. I agree with these readers and invite anyone to read this novel, for it is accurate to history and ties in a great romantic story.Senior English Student 2010"},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor","review":"OK, I just finished listening to the audio version, and I will say this: \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is not bad. But there's nothing great about it either.It is a love story set, obviously, at the dawn of America's entry into WW II. But it also the story of two best friends who get separated when one volunteers to help the British fight the Germans. The remaining friend and the girlfriend then strike up their own friendship, which becomes complicated when the volunteer returns to the US. When he finds out what's gone on, well...let's just say the war isn't the only fighting that occurs! And, oh yeah, right about this time the Japanese decide to attack the US, further complicating matters for the trio!Overall, this was a decent book. However, I have read a few other historical fiction works recently (\\"The Gates of Fire,\\" \\"Rise to Rebellion\\"), and there is a definite drop-off in quality between those works and this one. Again, \\"Pearl Harbor\\" isn't bad, but I was left with the feeling that it could have been much better.Three stars."},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor","review":"people say its not as good because the movie relied on sound effects, but it describes more, and is a lot easier to understand. they described how people felt and they also made sure people understood the feelings... not even the movie did that. i personally would go for the movie only because it has Josh Hartnett in it, but if it didnt i would definatley go for the book."},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor","review":"I doubt that I can say much about this book that hasn't already been said, but I am so disgusted that I can't stop myself from adding this. I would have rated it at less than 1 star, if that choice were possible.Besides being so wildly inaccurate with its historical &quot;facts&quot;, the prose in this book is so incredibly horrid. I really wish I had not wasted my money, but since I am such a history buff of the era, I tried it anyway. I can't imagine why anyone would publish this, much less &quot;write&quot; it.&quot;Melodrama&quot; is a weak description of this book - &quot;putrid schlock&quot; would be more accurate. What bothers me most is that it is such an insult to those who were there - to those who lost their lives, and those who survived. I forced myself to read the entire book, every painful moment of it, just to be sure that the whole thing was as awful as the first page. Unfortunately, it was.My advice is to avoid this book as if it were toxic waste. It surely is poisonous to the memory of the tragedy and treachery of the Pearl Harbor attack. I was going to go see the movie, but I won't waste any more of my money on this travesty - that would be a sacrilege to those earned the freedoms we now enjoy. Yes, even the freedom to publish a book as horrible as this one is - and the freedom to voice my opinion.May the souls of those gallant men, women and children who died in the Pearl Harbor attack know that some of us remember the truth, and we honor your sacrifices and heroism. To abuse their loss in the pursuit of Hollywood money is almost as big a tragedy as the original event."},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor","review":"I was surprised to find so many reviewers panning this &quot;novel&quot; for being &quot;historically inaccurate.&quot; Hello!!! It does not claim to be a documentary on the war - that has been done, as we all know. This is a piece of FICTION Guys, so enjoy it for what it is. Yes, a &quot;sloppy melodrama,&quot; and a very good one at that!! I loved the characters and the love story, set against one of the most beautiful backdrops on earth. Each character had depth and meaning, and I felt as if I really got to know them personnally.

It makes you feel the pains, the emotions, and the sadness of that terrible day when our nation went from peace time to war time. It is also more historically accurate than the film version, even though the film is still the best film of 2001. An exceptional read! Almost ranks up there with the Shaaras' Civil War Novels (THE KILLER ANGELS, GODS AND GENERALS, THE LAST FULL MEASURE, and GONE FOR SOLDIERS). You won't be disappointed! Grade: A+"},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor","review":"This review is coming from a nonhistorical point of view, for all the casual readers who just want to read for the fun of it. Some minimal background knowledge is helpful, as this is very fictional but coincides with various historical incidents in World War II around December of 1941/early 1942. The book appears to be over early on, but several twists keep it going. I won't go into any more detail, but I recommend this book, which is a fairly emotional one."},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor","review":"The book Peal Harbor is a great Inspirational and meaningful story that I've ever read in which the story touched me deeply. It is a story that follows Rafe and Danny from their child hood in Tennessee through there courageous battles. The suspense of the story is unbelievable. Rafe has trouble reading and spelling but the bond between the tows of them prevails over all. Later in the story Rafe goes to war will he make it out alive or will the battle over seas take his life? This book is also an action filled story, from the battles over sea, to the dreadful battle in our very own Pearl Harbor, and the bombing over Japan. This is a great book that teaches you how war can effect you and what it does to people in war or some how connected to it. This is the best historical fiction book that I've ever read.By: Chris M."},{"Title":"Sign of the Cross: The Prosecutor's True Story of a Landmark Trial Against the Klan","review":"John Phillips' Sign Of The Cross provides a prosecutor's true story of a trial against the Klan, and uses police records, courtroom proceedings and testimony in the course of relating Phillips' stormy legal battle against An involving history."},{"Title":"Sign of the Cross: The Prosecutor's True Story of a Landmark Trial Against the Klan","review":"Sign of the Cross is a riveting account of hate crime.

But, Sign of the Cross is a sensational True-to-Life Drama that kept me anxiously turning each and every page. The book was extremely well-written and I think we need more books like this one, so that people in our society can be aware of what's going on in society (both historically and currently).I would love to see the book adapted as a screen-play.

It was almost as fun as having friendship and loyalty!"},{"Title":"Sign of the Cross: The Prosecutor's True Story of a Landmark Trial Against the Klan","review":"John Phillips prosecuted some pretty ugly guys who were into cross-burning in the California suburbs. This is his first-hand story, and it's a good one. I found it especially interesting because of the creative legal strategies he had to take in order to move forward with the prosecution, the deep humanitarian and religious questions his story raises, and the office politics in the LA District Attorney's office that he had to overcome in order to bring these men to justice.Mr. Phillips has more of a law than a writing background, and it shows; a journalist would have written a slightly more polished book. But it probably would have been less satisfying, because polish means stepping away from the driving passion that animates the prosecutor. Overall, this is a compelling story of an obscure but important moment in American law."},{"Title":"Sign of the Cross: The Prosecutor's True Story of a Landmark Trial Against the Klan","review":"In 2002, when I was about to graduate high school, the seniors had to do one last book essay for school.

I was excited to write an essay about this book but I didn't know where to start. Until I was answering the phones at work one day and my boss got a call from a John Phillips. So I asked if he was the John Phillips that wrote the book and he said yea and I told him that I liked the book so much that I was doing an essay about it at school and he seemed very happy to hear that.

[no. 590])","review":"The ideas put forward by Ricardo in this book challenges some of the ideas presented by Adam Smith in the Wealth of Nations, particularly in the principles of economic rent. Ricardo also revealed interesting insights on the subject of value in chapter 1.To understand the text fully,it would be advisable to have read Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, another book in the Great Minds Series, which I had also painfully digested.Like other books in the Great Mind's series, have a good cup of coffee ready. It is a very challenging and difficult read. Nevertheless, it is a worthwhile read for those serious in understanding the foundations of the present economic systems."},{"Title":"The principles of political economy and taxation (Everyman's library, ed. by Ernest Rhys. Science. [no. 590])","review":"Some authors you read, and perhaps think, &quot;I wish I'd written that!&quot; Ricardo, like Adam Smith and John Locke, are in another league altogether. The originality of mind is stunning. Smith, Mill, Malthus and J.B. Say are all more readable, which I fear sounds like a very poor recommendation for Ricardo! Still, I was so bowled over by the originality of his theoretical line, that I forgave much slow slogging through a difficult text. His theory of rent is I think quite misguided, but is so powerfully presented that I was hard put to think how I might argue against it were Ricardo to appear before me in person. I took this book about ten pages at a time, and found it well worth the trouble."},{"Title":"The principles of political economy and taxation (Everyman's library, ed. by Ernest Rhys. Science. [no. 590])","review":"Along with Adam Smith, the Englishman David Ricardo is one of the fathers of the so-called Classics school of economic thought, and the Principles is his major opus, one he was very much reluctant to write, but only did so at the urgings of James Mill and his son John. Written in the first half of the 19th victorian century, he was nonetheless, a very freed mind, who did not accept or indulge in the extravagancies of the beginning of the industrialization proccess in England. To David Ricardo, Karl Marx owes a good share of his theory of labour, something essential in the labour movements of then. The concepts adapted and created by David Ricardo is transported to the text in a dry and concise style, not too much worried in polemics, but only interested in address the topics he raises in a very precise way. IF you are a student of Social Sciences, this book is a must."},{"Title":"The principles of political economy and taxation (Everyman's library, ed. by Ernest Rhys. Science. [no. 590])","review":"I got this book, well frankly because I wanted to read John Maynard Keynes' General Theory. I got 2 pages into it and realized that I needed to do a little more background work. Keynes referred to Ricardo a bunch in those first few pages, so I skipped to this book.I am VERY glad that I read Adam Smith's \\"Wealth of Nations\\" before I read this book. Ricardo constantly refers back to it. He also refers to Malthus, Buchannan and Say alot. I did learn a great deal in this book-and he proved very effectively some points that seemed counter-intuitive to me. There are a few things that I still don't agree with, but I recognize this as a the next step down the road to modern economics.The language in this book was more \\"modern english\\" than \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" but still not what I would consider entirely modern. Another thing that made this book a little more readable was the lack of long digressions on various things. Ricardo's examples were short and very illustrative. \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" was laced with Enlightenment philosophy which really made my little libertarian heart flood with joy. There was none of that, here. Very much more like a text book.The reason I knocked off a star was Ricardo's habit of taking great pains to explain in great detail how this or that would happen under this or that circumstance...and then in 1 paragraph at the end explain why this would never actually happen, or explain why he didn't really mean what it sounded like he was saying. Frustrating.Overall, a good and very worthwhile read. Don't expect to be entertained-but expect to learn something."},{"Title":"The principles of political economy and taxation (Everyman's library, ed. by Ernest Rhys. Science. [no. 590])","review":"This work is a masterpiece of economic theory only second tothe Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith. Ricardo states that valueis a function of effort and not the price paid for labor. Hereminded us that labor plus the tools to assist labor affectedthe creation of value. Therefore; increases in value were indirect proportion to increments in labor. Value was also afunction of the time it took to bring the goods to market.Surprisingly, the cultivation of inferior land resulted in ahigher exchangeable value of raw produce because more laborwas required in its production. If we become more efficient inland cultivation, rents will go down because more can becultivated with less land. In addition, the exchangeable valueof commodities is undisturbed by natural or accidental causes.Laborers derive their greatest pleasure when the market priceof labor exceeds the natural price. Therefore; wages willincrease in response to increases in the demand for labor.Rises in rent are accompanied by increments in the share ofproduce because landlords want more rent when harvests aregreater. Accordingly, the price of corn is a function of the labor to produce it. If wages go down, then prices must fall.As the price of labor goes down, profits increase but theprice of the commodity may not go down. Taxes on profitstend to increase the price of a commodity . If money is nottaxed, then all commodities will be subject to price increases.Ultimately, a tax on land begets a tax on produce. In addition,a tax on labor will raise its price. In addition, the price ofprovisions determine the price paid to the worker. If moneydecreases in value, all commodities will be subject to steepprice increases. This was seen in modern times with thefluctuation of the Russian currency. Ultimately, bountylowers the price to foreigners because the government subsidizesthe bounty paid to the local merchants to stimulate trade.The theory of rent transfers value but does not create it.Ultimately, wages are determined by the price of food andcost of production.This theory of wages differs from Adam Smith who said thatwages were a function of the ease or hardship to do work, thedifficulty or expense of learning a trade, the constancyof employment, the trust reposed in the workmen, the probabilityof success or failure of the venture or the fear of misfortune.David Ricardo's work is an important milestone in the theoryof economics and comparison to the work of Adam Smith."},{"Title":"The principles of political economy and taxation (Everyman's library, ed. by Ernest Rhys. Science. [no. 590])","review":"David Ricardo played a crucial role in developing Classical Economics. Ricardo was prompted to write on economics by reading The Wealth of Nations. As luck would have it, Ricardo knew James Mill (father of JS Mill) and was soon in contact with TR Malthus. The debates between Ricardo and Malthus produced a paradigm that lasted only a half a century. PPE+T is a central part of the Classical paradigm, it is Ricardo's definitive statement on economics.PPE+T is perhaps the most tightly reasoned book written by a Classical economists (JS Mill is a close rival here). This is not fun reading but it is important as a piece of history, and elements of Ricardo's analysis remain relevant today. Given Ricardo's razor sharp intellect, one must wonder why he did not develop modern value theory himself. The tight reasoning of this book is, ironically, the source of much criticism against it. Joseph Schumpeter (among others) has lamented \`the Ricardian vice', by which Ricardo arrived at policy conclusions through flawless but restrictive logical reasoning. Ricardo is hard to argue against, given his assumptions, but what if we alter these assumptions?While Classical Economics is dead, some of its Ricardian elements live on. The Principles of Political Economy and Taxation remains relevant today largely because of Ricardo's concept of Comparative Advantage. Comparative Advantage is one of the most enduring ideas in economics. The development of the Comparative Advantage concept set Ricardo ahead of all but a few of his contemporaries. Economists still speak of Ricardian Equivalence and The Ricardo Effect. While some might object Ricardo's logical-deductive approach to political economy, few economists have stood the test of time so well. PPE+T is a timeless classic. This is not fun reading, but it is important none the less."},{"Title":"The principles of political economy and taxation (Everyman's library, ed. by Ernest Rhys. Science.

The author offers many practical toning exercises. Great pictorial book format with clear and concise instruction. I would give this book 5 stars, but I have two reservations. First, the author's constant referral to Hollywood clients began to sound like relentlessly insecure &quot;look at who I train!&quot; name-dropping. The author's strong credentials stand on their own -- she doesn't need to underscore her legitimacy by constantly fawning over her Hollywood clients. I just want the exercises, not the dirt about Penelope Miller! Finally, the book seems to skim the upper body workout, while focusing on some (admittedly wonderful) ab, glute, and leg workouts.

Only one sister of three survives her isolation in a TB hospital-orphanage in the secluded Kalihi Valley in Hawaii, three little girls sent away when they develop tuberculosis, one after another, banished so that they will not infect their family, five-year old Leah, then Aki, then Anah. Leah is terrified; Aki is angry. Only Anah will survive, her sisters dying one after the other, Anah left alone in a place where there is little solace and much despair. Lonely, she reaches to the spirit world and the companionship of her sisters. Leah calls out to Anah; Aki curses her living sister and attacks her mercilessly; and Seth, a boy who died before they came, waits for them all. At the family home, their Hawaiian mother goes mad with grief, their Portuguese father demanding she forget those worthless daughters and give him sons.Anah endures much at the orphanage, the relentless jibes of Sister Bernadine a burden from which she can never escape, her only solace Leah, Aki and Seth. Seth's older brother, Ezroh, is Anah's salvation. It is he who cures her from the cuts and bruises inflicted by Aki that no one at the orphanage can explain, he who offers release with his unconditional love. On her eighteenth birthday, Anah is finally released, leaving behind her sorrows and her sisters in hopes of a better life with Ezroh. Cruel words follow even here, this time from Ezroh's Portuguese aunt, bitter remarks that infect the difficult births of Anah's four daughters: Hosanah, the first-born, disfigured by a careless midwife; Elizabeth thought slow because she refuses to speak; Tori a perfect replica of Anah's beautiful mother; and the frail but spirited Miriam who fights for life against all odds. Through her children, Anah recovers her family, yet she never forgets her siblings or the curse they have laid upon her. She will pay a price for her freedom, though she never imagines how staggering this price will be.Anah has an indomitable spirit and a generous heart, reaching through the world of the living and the dead, yearning for a lost mother and the sisters she could not save. In a story of stark beauty and brutal reality, Anah's life is painted in the bright red blood of tuberculosis and of childbirth, the yellow dress Leah wears even in death, the dark, dank closets of the orphanage and the blue sky of her marriage to Ezroh. In this extraordinary tale, Yamanaka weaves truth from dreams and breathes life into the spirit world through a girl become woman and mother who embraces all, joy, pain and love, her heart the repository of all their hopes. Luan Gaines/ 2006."},{"Title":"Behold the Many","review":"In 1939 Anah's daughter Hosana dies; though she mourns her loss, Anah prays that the death will lift the curse.In 1913 Hawaii, young Leah comes down with Tuberculosis; her mother tries to hide the illness, but is caught. The child is sent to a remote orphanage in the Kalihi Valley in the Ko'olau Mountains. One year later her sister Aki joins her and not long afterward another sibling Anah is sent there.In 1916 Leah dies and subsequently so does Aki. Anah vows to stay there forever and the ghosts of the children who have died there including her two sisters communicate with her. In 1924, Anah marries Ezroh with plans to finally leave the orphanage. However, the ghosts are angry and jealous that she is able to go anywhere while they cannot. They try to stop her marriage, but fail; however she and her family are cursed by one of the spirits. Over the years Anah has several children, but never overcame the guilt of surviving nor of leaving.In some ways BEHOLD THE MANY is a deep historical tale with plenty of insight into Hawaii and how tuberculosis victims were treated. However, it is the relationship when they lived and after they died between the surviving sister and her two deceased siblings that make for an eerie ghost story. Anah's beliefs that she communicates with all the dead children at the isolated clinic seems very real though some skeptics will say she compensated for her losses. Though time moves too fast making it somewhat difficult to follow, fans will relish this strong ghost story.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Behold the Many","review":"If you were thinking about killing yourself before reading this book....DON'Tvery depressing.I kept waiting for something good to happen...nope...nada....never...not even once"},{"Title":"This Species of Property: Slave Life and Culture in the Old South (Galaxy Books)","review":"Slavery is the great blight of American history, the stark contradiction of the freedoms on which the country was founded. In part because of this, the actual lives of the slaves were often misrepresented, both by contemporaries and by historians seeking to justify the \\"peculiar institution\\" or reconcile its existence. This is what Leslie Howard Owens seeks to redress with this book. Rather than focusing on the institution of slavery, Owens examines the slaves themselves, explaining how their status as bondsmen shaped the lives they led.To accomplish this, Owens sifts through numerous plantation records, slave narratives, and other often overlooked sources to reconstruct the daily lives that slaves in the United States led. The result is impressive. He demolishes the traditional \\"Sambo\\" stereotype, replacing it with a much more nuanced, complex portrait. Each chapter focuses on a different aspect of the bondsmen's experience - field work, family life, slave culture, and so forth - providing a broad portrait of what life was like for slaves. Perhaps his most fascinating findings are in his chapter on slave diet, the nutritional deficiencies of which explain many of the traditional ailments that slaves suffered from, as well as the low energy levels that many owners dismissed as laziness.While such insights make the book a valuable introduction to the subject, some of Owens's arguments are open to question. He notes that the question of resistance is one of the most debated aspects of slave life, yet his claim that historians underestimated revolutionary plotting isn't supported by the evidence. Owens also leaves the question of the mutual adjustments made by bondsmen and their owners unaddressed for the most part - a disappointing admission in what is otherwise a broad-ranging overview of the topic. Nevertheless, this is a good starting point for readers seeking to learn about slave life in the antebellum South, the echoes of which continue to resonate in America today."},{"Title":"This Species of Property: Slave Life and Culture in the Old South (Galaxy Books)","review":"The author's subtitle of this book is \\" Slave Life and Culture in the Old South\\" probably does not fully bring the full impact of this particular institution, i.e. slavery, fully to the readers mind. It is difficult, for me anyway, to stay clinical and detached from this subject. This work has been meticulously researched and, despite the fact that it is a scholarly study of a facet of this countries history, the author has been able to bring, in hard hitting prose, the horror of this institution. I fully realize and accept the fact that all people, for the most part, are products of their times. We, at present, are a product of ours. Despite this, I still have a strong intellectual struggle accepting the fact that a rather large section of our population either accepted or condoned this practice. As a student of the Civil War and those times, I find it difficult to accept the fact that any understanding of the war, of that era, can be complete without a solid understand of just what slavery was, what it did to the individual and what it did to an entire society, i.e. the South. Beyond a doubt we are till reaping the crop which was planted in the early years of our country and since we have to live with the consequences it behooves each and every one of us to gain as much understanding as possible. This work, among others, sheds some light on the situation. This was beyond a doubt one of the darkest aspects of our history as a people and the author nails the essence of this perfectly.The author has used a very readable style which is quite easy to follow. The book is well organized.This book if full of tidbits and facts of which I was unaware, and very few pages were turned without new knowledge gained. The reader can be assured they will gain some insight, some understanding of the situation as it was, without feeling any obligation whatsoever to accept the situation.

In my case it was the eighth edition, published in 1982 and republished in 1986. CAPT Noel's versions of the \\"Watch Officer's Guide\\" and the \\"Bluejacket's Guide\\" were also instrumental to me in my Navy career, as they surely have been to generations of sailors.Now that I have retired from naval service and have done a few things since, I have had the chance to re-evaluate this book and would like to mention some things about it that I have found to be of value.This remains one of the best books about the art and science of naval leadership I have ever read. This includes literary works by Melville, Conrad, and others, as well as film and Television episodes such as \\"The Caine Mutiny\\" (which we also watched) and a variety of Star Trek \\"The Next Generation\\" episodes, which deal in naval leadership themes with a surprising degree of detail and nuance.The lessons of naval leadership that CAPT Noel imparts in this book are timeless and increasingly relevant. The three core elements of leadership he mentions on page 4 of the book remain fundamental: personal example, effective management, and moral responsibility. In stressing the importance of the human element of leadership, CAPT Noel would probably be considered old fashioned in today's technology infatuated military. A word to contemporary military strategists now embracing anthropology and other \\"soft\\" techniques about CAPT Noel's definition of \\"moral responsibility:\\"\\"The difference between Hitler and Churchill was not only their methods but in their motives. Irresponsible leadership threatens, bluffs, deceives, and oppresses; morally responsible leadership guides firmly and honestly, with every possible regard for human dignity\\" (p. 5).The U.S. Navy (and the other service branches), as well as business and industry, would do well to adopt the honorable and learned counsel he imparts here."},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Abominable Snowman (Can Science Solve?)","review":"For centuries people have been puzzled and fascinatedby mysterious places, creatures,and events.Some mysteries have puzzled scientists who have spent yearstrying to find tre answers.This book tells you about themystery of the Abominable Snowman also called theYeti.It has been said to be half-man and half-ape."},{"Title":"The management of common land in north west Europe, c. 1500-1850.

It begins with northern England and covers the continent west of the Elbe and north of the Alps, including Scandinavia. Since most American readers tend to have some familiarity with England if with any region, this may be practical. However, it leads to a recommendation that the reader definitely should not stop with the first chapter, because only later does it become apparent that there were many other ways of handling &quot;commons&quot; and many different definitions of what was &quot;common.&quot;"},{"Title":"Characters of the Inquisition (Essay and general literature index reprint series)","review":"This book is a bit dated, but useful nonetheless.Walsh is unbashedly Catholic, but for me (also a Catholic) this book was a good eye-opener to the world in which the inquisition operated. I now believe that there was nothing intrinsically evil with its institution, abuses notwithstanding. Wlash does sometimes tend to over-defend the inquisitors and their methods, but he does eventually get around to gicing them their due criticisms.There are a few things I would change about this book. First, it suffers from a lack of documentation. From reading other scholarly works, I've found the material presented in &quot;Characters of the Inquisition&quot; to be factual, but I cannot confirm this from the book itself. Footnotes are scanty; the chapters are inconsistently documented.Also, I thought that Walsh's account of the historical development of the Inquisition was incomplete. He devotes an entire chapter to the &quot;first inquisitor,&quot; Moses, and the persecution of heretics in the Old Testament. Suddenly, in the next chapter, we are brought to the 13th century, and the pontificate of Pope Gregory IX. His survey of the Church's atitude to heretics prior to this is too brief. He really could have gone into a little more detail, even poting a quote or two from the Church Fathers, and show the development from Patristic thought to that of the Middle Ages.Lastly, this book ended on a really boring tangent. The last two-thirds of the last chapter are little more than a tirade against communism. He expresses fears that the America of his day (the book was written in 1940) is becoming more and more &quot;socialist.&quot; Quite honestly, I don't think he made a good case for this, and I fail to see where it tied into the book's thesis and purpose: a survey of the inquisition. Maybe I just don't know a lot about Communism or socialism. I wish Walsh would have taken more time to explain these.Otherwise, this book is a good, informative read. I'd read it only as a companion to more scholarly volumes.

Rather,Weiss stresses the importance of basic skills that helped propel him up the corporate ladder.

I graduated from Yale in 2003 --it was a great school, but they didn't teach me a jot about how to succeed in business. This book has become my little bible for doing the right thing on the job. Some advice is common sense, like 'show up on time.' But other things I never would have known, like 'ask to read their business plan.' (You should have seen my boss's eyes light up when I asked to read the plan...)My favorite thing about this book is the format. Each chapter is only 5-6 pages long, and covers a specific piece of advice. Joel backs up every piece of advice with a story or two from his own experience, which really gives the book a human element. Each chapter ends with a few famous quotes to back up the main theme. This is a book to read, and re-read for advice. It sits by my bed, and I'll read a chapter or two to psych me up every once in a while.This isn't some new 'job philosophy'--it is about 30 specific suggestions for doing well, getting promotions, and even creating new job positions within a company.

Looking forward to reading &quot;A Man In Full&quot;, but I know I'll be disappointed, it just couldn't possibly live up to Bonfires."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"First: the book is brilliant. It has some echoes of \\"The Great Gatsby\\" but a much larger canvas. Though it is very long and has some overblown descriptions it is absolutely engrossing. The focus of the book is Sherman McCoy, whom I found quite fascinating. He starts off quite unlikeable due to being an amazingly smug, arrogant snob. Then slowly one starts looling beyond these points. He is human after all and not all that bad. And that is true of all the other characters too, none is wholly good or bad.In a book about great moral issues, Tom Wolfe describes in great detail his characters' concern about their appearance, their social success and their finances. But for most people these superficial things ARE major concerns in life which influence their actions and destiny.Some of the earlier reviews have made a very interesting point. The themes of the book will never date but the plot as written could not have been set in the year 2003. Technology and media has changed so much in the last 20 years.But as an Indian who has never visited America I am not able to judge many things. Is American society as unequal and divided as portrayed here? India certainly is, and if the story was transported here it would ring true. The poverty in India is so extreme and wide-spread that the comparatively well-off are almost forced to make a habit of \\"insulation\\".Also: I dont for a moment think that Tom Wolfe could be racist. But it shows what a gap there must be between the races in America in that all the characters whose minds he explores are white. Non-whites are shown from the outside only. Similarly women are shown from the outside only. I understand that a male author may feel unable to speak about a woman's feelings. But are black males and white males so different?"},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Critics of Bonfire of the Vanities often say that Wolfe's epic novel is not \\"literary\\" or \\"high brow\\" enough to go down in the literary canon. I can see where these reviewers are coming from, but that does not make this novel any less entertaining. The difference between Wolfe, as opposed to an author like Jonathan Franzen, is that Franzen's novels are reflective of the psyches and personalities that make up middle-America -- essentially, Franzen has something to say about our society. Wolfe, at least to me, is more focused on telling a good story.Not that there is anything wrong with that. While Wolfe perhaps has something to say about race and socioeconomic relations (essentially, that the rich folks on Wall Street kind of jerks and poor minorities on the street are not all that bad), Bonfire of the Vanities is more an exercise in style and pacing. It is a testament to Wolfe's structuring ability that a book this lengthy (my hardcover is over 600 pages) never feels too long-winded. This book will not change your life or the way you look at things -- it will, however, provide you with a few solid hours of great entertainment."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"This is the first Tom Wolfe novel I've read, and I had a preconceived notion of southern literature along the lines of Styron or Faulkner. This novel is more Olivia Goldsmith than Carson McCullers, and I have to admit I loved it. Wolfe's detailed inner dialogues were addicting, and I followed each of the characters with varying degrees of sympathy, admiration or disgust, but never boredom. He describes the world of his story to such an exact amount of detail that I feel like I could now write a novel of New York in the '80's (or at least Tom Wolfe's version of it). I was hoping desperately for a neat and happy ending, and I was both pleasantly surprised and disappointed with the resolution. Quick, satisfying read."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe's \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" was first published in 1987, but 16 years later it is still the best parody of the political and social scene in New York City. Combining his everyday, \\"fly-over country\\"-style conservatism with his keen wit, Wolfe lays out a story that sends characters crashing into one another from all socioeconomic levels across the Big Apple.Sherman McCoy, a stereotypical, ego-maniacal bond-trader, is Wolfe's typical protagonist. The main plot starts when McCoy and his mistress, Maria Ruskin, take a wrong turn returning from Kennedy airport one night, leaving them lost in a bad neighborhood in the Bronx. This is where they cross paths with Henry Lamb, a seemingly innocent kid stuck in a sad world, and Roland Auburn, a neighbor of Lamb's and local drug-dealing hoodlum. In their haste to escape from a neigborhood within their city but light years from anything they recognize, Sherman and Maria strike Lamb with their car, critically injuring him. Once a struggling NYC journalist learns of the story, it becomes a perfect case for the politicians, media, and attorneys to latch on to for their own selfish gain. From there the Lamb case blows up into an ordeal beyond anyone's control, but one that could only descend into such madness in New York.Wolfe's writing is funny, entertaining, and searing. Through his fictional characters, he presents the perfect condemnation of the ridiculous excesses found in some NYC political and social circles, with specific real-life examples coming naturally to any reader's mind."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"In retrospect, there is no better snapshot of New York City during the 1980's than THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES. This novel completely captures the energy, and even the euphoria, which crept into city life during a decade that now seems far removed.BONFIRE is an engrossing novel, interweaving all of the many aspects of city life, from the self-indulgences of the newly (very) rich to the struggles of the ghetto poor. Much like that proverbial first potato chip, once a reader gets a taste of this book, it is hard to stop reading until the final resolution. Wolfe writes a detailed and informative story in his typical lively style.Anyone who wants to remember New York City during the overheated 80's will find THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES to be a clear snapshot of that time and that place."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Not since The Great Gatsby has a work so completely defined an era with such brutal honesty. So revealing of the affectations of the period, the filming of this book for the big screen was banned in the Bronx, ironically giving proof to Wolfe's indictment of the liberal political machine of the 1980's. This is a classic &quot;must read&quot; and, as usual, the film doesn't come near to doing the book justice. If you haven't read Bonfire, you're not well read."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe, an eloquent, if sometimes pessimistic, writer who deeply understands modern culture, wrote this massive, classic tale of greed, ambition and power. He casts the story of financier Sherman McCoy in the financial world of Wall Street, but includes the racial, political and economic issues of New York City in the early 1980s. Even 13 years after its publication date, this is still a gripping read. You can use this book as the starting point for reading about business culture from a fictionalized perspective. Or, you can combine it with Michael Lewis' Liar's Poker and The New New Thing, for insight from fact and fiction into the major episodes of greed and economic boom in the past 20 years. This undeclared trilogy examines the desire - not confined to Americans, though the books are U.S.-based - to achieve wealth at any cost. We at getAbstract.com recommend this book, all by itself, as a seminal volume in business fiction."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Wolfe is an amazing author. On a literary level this is one of the best books I've read. The dialogues in the book are marvelous while the writing itself creates some beautifully contrasting and yet similar characters. The book bleeds social and racial overtones that are devastatingly real and yet rarely put onto paper the way Wolfe has. The story is okay, but the lack of a hero left me detached from the whole thing. The book is worth reading however, if only to appreciate the bluntness and humanity in Wolfe's writting."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Deliciously skewers liberalism.

But its frustrating hearing the demonstrations and accusations of racism. Wolfe also portrays the stupidity of political correctness and liberalism. Wolfe is one of the greatest American writers in history."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"From it's thrilling opening to its open-ended conclusion, this is a book you not only want to keep reading and reading but never forget about afterwards. All the characters - their wants, fears, ambitions, and failures - make them human and believable. Depraved though they may all be, they are too complex merely to be shrugged off as &quot;unlikable.&quot; What makes this book great is not only its wonderful and on-point observations of New York but also its brilliant little touches: &quot;The Masters of the Universe,&quot; the wonderful &quot;Hack hack hack hacking&quot; laughs, the hilarious tabloid headline &quot;Scalp Grandma, Then Rob Her&quot; and on and on and on. I predict that fifty years from now school kids will be reading this along with &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; as one of the defining novels of the twentieth century. It is a fierce and uncompromising look at &quot;the way we live now&quot; and its greatness comes from the fact that it doesn't spare anyone. I could write a whole book about how good &quot;Bonfire&quot; is and surely this book exists on so many levels that years from now people will write multitudes about its numerous meanings. And so on. One question: what does &quot;Heh-heggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhh&quot; mean?"},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"A refreshing change from perfect &quot;Grisham-esque&quot; heroes and endings. If you are interested in reading a novel about the true (albeit somewhat exaggerated) nature of the human condition in the 80s, read this book! Excellent!"},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"I don't wish to make a proclamation that this is the &quot;best American book ever written,&quot; nor do I want to complain about an &quot;inadequate&quot; ending. All I can say about this book is that, from the first chapter's over-the-top description of the mayor's speech in Harlem, &quot;Bonfire&quot; consistently held my attention. (I'm sorry to say that I can't say the same about the more recent &quot;A man in Full.&quot;) The sheer unfortunate reality of Wolfe's writing is, as many will tell you, a precise color photograph taken then and there in 1987, complete with polarizing filter and an all-too-true vibrancy. It's the kind of book that might be depressing to read soon after its publication and yet evokes quite a few biting, almost nostalgic memories of those infamously coarse upwardly-mobile days of yore. And while I was a mere four years old when I myself was caught in the middle of that web of 58th-and-Sutton &quot;would you like to draw pictures in the Met, Samantha?&quot; Upward Mobility, this seems to accurately capture that era that I at the time failed to understand but am now sure existed just as Wolfe has said.And yet &quot;Bonfire&quot; is by no means historical fiction. Rather, our good friend Tom manages to do what I've always maintained a good satirist should do: Keep a perfect distance. Wolfe manages to edge close enough to his characters to dig into their minds and show us what's inside -- and yet he stays far enough away that he can poke fun and them with his usual slightly-supercilious air.This perfect distance of his seems to be what ensures a constantly entertaining read. Seldom do the often-lengthy descriptions bore the reader; such minor allusions as that to the &quot;tub and shower stall module -- module! -- a single molded unit that deflected slightly when he stepped into the tub&quot; remain startling real, making the abrupt ending not at all unsatisfying but rather entirely appropriate and understandable; with literature this interesting, why would one ask for a happy ending?"},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"The 80's were a time where people thought they were indestructable. Including Sherman McCoy. A hotshot investment banker he has it all. A Beautiful 12 Room Apt in Central Park, An Adorable Six Year Old Daughter who attends an exclusive Private School and a Interior Decorator Wife. He also has a mistress on the other side of town named Maria who's much older husband is the driving force behind a multi-million dollar airplane empire and together they take the wrong exit in the wrong section of town and hit an innocent black man named Henry Lamb and then the chaos ensues. From Reverend Bacon's quest for showing how racist New York is to Peter Fallow's desire use the story to get to the big time, Sherman's world is turned upside down with some pretty frightening yet hilarious consequences. It also teaches us that no matter how good our life is, we can automatically lose it with the snap of the fingers as Sherman found out the hard way. Tom Wolfe is next to Jackie Collins and John Grisham the very few white authors who can do a black character down pat. A must read book for anyone who's enjoyed A Man In Full."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"This is probably the best book I have ever read.

Great plot and believable characters...Tom Wolfe really gets you into their minds and their emotions. I really liked it from start to finish. And, like so many novels out today, it wasn't corny. It was very believable..even the way it ended with Shreman McCoy still dealing with his problems.My only criticism would be that sometimes Tom Wolfe gets into some LONG oratories or explanations which, often, I skipped over because they were tol laborious.On the other hand, I LOVED the social parties...Wolfe's description of the &quot;ha ha ha&quot; and the &quot;heh heh heh&quot; was really a good laugh.This is one of the very few books that I'll probably read again."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"This book sums up New York and the criminal justice system.

But where A Man in Full falls into an unbelieveable collapse, Bonfire of the Vanieties is an exhilarating rush. Reading Sherman's rebirth, I was overcome with energy. In Bonfire of the Vanities, none of the characters are likeable, all shallow and self-serving. Only through losing everything including his dignity does Sherman have a chance at redemption. And when that time comes, he has given up on himself, probably the worst act anyone could do. Yet we are left with his rebirth, a lean, mean fighting machine.

You just can't get a sense of yourself.And that is the tragedy of &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;. Sherman doesn't have a sense of himself after losing the fruits of his samsara - money, home, respect, family. He redefines himself as a defendant in the legal system. But is that adequate?And you can say the same thing about every character in the novel. Even the lawyer Kilian who seems to fare pretty well still isn't completely happy - he can't build his dream house.After reading this brilliant novel, you can't help but think about the &quot;meaning of life&quot;."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"This book is a great achievement in portraying the life and prosperity of the 1980s.

Tom Wolfe is a genius."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"A contemporary classic, detailing the social dynamics of the 80s. Perfect in every way, form, function and style, it was &quot;unputdownable&quot;."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"I loved A Man in Full and Bonfire was equal to the task. The book read well and the Dickensian descriptions showed up but not enough to be put off by them. The ending lacked the completness that A Man in Full had, which was part of the idea behind Bonfire. It was an enjoyable read and I recommend it but again, the book does leave you hanging.

For this reason, I believe it belongs alongside Catch-22 and Breakfast of Champions as one of the funniest an most intelligent satires of the 20th century. I will admit that I laughed the most loudly at the obvious, although well-set-up punch lines. However, the real joy of reading this book is not the trip-and-fall jokes, but rather the wry, dry, witty, and acid-tongued descriptions, characterizations, and prose which Wolfe fills his pages with.Wolfe is a little bit pretensious, a little bit obnoxious, and very funny. It is not racist to make fun of blacks if you make fun of WASPs, Jews, the British, men, women, and just about every other possible demographic group known to man.A telling sign of a wildly overambitious novel is one who's ending has difficulty wrapping up the exploits of all of the main characters without feeling contrived or forced. Unfotuntaly, this is where THE BONFIRES OF THE VANITIES fails. But for over 600 pages, it is a knee-slapping, bellylaughing, observation-deck yawp of a novel, and a whale of a good read."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"I admired Bonfire more for the innovative uses of language than for his social incisiveness. I despise the knee-jerkers who deplore the 80's as a &quot;decade of greed&quot; and point to Wolfe's book as a banner example of that sentiment. Surely, any reader out there would jump at the chace to have the wealth, connections and opportunities that the main character, Sherman McCoy had? Wolfe neatly lays bare the foibles of members from all levels of society. No one is spared, but most people seemed to really enjoy the downfall of Sherman McCoy. I felt nothing but sympathy for the man, but then again I'm always a few steps short of being a pariah. I had an intriguing assignment in a college English class: a favorite book of yours has been banned in your community. Write a spirited defense of the book.

This book, however, changed my opinion of the latter.I wasn't too thrilled to have received this book as a gift; but, decided to give it a chance. I had trouble with the first few pages --looking back, I probably should have re-read them. Nonetheless, the following pages kept me reading hour after hour. Finally finishing the book 2-3 days later.I can truly say that --after getting through the first chapter-- I enjoyed reading &quot;Bonfire of the Vanities.&quot; I highly recommend this book. And, I thank Mr. Wolfe for being one of a short list of authors who brought me back to the love of reading I had enjoyed as a child."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"I saw the bizarre trainwreck of a movie many moons ago and did not give much thought to reading the book. There are times I wonder at my own stupidity. It was only as the year 2001 dawned that I began smarten up. Why had I never read this book? Got me. Two my favorite books of recent vintage owed a debt to Wolfe (or mentioned him outright): Turn of the Century (Kurt Anderson) and Last Days of Disco (Whit Stillman). I figured maybe it was time to read the Master himself.I remember when Man in Full came out, it was as if George Washington himself had risen from the dead. Who was this guy? I consider myself quite well-educated, but it was time educate myself about Tom Wolfe. I bought the paperback.I just finished it. I'm sad because the book ended. I love anything about the '80s, but this book basically defined it. The style is priceless as are the characters. These characters, even the smaller ones, Abe Weiss, Miss Shelly Thomas, Arthur Ruskin among them, are fully formered. The book is a true masterpiece. I knew it was a satire, but came to really care about these characters, winners and losers all of them. When I took a step back I could see the brillance the names in this book, satirically speaking: The author Nunnally Voyd, the law firm Dunning, Sponget, and Leach. And on and on. Peter Fallow. I should stop here. Readers should find out these treasures on their own. The book is so great because it evokes a time not long ago yet now a memory. Wolfe brings it life again. It works at so many levels. Tragedy, farce, brillance... Don't be dumb like I was. Just go read it.

Bonfire of the Vanities is a marvelous achievement: By turns, it doubles you over with laughter, causes you to pause and linger over a sublimely-written paragraph and shocks you into confronting the realities of our modern day institutions. The language is not for the faint-hearted -- beware. But as social satire and commentary, you're likely to find few equals."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"An amazing romp through 1980s New York, Wall Street, the court system, and the lives of the rich and aspiring to be rich. Through the downfall of wall street trader Sherman McCoy, Wolfe brings the reader into the psyches of his characters, forcing one to sympathize with even the most despicable. In the process, he helps us to understand humanity. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Pivotal in the characterization of this book is the accuracy in which every thought, action and even accent is described. The author leaves absolutely no margin for your imagination to alter the experience of the story. This is why you are living the satirical story of Mr. Wolfe portraying New York by its essentials: power, racial issues and money. That's all there is to it.Sherman McCoy, whom you are given ample opportunity to hate, but really cannot hate completely, finds out that life is extremely fragile when you have everything everybody else wants. One misstep, or in his case one wrong turn in his pricey Mercedes, shows him literally and figuratively a more colorful New York than he has ever seen. Being terrified even on the 'safest' streets of New York, the Bronx appears before him like the nightmare he never had, accompanied by his mistress with the southern accent, Maria. Trying desperately to return to safe Manhattan, he is involved in a hit-and-run which is the start of a series of events that change his entire world. The mighty must fall, as seen from the Bronx. Justice must be done, seen from the assistant DA (who in fact has other motives). Headlines must scream, as seen from the press. All want a piece of McCoy, all want power, all want money.Everybody who reads this book cannot deny finding many truths in it, about America, about wealth and about life all intertwined in an exiting story. Herein we find the strength of storytelling of Tom Wolfe. Read this book."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"This book, written in the 1980s about New York of the early- to mid-1980s, while not fresh, is certainly not irrelevant. Most of the character types are clearly recognizable as extant forces in the city and the nation.The plot of the book is nothing remarkable per se. It takes a while to materialize and is mildly interesting, but nothing about it is especially clever. A bad, dumb, white guy -- rich and insensitive of course -- is screwing around on his wife with a golddigger. Through circumstances beyond his control he is involved in a seemingly minor incident that balloons up and takes over his life, making it, and him, into something very different, (and, we presume, better) than it, and he, was before. Along the way, some good guys pop up, some bad guys pop up, and some guys you thought were good but turn out to be bad pop up.Wolfe does a good job in getting into his characters' minds and letting us in on what they're thinking and feeling along the way. Wolfe's writing gets in the way of the story, however. He is overly descriptive of the surroundings to the point that one soon tires it -- at least I did. It came to the point that I skipped over entire paragraphs devoted to descriptions of furniture and wall hangings.Some of the more memorable parts of the book involve the parties the rich white guy and his wife attend, with hilarious, almost Vonnegut-like descriptions of the attendees' laughs. Wolfe also does his readers a service for a look inside the fourth estate. To those of us who think the news media have a particular axe to grind it is enlightening to see them cast as mere grubbers, each after his or her own moment of fame. (A phrase from another book -- The Martian Race by Gregory Benford -- comes to mind -- \\"the snout of the media pig had worked its way under the tent...\\")It is amusing to think that many of the events so central to the plot are now meaningless due to technology - cell and satellite phones, the Internet and cable news, and the widespread availability of credit cards, to name a few. All in all though, this is not a bad book. It is overly long and tedious in spots, but it's worth reading if for no other reason than it provides a look back into the marvelous '80s, and a reminder that human nature never changes."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"When you filter out all the noise (ethnic conflict, unbrideled wealth &amp; priviledge, Wall Street greed, extramaritial affairs, etc), this book is really a simple tale of human sacrifice. The main character (Sherman McCoy) is deliberately sacrificed by the powers that be (the NYC political establishment). This sacrifice is a means of achieving &quot;steam control&quot; by staging a sideshow to placate the &quot;righteously angry&quot; minority groups threatening to rise up and topple the status quo. Even so, its a fascinating story. Especially interesting is McCoy's transformation from a spoiled, arrogant Master of the Universe to a scrappy fighter whose only goal is survivial. Wolfe is obviously trying to tell us something about our future with this tale, but I'm not quite sure what."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"As I first began reading the book several years ago, I thought it was quite intriguing and well-done. As the book went on however, I realized none of the characters were three-dimensional. The situations in which they were placed could certainly happen, but the complexity of character doesn't equal the plot structure. It was worth reading, but it's not something I'll ever return to."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe creates the characters, situations, plot and prose to make even the weathered reader gasp.After reading A Man In Full, this book was again a triumph of the emotions, thoroughly enjoyed."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"I can't help but be amused at the irony of how this satirical masterpiece, among whose targets is the ridiculous overpoliticization of our age, tends to be viewed by its admirers and detractors alike through ideological blinders. Some view it as an attack on the &quot;Decade Of Greed,&quot; as if that basic human frailty could be confined to a single period of time. Some see it as a jeremaid against liberalism, as if the more asinine PC platitudes of the Left somehow discredit the entire liberal enterprise. Some view it as a repudiation of the wealthy, although Wolfe shows in agonizing detail that greed, lust, envy, ruthless ambition and pathological self-absorption can be found on all the rungs of the socioeconomic ladder. Others think it's strictly about New York, and in one sense they're right; but most of the foibles depicted in &quot;Bonfire&quot; can be found in Anyburg, U.S.A. Others grouse that the characters are too morally ambiguous: McCoy is too much an admixture of hero, villain, and victim for them to know how to respond to him. And where's the happy ending?Look, the whole point of good satire is to shed light on the more pathetic aspects of the human condition, not to grind specific social, cultural, or political axes or to prescribe panaceas. What &quot;Bonfire,&quot; like all good satire, does is force us to confront the demons in our own hearts and minds and reexamine our motivations and actions. Wolfe's book has something to offend (and challenge) everyone: rich folks, poor folks, blacks, whites, Jews, Christians, agnostics, New Yorkers, non-New Yorkers, liberals, conservatives, politicians, journalists, lawyers, cops, crooks, bums, husbands, wives. This novel transcends time, place, and ideology. It's one for the ages."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Tantalizingly fascinating, The Bonfire of the Vanities is a deeply detailed and yet enthralling account of the entwining ways in which the forces of opportunistic politics, ugly racism, greedy Wall Street, gullible public sentiments, sinister profit motive and compelling lust interacted in New York City of 1980's. It is an outstanding work of fiction so vividly depicted and so richly crafted that you might feel yourself in the middle of action. The author's creativity with words and ideas while narrating very plausible events and developments adds remarkable color and candor to the plot. Phrases such as \`laboratory of human relations', \`big breasted eyes', and \\"master of universe', are so apt in their effect that you find yourself longing for more.At the script level, The Bonfire of the Vanities is a tragedy of a Wall Street bonds trader whose sheer misfortune causes his downfall though he does not endear himself to the readers by his philandering and vain ways that he feels he is entitled too. It also is the tragedy of an unfortunate black boy who gets killed for no fault of his, of a spouse whose only fault is that she has aged the best way she could and a 6 year old girls who \`loses' her father to bizarre sequences of New York life. At a broader plane though, The Bonfire of the Vanities is the tragedy of the \`Greatest City on the Planet', a city that has scaled every possible height and yet whose inhabitants have not overcome even the very basic vices that plague the human race. Powered by the avarice for lust, weaved around the gluttony for pride, fired by the envy of the have not's and the wrath of the racially deprived, New York is tortured by the sloth of conscience. Rarely has this tragedy been better depicted than in this landmark novel."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Although I never lived in NYC, and know little about the markets, I knew the characters Wolfe has created. The most dispicable character in my humble opinion, are the two politicians, and the character of the Rev Al Shapton, who is a quasi politician. Wolfe candidly describes the problems of the courts, the justice system and we the people with all our faults and blemishes.As Clarence Darrow once said about his two thrill killer clients,\\"even rich people are entitled to a defense.\\" I do not find Sherman as a hateful character. Perhaps because I do not find fault with someone who makes a lot more than I, or someone who is unfaithfull. The only flaw I find is my failure to understand how some one is \\"master of the universe\\" can turn into the mush Wolfe makes of him. There were a few moments when Sherman shows his \\"manhood\\". But most of the time, he seems a quivering mass of tepidity. (if there is such a word.)This novel was written before the incident at Duke, where the local DA, for political purposes, tries to convict the Duke La Crosse team. The real villians of the criminal justice system are no longer the Bull Conners of the past, but the elected DA's other public officials, and yes, the minorities who blindly follow people who are not their saviors, but self promoters. I think Wolfe was brave enough to write this story keeping political correctness out of his work. Wolfe has described our society with the shades drawn up. The novel reminds me of thelong running TV series,which somehow managed to be a comedy. I think it was sucessful because it showed everyone's pretensions, faults, and contradictions of personalities and groups.Nobody, from parents, gays, and all ethnic groups were treated equally.Compared to most of the trash that is written today, this novel is probably going to last beyond our generation. It is an accurate description of our times. The language uses 4 letter words accurately, as used in life, not for the sake of foul language, or sex to spice a story with sophomoric writing, for sophomoric readers, and publishers who promote and encourage writers to produce trash, instead of art.If you are looking for a book with a hero, don't read this. There are few real hero's in real life, and there are none to be found here. In the end, perhaps Sherman, becomes a hero because he apparently learns something he didn't know when the novel begins. Finding knowledge in a pile of poop is something most people never learn."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"I found the book enjoyable once I got over Wolfe's promiscuous use of exclamation points. I found the characters to be jerks, but aren't we all."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe really caught the \\"mood\\" of society when this book came out. After re-reading, the book is as \\"on the money\\" today as it was when written. Buy it and read it."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"New York City in the Big '80s is the backdrop, lead actor, and punchline of this fantastic, sprawling, richly detailed and realized debut novel by famous New Journalist Tom Wolfe.\\"Punchline,\\" you might ask? Well, consider that the book was published just before a bond seller named Michael Milken galvanized the city with his sordid and high-profile arrest and just before a New York State schoolgirl named Tawana Brawley dropped a racially-explosive bombshell regarding her apparent victimhood at the hands of whites. In the book the bond salesman is named Sherman McCoy; the \\"victimized\\" student is named Henry Lamb. You kind of get the feeling Wolfe here was trying out something called \\"New New Journalism\\", i. e. reporting on the story before it even happens.Beyond its headline-stealing, the book is a rich stew of dramatic juxtaposition, political and social commentary, characterization and caricature, all boiled in the broth of a New York Wolfe toiled in for years and had researched at length for this novel. At times it reminds you of that famous New York-based TV series that came after, \\"Law & Order,\\" with its in-depth examination of what goes on in a Bronx courthouse as a DA and his minions examine the Lamb case and what to do with it. At other times it reminds you of that other '90s TV series set in the city, \\"Seinfeld,\\" with its amusement at people's baser selves and its development of an insular lingo. As he strides among Manhattan's upper-crust set, McCoy sees women as either older \\"social x-rays\\" or younger \\"lemon tarts;\\" partiers ask for sparkling water, not Perrier; and interior designers shudder at the memory of mirror overuse, a. k. a. \\"Mirror Indigestion.\\"Most famously, Sherman styles himself a \\"Master of the Universe,\\" the phrase that stuck with people most here. Sherman's hubris is the source of much of \\"Bonfire's\\" first-half satire; his downfall and discovery of a certain dignity provides \\"Bonfire's\\" second-half uplift.\\"Bonfire\\" doesn't focus solely on McCoy. There's a prosecutor named Kramer who shares his boss's longing for finding someone known as the \\"Great White Defendant,\\" a big-name criminal suspect who isn't black and poor. There's also Peter Fallow, an alcoholic reporter who finds his feet covering the Lamb case for the sensationalist New York Post, em, I mean City Light.Floating around the edges of the story are other characters whose minds we never get to enter. One, Reverend Bacon, is a black minister and pressure-group leader who steals money from a white upper-crust church and waves off their complaints, telling them he's their \\"prudent broker...who can control the steam\\" of the inner city. He's the one who works up the people when McCoy's case comes to trial. Bacon's resemblance to one Al Sharpton may or may not be incidental: Sharpton was another real-life character who didn't raise his profile to a national level until after \\"Bonfire's\\" publication. Wolfe isn't afraid to push racial buttons, or skewer targets of varied ethnicities, to make his points about the baseline dysfunction dogging NYC.The book doesn't always work at the same high level. Kramer starts out a pretty interesting character before devolves into a one-dimensional horndog, while Fallow's comic inability to grasp basic American culture seems strained. There's a speech in the middle of the book by a novelist dying of AIDS who references Edgar Allen Poe's \\"Masque Of The Red Death\\" (Poe Towers is also the name of the housing project where Lamb is from) in a way that feels like Wolfe straining for the kind of literary affect he captures elsewhere in stride.The book scores so often you ignore the off-notes like you would a weak pun in Shakespeare. In McCoy, Wolfe creates a wonderfully perverse yet strangely sympathetic figure. You will hate him in the beginning, yet as he is pulled and twisted by the system that fed him for so long, you begin to care, and recognize in him something of a common humanity. I think it's this element that gives the book a hidden depth that stays with you after the laughs fade.For me, \\"Bonfire\\" is a richly rewarding reading experience, married to its time in a wonderfully redolent way yet not limited by it in terms of message. It's not like the kind of greed McCoy embodied went away with Ronald Reagan, Culture Club, and big hair, or that color-blindness now reigns supreme. I think mirrors may even be making a comeback. \\"Bonfire\\" is not only a laugh-getter and a reader roller-coaster; its social commentary remains sharp as ever."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe doesn't hold back on punctuation and it made me feel like he was next to me telling me this story.

I had no need to worry. The New York City and Wall Street of the 1980s has not changed much and with the focus of the 2008 great recession as a new point of reference, Bonfire of the Vanities has an immediacy that belies the passing of a quarter of a century. The characters and the situations related in the novel are contemporary, and above all, the book tells a very, very good, indeed exciting, story. It is easy to predict that Bonfire of the Vanities will remain in print indefinitely and will continue to be read by readers like me, who value good and pleasurable writing, centered around plausible and relevant plots.

Let it be stated that I love fiction set in New York and the 1980's is a fascinating decade worthy of examination (and post-rationalization). The interlocking story is so well known now that I will not reprise it in this review. Suffice it to say that this is a tale of greed, morality, ego, \\"classes\\", and lost values. Wolfe walks and drives us all over New York and it is a dizzying and fun trip."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"It's hard to believe that 20 years have passed since this book was first published. I had a chance to read it during the recent blizzard(s) and was pleased to laugh out loud only to realize that we have sunk further into narcissism than this book so scathingly depicted, to no good end. I actually wonder whether this book would be printed today. Heaven knows, it isn't politically correct. Except for the hating white men, particularly wealthy white men, part. All others portrayed as flawed might not be deemed acceptable for print. The truth is like kryptonite to narcissists. They lose all their power....alas! A great read and a trenchant wit!"},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"No one is likable and everyone is out for themselves in this book ... captures the 1980's to perfection. So many elements of the 1980's are captured in this book, but the greatest feature is ego unchecked. From the opening scene where the mayor gets hit by a half-eaten jar of mayonnaise and all he could think of was, \\"who would bring a half-eaten jar of mayonnaise to a public rally,\\" to lawyers vainly feeling their muscles in the \\"tricep-ich,\\" this book pulsates with the blood of the 80's. Sherman McCoy - a WASP junk bond salesman, accidentally hits a black youth that was talked into trying to rob him in the Bronx. The narration is omnipresent which makes this book the power that it is. Wolfe acts as if God Almighty is writing this book and passing judgment all along the route. He has plenty of material to work with as the cast grows with each page. The ending is characteristic of Wolfe's work and the 80's. Of all I read of Wolfe (and he is a great author) this is his finest work. No single bit of work has captured with satire one era more successfully than \\"Bonfire.\\""},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Iam more than happy that I finally read the book, although I knew about it for a long time. during my free-time I read a lot and this book was a terrific read, one of the best books I ever picked up.it is about the fall of sherman mccoy, a wall street 'wunderkind'. one night, he and his 'foxy love' take the wrong exit of the freeway and find themselves 'trapped' in the bronx. by accident, they hit a joung black male. the hit-and-run causes them unthinkable trouble and from now on, everything goes straight downhill. simultaneously, many other people take advantage of their doom. foremost, the journalist p. fallow and rev. bacon. the book is full of interesting, funny, but also bad characters (especially mccoy itself who is indescribably arrogant, the english journalist as well as the slimy, sycophant kramer and the 'influencial' rev. bacon to name but a few) and wolfe provides an excellent description of ny in the late 80's. however, due to the fact that iam german I do not know whether everything is true or a slightly exaggerated description. but I perosnally think it doesn't matter at all because the message is clear: in an achievement-oriented society everyone is only interested in her/his own benefits and 'walks over dead bodies' to reach more and more. of course, it is stereotyping but I safely assume that this is true and undenieable at least to a certain degree.the bonfire of the vanities is a bitter-sweet, satiric, funny, dramatic, and enthralling novel everyone ought to read. maybe one of the finest american novels of recent times. what I liked most is the fact that there are no 'real heroes' and almost every character shows its dreadful, abhorrent side. of course, the book has its lenght but its worthwile to proceed because the pace is always high and so many amazing things occur although one might correctly guess what is supposed to happen next.moreover, wolf's writing is great, in particular the different linguistic details in terms of dialects, abusive language etc. are absolutely fabulous. with a clear conscience, I highly recommend this book..."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe is a great writer. He uses language beautifully, develops characters extremely well, and creates good drama. I would, however, say that he is a better essayist than novelist and I would recommend The Right Stuff or The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test over this book because they are more focussed and he keeps his story together better in them. With that said though, I would highly recommend Bonfire of the Vanities. Wolfe describes the socialites, lowlifes, politicians, reporters, and other various characters who populate the New York scene and all of their particular vanities in great detail. They are believable, whether they are likable or not is really besides the point, and they come to life with their authentic dialogue and charater flaws. It is a satirical book written by a very observant author, so even those who have not been exposed to this culture is able to become caught up in it and find themselves fascinated by the whole scene. I would recommend this book to anyone who like social critiques, interesting characters, good writing, and a fast paced story."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"The frank story delivered by Wolfe has a powerful message that rings true in today's society, it was just a little long - 700 pages (I often found my self sifting through meaningless paragraphs). Sherman McCoy, who is a rich Wallstreet aristocrat, runs over a Bronx city hoodlum after being threatened. It is a commentary of 1980s society, and can be extended into the present time. Materialism, egotism, hypocrisy...even the middle-class assistant D.A., Kramer, is subject to these human flaws as he uses the case for personal gain and glory, as does the DA in his re-election. McCoy sums up a major point in the book in saying to his lawyer, &quot;Your self -- I don't know how to explain it, but if, God forbid, anything like this ever happens to you, you'll know what I mean. Your self...is other people, all the people you're tied to, and it's only a thread.&quot; Of course, if this thread is cut, like it is for McCoy, what becomes of that &quot;self?&quot; Wolfe's story becomes a Greek tragedy on the major flaw of humans -- finding their identity in people, possessions, and power."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"A perfect attack on the pompous attitudes possessed by the rather &quot;well off&quot;."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"I read this book. It is least boring of the two Tom Wolfe books I have read. Perhaps I will read it again some day."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"... this book has all the trappings of class while never surrendering its large-scale consumer appeal as \\"fiction.\\" BOTV has several dimensions - on one level, it's a satirical look at the dog-eat-dog world of upper-crust 1980s NYC, where power, greed and rabid statusmongering are the rule. Even if you just stay on that level, Bonfire is a great read - alternately very funny and sobering, though the prevailing dismal view of human nature may depress you.On another level, BOTV has something to say about American society, human nature and, I think, the nature of desires themselves. Even the most hard-nosed conservative will wince at Wolfe's unrelentingly cynical view of black \\"civil rights leaders\\" who invariably turn out to be corrupt (interestingly, BOTV has not a single positive black character - unless you count Lamb, who's dead). And even liberals like me cringe at his description of made-for-TV \\"mass demonstrations\\" orchestrated by know-nothing urbanites.Political sensibilities aside however, BOTV shows that even those who seem one-dimensionally \\"bad\\" to their antagonists often have at least a glimmer of decency. It's also a poignant commentary on what desires are real and which ones are products of the lives we lead; the hope for love versus the longing for exotic and dapper clothes, for instance. If you wanna think about it, this book can do us all a lot of good.... and heck, if you don't, it's still a good way to kill some time."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"I was born &amp; raised in New York and lived there until 1987. This book perfectly captures the culture &amp; attitudes of the city, its shrill power politics and opportunism and hypocrisy.Wolfe has called this a &quot;social novel,&quot; a once popular form, now less so.The social novel is sociological, as opposed to psychological. It paints with a broad brush. Its &quot;main character&quot; is an entire city, or profession, or period in history (rather than the psychological novel's narrow focus on a single individual's inner thoughts &amp; feelings).This book is funny and truthful. And despite its thickness, a quick read, because it's also an exciting page-turner."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Not the world's best writer. Tends to beat things to death. But it's amazing how he interweaves all the characters."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"I read this because someone said that today's events are hauntingly similar. I found the plot to be fascinating and let other things go until I finished the book."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"This book by Tom Wolfe was interesting to a point. It gives agood characterization of the many types of people that you will find in New York City. You have the Wall Street types,you have a black activist,you have society ladies. The book stays bogged bogged down in this routine tom the point of being nearly boring.It becomes difficult to read after a point. I have read no more Tom Wolfe books after I read this one.Find this one in a used book store."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"The much-celebrated novel is a fairly unique one in the landscape of literature. Its 700+ pages and style are, as explicitly stated by Wolfe in the intro, an attempt to return to the grander realism works of the past. He specifically mentions Anna Karenina as the great example of the novel that portrays a cross section of a whole society. Only this is rarely done today, so what we have is one of the only major cross-sections of New York in the 80's.However, this is a cross-section that is viciously sliced from the meaty flesh of New York society, leaving it gaping, bleeding and exposed, all in a highly satirical and humorous way.The main story revolves around a high-powered broker and his mistress who are involved in a hit-and-run accident which leaves a young, black &quot;youth&quot; from the Bronx in a coma. The scandal sweeps the city as an epitomy of the racial, economic and cultural differences (and inequalities), as a mob builds up around the case. In terms of the actual plot, there's nothing complicated, rather, its the eye into the eschelons of high, middle and poor society New-York-style that makes this entertaining and enjoyable.Wolfe exposes the massive slab of hypocrisy present in the society, from the DA who has idealistic tirades about his job (when it's really a vehicle for his extra-marital and political ambitions) to the British journalist who thumbs his nose down on all things American (while scurrying for his next free meal and alcoholic binge).As mentioned by many reviewers, there's nothing essentially new in the book - as Wolfe said, some of it feels like it's been ripped from the headlines, but in reality much of it is art imitating life. What I liked about the book is its message of vanity and indulgence, and how quickly those superficial bubbles can be burst in a crisis to *make* a person &quot;ordinary&quot; again. True to an almost century-old tradition in books, there are no real heroes here. But still, despite all the horrible things the main character has done, I found myself feeling sorry for him and somewhat admiring him by the end.Other complaints have been the superficial role of women in the book, but again, I think that's simply an extension of the superficiality of a section of society that spends more on a painting frame than a cop earns in 6 months.Overall, a great book that speaks without being preachy and has a lot of very funny moments."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"This is probably *the* book of the 1980s - it explores the fragile, false world of Wall Street and Manhattan society with witty, cruel glee.A one-off freak accident lands Sherman McCoy in a world of trouble. McCoy switches from a life of unquestioned privilege and superiority, to fear and questioning when the facts and evidence come together to point the finger at him for a hit and run.Wolfe shows his brilliance as a writer with this book - his characters manage to be embodiments of stereotypes and complicated individuals at the same time. The reader feels sorry for un-likable characters. Little details build up - for example the male characters preening and deporting themselves in ways they think make them look strong, powerful and handsome, only when we are given another point of view we see that they just look silly and vain - the vanities of this book are many and varied (Savonarola, he of the original bonfire of the vanities, would probably be happy with the comeuppances this book provides).Ultimately, this book is a modern classic because it manages to successfully combine all the elements - explorations of society, equality and motivation that still manages to be a great story; sparkling and witty prose that is never really flippant. It is a book that makes you think and manages to entertain at the same time.It took me a long time to track down a copy of this book, but it was worth it - Sherman McCoy, his friends (so called), adversaries, and everyone in between, make a fascinating morality tale with a moral that manages to be blindingly clear and ambiguous at the same time."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe has a magical touch for breathing life into non-fiction, as in The Right Stuff, but in Bonfire of the Vanities, his skill as a novelist and a satirist is blatantly evident. This bleak and witty portrayal of New York life in the eighties is both hilarious and dark at the same time. Wolfe's characters represent the spectrum of human behavior, while his situations are riddled with ironies and paradoxes of truth about human existence. This book is most enjoyable, I would imagine, if you have at least some knowlege of New York, because much of its humor and depth stems from New York culture, but it is also true that New york is a micrchosm of american existence on a whole, so Bonfire of the Vanities may, in fact, be a universally American Novel. Whichever, it is worth reading if not only for the reason that it is funny, brilliantly written, and makes clear the fact that Tom Wolf's name belongs on the list of satirists that includes Jonathon Swift and Oscar Wilde."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Bonfire of the Vanities is one of the great page turners of the last half of the 20th century. Wolfe combines comedy with scathing social commentary, as a blue blooded Wall Streeter takes the wrong exit off the highway and two cultures collide with tragi-comic results. It was impossible to put this book down, even though it is quite lengthy. The beleaguered Bronx judge, the girlfriend, the Harlem reverend who thrives on playing the race card for his own greater glory and the slimy reporter are just some of the characters who ring true.For those who saw the movie, don't let that turn you off. The whole premise was changed and it was a typical Hollywood bastardization. Wolfe tried a similar sweep of the cultural landscape in &quot;A Man In Full&quot; but lost his way halfway through that book. There are no wrong notes in Bonfire; it's a snapshot of New York politcally and culturally in the late 80's, and it's amazing how little has changed in today's world."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"One often hears people describe this book as &quot;the definitive novel of the Eighties,&quot; and I expected it to seem as much when I began reading it in 2002. What I found was that nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, much like &quot;A Man In Full,&quot; which I read immediately afterwards, this novel is simply about Americans. But unlike other popular American writers (e.g., Tom Clancy), Wolfe treats his characters as human beings with flaws, and no more control over their own destinies than the vast majority of the people of the rest of the world. I think what Wolfe is ultimately getting at is the &quot;arbitrariness of fate.&quot; Americans, as the last products of Western civilization, are conditioned largely to believe that if they only do certain things a certain way in life and make themselves believe in this way of doing things, they can exercise control over their futures. As such, Americans more than any other people tend to live &quot;in the future.&quot; Yet, as Wolfe so eloquently shows, myriad different unforeseen things can happen in anyone's life, including an American's, that can almost instantly shatter the illusions built up over a lifetime -- illusions that often lead Americans into complacency about themselves and the world. It is quite extraordinary the way Wolfe develops stories and characters. He is unusual in the sense that in his books, the &quot;good guys&quot; don't always win and the &quot;bad guys&quot; often come out on top. You simply can never predict what will happen, and that makes the stories so much more compelling and engaging. You feel like you are living within the &quot;real life&quot; of a given character when you are reading about him/her. I look forward to many more brilliant reads courtesy of Tom Wolfe."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"The Bonfire of the Vanities, is an overwhelming insane story, but yet it has such a devout social commentary correctness to it, that to ignore it would be unjust.Wolfe creates an amazing story line, which throughout the whole book is very consistent, but yet at the same time drifting. Every character in the book is given their own personality, problems, and mini-story line, in essence their own book. As the story moves along everyone is pulled together in the overriding story line but yet again they stay consistent to their own stories. You end up watching every individual character play their own role and you ge tot know them more than it seems necessary, although in the end you realize why you needed so much detail.Not only does Wolfe provide lavishly entertaining characters, but also a strong commentary by the master himself. Every word printed in the book is a reflection on how Wolfe views the world, and the types of people we really are. Although never having visited New York myself, Wolfe creates more than realistic picture of how he and the rest of the world view New York. The rich vs. the poor or the black vs. the white. Everyone is placed in one group or the other whether they like it or even fit into it...Wolfe's commentary and vivid use of racist terms at times becomes hard to bare and understand. Although with out it, it would be just a simple book, never a bestseller. It is exactly this type of language that makes the book more than an interesting read, but also an insightful and provocative journey through the mind of Tom Wolfe and the world he sees."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"This not only happens to be my favorite Tom Wolfe book, but my favorite book period. The plot is exciting and realistic. Readers will relate with every single character depicted here. And no one matches Wolfe's descriptive capabilities. What the rest of us would need a million words to say, Wolfe manages to express with a few key and very visual phrases. So far, there isn't a book I've enjoyed more."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Yes, this is a very good book. I was completely absorbed by it, but I didn't find it &quot;entertaining&quot; or funny, as most of the other reviewers seem to do. It's full of a dark sort of humor, but this didn't make me laugh very often. Most of the characters are as large as life and very &quot;real&quot; and that makes the story even more painful to read. After all, practically everything in this book goes terribly wrong, almost all the characters fail to realize their ideals, fail to transcend their own mediocrity and fail to live up to their own moral standards. They all leave a trail of victims in their wake. It's a sad story, really, which paints a very gloomy picture of modern society, a society whose members have such a hard time finding some meaning in what they do and what happens to them. The much criticized ending effectively deepens the pessimism, since it offers us a glimpse into the future: a tunnel without a glimmer of light at the end. I often asked myself if Mr. Wolfe sees any hope for us."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"One of the most important novels of the 1980s Tom Wolfe's \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" gives us a very realistic portrayal of New York during that period.But realism, tinged by Wolfe's own outrageous characters, and his relentless satire. While there may be nice things to say about both, Wolfe needs to realize that sometimes, saying little is the best way forward.And yet,Wolfe fails to make a statement with the book. The reason he is not ranked with Swift as satirist is specially because of this. Swift had a vision, a way he wanted the world to be, and besides, he was far more imaginative than Wolfe could ever hope to be. Wolfe's satire is limited by his reportial aspirations; Swift went so much further and took his to an artistic, and almost prophetic level.And finally, Wolfe isn't even the best satirist in America. John Updike offers far more power in the last of his \\"Rabbit\\" novels, and does so as he provides other things.But as a novel, the book falls flat. The badly overdone characters work well when used for satire alone, but are too shallow and clunky to sustain a story as long as this one. Characters so one dimensional that they serve as excellent entertainment, but not if we are to gain any real pleasure out of the book. And the constant emphasis given things, as he did in his second novel, makes teh novel that much less appealing. Thomas Pynchon resorts to outrageous characterization too, but notice how skilfully that is done, how that feels like the magnification of a real person's feelings. Tom Wolfe, the other Thomas, can't do that, or will not do that.The best part of the book was the end, the only part that felt inspired and original. When everything is taken away from him and how he reacts, that was the only part of the book in which Sherman McCoy shows a side of him that's different from what he did before. You wish the whole book had been this taut and unpredictable."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"I cannot believe that it has actually been over a decade since I read Tom Wolfe's THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES; it is a brilliant and hilarious entertaining work of satirical fiction, and a dead-on accurate social commentary of everything that made up the 1980's, commonly (and accurately) known as The Greed Decade. This includes the incendiary racial conflagrations that had been simmering throughout the 1970's that finally began to unravel during the 80's, aided and abetted by an increasingly sensationalist media that practiced underhanded &quot;divide and conquer&quot; tactics in order to keep the middle and working classes down by improperly (and sneakily) shifting the discussion from class to race.Wolfe captures all that here, albeit in a lighter tone, by following four separate tracks concurrently, and how they all come together: Financially successful but amoral and philandering nouveau-riche bond trader Sherman McCoy, professional successful but financially wanting assistant prosecutor Lawrence Kramer, professionally unsuccessful and perpetually inebriated British-born tabloid 'journalist' Peter Fallow, and socially powerful (but under-respected) self-proclaimed African-American leader Reverend Reginald Bacon. The bonfire that their vanities create is fascinating; but what is best about this book is the insightful and real-to-life humor/social commentary that Wolfe weaves into the story throughout. If you're a relatively young reader who was born in the 80's and thusly do not remember it the way that, let's say, those of us born in 1967 do, then the reading of this book is absolutely essential to understanding all the different dysfunctional facets that made the 1980's the way it was.Do not be put off by the story's length (705 pages); it is so enjoyable and is such a compulsive page-turner that it is likely that it will only take you a week or less to get through it all. Pick this one up and treat yourself to the hilarious world of THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES---and if you must, rent the 1990 Brian De Palma-directed misfire and see just how totally inept Hollywood was in capturing this world. THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES has earned its proper place one of the greatest---and most important---works of fiction in the 20th Century.MOST RECOMMENDED; AGES 17 &amp; UP"},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"I picked this book up on the recommendation of strangers who said that it was one of those must read American novels. I'm always leery of these recommendations as they Ayn Rand usually appears on them and as a someone once told me \\"Friends don't let friends read Ayn Rand\\". This was a surprisingly good book, I can't say how accurately it portrays New York City in the late 80's early 90's but it feels real, and the tensions and issues it deals with (race/class inequalities, the purpose of wealth) are ones we've yet to overcome or even recognize they need to be dealt with...

Granted it's a wonderful book, but that doesn't fully explain the phenomenon. Just something to think about."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe provides a very realistic look into life. Wolfe's style of writing is very refreshing: colloquial speech and dialogue make the characters very easy to relate to. Sherman McCoy is not your average blue-collar worker, and he may even spur jealousy and anger from readers. But it becomes difficult not to emphathize with him through his struggles and in the end. Wolfe also provides impeccable description of emotions and feelings, even something as simple as a hangover: &quot;The telephone blasted Peter Fallow awake inside an egg with the shell peeled away and only the the membranous sac holding it intact. Ah! The membranous sac was his head, and the right side of his head was on the pillow, and the yolk was as heavy as mercury, and it rolled like mercury, and it was pressing down on his right temple and his right eye and his right ear. If he tried to get up to answer the telephone, the yolk, the mercury, the poisoned mass, would shift and roll and rupture the sac, and his brains would fall out. (p.164)&quot;However, the arrangement of the chapters and different stories is very fragmented; there doesn't seem to be any organization other than, of course, a loose chronological unfolding of events. It is not difficult to keep track of what's going on, but it becomes very frustrating when attempting to try to tie every chapter or section to the others.Overall, this book is decent, but there may be a few major downfalls that will prevent everyone from enjoying it."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"First off, let me say that this book really held my interest and I enjoyed it (I gave it four stars, didn't I?).Perhaps, though, I should not have read &quot;A Man in Full&quot; first. There are so many similarities between the two books that I found myself thinking that Wolfe re-wrote &quot;Bonfire&quot; to make &quot;Man,&quot; yet based it in Atlanta instead of New York.Let's see...both books had racial tensions, both concerned lawyers that only looked out for their own interests, both had a strong main character that eventually fell in the end, both involved a lot (and I do mean a lot) of spouse-cheating, both had political figures that were determined to get re-elected at any cost, both had characters that were oh-so-concerned with thrusting out their mighty muscles to impress the women...etc. etc. etc.A previous reviewer stated that she didn't understand why people did not like the protagonist, Sherman McCoy. Let's see...hmmm...he cheats on his wife, repeatedly...he's a jerk to his fellow co-workers...he has no thought to what the consequences of his actions could do to his young daughter...in short, he generally thinks with the, er, &quot;contents&quot; of his pants. Granted, Wolfe writes in such a way that you do feel sorry for Sherman at the end, but I think it's important to remember that if he hadn't been cheating on his wife with Maria, then he never would have hit anyone with his car and the whole situation would have been avoided (although granted that would have made for a much less interesting book).All in all, though, even if &quot;Man&quot; and &quot;Bonfire&quot; are similar, one cannot overlook the original genious of &quot;Bonfire.&quot; Wolfe's descriptives of different types of people (the &quot;Pimp Roll,&quot; for God's sake, to describe how someone walked) and the vicious observations he makes on society and its shortcomings (and believe me, no one is exempt, not even authors) aid in the creation of an intricately woven piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"New York, The Brits, the Yanks, Racism, Politics, Institutions, Money and People go all mixed up in this great book, so great that is a classic.

Very strong character development, elaborate details and unbiased analysis of the contradictions existing in metropolitan life in USA are the hallmarks of this work. Shame that Tom Wolfe has written only two novels."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"It's obvious that this book takes place in the 80's. What with the 80's wall street narcissism, the abundance of shoulder pads, the European opulence in decorating styles of the elite, the computer screens with \\"green\\" writing, the use of pay phones, the idea that brown lipstick could ever be remotely sexy. Yet despite all this, the book still feels incredibly relevant in today's times. Actually even more relevant as America wakes up to a crisis of confidence in Wall Street.Almost all characters in this book are contemptible, save for maybe the Lamb kid (although even his wholesome personae is overblown), the little daughter, and the defense lawyer. Yet none of these people are the stars of the book. The real players: Sherman, Bacon, Kramer, and Fallow are incredibly smarmy in their respective fields. You can't root for any of them. Did you want Sherman to win his case or not? Wolfe clearly had a real disdain for these characters and so too did I. But I kind of liked this. I couldn't root for anyone and it kept me on my literary toes.The only observation that kept running through my head while reading this book was that Bacon, Kramer, and Fallow all had to metaphorically or actually tear down alpha male Sherman in order to feel better about themselves. To that end, I think this book is just as much about American male egotism as it is about anything else.All in all, a great, worthwhile read (and BTW, the first Wolfe I have ever read; I might have to venture further into his collection)."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe is a master storyteller in this gripping novel.

Who really cares about Larry Kramer trying to get &quot;the girl with the brown lipstick?&quot; In fact, a good portion of the book concerning Larry Kramer could be omitted, as could many of the ceaseless droning about the parties Sherman went to. They're irrelevant, so leave them out. I wish that the author had spent a little more effort on the ending, which is incredibly disappointing, with no real resolution. What kind of book ends with a paragraph to resolve the last 300 pages? Wolfe should have spent a little less time spinning his wheels, and a little more time making it worth it when you finally get to the end."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"This book holds up well, as the 90's on Wall Street make the 80's look like a bear market! Greed has just moved to the suburbs and purchased a sport utility vehicle. A fascinating read, gripping,and with a plot that predicted the front page spiced up by Tom Wolfe's original and witty observations. By the way, I met Tom Wolfe on the Delta shuttle soon after this book was published, and what a gentlemen. He couldn't have been more gracious as I nattered on about Bonfire and some of his other books. Tom, another book please!!"},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"If F. Scott Fitzgerald's Jay Gatsby was the Modern-Man of his generation, Tom Wolf's everyman hero in &quot;Bonfire of the Vanities is our Boomer man,&quot; the guy who can't quite make ends meet on 998,000 bucks a year. Although Wolfe is best known for his &quot;new journalism&quot; stethopscopic view of America in works like &quot;Electric Acid Cool Aid Test&quot; and &quot;The Pump House Gang,&quot; his first foray into the land of the novel is novel indeed.Bonfire is a hybrid of novel and journalism with a pinch of Woody Allen. Wolfe's &quot;social X-rays&quot; scavenge cosmopolitan Manhattan cocktail parties as the vultures of the downtown poverty industry exploit a yuppie faux pas that sends his Boomer hero into a crashing Sartrean abyss.Angular as a spaghetti Western, zanier than Monty Python, and truer than Sinclair Lewis, Mr. Wolf's excursion as a novelist leaves us wondering why he doesn't do more."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"&quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; will be on any self-respecting literature professor's syllabus in the year 2050.&quot;Students,&quot; he or she will thunder, &quot;this book is an incredible example of flawlessly crafted writing by one of the 20th century's greatest authors.

Thiscertainly is my case, since I reveled in the somewhat perversepleasure of reading this book and watching the spectacular fall of Sherman McCoy, the central figure.Bonfire of the Vanities is a book about New York in the late 1980s, when bond traders like McCoy ruled the universe. I understand that it has become a cliche to say that the novel is better than the movie. In this case, however, the disparity is so great that I would actually recommend you see the movie."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"On the plus side, The Bonfire of the Vanities compares well with Balzac's stuff. I mean, the methods are similar. The story follows several very different characters living in New York, and each scene is detailed, particularized, analyzed, painted with a very fine brush. Many layers of New York's society are represented. There are no moral messages, no lessons to be learned, just life in New York in the late 'Eighties or early 'Nineties at its most intense, presented as \\"business as usual,\\" with corrupt politicians, lascivious prosecutors, moronic members of the jury, conceited stock market honchos, cynical lawyers, less-than-bright policemen, political opportunists, socialites, priests, opera singers, real estate agents with five thousand dollar manicures, rich faithful wives who deserve to be strangled, only it never occurs to anyone to strangle them, mistresses on the make, petty criminals, silly immigrants, bone-headed journalists, feminists of both genders, racial and ethnic tension - and on and on. The book is really a lot of fun.On the other hand, the opus falls just short of making its author, well, \\"the Balzac of our time.\\" No scene is picturesque enough to be called cinematographic, and for a novel 800 pages long that's a bit, well, loquacious (on the author's part). The author tends to explain too much, and fits people and scenes together in such a way as to promote his own outlook, leaving the attentive reader no choice but to examine it. Upon closer examination, one realizes that Mr. Wolfe's main purpose is to show that people in general are vile, selfish, obtuse creatures (without exception); that life is a pretty ridiculous affair; and that any joy a person ever derives from living is brief, accidental, and usually comes at the expense of others. To put it plainly, THERE IS NO GOD in this novel. It was written by a fierce atheist. There is neither faith, hope, nor love in it. None. Life is algebraically plain and tedious.(I realize I said earlier there were no moral messages in the book. There aren't any. The above is an OUTLOOK, not a message).Literature thrives on extraordinary situations in which characters are inspired to perform extraordinary acts. The element of surprise in Wolfe's novel is purely circumstantial. Folks have no fre will in this story. (All atheists are determinists more or less by definition, I suppose).In the past, I've had some interesting experiences related to the publication of this novel. Two years after it came out (in the early 'Nineties, I believe), the news finally reached the Philistines, and by Philistines I mean those representatives of the middle class (and, sometimes, the upper middle class; I have nothing to say about the actual upper class since no one, not even the representatives of the said class themselves, can figure out what the hell they're up to, what it is they do all day, and what their problem is) ... uh ... where was I? ... Philistines ... those representatives of the middle class that once in a while make a half-hearted effort to appear CULTURED, which, in their view, means catching a program on the History Channel once in a while and telling others that they're reading \\"this book, it's actually pretty good.\\" They never seem to finish this book. I mean, they sort of struggle through the first twenty pages, and then skim through the rest, and make plans to read it properly when they visit Aruba next year, or some such. They're always too busy, they never have any \\"free time.\\" One gets the impression that if they stopped being busy for a moment, civilization would just collapse and never recover. Anyway, this dude had a copy of \\"Bonfire\\" in his briefcase and was telling me (his colleague) how everybody had recommended this book to him. He was going to read it when he had some free time. He actually DID take it to Aruba (there was also a wife involved, I believe). He came back, I believe, without having finished it. A year later he died. He was a good guy, too. Reading just wasn't \\"his thing,\\" as Philistines like to say.Anyway, when \\"Bonfire\\" came out, the hype was considerable, which for me is nearly always a turn-off. And then the movie came out (which, incidentally, was far more politically incorrect than the book, and the choice of actors and actresses was just UNBELIEVABLE; I loved it). So I put off reading \\"Bonfire\\" until, oh, I don't know, maybe after 9/11. By that time, home video games had become astonishingly popular, and crime rates started dropping everywhere across the nation, including New York (for which then-Mayor Giuliani took all the credit, of course). When I finally got to read it, the novel struck me as a bit dated. Not that any issues described in it with a flourish, social and otherwise, had become a thing of the past. The overall societal set of problems had shifted a little since the novel's publication, that's all.The story is constantly balancing on the edge of political correctness, even though it never goes beyond the boundaries, not once. Even so, few other authors would dare show a book that probes so many \\"untouchable,\\" \\"sacred-cow\\" issues to an editor, and few editors would touch a book of this sort with a hundred-foot pole. The advantage of being Tom Wolfe, I suppose, is that during the decades he spent being a journalist and creating his own style (starting back in the '60's), the man gradually accustomed everyone to the fact that he says outrageous things and gets away with it. The degree of outrage has increased over the years, and today Mr. Wolfe can get away (I would imagine) with saying pretty much anything, because he knows that no one will take it (or him) seriously.It is worth remembering, while reading this novel, that its author belongs to the glorious school of Southern authors with New York careers: the crux of American literature. God bless."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"I read and enjoyed this book previously in the late 80's. The passing of a further twenty-five years or so have brought it some clarity. I've got to highly recommend it, although there is one flaw that SHOULD push the rating just below 5 stars. More of that later.Sherman McCoy has it all. He makes a million dollars a year selling bonds for a top Wall Street firm. He lives in a 14 room, one-apartment-with-servants-wing-to-a-floor building on Park Avenue enjoying picturesque park views. His devoted wife--a little older than him and not as attractive as she once was--has carved out a career as an interior designer published in Architectural Digest, and his idealized 12 year old daughter attends the toniest private school with it's own shuttle that tools up and down Park Ave. gathering golden children in the promised land. Topping it off is his mid-20's mistress who he joins for the occasional impromptu tryst in another woman's rent-controlled apartment ($333/month)that the mistress--trophy wife of a self-made Jewish gillionaire--coopts from her for $750/month.Sherman's (SHUHMAN, the mistress calls him through her South Carolinian accent)fantasy life begins to come unravelled when he misses a turn off to Manhattan and ends up in the Bronx one evening after picking up his paramour at Kennedy airport. He goes from missplaced to lost and stops at an on-ramp because of an abandoned tire in his path. Two black youths appear from the side and a larger one come towards him somewhat quickly. This is the point where a spoiler opportunity presents itself to me, I'll resist the temptation, but the upthrust is that one of the youths gets struck by Sherman's car and the balance of the book is devoted to the downward spiral in Sherman's life this produces.The only flaw in the book occurs when detectives first visit Sherman's apartment to get a look at his car as a function of their hit-and-run investigation. The struck youth went to the hospital with a wrist injury, is treated and leaves with undiagnosed head trauma that later produces a coma (ultimately fatal). He told his mother he had been hit by a Mercedes with a license plate beginning with an R and a second number with a full ascender (my words, not his) like an \\"I\\" a \\"P\\" or an \\"F\\". After a self-appointed civil rights leader/preacher looking for a fast buck produces PR that takes talk of the accident to viral extremes, the police launch their investigation that leads them to Sherman's (and 500 other) doors to examine their cars. With so many possibilities, the police are just looking to eliminate the cars with no physical damage.Sherman blows the interview and arouses their suspicion. His behavior is not only ridiculous and outrageous, it's also unbelievable. Here he is, a self-styled \\"Master of the Universe\\" (as a bond salesman) and he can't act cool in a not even unexpected situation? Here, the author almost lost me. I was very disappointed.But he had to do this to produce the rest of the action of the book, which was well drawn and monumental. The author's gift of language, or characterization, or descriptive narrative--I could go on--are beyond comparison. This is a masterful story-teller at the peak of his powers.For those of you that look for \\"messages\\" in better fiction, you see how revered American institutions can be prostituted and perverted by the whims of angry crowds and determined behind-the-scenes influencers. Courts aren't supposed to function like the one in the Bronx, but, in context, it seems the most natural thing in the world.This is not Tom Wolfe's best book, but it's better than just about anyone elses."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"The Bonfire of the Vanities by Tom Wolfe is an entertaining book that earns the label of a \\"page-turner\\" through Wolfe's quality prose and ability to showcase the quirky parts of his characters. It's a good story with big implications, seen from the eyes of a handful of different New Yorkers. The best I can give this novel is good, but not great. It has good scenes and good subject matter, but never quite hits what it set out to.Wolfe gives you a taste of a lot of interesting things and characters that never get expanded on. When you read the two scenes with Bacon (Al Sharpton-lite) you're captivated by him, but he hardly appears otherwise except for somebody mentioning how terrible he is. We meet the judge Kovitsky early on and he's equally interesting, and he goes unheard of until the climax in which he's supposed to be the crux of the finale. We don't find out that Sherman was once an idealist who wasn't consumed by money and social status until it's way too late to care. Sherman's turn from a wimpy yuppie into an \\"animal\\" at the end came off really lame. So now he isn't afraid to lie...wait, hasn't he already lied to everybody he's encountered up to this point?Wolfe can craft a line with the best of them though, and his humor and descriptive ability usually keeps his stuff afloat when he lacks in other departments. One of the best parts of the book was the dichotomy between Kramer and the women he lusted after. When he was staring down Maria as they interviewed her and his inner dialogue hinted that she might want him, and then we find out that she thought he was a creep was a beautiful notion about how a lot of men think and women's reaction to that. Also when he's rambling to The Girl With the Brown Lipstick about the trial and he thinks she's enthralled with every aspect of it, come to find out at the end of the scene she thinks he's a typical New York male that only talks about themselves. Subtle nuances like this made the book worthwhile despite being bashed over the head with the fact that Jews, Italians, Blacks, Irish, rich people and poor people are different. Wolfe also made it a point to note that everybody who worked for the justice system was bald or balding.I would have liked to have seen the story go to trial and seen Killian and Kramer going at it with Kovitsky playing mediator. I wanted to see Sherman watch Maria testify under oath and I wanted resolution. I guess I can't fault Wolfe for his ending though, because it's his story and that's how he chose to write it. I can say though that the ending felt like a cop-out and a let down. The book was worth reading and a good addition to the Tom Wolfe canon, but not his best work."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"The Bonfire of the Vanities is the second Tom Wolfe book that I have read. The first was I Am Charlotte Simmons, which although flawed, I enjoyed. Still, this book (along with two other Wolfe titles) sat on my shelf for quite a while, intimidating me due to its thickness, as I like books that I can read through quickly. When I finally began reading this one, I found that in spite of its length, I was able to proceed quickly.The Bonfire of the Vanities is the story of three men. Sherman McCoy is a high-salaried bond trader living with his wife and daughter in a Park Avenue apartment. In spite of his job and status, he finds himself worrying about money as it flows out as quickly as it comes in. His obsession is being a \\"Master of the Universe.\\" Sherman is also romantically involved with Maria Ruskin, the young wife of an elderly businessman.Larry Kramer is an assistant district attorney working in the Bronx. He also lives his wife and young child, but his conditions are much different. His tiny apartment would fit into McCoy's living room. Kramer experiences a combination of envy and disdain toward other lawyers with high-paying jobs at big firms, as he would like their salaries, but feels he is on the moral high road as he helps serve the public.Finally, there is Peter Fallow, an alcoholic British journalist for a tabloid. Fallow has been down on his luck, and his main goal each day is to find ways to get free meals. Fallow tries to dupe his boss into thinking he is being productive, and also desires a lifestyle beyond his means.The thread that ties the three characters together begins when McCoy and his mistress are involved in an accident where he may have hit someone while driving in the Bronx at night. He is conflicted over whether to report it, while his mistress says to forget about it as they don't know if anything actually happened. It turns out that they hit a young black man from the projects who was living a clean lifestyle, leaving him in a coma. Community leaders put pressure on the police and legal system to go after the perpetrator. Fallow is the reporter who breaks the story, while Kramer is the ADA in charge of prosecuting the case. When witnesses lead the investigation back to McCoy, the case becomes about race and social class.In telling this story, the author presents a vivid description of New York during the 1980's. Having never been there, I can't judge whether this description is accurate, but it added a lot to the story. Also, the characters are very well fleshed out. Each has his own flaws and virtues, which evolve over time. The arrogant McCoy and the idealistic Kramer from the beginning are definitely depicted differently at the conclusion.Overall, this was a well-written novel, and I will be dusting off and reading A Man in Full and The Right Stuff (eventually)."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"For me, at the beginning there was an intrest in how all of these people related together. What could a Bronx defense attorney have to do with this guy that makes a ton of money on Wall Street?Sherman McCoy had a demanding presence throughout the book. He is the elusive millionare that everyone wants to be. He seems to have everything...what could possibly go wrong?Then there is his mistress. She is cheating on her husband, but seems otherwise harmless. It turns out she just may be the sneakiest of all.I cannot believe how the justice system was run in this book. What Kramer did was crazy. I felt it really gave me an inside look at what really happens and how people try to win over their consituants. Poor Sherman just got lost in the shuffle. A great read!"},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"This was my second Tom Wolfe book and I enjoyed it even more than the first, being \\"A Man In Full\\" It amazes me how Wolfe can introduce so many characters from so many places and then some how tie them all together. This book may anger certain readers with the frequent stereotypes used by Wolfe to show New York prejudice but they are essential in understanding New York city. I personally enjoyed the theme of how many whites were afraid of blacks and were scared to travel to what seems like another city in Harlem. Wolfe also addresses the situation within the poverty stricken ghettos of New York. This book paints an accurate picture of New York sex and class and the divisions within them."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"The Bonfire of the Vanities clearly made several strong points about racism, sexism and capitalism in America, but I personally enjoyed the attention Wolfe paid to developing the characters and situations each character was in. All the plot lines are just built up by the indepth description of how each character was involved. The reader is never left wondering why the characters are doing what they are doing, but everything is very obviously connected by Wolfe's previous narrative that it gives the reader something to look to for clarification. Specific events such as the mayors obsession with mayonnaise \\"who in the name of God would bring a half eaten jar of mayonnaise to a public meeting?\\" or Sherman's confusion in the Bronx \\"Who on Earth would take the trouble to shove a chair in a chicken wire fence in this neighborhood?\\" also shows the actual character's detail orientedness, and perhaps shows that focus on detail is an inherent human flaw."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"This is the only book I took with me on a three-month trip to Europe. It was plenty. A huge, beautiful, juicy paean to New York, to Americans, and finally to Sherman himself, Bonfire grabs the reader and doesn't let go. I would ration myself, a chapter a day, because I didn't want it to end. Then I reread the whole book on a six-hour train ride and didn't even mind the motion sickness.Whatever you do, don't see the movie, or you will forever be tormented by Bruce Willis as a dissolute London reporter, Tom Hanks as the quintessential 80s bondsman who's lost his way and Melanie Griffith as...well..who knows? Read this book as fast as you can and then read it again. It's like time travel back to the era of &quot;Greed is good&quot;."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"...this is the book you should take. The characters are so entertaining and the plot(s) so interesting that it will divert you and keep you engrossed all the way to Hong Kong. The only drawback will be when you have to stifle your laughter! The mixture of types that make New York what it is are all depicted with wry humor and a keen eye for fakery. No one sees through people's social poses like Tom Wolfe! He even presciently created the character of Reverend Bacon before our real life version, Al Sharpton came on the scene."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Using Wolfe's cake analogy, this book is one hell of a serving of a multi-layered cake. It is funny, farcical, tragic, satiric and informative. We are giving the wonderful New York landscape at its panoramic best, even to its underbelly in The Bronx Courthouse.Sherman Mc.Coy becomes a victim of vicious circumstance, not only that we are given a glimpse into the machinations and manipulations of those who take advantage of his unfortunate position.It is a morality tale, but one is left wondering what Sherman, a Master of the Universe, invite this upon himself: basically not listening to his better instinct of immediately reporting an accident to the police. He had become blinded by his love in an extra-marital relationship.A real treat to read."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Bonfire of the Vanities has long been hailed as one the greatest (the greatest?) American novels of the 1980's, and its accolades bear little use repeating. Nevertheless, a new look at this classic novel provides ample proof that while many aspects of society have changed in the nearly two decades since Bonfire was published, a great many other have, sadly, not. Just add Starbucks, the Internet, and cellular phones; you'll find that the world described by this novel is very much alive in Gotham today.Literary celebrity and brilliant self-promoter Tom Wolfe did meticulous research on both the upper crust and under belly of Reagan Era New York City to craft this incisive, complicated, dense, and comic tale of racial unrest, political bickering, and blind sighted American bourgeois insularity. Darting from the dilapidated housing projects of the South Bronx to the gilded penthouses of Park Avenue, Wolfe spins his tale around the fictional personage of Sherman McCoy: a WASP wall street powerhouse, a self-described \\"Master of the Universe\\", and a man who due to an accidental and tragic visit to the South Bronx ends up igniting the collective and seething racial and socioeconomic tensions vibrating beneath New York's polarized population. Mr. Wolfe has painted a rich and multifaceted ethnic landscape to navigate, avoiding any and all simplistic cultural syllogisms in lieu of both character and cultural specificity, with all of the complexity and contradictions that come with it. Though it has a Dramatis Personae the size of a Dickens novel, none of the characters are turned into caricature; indeed, every individual is sympathetic in Wolfe's world, though none are overtly heroic or free of troubling ethical transgression. It is a testimony to Wolfe's skill as a writer that, though this southern WASP in the famous white suit bears little relation to many of Bonfire's most colorful characters, he always presents them with conviction and believability. His detailed descriptions of various social and professional rituals at various levels of New York life give the reader the detail needed to invest imaginatively in the lives of the many characters populating Bonfire's New York. Whether it be the perpetually caffeinated barking of a Wall Street Investment Firm's trading floor, or the grinding, discouraging monotony of the legal machinations in the South Bronx courthouse, the reader is no doubt given the impression that this is how it really was. The zenith of this is an extended chapter in which Wolfe intricately (and often hilariously) describes an uber-posh dinner party at a palatial 5th Avenue apartment. One can almost taste the foie gras pate and Dom Perignon.A lesser writer could let all this detail weigh him down and cause an otherwise interesting book to have all the buoyancy of sunken treasure chest. Bonfire's prose eschews this particularly precarious trap. The narrative often oscillates between traditional 3rd person description and 1st person expression. Depending on which character is being focused on at any given moment, their own point-of-view on the narrative is seamlessly woven into the prose allowing the story to take on an emotional immediacy and deeper sense of perspective. Most importantly, the plot itself is a thoroughly designed piece of machinery that allows Wolfe to go on his descriptive tangents without harming the book's internal feng-shui. Indeed, the story's momentum is built on this specificity. While the general points in the storyline could be churned out in any Law & Order episode, Bonfire's power cannot be reduced to a simple plot description. It is not about the guilt or innocence of it's characters. Instead, the author is putting a whole era on trial. No doubt Wolfe does have an agenda (it would be foolish and impossible to imagine any writer worth his salt without one) but it only is apparent in an overarching view of the work as a whole, and is never overtly didactic.This being said, Bonfire of the Vanities is a book about the dangers of a stratified society, in which an egregiously affluent echelon of the population ignores the clearly deteriorating circumstances of less-fortunates around them. Equally dangerous are the politicians, public servants, \\"community leaders\\" and \\"journalists\\" who, in order to appease the mob and advance their careers, exploit these deeply troublesome socio-economic tensions with shallow displays of self-righteous verbosity and hyped-up social hysteria. What makes Bonfire such a classic is the way Wolfe presents these social problems as a result of the elaborate Rube Goldberg device that was (is?) contemporary American metropolitan society. This is illustrated with astute clarity by his representation of established government bureaucracy's engagment with the ever-churning melting pot of American culture, as typified by the extremely volatile ethnic smorgasbord of New York City. Running parallel and counterpoint to this is the way the Press uses these often complex problems to advance it's own agenda and increase it's profit-margin. The characters and plot of the book move like a machine, each person doing what is generally expected of him given his social position, occupation and (less so) personal commitments. Nevertheless, the problems of the characters, both lowly and highbrow, are not easily resolved. The real culprit is the excesses of the 1980's, and they have never been presented with as much clarity, insight, heart and humor as in The Bonfire of the Vanities. Of course, the lessons of the book were hardly learned, and America today has yet to escape the problems that Tom Wolfe so exquisitely and satirically addresses in this masterwork of the contemporary American novel."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"I think that one of the most startling things about this novel is that, for everyone who reads it, there is a different pivotal image, a separate moment in the book which forms an axis for the work. For me, it's Sherman McCoy's phone conversation with his estranged wife, in which he talks about the days when, as he went off to work, he would turn on the street under the window where she was watching, and give the black power sign. It meant, to this white son-of-a-lawyer, that he wasn't going to get sucked into Wall Street, that he was only using it; that it wouldn't change him.Fast forward a dozen or so years, and Sherman is 38. He's one of New York's leading Bond salesman, a self-titled Master of the Universe who makes a million dollars a year (and that isn't enough), barely sees his wife, and is cheating with another man's gold-digging spouse. As a matter of fact, when we first meet Sherman, the only redeeming feature he has is that he does seem to really love his five-year-old daughter.Sherman is not the only disgusting character we find as our story opens. There's the mistress, Maria, who laughs at her husband from the confines of her sublet rent-controlled love-nest. The wife is bitchy enough to lose sympathy with the reader despite her husband's philandering. There's the alcoholic tabloid journalist, who is an expert at getting other people to pick up the tab. And there's a thinly veiled reference to the Rev. Al Sharpton, just to complete the picture. When the book opens, the only character with whom the reader can sympathize is Larry, a lawyer who chose to work in the Bronx D.A.'s office because he wants to &quot;make a difference&quot;.And yet, the reader is sucked into the lives of these people. At first it may only be for a tittlating look at how bad bad people can be, but very soon (Wolfe doesn't tease us long) we stay to find out whether our characters will get caught for the crime they have committed; finally, we stay because we have come to admire Sherman McCoy.It is a testament to Tom Wolfe's abilities that by the end of the novel, we have come to completely different views of most of the characters in this novel. The wife isn't bitchy, she's just dissatisfied with a life that she didn't set out to get. The mistress isn't harmless, she's a viper. The reporter will print any lie to increase the drama of the crime he's uncovering; the lawyer will justify anything to catch his &quot;Great White Defendant&quot;.Sherman begins the book by telling us that he is entitled to his penthouse, his sports car, his mistress, his Saville Row suits. He finishes it standing alone, unable to afford a lawyer and &quot;dressed for jail&quot;. But he's standing, and once again, he's raising a fist in the air, determined to overcome."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"In *Bonfire of the Vanities*, pop journalist Wolfe takes a sneering satirical look (from a surprisingly European point of view) at American culture and all of its absurdities and obsessions. New York is treated as the microcosm of 80s America with all of its fads, rivalries, economic woes and class inequality mixing together uneasily and then exploding. Sherman McCoy, the supremely irritating central charater, is a fresh-faced adolescent of 38 years who just doesn't get the fact that the world is a harsh, dangerous place--that is until he becomes the fall guy in a politically and racially charged scandal. Peter Fallow (by far the best character in the book)is a delightfully cynical and misanthropic British journalist who observes the parade the do-gooder activists, slick political manipulators, confused cops, thuggish cops, skeletal society ladies, urban punks, garish architecture, trash culture and trendy clubs with an acid wit and always a few stiff drinks under his belt. If they ever make a real movie out of this book (the existing one doesn't count) PLEASE get Jeremy Irons to play Fallow. Some people see this book as some kind of right-wing propaganda. It isn't. Wolfe, despite his own more or less conservative views, allows the story to tell itself without a lot of interpretation from above. Each character is a complex individual with his or her own unique motivations and mixture of vice and virtue. We spend time inside the minds and private lives of a wide variety of people and are allowed to make our own judgements about who deserves what measure of praise or blame. If there is any prejudice in the book it is against people who simplify complex issues. Wolfe's world, like the real thing, is brimming with paradox."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe was once asked if the novel is dead. He replied that it's not quite dead, but it's on life support. He thinks the biggest problem with modern novels is that the novelists don't bother to do adequate research on their subject. How can one write a novel about India, for example, if one has never been to India? In Bonfire of the Vanities, Wolfe has done the research and has created an exact representation of modern city life in America, complete with politically self-serving DAs, civil rights demagogues, and pompous gold-coast dandies.Wolfe is obviously a keen observer of detail. This skill combined with his mastery of the reportorial style of writing make for a great novel, and a great expose' of the hustlers and opportunists that use the system for their own self-interest. I think of him as a modern-day Sinclair Lewis, who once said that he never passed judgement one way or another, he just reported what he observed. Since most of us have probably never been in a high-rise apartment on Park Avenue or a housing project in the Bronx, it's interesting to read Wolfe's detailed descriptions down to the type of wallpaper and table centerpieces. All of this works to pull the reader into the scene, the only excess possibly being his proclivity for over-reporting clothing styles. Wolfe shows his love of clothing by using esoteric terms that probably have no meaning to the average reader.Wolfe's scenes are so realistic the reader can imagine himself being in the action. I felt Sherman's fear in the Bronx jail cell. I felt his shame when lying to his wife about his relationship with Maria. The characters and dialog are so real, even though the reader may not live in that social milieu he can identify with the situation. The action moves at a rapid pace. Wolfe doesn't get bogged down with excessive narrative. He lets the characters speak for themselves--truly the mark of a great novelist.I love the way Wolfe has the Brits comment on Americans. It's refreshing to see ourselves from another perspective. How funny it is to hear Peter Fallow complain about our \\"ridiculous country\\" and our lack of social graces, all the while sponging off of rich Americans at every opportunity.This book is timeless. I read it for the second time recently and found it as enjoyable as the first. At the end I felt myself wishing for several more chapters. Bonfire of the Vanities should always stand as one of the best examples of American literature by one of our greatest writers."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Bonfire is my all-time favorite book and, in my opinion, Tom Wolfe is an absolute genius. A lot of talented authors tell us very good, sometimes great, stories, but few people have the genius to cut through all the trappings and see life exactly as it is. Tom Wolfe exposes the excesses of the 80s gloriously in this book. Okay, all the characters were hateful, but how could they have been otherwise? The only problem I found was the ending--I would have liked to have seen a little more resolution, but that doesn't detract from the book's perfection. My only real complaint is that Wolfe never gave us anything else to equal the sheer genius of Bonfire."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Lot of useful reviews here. No one mentions Wolfe's 24-page introduction, 'Stalking the Billion-Footed Beast,' which is excellent in itself as an overview of the alleged death of the novel, The New Journalism, non-fiction v. fiction &amp; his own evolution as a writer. The introduction is worth a read on its own if you're a journalism student, a would-be or actual writer or just interested in the publishing world. As for the rest of the book, it's excellent. Wolfe is a master of the set piece, the extended vignette beautifully observing a situation or person. He is not so good at endings, which is why I picked four stars rather than five. I felt identically about his later &quot;A Man in Full,&quot; and it didn't stop me enjoying the heck out of the book. If you enjoy his fiction, his non-fiction is well worth checking out as great examples of very controlled, observant reporting &amp; writing. I particularly enjoyed &quot;From Bauhaus to Our House,&quot; an extended essay about modern architecture, and &quot;The Painted Word,&quot; ditto on modern art."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe knows how to do his research. In his earlier, nonfiction works, he demonstrates his capacity to observe and synthesize information from even the most chaotic of situations. This is his first work of fiction, and his critical and all-absorbing eye works overtime; no detail is too small, no element is too minute. This work is saturated with timeless authenticity. It is intricate, impressive, and exhaustive.Exhausting, too.I admire the virtuosity of this book -- its scope, ambitions, and insights. But these admirable qualities are subsumed by an avalanche of detail. Wolfe amassed a titanic amount of information about New York in the 80's, and instead of carefully parcelling those tid-bits out in a way to delicately suggest the satire he is aiming for, he decided to include every, single, solitary thing he learned. The story here is secondary to the scenery.Speaking of story: Sherman McCoy, \\"Master of the Universe,\\" a Park Avenue bond trader with a massive bank account (and an ego and debt to match) is embroiled in a political whirlwind when he and his mistress are the cause of a possibly fatal accident in the Bronx. McCoy's world is knocked out of whack when he finds himself at the mercy of fame-hungry D.A.s, money-hungry opportunists, power-hungry politicians, and gossip-hungry journalists. It's the story of a world full of fools and blow-hards who spend most of their energy trying to be (or at least appear to be) otherwise.The satire is acute and on-the-nose, but it also centers around a cast composed entirely of unlikeable characters. Everyone from the naive McCoy to the pompous (and shady) Reverend Bacon, from the hypocritical attorney Kramer to the pickled and brined journalist Fallow: they are well-rounded, mostly believable, and mildly intriguing, but they also reek of their various vices. Because of this, when Wolfe attempts poignancy, it comes across as vacuousness. When the satire tries to be tongue-in-cheek, it is instead elbow-in-rib (and not very subtly, either).The biggest flaw in the novel is that Wolfe has tried to make far too many points, and he takes too long to make them. He puts his two cents in, but it looks like twenty. The story isn't bad at all, and the turns it takes are certainly entertaining, but it is a wearisome read. When all is said and done, I feel like I have learned more about political in-roads, journalistic deception, and financial loopholes than I have about real people, much less those all-greed, all-Me people of the 80's, at which Wolfe's novel tentatively tries to aim.Again, this is a flaw of Wolfe's refusal to leave even the tiniest microbe of research out of his writing. A good knowledge of characters and setting is necessary to give a novel a solid pulse, a sense of liveliness, but any real and true pulse is usually hidden just beneath the surface. Wolfe has slashed the skin of his story, revealing its pulse in throbbing torrents. If I may torture the metaphor, he's cut a major artery of the tale in order to show us its life, and what he's done instead is cause his novel to die a slow and laborious death. We watch the book struggle and plod forward, valiantly, but by the end, all we're left with is a twitching mass that still wears a grisly death grin. The ending here is less an ending than it is Wolfe running out of research to employ. The pulse stops there."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Although several reviewers have claimed that elements of this novel have dated the essence of this novel will always be relevant. True this was written pre-internet, pre-Clinton, pre 9/11 but the vanities that drive the chattering classes, so perfectly satirised by the author, are an inherent characteristic of moneyed urban dwellors anywhere on this planet. The spiralling nature of the plot complements the authors heady character descriptions and set-pieces.I know several people who have read and hated this novel because of its ultimately bleak portrayal of humanity. I however found it marvellously uplifting (not to mention hilarious) and view the book more as a dark fable on the perils of ambition in a capitalist society. The reader should note that most of the novel's characters would be regarded as successful in their respective professional lives and that each of those characters have lost a little bit of their soul to get where they are. What Wolfe allows us to ponder is : Is this what it takes to get to the top?"},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"It's always fun to read a best seller from almost 20 years ago, especially one that was proclaimed as something of a classic at the time. It's even more enjoyable to discover that Tom Wolfe's The Bonfire of the Vanities proves worthy of its acclaim even with the absence of cell phones, email and instant messaging.I mention the technology only because such communications dinosaurs as pay phones play significant roles in the story of how an auto accident involving a bond trader and a pedestrian teenager gets complicated by his mistress, a political hack of a DA, the resentful prosecutor, a drunken opportunist of a reporter, society matrons (including the bond trader's wife), a media manipulating black activist/minister, egotistical Wall Street executives, courthouse lawyers and a wealth of other characters.The title says it all. No character in the book operates without his or her ego getting in the way of things and like a small fire that gets too close to the charcoal lighter and then the gas tank... well, you get the idea.Forget the nonsensical movie they made of this, as far as I'm concerned that film exists solely for the purpose of demonstrating that Tom Hanks can make a bad decisions once every decade or so. This novel is a delight, one that should be rediscovered by a generation of readers that was in elementary school back in the 80's."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"This is one of the best stories I've ever read. It's intelligent, hysterical, very cynical and yet, so very real. Not only did it capture my attention during its 700pages -to the point I just couldn't go to sleep - but also I actually felt sad once I realized there was no more book to read and that it was over. I had become so attached to the characters - it was almost as if I had become one of their friends - and also I went so into it that I was dragged into its own pace and timing. In the end (don't freak out, I'm not gonna say how it ends) I realized that I 'd become agitated myself as action took place at such a high speed -as if I had been there all the time: if a book is capable of making a person perspire and agitate in his armchair and laugh loudly and histerically, so hard that he is unable to continue reading, then it must be a masterpiece. And this is most certainly one."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Regarded by some as the essential literary representation of 1980s America, \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" was written during the economic boom and urban crime waves of that decade and published almost as the stock market crashed in 1987. It follows the lives of a group of characters who express New York City's ethnic, socio-economic, and political rivalries through their involvement in a highly-publicized case of hit-and-run. A car belonging to Sherman McCoy of Park Avenue, one of Wall Street's most successful bond brokers, accidentally strikes a young black man in the Bronx. With the injured man in a coma, Harlem preacher, politician, and general rabble-rouser Rev. Reginald Bacon sees an opportunity to advance his agenda -by delivering the racially charged case to ambitious District Attorney Abe Weiss and to unscrupulous tabloid journalist Peter Fallow. Prosecutor Lawrence Kramer jumps at the opportunity to bring down a wealthy WASP in the name of equality. And streetwise Irish lawyer Tommy Killian may be McCoy's only ally in a city where truth and justice take a back seat to just about everything.\\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\"' flaw is ironically the source of its strength. The book is over 600 pages long. It follows too many characters and spends a lot of time describing the world from their point of view. The book's insights rely on its many perspectives, but at the same time, the descriptions are cumbersome. Tom Wolfe generally does not cast his characters in sympathetic light. His willingness to call it how they see it draws the reader into the story out of an almost perverse curiosity. The blunt talk and peek inside the worlds of city politics, tabloid journalism, criminal law, and Park Avenue lifestyles keep us interested. The story is found in the self-serving hostilities and interdependencies of New York's many factions more than it is in the sequence of events. And it's all thoroughly plausible, sadly."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"I thought that the use was well understated. I received the book and the jacket was practically falling to pieces."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"I have been a Tom Wolfe fan for over two decades but continue to think that his real talent is for the essay and not for long fiction. Like Mailer, he seems to be able to string words together with unnerring skill but has trouble sustaining a tight narrative. Mostly, for me, what kept this book from coming alive was my dislike for the main characters. I just didn't care what happened to them. Rather, nothing could be bad enough. This is pure prejudice on my part, but I can't get past it. I hate these folks - their lifestyle, their values, their friends, their work, their entire social world - and I really don't want to read about them. Certainly not read this many pages. Couldn't he have punctured the hero's little life in half the number of pages and not left the reader so numb?"},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"...but I easily could have. Bleah. Dull and racist. I am not much of a Tom Wolfe fan at this point, having read and been bored by both &quot;A Man in Full&quot; and &quot;Bonfire.&quot; I admit laughing at and being impressed by the vivid characterizations--the prose and powerful description does keep you going, but the plot definitely does not."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe's reputation as a good writer is one of those things that escapes me, rather like the appeal of figure-skating and the music of Dean Friedman. His fans claim him for a dazzlingly witty writer and an inventor of a whole new style of journalism - which style seems to me to be a pathological delusion that we are more interested in him than in what he writes about. His book on architecture is farcically shallow, and his major contribution to 20th century prose style seems to be the introduction of multiple exclamation marks to signify when he's being funny.So, no, I don't like him. Skip to the last paragraph if you feel you've heard enough of my opinion. The Bonfire of the Vanities was a major publishing event, as it was Wolfe's first venture into fiction; he had claimed for years that contemporary fiction writers had abandoned the idea that fiction had anything to say about the real world, ignoring the fact that a really _good_ novel like Pynchon's &quot;Gravity's Rainbow&quot; is chock-full of information about military technology, the complicity of America in colluding with Nazi science (hiring the borderline war criminal Werner von Braun to work on the space program, for example) and historical examples of genocide. Hence, he turned out this galumphing &quot;satire&quot; in which a yuppie is prosecuted for knocking down a black man in his car. Wow. Like, daring. Bret Easton Ellis' &quot;American Psycho&quot; was a far more visceral registration of 80s greed than Wolfe had the nerve to dream up. The best thing about this book is that it gave rise to a very bad but far more entertaining movie.You may be interested to know that National Alliance, an extreme right-wing group devoted to raising the consciousness of the white race, list this book on their website as recommended reading, along with &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot; and the works of Alfred Rosenberg. You can even buy it from their online bookshop (National Vanguard Books). I'm sure Mr. Wolfe would not be happy to learn this, but if he were a better writer they wouldn't have found so much in his work to admire. Just thought it was worth pointing out."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Bonfire may be the worst book I've attempted to read in the last five years. I say &quot;attempted&quot; because I finally became so disgusted with the thought of wasting another second of my life reading this wretched book, that I at last put it down for good.To be fair, Mr. Wolfe has an excellent grasp of the 1980's in New York, and from my own experience his descriptions of bond salesmen are pointedly accurate (allowing for slight artistic hyperbole). Unfortunately, his characters so totally fail to captivate any sypathy/interest/buy-in on the part of the reader, that I when I would pick up the book to read a chapter or two, I found myself questioning my own judgement....&quot;Why?&quot; Some may say that the shallowness of the characters is exactly what Mr. Wolfe intended -- a perfect fit for the terribly cliche view of the 80's as the decade of materialism. I believe that line of reasoning is just a poor excuse for bad character development. I feel no sympathy, distain or otherwise care at all about any of the characters or what happens to them. The only emotion cultivated by this text is one of disappointment that I bothered to read most of it.Bonfire stands as the only novel I've started and never finished. I came to a point where I decided it was better to cut my losses and ditch the book rather than invest any more time in it."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"This book was a painfully unbalanced story to read because of the ridiculousness of the story. I rate it two stars because the author at least kept me going to see how it comes out in the end.Mostly it is a statement of the author's perspective of rich Wall Street, the poor Bronx, the sad shape of New York's criminal justice system [obviously pre-Rudy G.] and everyone else who sees life only as a game. Every character is either abusive of the power they have, or jealous because they have none. The only redeeming and real character in this book was detective Martin [and perhaps that is only because the author didn't have time to poke fun at him too... or maybe he did and I didn't get it.].The author tries to make a hero out of a drunk, two-bit reporter. He was actually nothing more than a pawn used by others to minipulate public opinion. The main character, Sherman, is a successful, high-powered Wall Street bonds trader. One would expect him to have more intellegence. Sherman makes a lot of unbelievably stupid mistakes in his personal life that are impossibly contrary to his successful professional life. We are supposed to believe that he can read into the minds of the international bonds &quot;crowd&quot;, predict market futures, and minipulate complicated billion dollar deals, but is manipulated by a sexy gold-digger just because of her Southern charm?Oh, yes, there was one other believable character in this book - Sherman's 6-year-old daughter, Campbell. Poor thing... her parents love her, but are so weak, she will never grow up normal.I admit, I didn't realize this was supposed to be a satire until I read the reviews on this site. Had I known, I never would have bought the book. There is no one in the book a reader can (or would want to) identify with or feel sorry for.

I grew up in NYC during the 80's and I remember the fear and the bizarre crimes that took place then so I understood the climate that the book was written in but Tom Wolfe just dragged everything out to the point that I had to simply skim it to get through it.I know many people loved this book but I really felt it was dated and the writing was bland."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Perhaps I expected too much after hearing so many good things about this book. But I found it one of the most dull works of fiction I've ever read. I admit that Wolfe does has a prescient insight into the 80's greed mentality.

As before, it is quotable and readable and at times, hilariously funny. I'd vote for it as book of the decade except for the weak ending.

TW at his very best. After re-reading it, I am puttin git on my Christmas list for some unsuspecting neices and nephews who have likely not read it."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"It may take readers few chapters to acclimate themselves to the breakneck pace of The Bonfire of the Vanities, but the time is an investments that pays off in a wonderful, entertaining tale of an era that not too long ago provoked intense social discussion. Thomas Wolff's best seller evokes a period where New York City tried to crawl out of the fiscal doldrums of the mid to late 1970s. The Federal Reserve Board decided in 1979 to stop defending interest rates, which led to unprecedented trading in the bond market. Price was inversely related to interest rates, and firms that could price bonds properly in a time of fluctuating interest rates could make big money. Some of these professionals earned enormous amounts of money. This veneer of gold beside a decaying city provided the backdrop for Wolff's tale.The urban decay of the 1950s became an epidemic in the 1960s, then a fact of life in the 1970s. Cities may not have gotten worse in the 1970s, but its symptoms were more prevalent. New York City defaulted on some municipal bonds in 1975. It had a massive power outage in 1977, and Howard Cosell announced during a post-season game that the Bronx was burning due to a fire visible from Yankee Stadium. Though New York City has never been one to dwell on its historical sights, the seventies saw unprecedented dilapidation in Grant's Tomb and other landmarks. Most subway cars were plastered with graffiti.Within the city, small enclaves of wealth took foothold in areas such as Park Avenue and the Upper East Side. The Upper West Side had transformed from the area that Saul Bellow wrote about in the late 1950s to another yuppie haven. These residents still had many of the fears of the rest of the city that its former residents, who fled to the suburbs and elsewhere, wished to escape - particularly when they were not traveling in familiar areas. Sherman McCoy and Maria Ruskin exhibited those fears when they took a wrong turn off the Triboro bridge and ended up, probably, following the Bruckner expressway to somewhere in the Hunts Point neighborhood.The silence of the victim, Henry Lamb, is contrasted by the boisterous protests of Reverend Reginald Bacon, a character that Wolff merely borrowed from the Reverend Al Sharpton. Sharpton wasn't well-known during the setting of Bonfire of the Vanities, but he began to make a name for himself with his racially polarized stances on isolated cases of urban misunderstanding in the mid-1980s. Sharpton fed into sales of Wolff's book in 1987 when the reverend accepted the story of Tawana Brawley, and launched a furious campaign against the district attorneys of Westchester County for covering-up a crime. In fact, a hoax had been committed - and a jury ruled that Sharpton had known this, yet recklessly and maliciously attacked a junior prosecutor named Stephen Pagones for inaction. Pagones later won a substantial lawsuit against Sharpton, who never paid, claiming indigence.The victim's mother, Annie Lamb, was a member of Bacon's church, and came to the Reverend with the story of her son hit by a Mercedes and lying in intensive care while the driver of the car fled the scene. Sherman McCoy did flee the scene, because he thought the two boys were up to no good. It wasn't necessarily Lamb that put fear into Sherman and Maria; it was the large boy in the Celtics jacket who was with Henry at the time. The actions of the yuppies are not too far removed from what many people would have done in the same situation. A friend of mine told me a story about a carjacking in Overton - in Miami - which began when someone ran in front of the car, forcing the driver to slam on the breaks. The car was then attacked by several others in cahoots with the man who ran in front of the car to stop it. The moral of his story was that his father should have run the guy over and gotten the hell out. Nobody wants to be a hit-and-run driver, but nobody wants to be robbed, either. It is a thought-provoking dilemma.The Lamb Case was publicized by an alcoholic reporter in a small local paper that hadn't written a good story in several years. Peter Fallow was destined to be fired from the City Light for ineffectiveness at his job, and his personal life consisted of mooching free drinks and food at a local pub by finding a sucker to get stuck with the bill. If Fallow woke before noontime, it was because someone woke him up. This story was a remarkable boost to his career - in fact, we learn at the end just how far he could run with the story.A number of coincidences must occur before this case can get any traction - and, remarkably, they do! For example, Maria is having an affair with an artist, Filippo Chirazzi, while she is entertaining McCoy. This artist also knew Caroline Heftshank, one of the Brits who frequented Leicester's, a local hangout of Brits in America. When he failed to call Caroline, whose interest in the artist failed to match his interest in her, she told Peter Fallow about the artist's involvement with Maria and some conversations that linked Maria to Sherman McCoy.Nearly every character in the story has an ulterior motive, and how these play out is a remarkable social statement of the decade. The power-broker becomes a scared, witless dolt. The beauty with the brown-lipstick distracts the married assistant prosecutor. Even a simple matter of speech is laden with innuendo. Wolff captures the decade in one compelling, impossible-to-put-down story that ought to appeal to anyone."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"I read &quot;A Man in Full&quot; before &quot;Bonfire&quot;.

While some choose to focus on hating Sherman McCoy and what he represents, I choose to focus on the morally bankrupt media and &quot;Reverend&quot; Bacon aspects of this magnificent morality play. Today the media is driven by the credo &quot;while the facts may be interesting, they are irrelevant&quot; when a story such as this explodes across the headlines. Reverand Baconesque characters are given legitimacy and muggers are portrayed as altar boys and honor students in the media's zeal to create a story by tearing down heretofore legitimate institutions and/or people. While some readers complain about the ending of this book I do not. The book ends a lot like real life. There is no closure, there are no pat and easy endings. Only a struggle to get thru the day and the day after that. Sherman McCoy abandons all pretensions after hitting rock bottom and, instead of crawling into a hole and dying, he rededicates himself to redemption regardless of the cost. I like the man Sherman McCoy became."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"I loved Liar's Poker, by Michael Lewis, and was told repeatedly to pick up Bonfire. I'm glad I did. I do have to agree with other reviewers which point to the ending's weakness. Wolfe did seem to just abruptly end the story. While it lasted, however, it kept me laughing..One thing, definately not for people who don't appreciate black humor..."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Outstanding! The story at first seems to meander, but even Wolfe's seemingly innocuous first 3 chapters serve their purpose. Sherman McCoy is such a completely self-centered, sheltered, wealthy individual that the mere sight of a young black male in his posh Manhattan neighborhood practically gives him a panic attack. Wolfe also skillfully shows how the sophisticated, Yale-educated stockbroker Sherman is reduced to a hormone-ridden high-school boy at the prospect of a secret rendezvous with his sexy, desirable young mistress, Maria. His bumbling phone call to his wife Judy prepares us for exactly how poorly he will be prepared to handle any events that deviate even slightly from his closed, insular life. The other 3 main characters are just as sharply drawn. Larry Kramer is the poor man's Sherman McCoy. Just as Sherman risks everything he has, including his marriage, for a woman he lusts over, Kramer does the same, risking the opportunity of a lifetime to act out on his! ! unfulfilled fantasies of &quot;the girl with the brown lipstick&quot;. Reverend Bacon, an obvious parody of Al Sharpton, is shown in all of his self-righteous posturing and slick insincerity (his motivations in &quot;helping victims&quot; are less than pure). Peter Fallow, the British tabloid &quot;journalist&quot;, is a first-rate opportunist who uses other people's tragedies to save his flagging career (he's desperate to get the &quot;Big Story&quot;, truth be damned, since he's about to be fired for his habitual drunkenness). His snobbery about the crude &quot;Yanks&quot; provide a lot of the humor; as much as he reviles Americans, he is not averse to mooching dinners and drinks from them. One of the funniest chapters consists of his dinner with Maria's tycoon husband. The finest creation of the secondary characters is Myron &quot;Mike&quot; Kovitsky, the no-nonsense judge who won't buckle under to the pressures of popular demand. His manner in dealing with the caged crimi! ! nals, for instance, is a classic: he gets down to their lev! el of cat-calling in his own unique, vulgar way. This stubborn trait never changes throughout the novel; he is perhaps the only truly noble character to be found. I wish there had been more memorable female characters; as it is, Maria is the only stand-out among the &quot;social X-rays and lemon tarts&quot;, including Judy McCoy (I would have liked to see her character expanded). Predictably, Maria plays a large part in the resulting comic tragedy and shows herself to be completely self-centered, utterly without a conscience and purely carnal in her instincts. Maria, not the sterotypical fragile Southern belle she at first appears to be, is not easily intimidated and proves to be much more of a ruthless cut-throat than Sherman the Scheming Stockbroker, who soon falls apart at work as well as in his personal life. The satire is first-rate, although some of the &quot;privileged party&quot; scenes are occasionally dragged out too long. Wolfe shows that there is no limit or except! ! ions to greed and opportunism in any class line, from the blacks in the Bronx to the WASP-y Manhattan socialites to the British tabloid &quot;sleaze journalists&quot;. Some people have suggested that the epilogue was a cop-out; I happened to like it, because it provided a bit of realism to the satire. Especially observe how Sherman, as an accused criminal, is the toast of Manhattan, and after his trial, appears to have been deserted."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"This is arguably the best American novel of all time. I recently had the pleasure of rereading it, and was thrilled anew at the way the dirt of the American Way is so shamelessly and so gleefully exposed. Wolfe writes with such zest, such pleasure, you can almost hear him laughing as he types the last period. The modern pretenders to the throne, such as Stuart Woods (and his odious &quot;Dirt&quot;) et al., are hardly able to compare to the Walker Percy-like insight Wolfe has into the distinct voices that comprise America."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Wolfe's innovative descriptions of the '80s New York culture is the strength of this novel, yet is not enough to excuse the completely disappointing epilogue. Apparently pulled from another story, this ending contradicts all evidence and character development that 99% of the wordage strove to build. Attempts at making a statement about racism, politics, and justice is thrown out in leiu of a disappointing synopsis that downplays every sympathetic character while the story's villians prosper against all reason. The epilogue offers no resolution, and thus, makes no statement. Imagine sitting through every day of the O.J. Simpson trial and being deprived of a verdict. Fortunately, Wolfe's style makes the bulk of the reading easy enough to digest, but in the end you have to wonder why this book was ever written."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"UNTIL THE ENDING/EPILOGUE THIS WAS &quot;THE BEST BOOK I EVER READ.&quot; UNBELIEVABLY SUSPENSFUL AND INSIGHTFUL, MY HEART WAS ACTUALLY POUNDING WHILE I READ THE BOOK. BUT MR. WOLFE SHOULD HAVE STOPPED BEFORE THE EPILOGUE. TO THAT POINT A POWERFUL STATEMENT HAD BEEN MADE AND SHERMAN MCCOY AND HAD BEEN EXONERATED FROM A CRIME HE DID NOT COMMIT. AFTER THE EPILOGUE, THERE IS NO CONCLUSIVE ENDING, ALTHOUGH IT IS OBVIOUS, THAT IN FEAR OF BAD REACTIONS FROM THE BLACKS, MR. WOLFE HAS WEASELED OUT AND MADE IT APPARENT THAT THE LAWYERLESS MR. MCCOY WOULD LIKELY BE UNJUSTLY CONVICTED AND SPEND 8 TO 25 IN JAIL AND MARIA, THE GOLDDIGGER AND REAL CRIMINAL WOULD ROAM THE WORLD UNSCATHED."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"I do not think an author puts more into his books than Wolfe. This is a story so much more than about the greedy 80's. As you are reading you are saying to yourself exactly what Wolfe saids seconds later, as if he is in your mind. Its about political correctness gone awry. And its so \\"New York City\\" and you have to live and work there to totally see how Wolfe is so accurate even 20 years later.Sadly now as you read this great novel, you think to the disaster of a movie. So altered and so miscast. And reading about the making of the movie, the same fictional pressures of politically correctness in the book hampered the actual movie. For example Morgan Freeman's a great actor but his character is totally different than the book. This is a movie that SHOULD BE RE-MADE.In any event The Bonefire of the Vanities is a MUST read."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Beginning this novel, I knew its reputation and its basic plot, but right off I feared I would despise this novel because of the horrible things that Sherman McCoy puts his wife Judy and daughter Campbell through.This novel is really about characters, primarly McCoy and to a lesser degree Larry Kramer, the DA. Yet Wolfe also devotes large chunks to Peter Fallow, the tabloid drunk journalist, and Reverand Bacon, the scheming civil rights leader.As the novel opens, McCoy is a selfish louse who views himself as a Master of the Universe in his position as a bond salesman. He also is cheating on his wife and lusts after other moms at his daughter's bus stop. McCoy is a bad man. But circumstances take over and other people, acting realistically, (like Kramer the DA and Fallow the journalist) and in their own self-interests begin to do things that on the surface are right, but end up attacking McCoy's sheltered life.As the novel progresses, McCoy became a more sympathetic man. One reviewer said they felt cheated because McCoy never changed until the final 2 pages and it would have been much better if he had changed some during the course of the novel. But I think McCoy began to change the moment he spent a few hours in jail. At that time, he needed Judy to be with him and tried to reach out to her, but his behavior previously had kept her from being supportive of him. Campbell was also affected by McCoy but not permanently.In this character driven novel, there aren't good guys or bad guys, just normal people acting selfishly and predictably and these situations ultimately force Sherman Mccoy to realize what is important in life before it is too late."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"This book is one of the most enjoyable books that I've read. With great characters and descriptions, it is definetely a masterpiece.The characters in the novel are downright brilliant. Each has his or her flaws, and Wolfe shows those, but not with too much severity, instead showing that we are all equal in our flaws.The description in this book, though sometimes too much, too long, and repetitive, is generally very good and paints a beatiful picture of the scene in your mind.The plot is very involved, but not so much that it confuses you, and more than enough to keep you interested. The ending is very surprising and very riveting, and is a perfect ending to a already great book.Highly recommended to all."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"'Bonfire of the Vanities' is a quintessential novel of the contemporary era not only for its literary craft, but also for its insight into the modern-day social system. Wolf accurately depicts this system on all fronts. The social interaction between economic classes, the growing problems (maybe even failure) of politics and justice as vehicles of freedom and democracy, and the powerful control of consumerism over us all are themes of the book underlying a story masterfully written from a number of the characters' perspectives. You start to feel the strengths and weaknesses of each character, realizing how human nature and illusions of grandeur make us all into people we never thought we'd become.Being a big Easton Ellis fan, I thought the descriptive writing in this book was far from excessive and only illustrated some of its themes of materialism. It's also probably one of the fastest (substantive) 700 pages I've ever read. Don't count on the film for anything but a good laugh.Regardless, you will be more enlightened after readiing this book."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe does a wonderful job of displaying true feelings and thoughts to the reader in this unique story of the true realities of life in New York City.One of the merits of the book is how easily you can relate to the characters, how truely real they are and how real they react to each situation is how many of us could see ourselves reacting to the same situation. He does this by having people deal with things that they think about only in their heads, but would never say out loud. Another merit of the book is the ability of the author to create a true essence of New York City and of the American way. At the beginning of the book the author descibes a situation taking place in the heart of New York City. \\"Half full! Half consumed!Somebody has just thrown a half-eaten jar of Hellman's mayonaise at him (the Mayor)!\\" The idea that the author has the object that is thrown be something so real something that we all know and all use, shows how American and how normal the author's ideas are so that the reader is able to relate.One weakness of the book is how nothing seems to ever turn out right. That is not real lfe and in that aspect the story is never very fulfilling until the end, when by the time you finally get there and after all the bad things you've gone through with the characters it doesn't quite seem like enough good to fulfill the reader with in the end. It lacks the aspect of true happiness in the reader, making you think that life is all full of bad things and there is no hope for the good in people. And by the time you finally reach the good, it is so unexpected and uncommon that you don't even eralize it is there. You have to go through a tremendous amount of pain and hatred and it doesn't seem the happiness is worth all the pain.Overall i think that the book was very long and had a lot of unecessary detail the reader could have lived without. I only suggest this book if you are willing to face your own mind and the thoughts that you keep inside. It is very prejudice and stereotypical, but tHat is what makes it as good as it is."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"The first thing that struck me, after reading a synopsis of Bonfire, is that its impetus is similar to the climax of The Great Gatsby. Given this connection, we can look at these two novels in the context in which they are written. The Great Gatsby is considered by some to be &quot;the great American novel,&quot; trying to encapsulate a time in the country's history. Jay Gatsby creates a wealthy identity for himself, appearing out of nowhere to claim his love, Daisy. Vehicular manslaugther ends their love. Sherman McCoy, in contrast, is born wealthy. Vehicular manslaughter ends his fun, which I hesitate to call love. Lust is probably more appropriate. This is only the beginning of the novel, and we watch his entire downfall unfold. So the two main contrasting ideas are what Jay and Sherman's motivations are (love versus lust) and what the focus of their lives in the novels are (love versus downfall). These are important things to think about when reading these novels and considering what each author might be trying to say about the period they are writing in. I also want to comment briefly on a few reasons some readers really dislike this novel. First, none of the main characters are admirable. There is definetly no one to latch on to as a moral center. Don't read on in hope of finding someone, but do read on anyway. Second, the entire society we are viewing is corrupt. There is no way to place blame on any single person or group in the novel. Be careful while reading and I hope that at the end, you are satisfied that everyone is equally at fault. I don't think Wolfe intended for his novel to place blame."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Somehow I'd missed reading Bonfire of the Vanities back when it came out. Now I see why it's considered a modern classic. Wolfe's characters are richly drawn composites of how I picture the ultra rich Wall Street traders, contrasted with the whole other world of the South Bronx. Although I've never been there or done that, I can relate to these characters and the fascinating situation that unfolds when their world's collide. Sherman, his wife and mistress, assistant D.A. Kramer and all the rest are so consumed with lust for power and position that their fall from grace seems appropriate; after all, what does really matter in life? The preoccupation with wealth, status and the pretenses of success all come tumbling down. I look forward now to reading more Tom Wolfe; I see what all the fuss is about."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"So, I am finally reading this book by Tom Wolfe; my sister just highly recommended to me \\"The Electric Koolaid Acid Test\\", which I ordered at my library to read. Glad I found \\"Bonfire\\" on the shelf in the meantime, and to have finally started on Tom Wolfe. OMG, I am so glad I am finally reading this novel. It is beyond sophisticated and beyond hilarious (any author who makes me bust out laughing like a hyena anyway I know immediately is wonderful); what an indictment of so much of the culture and style of the '80's. Reading this novel, I think I am able to see so much (good) about the author - his culture, humor, intellect and thinking, just shining through this brilliant novel. Especially if you have grown up on the East Coast, you immediately get the style and sophistication of this writing (maybe somewhat similar too I think to the great detective writing of someone like Raymond Chandler (?). Anyway, I do not want this book to end, I am so entranced; I am LOVING Tom Wolfe!"},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Even though this was written 30 years ago, i still found it fascinating.

Truer now than when it was written. A harsh look in the mirror for us all."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"A farm kid from Upstate New York, I grew up thinking of New York City as a place to be afraid of. I never went there, of course, but according to TV -- well, excluding Seinfeld -- and the movies, it was a jagged skyline towering above a huge steaming cesspool, where it was always nighttime and horrifying things happened to people. But as I got older and bored with my home county, that image began to appeal to me, and it's ultimately what brought me here.It was that same city -- the dim grimy hole of crime and perversion, the New York of the 1980s -- that appealed to Tom Wolfe and inspired him to write 'The Bonfire of the Vanities.' Born into a genteel Virginia family, Wolfe has always been obsessed with race and class, and 'Bonfire' depicts a divided city: ethnically, politically and geographically. According to Wolfe's demographic map, in Manhattan below 96th Street is the insulated upper class of WASPs, who rarely set foot on the streets of their city. They live far above in high-rises and get ferried to and from work in taxi cabs. Also on the island are the Jews, who, after generations of struggle hold most of the positions in the city government but find power slipping from their grasp as New York demographically darkens. Then there are the masses of impoverished blacks and Puerto Ricans holding the upper half of Manhattan and nearly all of the Bronx and Brooklyn. It's clear from early in the novel that the future of the city is theirs: Riverdale is \\"a little freeport\\"; Brooklyn Heights and Park Slope \\"Hong Kongs\\"; the Bronx County Building is repeatedly called \\"Gibraltar.\\" For now they're getting chewed up by the justice system, but inevitably they'll organize and take the city. Acting as a buffer are the Queens-based lower-middle class Irish and, to a lesser degree, Italians who run the police and hold minor jobs in the city courts. Finally, there's the bohemian British expatriate community, in control of much of the city's press and motivated mainly by their contempt for Americans.In terms of plot, Bonfire is the story of Sherman McCoy, a Wall Street bond trader from Park Avenue on the Upper East Side, born rich and getting richer. One night, while escorting his mistress from LaGuardia airport in his Mercedes-Benz, McCoy gets stuck in the wrong lane on the Grand Central Parkway and finds himself in the South Bronx. There he gets into a hit-and-run with a black high schooler that isn't entirely his fault. A good chunk of the book just consists of McCoy trembling over whether he'll get caught. But the boy's mother goes to the Reverend Bacon -- an Al Sharpton-style rabble-rouser who bends idealistic rhetoric to the purposes of intimidation and extortion -- and Bacon goes to the police.The case lands in the lap of Lawrence Kramer, a Bronx assistant DA (one of hundreds) feeling trapped in his job and small apartment, sick of anonymity and tired of prosecuting young blacks and Puerto Ricans. However, Kramer doesn't fully realize what he has until Bacon's lawyer brings the story to Peter Fallow, an alcoholic English reporter on the verge of losing his job. When it breaks in the press, the police trace the crime back to McCoy and the car accident off Bruckner Boulevard becomes a collision of every faction in New York City. Black and Puerto Rican protestors storm Park Avenue. McCoy is dragged into a jail cell in the Bronx. The justice system revels in finally having a WASP in its teeth. Faced with a rallying block of minority voters, the Jewish politicians have no choice but to condemn the rich bond trader. McCoy hires a street-smart Irish attorney named Tommy Killian, who acquaints him with the seamier sides of the law. Ultimately, McCoy lets himself sink and embraces the violence and seediness of New York City.If done as a drama 'Bonfire' would be painfully overwrought. But Wolfe is a satirist, and the book's outrageousness is all for the sake of comedy. The opening chapter with the mayor, the descriptions of high-class parties, of the protests, of the all-out brawl in the courtroom, of just about every scene involving Killian, are so over-the-top that the reader has to laugh. The book is also a kind of prophecy: in the '80s, an encounter like McCoy's \\"fracas in the jungle\\" probably seemed inevitable; the contradiction of the city's incredible wealth and unfathomable poverty was too great, it had to be resolved somehow. From Wolfe's perspective, as the white working class bled out of New York, the democratic process would leave the blacks and Puerto Ricans in charge, exposing the elite to the raw reality of their \\"Third World city.\\"Of course, as I -- and countless others who've come to New York with the vision of a drippy, neon-lit metropolis -- found, that prediction proved completely wrong. In the '90s, crime was fiercely suppressed. The rich whites are richer than ever. New York has another Jewish mayor, now in his third term. Black and Puerto Rican communities are caught in a pincer between gentrification and the influx of Dominican, Mexican and Chinese immigrants. And while few neighborhoods have a strong Irish character anymore, and Italians are ceding their old strongholds in Brooklyn and Queens, the city has a growing population of white working class Eastern Europeans.Which brings us to the question of the book's literary merits. Wolfe declared in 1989 that he'd revived the great realist tradition of the late 1800s and early 20th Century. But Bonfire is too much a portrait of a specific time and place and not enough of a novel. The book's leading men -- McCoy, Kramer, Bacon, Fallow -- are more or less the same character: vain, arrogant, sleazy, hungry for glory. Reading their interior monologues is a bit like watching a puppet show where all the dolls have the same voice. Some Internet troll will probably argue that Wolfe was trying to show the universality of certain human tendencies, but it's idiotic to think that people from such disparate backgrounds would have identical personalities. McCoy's third act conversion to a tough guy comes off as childish, and the plot is altogether too dependent on coincidence.New York is amorphous and unpredictable, and any book whose main virtue is describing it accurately is doomed to be short-lived. 'Bonfire' is like an old Polaroid: blurring, curling at the edges, slowly turning brown and falling apart -- a reminder of the impermanence of things and of how shallow pictures really are. Like me, most people who glance at it today probably do so out of nostalgia for the dirty, gritty old city. Topical writers like Charles Dickens and John Steinbeck have endured because of their wide appeal and deep humanity. But Wolfe's writing isn't as powerful as Steinbeck's, and his characters lack the warmth and charm of Dickens'. Even though Dickens' London and Steinbeck's California have long vanished, in 100 years -- assuming anyone is still reading -- 'Great Expectations' and 'Of Mice and Men' will continue to enjoy broad audiences. But as Tom Wolfe's New York fades out of memory, 'The Bonfire of the Vanities' will likely do the same.(...)"},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"When entering the competitive, cut-throat professional world, where stories abound of the dorm-mate who just landed the six figure job at Goldman Sachs, \\"The Bonfire of the Vanities\\" just may help you maintain the precious altruism that you grew up with.This book is honest. It's a story of how people become when they allow their ego to be defined by their over-compensation, and it's not pretty. 'Bonfire' is witty and human. Mr. Wolfe does a fantastic job of developing his characters into people you'll care about, and builds their stories until you'll just cringe over the situations they put themselves into. In the end you'll thank God you're not them."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"On the surface, the book is a satire of the puffed up 80s. The &quot;Vanities&quot; that are being blown up are all the pretensions that people put around themselves. Sherman McCoy is a man who would've exuded strength and power in a prior age. But is he a &quot;Master of the Universe&quot; bond trader (a term coined by Tom Wolfe, later to make it into the popular lexicon) or just another fluffed up product of society? Indeed, the book explores this question. You'll be surprised by the answer!Is it just a novel of the 80s? I disagree, for several reasons...- The greed of the 80s reappeared in the past 5 years.- If you look hard enough, one of the characters in the book is running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004.- The deep characters Wolfe creates ring true today.- New York again sees itself in a time of great change. Maybe there are lessons in this literature?Is it the Great American Novel? Who knows... But it can be read with &quot;A Man in Full&quot; to understand grit, determination and what does make America different."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Perhaps the thing that struck me most about this novel was the fact that even if it was a \\"period\\" piece of the 1980s, it was shockingly similar to the society of the turn of the 21st century, right before the tech-bubble burst. In 20 years, it amazes me how much--and at the same time how *little*--has really changed. One might almost expect Sherman McCoy to pull out a miniaturized cell phone to bid on some shares of Enron rather than the Giscard bonds he was involved with. I felt, reading this book for the first time in the 21st century, that it might as well be the society of today under Mr. Wolfe's satirical scrutiny.The racially, politically charged media circus surrounding his arrest is perhaps now an even more familiar phenomenon than it would have been in the 1980s--something to which we as a society are becoming increasingly numb to. As the situation grows, and spirals further out of control, Mr. Wolfe makes it increasingly harder on the reader to land squarely on one side or another--on one hand we have the unjust death of a promising Bronx student, and on the other, we have the case being used by various people trying to further their public careers. One even begins to feel sympathy for the calculating, womanizing Sherman McCoy as his perfectly ordered life comes completely unraveled. And then we as readers become repulsed by such feelings--which is truly the \\"right\\" feeling in a situation like this? There is no black or white here (yes, that remark is meant on many levels)--only a confusing, boundless field of grey. And that seems to be at the core of Mr. Wolfe's purpose in writing this...it is an unflinching look at a society that seems to verge upon the completely amoral.With regards to its \\"unflinching\\" nature, some readers may at first be put off by the extreme bluntness with which Mr. Wolfe tells his story. Epithets and \\"outdated\\" social and cultural attitudes abound, and Mr. Wolfe doesn't shy away from the harshest, ugliest possible terms for them. And this very bluntness is perhaps what makes The Bonfire of the Vanities so compelling to me as a reader. We live in a society that has smothered itself by political correctness--a society where despite seeming openness, the lines of communication are really quite tightly controlled by that strange convention. To see the veneer of civilization completely ripped away from the society of the 1980s (and, one might imagine, from the very society in which we live now) is at once a repulsive and refreshing experience-- this is perhaps one of the best modern novels I have ever read, fully deserving of its 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe's kinetic style of writing takes some getting used to. He piles words on top of words, images on top of images, flinging them all at the reader with a fastball pitch. The pitch, though, is well-thrown.Wolfe's subject is New York City during the 1980s. He touches as many groups as he can -- wealthy Upper East Side socialites, tabloid journalists, criminals and burnt-out agents of justice in the Bronx, cut-throat sleazy lawyers, unscrupulous Wall Street stockbrokers... No class of people escapes having its faults exposed in Wolfe's sharp, accurate prose.Wolfe is sociologist first, novelist second. He probes the psychology of all these disparate groups and finds a common denominator: selfishness. All people are out for themselves no matter who is destroyed along the way.At the same time he satirizes the dark side of the human experience, Wolfe makes it impossible to hate any of the characters. There is no true villain in this story. As readers, we are left with just the uncomfortable sensation of recognizing human nature's ugly parts.&quot;How much differently would you act in this situation?&quot; is Wolfe's implicit question. There are no easy answers."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"As my title states, a smart person doesn't make a great writer of fiction. Through reading this novel I saw that Wolfe a lot of interesting ideas and is a rather well-studied individual, but his execution in this novel his terrible. He repeatedly destroys the momentum of the story with excessive detail. I found that I could often times skip fifteen pages and not miss anything but more pointless rambling about things that add nothing to the story. For example, Wolfe would often give us the salary of a character, then list how much he spends a month for food, clothes, cars, etc. There is another point where he goes into a irrelevant discussion about Christopher Marlowe. I could picture Wolfe jumping up and down, shouting, \\"HEY, LOOK WHAT I KNOW! I CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT EARLY MODERN ENGLISH DRAMATISTS!!\\" Also, while I understand that this is a satire, the character development is poor and there is not a single individual that the reader can bring themselves to feel sorry for except for Henry Lamb and his mother. The rest of the time you feel like you are just reading about a bunch of selfish bigots. This could have been an engaging novel about the socio-political situation in New York City in the late 1980s. But instead it turned into a self-indulgent monstrosity.However, I would love to attend a lecture given by Wolfe. He seems like he would be an interesting person to listen to. But as a writer of fiction, he just doesn't cut it for me."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"\\"The Bonfire of the Vanities\\" by Tom WolfeNew York City, early 1980's; Sherman McCoy, a self proclaimed \\"Master of the universe\\" had it all. A loving family, a multi-million dollar Park Avenue apartment and he is the top producing bond salesman for a Wall Street firm which pays him 1 million dollars a year and more if he can close his latest deal. This wasn't enough for Sherman though; he needed, no, deserved more. He is a master of the universe after all. Sherman became involved in an extra marital affair which he deserved and after a wrong turn ends up on the wrong side of the law. Maybe Sherman isn't the Master of the universe he had initially believed...Bonfire made for a great read and Wolfe seems to have really captured the essence of that era. The characters be they the richest of the rich or barely able to afford their one bedroom apartment are all driven by their ego and Wolfe has captured this masterfully. Watching these characters and their rise or fall is what makes this story an interesting read.The Good: Wolfe writes great characters and throughout the story we see some of them go through a complete evolution. None of the characters garner much sympathy from the reader out of the gate but as the story goes on that changes dramatically and by the end you may even find yourself feeling sorry for some them. The lifestyles captured are fascinating if for no other reason that to see how the super wealthy flaunt their power and influence and how no matter how much you make you can still be tapped out.The Bad: The story does feel a little long winded at times but not to the point of ruination.Overall: Wolfe's ability to draw and evolve interesting characters is what makes this journey worth taking. If it sounds interesting then pick it up and give it a try."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Although I have enjoyed some of Tom Wolfe's early nonfiction work, Bonfire languished on my shelf, unread, for several years. For some reason, I had dry and boring in mind for this book, which turn out patently untrue.To the reader who expects a true picture of gritty life in a big city, or a real picture of relations between groups of people, as other reviewers have called this, look elsewhere! Bonfire is satire...it is exaggeration...it is a farce.Great truths, however, often lie in humor. Wolfe has created a world where the reader manages to despise just about every character. You may be at least indifferent to the cops, or Fitzgibbon, the assistant DA who still seems to have his head on straight, but these characters just provide enough temperance to remind you how you hate everyone else.Wolfe's use of the English language is something like Shakespeare meets tabloid journalist, and his verbiage never fails to trigger an emotion, or two, often laughter and anger or despair at the same time.I often found I could not put the book down, but unfortunately,it seemed at the moments of highest suspense, the wordiness begins to drag, slowing the pace to a crawl, when you'd most like to fly."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"In all 31 flavors of \\"Law and Order on TV, the NYPD and DA's office disposes of a case from the incident to the trial in an hour--sometimes two if it's a two-part episode. In \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" Tom Wolfe does the same thing in about 700 pages. That's because Wolfe brings to bear all the complexities of trying a case in the real world.In the mid-1980s, Sherman McCoy is a bond salesman at Pierce & Pierce, a self-described \\"Master of the Universe\\" with a three million-dollar apartment on Park Avenue, a wife who spends thousands on decorating it, a six-year-old daughter who attends a pricey private school, and a mistress named Maria Ruskin, who herself is wealthy from marrying a much-older man. One night Sherman goes to pick Maria up at the airport and their Mercedes Benz becomes lost on the seedy streets of the Bronx. They're approached by two black kids, and from there the \\"Master of the Universe\\" becomes an unwitting pawn of a black \\"reverend\\" hungry for publicity, a drunken British reporter hungry for a story, and a Bronx DA hungry for re-election. Because in the real world, cases aren't solved in an hour and \\"justice\\" is a game won or lost based on who can cheat the most and get away with it.Like an ancient Greek tragedy, McCoy has to pay for his hubris. So do some of the other characters, although others are seemingly rewarded for their bad behavior. This is certainly not a novel of white hats and black hats where the good guys triumph and the bad guys get their just reward. If you want that, you'd better stick to the TV.What Wolfe does so well with this book is to paint the \\"big picture\\" of New York City in the 1980s with its melting pot of Irish, Italians, Jews, blacks, Puerto Ricans, and Wasps. All of these rival factions collide with the McCoy case to depict not just the justice system, but society as a whole. It's an unflattering image to say the least, even viewed through the prism of satire. More importantly, the image of black against white and rich against poor is still applicable today in America's major cities. That makes Wolfe's book as relevant today as it was back in the \`80s.Wolfe's writing itself can get a little tedious and long-winded at times. There are so many nuances and complexities and tangents going on throughout the book. While these provide richness and depth, at some point it becomes overkill. The stuff about the mayor and the Episcopal Church was interesting, but not really necessary. As well there are...so many ellipses...and exclamation points! It can be a little irritating after 700 pages.Still, it's a relatively minor flaw in what is a great book that even at 700 pages shouldn't take too long to read because it's so funny and clever that it's hard to put down. I had previously read Wolfe's \\"Man in Full\\" that came out ten years after \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" and has many of the similar themes of race, class, and a rich man in legal peril, though it takes place in Atlanta instead of New York. I'd recommend that book as well.As for the 1990 movie of \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" it pretty much makes every critic's worst list, so I wouldn't recommend that. The movie does stick to at least most of the book's main points. In its defense, it would be impossible to depict all the subtleties and nuances of Wolfe's novel on the big screen. Trying to adapt it really was an impossible mission.That is all..."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"When I first read this book, I didn't like it. It did grow on me and in retrospect I saw it was some of the best satire done in decades. But I think the actual book itself is so heavy and so full of genuinely mercenary and dishonorable people that it makes you want to hold it at arm's length. This is a tough read, and it dwells in themes that by nature are not pleasant. What it DOES achieve is an ultra-realistic (and growing moreso by the year) illustration of how society really works."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Woolf is a genius -- this is one of the most enjoyable and interesting novels you may ever read. No where has the ego and greed of Wall Street in its heyday been so exposed along with all the conventions and pretenses of the newly rich and famous. Few readers will forget the opening page with &quot;Shuuuurmen&quot; blaring out. The characters are unforgettable and Woolf is an absolute genius at capturing detail in both his dialogue and description. One of my favorite all time novels. At once fun, and great literature."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"I've only read the first 100 pages and the book is excellent.

If you appreciate puzzles you may like this version, but if you actually want to know the story as Tom Wolfe intended it, you should skip this version and anything published by General Books LLC."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Prior to actually reading it, my understanding of Bonfire was that it's one of those \\"must reads\\" for any self proclaimed American bibliophile because it is a landmark piece of cultural satire. Now that I've read it I can say that in no way does this book live up to ANY of its hype.Although this is not the first time this has happened, it never ceases to irritate me when I walk away from a book with no actual \\"walk aways\\", ie, \\"what a GREAT story!\\" or \\"did not see that twist coming\\", or \\"I need a moment alone...those sex scenes were ridiculous!\\" After finish Bonfire, my only thought was, \\"ok, so what?\\" The story takes place in NYC circa the 80's. The focal character is a quintessential, self made yuppie, Wall Street bonds trader whose life comes crumbling down after he's involved in an unfortunate late night encounter in the Bronx, apparently the borough from hell during this decade. What ensues is a strange smattering of social clich&eacute;s with little cultural context (I would've loved more references to the political and pop culture landscapes of the time) and zero character development. I suppose you could draw some parallels with greed of Wall Street then to the all out corruption of Wall Street today but when the author seemingly has no opinion about it, there is nothing the reader can do with it.In short, this is 685 pages you could be spending elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"I am a foreigner, and after reading this book halfway, I asked myself, \\"Gee, is this the way New Yorkers talk? Using the 'F' word most of the time? This is not what I've seen on TV and in the movies.\\" Several scenes are also unconvincing. Top of the list is when Sherman McCoy tries to drag his dashshund into the rain but the mutt resists. Having owned a daschund before, I know it's not the kind of titanic struggle that Wolfe describes. The party scene where NY's socialites boorishly laugh \\"Hack hack hack Haw haw haw\\" is also incredulous. The author also injects too much details into both setting and characters. Even an ashtry is described vividly : \\".. and with his right, he put the cigarette out in a Lalique ashtray with a lion's head sculpted on the rim.\\" The plot (which revolves around a hit-and-run accident) is too weak to carry the weight of more than 100,000 words in its 680 pages. When I reached chapter 23, I skipped the remaining 8 chapters and jumped to the epilogue just to find out the fate of the protagonist. Wolfe's style of writing is not my taste."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"This company was very fast in getting my book to me.

It's hard for someone like me to imagine going broke on one million dollars a year, but it appears that in New York high society, it's very possible. The descriptions of the society matrons and trophy wives were hilarious -- that was pretty much my favorite part of the book. Although I enjoyed most of the character depiction, there were parts where the book really dragged. I hate it when I have to force myself to read the whole chapter and not skip pages because I'm afraid of missing something. All in all, a good book, but the endless depictions of New York City life and surroundings were a little much. In the end, I could have skipped not only pages, but whole chapters, because the outcome was nothing out of the ordinary."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"This formulaic novel is fast-moving (except for Chapter 15.) It also provides insights on human nature and the sociology of New York City, circa 1987.Unfortunately, the plot breaks down near the end, in Chapter 31. The riot scene in the courtroom seems unrealistic, as does Sherman McCoy's too sudden transformation from petrified Wall Street elite to a guy ready to take on everyone in the Bronx.The story, which progresses steadily and surely through the first 30 chapters, comes to a too easily wrought end with the equivalent of a roaring car chase rather than by bringing all of the strands of the story together at trial.At the risk of seeming vain, and although still following the formulaic structure, I believe Wolfe would have been better served by the following outline for an ending:The case goes to trial ... Kramer argues the State's case ... Maria Ruskin testifies against McCoy ... Roland Auburn testifies against McCoy ... Killian plays the tapes ... Judge Kovitsky discovers that Killian and McCoy have tried to get a crucial tape of a conversation between Ruskin and McCoy into evidence despite knowing it was illegally made ... Peter Fallow makes headline news of all of this and Reverend Bacon states that vindication is at hand ... just when all seems lost for McCoy,Henry Lamb awakens from his coma, and being the honest, college-bound kid he is, testifies that Ruskin and Auburn lied about how he got hurt ... the rest of the newspapers and TV stationsin NYC jump on this news, crucifying Fallow's reporting, Bacon's posturing, and Kramer's baseless prosecution ... now comes the verdict: not guilty ... Maria Ruskin is convicted of perjury and perhaps it looks like she'll lose her fortune gained from marrying the geriatric and now-deceased Arthur Ruskin ... Auburn is also convicted of perjury, his plea deal is cooked and he is sent to Rikers for all of his prior offenses ... Fallow is fired and finished in journalism: he returns to England to rot in his alcoholic stew ... Kramer keeps the job he so hated before taking on the McCoy case, never again the star in the D.A.'s office and with even less of a chance of getting a job like the high-paying kind in a Wall Street firm he so envies; Kramer's nascent affair isn't discovered, but the girl with brown lipstick won't have anything more to do with him ... McCoy no longer must fear being thrown into Rikers, but his marriage is destroyed; McCoy's ability to regain his former stature on Wall Street and look at life from the point-of-view of an American aristocrat is irreparably compromised; McCoy's 8-year-old daughter is really the only one who still believes in him just as much as in the days when he thought himself a Master of the Universe ... can there really be any winners after The Bonfire of the Vanities?As it is, Wolfe's novel is surely more than passable entertainment, but misses the mark as one of the greatest novels of the 20th Century because of its formulaic structure and subpar ending."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"The subject of The Bonfire of the Vanities is Tom Wolfe's creative and perfectly illustrative descriptive writing. For example, the author refers, in one scene, to a character wearing a \\"'F--k You' necktie.\\" The main enjoyment in crawling through this 700-page beast, is awaiting each next colorfully described scene.The marketing for this novel, and the aura that surrounds it, bills Bonfire as capturing the 80s. There were some period elements such as the media-circus of hot lawsuits. It also had scenes, such as the McCoy's offices for bond-trading, that felt 80s. But you can more efficiently immerse into that period by watching Network and Wall Street. Plus, the scenes with aristocrat McCoy and hotshot Assistant D.A. Kramer, were written in a style that reminded me of film from the 50s.The transformation of Sherman McCoy is not well-developed. When it arrives it comes as a shock.There is engaging drama and interesting plot, but nothing occurs of great significance. Only at one point, when a character describes an Edgar Allen Poe poem, does the novel rise above the milieu of its multiple intersecting plotlines.The book is a large investment of your time. Do great descriptions and fun plots make it worth it? I think so, but only minimally so."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Wolfe tells a great story, keeps it moving, and fills it with wonderfully cunning and deceitful characters."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"I used to live in New York City, so I thought Tom Wolfe was right on target in describing its politics and different social scenes, and satirizing them. However, I couldn't relate to any of the characters; they were far too stereotypical and not enough like real people for my taste. You had your token Irish cops and pols, your token Italian pol/mafiosos, your token Upper West Side Jewish intellectual lawyers, and your token doofus WASP stockbrokers and socialites. I wouldn't be surprised if some people found these depictions insulting. Maybe I'm personalizing this, but it's also almost as if Wolfe is saying that if you don't fit any of these stereotypes, you can never be a true &quot;hip&quot; New Yorker. I would have found this book more interesting had the characters been much more complex."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"This edition, all in italics, is full of typos because it is the result of scanning Bonfire of the Vanities and then reprinting it using OCR (optical character recognition) software.

Don't buy into this scam."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"It's not often that you could say that a book changed your life, but Tom Wolfe's Bonfire of the Vanities did just that for me. I was a college drop-out doing nothing with my life and one day my sister gave me this book. I'm not a big reader but I could not put this book down. I became completely involved with the great characters in this book, young attorney, Larry Kramer, writer Peter Fallow, Reverand Reginald Bacon, and of course, Sherman McCoy. Wolfe wrote in such terrific detail that you feel as if you'd known these characters all your life. I started talking about them in conversations like they were close friends of mine. The story itself is incredible, taking you through the highs and lows of four main characters with Sherman being the tie that binds them all. Now, as for the life-changing part, I knew very little about the stock market, but after seeing the high-life that Sherman led, the luxury car, the Park Ave. Co-Op, and of course his lovely ladies, wife Judy and mistress, Maria Ruskin, i knew thats what i wanted for myself(except for the mistress, of course). So, I took a couple of classes, read a few books and I passed my stock broker exam on the first try. Wall Street has been great to me--I have a job I love, great friends and durroundings and I met my wife at my firm.

So sad."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Best description of this book is that of bridge between the genre novels and literature. It is not very good literature nor is it as bad (some might say less interesting) as genre novels. The characters and character descriptions are overstated and could very well have been written by anyone after reading 10-15 crime thrillers. The redeeming feature of this book is the work Tom Wolfe put into collecting a lot of information about a particular period in a particular city, varying from inner-city housing projects, jail cells, attorney's offices and high society life.The story is that of a fundamentally decent white male getting caught up in a minor traffic accident and getting exploited by the society around him. A criticism I have is that the characters who donot belong to the traditionally wealthy (means non WASP men according to the author) are portrayed as upstarts resentful of old wealth and wanting to bring them down to their level. For some reason there is not a single character in this book who want to rise up and be equal to the traditionally wealthy by honorable means."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Yes, the plot drives itself.Yes, the chracterizations are often vivid, entertaining, and thought-provoking.Yes, the style and is agreeable and never too inconsistent with any given character at hand.Yes, Wolfe shows and conveys his knowldge of the socio-economic stratums of America in book form. His insights into the relations between these groups and within them is noteworthy. He's well-travelled.But, the novel is essentially nihilistic - yes, grandly and lavaciously nihilistic, but nonetheless nihilistic.It is also too long. The writing helps justify the length, but the plot, the wonderfully simple plot does not!And I'm not one for &quot;gender studies&quot; but the depiction of women in this novel is weak, marginal, and miserable.I don't feel as if I wasted my time reading Bonfire( I skipped over the depressing last fity pages) but I feel Mr. Wolfe might have wasted some of his talent.And what of the loose ends of seemingly important side-plots. It smacks of the dissappointment, I felt after reading his &quot;A Man in Full.&quot; So much story, so little ending.It's well worth the read, and is a modern classic, but some classics have flaws (like the times in which they are based) and they bring down this novel.It at least brought me a little down."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"I remember this book caused quite a stir in the late 80's. Reading it now I enjoyed it very much. It's certainly not a defining, breathtaking, world changing book (back then everyone was fawning over it) but it is quite good for what it is. I don't think the point of the book was for you to feel sorry for Sherman McCoy or anyone else for that matter, but simply to see what can happen to someone who has his life utterly destroyed.

A lot of people said they thought it showed a good perspective of the corporate climate of the eighties, but that was only a tiny part of the novel. Stick to Liar's Poker or Bombardiers for a better look.Most of this novel is taken up by a ridiculous crime story. There is not a single sympathetic character, so it is like spending however many hours in a room full of highly unpleasant people. Not only are they un-likeable, they are also unrealistic and they make unbelieveable decisions. The young, energetic stock trader who is all charm and confidence in one scene is suddenly socially awkward and unpopular in another scene. The smart, tough lawyer sends his client off to a romantic tryst wearing a wire, even though any idiot would know the chances of his taking off his shirt would be very high. Other characters are just caricatures: the overzealous civil-rights activist; the arrogant cop; etc.I seem to be in the minority, but I thought this book was dismal.

In fact, all the main characters leave a bad taste in your mouth. Later, as the plot unfolds, some of those feelings change. It is a tribute to the author's excellent writing and grasp of human nature that even though I disliked the characters, I was drawn to them and their story. Its like a New York version of a Greek tragedy except it unfolds over the course of a majority of the book. The characters seem real--the story seems real and you end up rooting for the protagonist despite his many flaws. This is the Great American Novel--the kind that is rarely written these days.

Which of us has his desire? or, having it, is satisfied?\\" (from \\"Vanity Fair\\", W.M. Thackeray, 1848)In \\"The Bonfire of the Vanities\\", Tom Wolfe explores the theme of vanity. The exploration is set against an intricate plot in which the lives of upper class and lower class, Wasps and Irish, Jewish and Negros are set on a collision course following a random twist of fate by the book's protagonist -- Sherman McCoy, the aristocratic bond salesman.But the exploration of vanity is not limited to the rich and wealthy. Wolfe delves into the vanity of the everyman: from the assistant DA absorbed in his physique to the English journalist who is ashamed of how his blazer is becoming \\"shiny\\", even a crack dealer, who goes through 2 pairs of Reeboks a week.Thakeray explored the same theme in his work \\"Vanity Fair\\". While Thakeray writes in much greater detail and in a more florid style, Wolfe writes in the vernacular, liberally using language to bring to life the myriad of accents of modern day New York. \\"Talking\\" becomes \\"tawkin\\" for the Irish, \\"Sherman\\" becomes \\"Shuhman\\" for the southerners, etc etc.Bonfire was pure entertainment.

For me, the more pages, the better, because I hate to see a good book end."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Is Bonfire of the Vanities a period piece? When reading a book from a previous time period, one might begin to ponder that very legitimate concern? It is, but it isn't. Allow me to elucidate. Bonfire garners irrepressible staying power as a scathing, sardonic, and witty treatise exposing the greed, glamour, decadence, and moral decay of the 80's not unlike The Roaring 20's of Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. By no means is Bonfire in the same boat as Gatsby, but nonetheless, it's in the same ballpark, if you will.Having never read Tom Wolfe before, I must say that I came away quite impressed and entertained by his singular ability to instantaneously transfer from one character's perspective to another at the drop of a dime(e.g. going from Reverend Bacon in the decrepit racially-charged milieu of The Bronx to Sherman McCoy in the plush comfortable confines of Park Avenue). Wolfe's merciless satire and scathing cynicism lends itself to all of his eccentrically diverse motley cadre of characters. As a testament to Wolfe's eclectic acumen, the author definitively nails the veritable cornucopia of targets ranging the gamut from the sheltered luxury apartments, entre nous lavish fetes of the social elite X-Rays of Park Avenue, the high-pressure environment of Sherman's Wall Street, the dog eat dog baseness of Vogel & co. at The Bronx PD and jail, the unmitigated political pandering of Weiss and Kramer at the DA's office, the Machiavellian glibness of Peter Fallow of The City Light, and, last but definitely not least, the self-serving specious \\"racial activism\\" of Reverend Bacon.The vastly paradoxical upshot of it all is this my friends: Although this extraordinarily divergent melange of characters exists in strikingly unique socioeconomic environments, they all, however, undoubtedly contribute to the prodigious confluence of flagrant self-absorbtion, blatant egotism, deplorable moral degradation, pernicious greed, and the despicable venality that cryptically ties all of them together into one infinitely vacuous morally depraved vacuum categorically devoid of any semblance of moral absolutes. Ahh...the irony of it all! Wolfe's ingenious penchant for piquant characterization and witty dialogue makes for a smooth and fluid read that entertains as well as educates.

Love it."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"With the Martha Stewarts, the Tyco/Dennis Kozlowskis, the Enron/Jeffrey Skillings of the world grabbing every headline in the business world, this masterpiece by Tom Wolfe once again appears to be an important cautionary tale of ego, greed, and megalomania, nearly 20 years after its original publication.Wolfe is a master at providing rich characterization alongside marvelous social commentary. Lovers of Wolfe's other works will not be disappointed. He's captured the best and worst elements of New York City and all of its excesses, and wove it into a powerful tale."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"This novel still reads well and remains topical after more than twenty-five years. Mr. Wolfe handles confrontations with great verve and wit - these are confrontations between very distinct groups of people - bankers, district attorneys, ghetto thugs, preachers, journalists, detectives... Mr. Wolfe also perpetuates tremendous momentum through-out this six hundred page book.His observations of society through these different class groups are astute. For instance the detectives are bewildered by the Park Avenue doorman dressed in their Napoleonic regalia rushing into the street to flag a taxi. It is beneath the dignity of upper Manhattan types to do such a lowly activity. He explodes the bubble surrounding each class type. Within the varied encounters Mr. Wolfe illustrates the isolation felt by his characters.His settings - especially the fortress courtroom in the Bronx are well depicted and felt. Mr. Wolfe tells us that the lawyers within the courtroom dare not venture into the surrounding neighborhoods - they even order in for coffee. The deli lunch euphoria at their desks with their plastic containers of ketchup, mustard, relish, mayonnaise... is a contrast with the Fifth Avenue soirees embellished by tables of elaborate floral arrangements.Perhaps the ending is a little too sudden and is somewhat inconclusive. And too some extent none of the characters are particularly likeable - they all seem out to get something - money, women, status. To some extent Mr. Wolfe adjusted his characters in his future novels to make them more appealing.In many ways this is a novel about class cultures meeting and confronting each other - and all this in a New York setting where all is within walking and subway proximity. Mr. Wolfe, as stated elsewhere, captures the \\"carnival of life\\" - New York style."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"In times of stress when authors are producing crap (yes, that is what many publisher's are putting out there with superb quotes that can not possibly be real) and calling their &#34;work&#34; writing! So far from the truth as to be outside the Milky Way galaxy. My favorite &#34;writer&#34; to call out for this is James Patterson. Tom Wolfe's work is indeed worthy of another go 'round if you do not care for the classics and if you do care for the classics as well. I have read Bonfire so many times that my hardcover has pages falling out. Downloading it to my Kindle was well worth it. Still fascinating and worth the time to read and savor every page. I've read all his books but there is something about our current political climate that makes Bonfire a very fitting read! If you've not read Mr. Wolfe before, may I suggest you start with this book. I doubt you will be disappointed!"},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"I found the characters complex and believable. Many of them are shallow or superficial but that is the point - they are materialistic. This is not the same as saying that the characters were flat, one-dimensional, or undeveloped. The dialogue was well-written and conversational. This was the easiest 500+ page book I have ever read.The book was insightful too for its criticism of the legal system and the materialism that pervades our culture. I was a child in the 80's so that time is largely removed from my memory. I've also been to New York only once. I still connected easily with the plot and characters. To see critical reviews complaining about issues such as these is sad. If you can't read a book about a place you've never been or an era before your time then you're missing the point of reading.It wasn't long after I read this that the George Zimmerman - Trayvon Martin tragedy occurred and the fictional events depicted in this book served as an important reminder that I shouldn't jump to conclusions. Does that mean I think George Zimmer is innocent? It means I don't know and I don't think we'll ever know, regardless of what the legal system decides.Without wanting to spoil anything in the book, I honestly found the journalist Peter Fallow the most despicable character in the book. Reverend Bacon was about as vile. None of the characters were really likable and many were deplorable but I think this added to realism of the story. In real life people are usually not very likable; just as in the book, I find most people to be self-serving jerks.I also appreciated how the story unfolded from the vantage points of multiple characters. Each character had his own piece of the story and his or her own cliff hanger moments. The plot was artfully crafted so that no character's actions would spoil the cliff hanger where we left off with another character. That takes skill and care as a writer.This was a fun book to read with several insightful moments that, for me at least, spurred critical thinking about our legal system and culture. What more would you want from a book?"},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Conspicuous consumption, shoulder padded-blazers, a roaring bond market, and other hallmarks of 80's culture seem dated enough today to be comical, and The Bonfire of the Vanities is very much a novel of its time. So what's to recommend this portly tome to readers 25 years later? Some of the same traits that mark all great fiction, yet which are particular strengths of Wolfe's: a keen ear for dialect, an almost discomfitingly keen understanding of human nature, and finally, descriptive bon mots that cast the world anew while also giving a \\"Yes! That's _exactly_ how it is!\\" satisfaction.While the cultural trappings of mid-80's New York no longer apply, everything that makes this book move still feels bracingly current: the thrill and lust for power, journalism's drive for The Story, political machinations, the grimy real-world operations of the law, Society etiquette, racial tensions, and those errors in judgement upon which fates turn. The book is a colorful, vivid illustration of how the issues may change, but people stay the same.For the writer, there is much to relish in Wolfe's rich vocabulary and continually inventive turns of phrase. I found myself thinking of the old writers' adage \\"Show, don't tell,\\" and then thinking \\"But if you can do it this well, tell away!\\" The witticisms are too many to quote, yet too delicious to omit entirely. Speaking of an office building, Wolfe writes \\". . . a glass tower that rose up sixty stories from out of the gloomy groin of Wall Street.\\" Discussing a hung-over character who's attempting not to remember last night's follies, he says \\"Whatever he had done was submerged like a monster at the bottom of a cold dark lake.\\" In a trendy restaurant we hear the \\"aerobic voices of the young and swell,\\" and at a socialite party we envision \\"Two men and an impeccably emaciated woman.\\" There's a lot more where that came from, but I'll let you discover them for yourself."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe's books always impress me, and The Bonfire of the Vanities is definitely one of his best works, studying American culture and human behavior through the lens of a criminal trial in New York City.Sherman McCoy is the main character of the book, but the book also follows the Bronx assistant District Attorney and a newspaper reporter, whose fates intertwine with Sherman's after he is entrenched in the court case. Interestingly, the only true protagonists in the book, the Lamb family, are the only ones who do not get much time on the page beyond the initial accident. They become mere pawns in a much bigger game of egos, where justice is served (or not served) only based on personal gain or loss. The true fate of the Lamb family is hardly relevant to anyone.Wolfe brilliantly weaves an engaging story, and his prose are crystal clear and entertaining. The plot is enjoyable on the surface level, but the ramifications of everyone's actions will leave a reader thinking for days following the conclusion of this book. I definitely recommend this to anyone."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"There are a huge number of typos that are very distracting and frustrating. As stated by other reviewers, multiple words in a row are smushed together and there are random symbols floating around the pages. I recommend going to a used books store or something similar to get the book, because this version is not worth the money."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"For decades I have been told I should read Bonfire, and I don't know why it took me more than twenty years to get around to it. I lived in New York City throughout the 1980's (when I was in my twenties) and worked for both a Wall Street law firm and the District Attorney's Office, so the settings are very familiar, and I'm a Tom Wolfe fan, having read The Right Stuff and A Man in Full long ago. Wolfe is in top form here, and his cynical, microscope's-eye view through the dozens of individual set pieces is amazing. This book is a fabulous achievement. Long as the book was, I couldn't get enough of it, and there is no doubt that this fiction contains a lot of truth. So why only four stars? Well, its \\"truthiness\\" (a phrase coined by Stephen Colbert that Tom Wolfe undoubtedly wishes he had come up with) is part of the problem, particularly with the African-American and female characters. While the caricatures of black and female real-world actors (a thinly-veiled Al Sharpton, a real-estate-agent-I-have-known) are spot on, Wolfe nowhere conveys the essential humanity of either group: blacks are \\"the mob\\"--ignorant, manipulable, and dangerous, even if the victim of circumstance; women are shallow, defined completely by their sexual attractiveness and utterly dependent on the men. Bad enough on its own, what makes this particularly problematic is that the \\"truthiness\\" of the work as a whole risks leaving these bogus stereotypes in the reader's mind as true as well. It's all the worse because the book is so good. (Also, only four stars because of the abrupt ending; in A Man in Full Wolfe carries his vision of masculinity and heroism through a remarkably similar story, but completes his vision with more of the resurrection of his \\"hero\\")."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"This is a great book about a prominent Wall Street financier who has the misfortune of becoming a political football after he is involved in a hit and run accident on a black youth in the Bronx. Wolfe once again captures all of his characters perfectly - all the idiosyncracies are there. How do I know this? Because we see ourselves in these characters. We think many of the same thoughts and only when reading Wolfe do we say, \\"yeah, that's how I am too\\" which may be a humbling experience.While an interesting plot in its own right, Bonfire of the Vanities is also a piercing commentary on race relations, class relations, and human relations. Wolfe has an uncanny way of getting into each characters head and the reader cannot help but empathize with each one.This is Wolfe's first fictional work and widely considered his best fiction (of only three though). I have also read I Am Charlotte Simmons and I would argue that Bonfire is not quite as good as Wolfe's novel about a small town girl in prestigious university. Since I have never been to New York City etc I could not connect quite as well with the characters as I could in Charlotte Simmons which was an eerily accurate portrayal of collegiate life."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"This book really draws you in. The plot is intriguing, the pacing is flawless, and there are a great many insightful observations about society to be found between the pages. Too bad they did such an atrocious job with the film adaption."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Tom Wolfe captures the essence of big-city racial and class conflict, plus greed, ambition, and self-serving hypocrites. His story concerns high-living banker Sherman McCoy, whose accidental exit from the New York freeway into the crime-plagued South Bronx leads to his mistress running over a young black man (who may have been looking to rob McCoy). Enter a questionable black leader, an unscrupulous vote-seeking district attorney, and a sleazy tabloid reporter, each of whom seeks to manipulate and play off events for their own aggrandizement. The story has few admirable characters at any level, not in the Park Avenue mansions, the courts, nor the tough streets. Equally lacking are social codes of decency and honesty. The story covers New York in the mid-1980's but one senses it applies today as well.Wolfe provides a powerful tale, one with some parallels to the Tawana Brawley hoax that occurred not long after this book arrived. The book drags a bit in a couple places (thus four stars and not five), but Wolfe provides a powerful message."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"I was put off this book for quite some time because of having seen the film, but, finally decided to give it a go (despite having a paperbackl edition with the film characters on the cover...) This book is an example of what a meticulous, fearless and talented writer of prose can come up with in response to the world around him. While being a great 'page-turner' as far as plot goes, Wolfe manages, through a complex web of ironies and double ironies, to examine humanity as a social creature in a certain time and place. He deals so breath-takingly honestly with his characters that many readers might blanche, and want to point fingers at the author, something Wolfe is couragous enough to bear, obviously. He does not set himself up as a prophet - like many modern 'social-awareness' authors - and I am sure does not absolve himself from many of the 'vanities' that are examined in this book. He tries to be honest, deal honestly with his characters and, thus, his readers, which is perhaps so strange in this literary day and age that it is considered reactionary. It is not. It is a novelist. I will certainly be reading more Wolfe, who has now become my favourite living American author."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Bonfire of the Vanities was the first Tom Wolfe novel I read, not knowing anything about the author, and I was not disappointed! Had I known the book was about an upper class investment banker in the eighties who runs down some black kid in the Bronx I would have never picked it up but once I started reading it the little plotline blurb seemed so insufficient to describe it.This book seems to have a real talent for spelunking into the darker unseemly depths of human society but at the same time you're staring at the pages half horrified you're also sucked further into the story trying to figure out the whys. I don't think I've ever read a book with a main character as unlikable as this one but at the same time there are moments when you're sitting back thinking how sad it all is, or smiling at some little trifling piece of humanity that shows through. All the characters are keenly humanized. Nothing is held back, and I believe that's the key to this book's success. It catches not only the great human struggle but also the great societal struggle as well with wondrous complexity.I'm in the process of reading this book the second time and I must say you do get something new out of each little scene the second time around. I really enjoyed this book for not only showing the negatives of the human experience but also little tinges of the positives in various poignant scenes."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"As certain legal cases continue to generate huge headlines with everybody fighting for their camera close-ups, it shows that \\"The Bonfire of the Vanities\\" will never become irrelevant.The novel is an extremely fun read that eviscerates the New York of the 80s, as well as managing to stay relevant in contemporary times. Wolfe's novel peers through the windows of all the social strata to meld an infuriating tale of people pretending to look out for the greater good but only engaging in vicious self-preservation. There aren't many characters in the book whom I found especially likeable and some who I found palatable at first ended up disappointing me. Every twist in the story made things even more unpredictable right up to the epilogue, which I found to be a bit of a let down but a realistic one. My only real question at the end of the story was the subplot about the $350,000 that the Reverend Bacon couldn't account for; Wolfe seemed to drop the ball on that and I wanted to see where it would end up.This story was originally serialized in \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine (!) in 1984-85 but by the time it saw print as a complete novel, it had changed quite a bit. Sherman McCoy was a writer in the serial, and was a Wall Street financier in the novel. Wolfe tapped into the temper of the times with that canny switch, and makes the putpouring of anger and resentment against McCoy that much more timely."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Many will remember the movie made of this. My advice? Don't. I was put off this book for quite some time because of having seen the film, but, finally decided to give it a go (despite having a paperbackl edition with the film characters on the cover...)

While being a great 'page-turner' as far as plot goes, Wolfe manages, through a complex web of ironies and double ironies, to examine humanity as a social creature in a certain time and place. Hands down one of the most enteratining novels that I have ever read, and definitely the best rendering of modern New York City in fiction! This paperback was so ubiquitous I waited 10 years to reluctantly read it, and only because it was one of the only books on the shelf where I was staying. Boy, was I rewarded with this compulsively readable, suspenseful, razor-sharp story. For social satire to be so fiendishly plotted is a real treat and this story will have you racing to its inexorable conclusion."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"In a life of great writing, for me this is Tom Wolfe's greatest work. Its success was cataclysmic and was due in part to its perfection in timing. It hit at the very moment when the self anointed \\"Masters of the Universe\\" were becoming exposed to the general public and the materialistic and hedonistic culture of the eighties was becoming transformed. (At the time we didn't realize it would be a trade of the Culture of Greed for the Ravenous Orgy of Greed in the nineties.)This book offered wonderful phrases such as Social X-Rays, Lemon Tart, and so many more that you will be amazed when you re-read it or read the book for the first time. It has a fascinating story that weaves together the cultures of privilege (for there are many) and the dregs of misery. Each and every character is presented as someone with his or her own delusions of self, hypocrisies, and contradictory motivations.Now, this is not a novel in the sense of Thomas Mann or any other psychological writer. This is a novel of social reporting that continues to stand the test of time and you will gain from reading it several times. However, do NOT under any circumstances think that the movie made with the same title as this book in any way represents the wonderful things these pages contain. The movie is a complete botch while the book remains a treasure."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Hands down one of the most enteratining novels that I have ever read, and definitely the best rendering of modern New York City in fiction!

Download the sample 1st."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"The digital copy of this book is poor with artifacts on almost every other page, makes it difficult to read at points, definitely not worth the price for the effort the publisher put in."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"Bonfire of the Vanities is a long book and a good story by celebrated author Thomas Wolfe. I read a review of the book below and am wondering it it contained too much information and might have spoiled the ending, because right now I'm only halfway through the book. So far, the sense I get is that there are no good guys or bad guys, but there is right and wrong and each character spends time flirting with both sides. Sherman McCoy is a man who has all the trappings of success but his little empire is threatening to crumble becasue of his mounting debt, his affairs, and oh ya, a little hit and run accident that he should have reported to the police but didn't. McCoy, as a character, doesn't have many redeeming qualities. However, as political and cultural forces slowly unite to turn against him, I find myself rooting for him to stand up for all that is bad in society: the tabloid press, the Jesse Jackson/Al Sharpton types that don't really care about the truth and the district attorneys looking for politcal gain.Wolfe covers every aspect of this hit run, from its innocent beginnings to the outlandish policical case that it will turn into. Now 2/3rds of the way book, it seems Wolfe holds none of the characters in too much regard. Everyone from the victim, the accuser, the lawyers and the press are pandering to their weakest traits. I think that's where the title of the book comes from. What happens when you throw a bunch of people looking out only for themselves into one volitile situation. You get this book.Having now finished the book, I see why it is considered a classic. Wolfe tells a great story. Sherman McCoy is a bad man, motivated by money and seduced by younger women. But when he gets involved in the accident, he slowly begins to change. He is almost forced to change because all the other people involved in his life are worse than he is. Yet they aren't behaving badly. Wolfe just portrays these people for who they are. Kramer is the district attorney who seizes the case against McCoy as a way to make a better life for himself. He does what anyone else in the situation would do. Reverend Bacon is typical of the race mongering civil rights activistis who put themselves above those they supposedly serve. Peter Fallow is a journalist who would be nuts to refuse to cover a story that is given to him.I recommend this book because it points what can happen when selfishness overtakes people's lives. And it is an entertaining story that shows what happens when liberal politicians put their own success ahead of the truth."},{"Title":"The Bonfire of The Vanities","review":"I can understand how this book was such a milestone. True genius, in the journalistic style--for portraying so well the status and money-obsessed nature of New York, which still holds true today. Wolfe does a terrific, and I mean really terrific, job at describing the city's political climate and how easily people can be taken advantage of once power and money are thrown into the mix.Each character's intense need to better his or her own situation is at the center of how each of them relate to the story. In that, the story is essentially a description of how five New Yorkers cross paths and manage to further and better their personal situations, at the expense of a rich Wall Street trader's criminal mistake and inward feelings of guilt. Even though Sherman McCoy's character is portrayed as your typical snooty financial industry professional, the way in which he is brought down is dismaying in itself. He is used as a scapegoat for the ills of the White Establishment by a crooked, black political figure (using the hypocrisy of the church to better himself); used as &quot;the Great White Defendant&quot; by an insecure, self-critical assistant DA to make his career as a trial lawyer; used as centerpiece of a tabloid story to build a shallow, alcoholic reporter's journalist career; used to displace blame by a promiscuous, sleek money-hungry trophy wife... The Bonfire shows the lengths people will go to in order to get ahead and the lack of underlying trust for others, irregardless of money and status. The book is a lesson in city life, opportunism, greed, and a fundamental lesson in our very nature and how we operate, in the strict, economic sense of the term.In another vein, the plot takes some movie-like twists and turns that dont necessarily work well in writing. Overall, an amazing piece of work, but seems very well suited to the screen more than anything else...I still have to rent the movie!!! Overall, a gripping and very accurate rendition of the city lives we all dream of living."},{"Title":"Stitch by Stitch: A Home Library of Sewing, Knitting, Crochet and Needlecraft (20 Volume Set with Index)","review":"If you are looking for a particular volume of this set.........please ask questions before buying.While it definitely seemed too good to be true that you would get a 20 volume set for the price listedhere, I could find nowhere where it said any different.

It's deceptively simple, because the book has a rigorous intellectual base, and cites key theories, authors and research in the field (not surprising, because Stolovitch and Keeps also co-edited the definitive handbook in the field).I used the book as a text in my graduate course in human performance technology. It offers many benefits as a textbook. It's readable, so it invites students to read it. It's interactive as well, which makes the reading experience more of a learning session, rather than just an absorption session.Through these activities, the book makes the abstract and admittedly difficult-to-grasp concepts of human performance improvement concrete.It also helps me model a key performance concept: build on small successes to create effective performance. Because this book is accessible, my students--many of whom are new to both the field and graduate education--can demonstrate success early in the program and that inspires them to greater success."},{"Title":"Training Ain't Performance","review":"This book provides practical ideas and insights about how to best manage performance in the workplace and best invest your training dollars.

By understanding the basic tenets of human nature - honesty with oneself, finding our true passions and living with integrity, Gundry and LaMantia have shown the way.Although there are numerous \`teams' books written, few if any authors have trawled to deeply understand the building blocks of what makes an extraordinarily productive team - individuals who are truly honest with what they want from life, consciously make choices, speak with conviction and integrity, respect, honor and promote those around them. Truly collaborative teams that sustain breakthroughs as well as adapt and grow from adversity require, first and foremost, honest people. Gundry and LaMantia have to be congratulated for not only establishing the human principles required for establishing great teams, yet ask the questions we each should each pose to ourselves to experience a more fulfilling and whole life.Following significant reflection of this text, the authors are correct in arguing that there is very little we have to learn so as to work together with a high degree of effectiveness. We each have the skills to be honest with what we want and how we wish to work, to listen as well as have fun with our colleagues, to cultivate shared responsibility and ownership, act courageously, live according to a \`what if' rather than \`thou shall be' guidelines etc.As stated, what is required is to sweep away de rigueur organizational and society assumptions and expectations regarding the world of work and create new modes of conduct based on what the team desires to be truly effective. The most important task as we begin to collectively mold into a new team is for each individual to reflect on who they are, what are their dreams and passion, what they see as the purpose of the team and what they wish to contribute. They share this openly and honestly with the team, without judgement and questioning.How refreshing it is to read learned experts in this field discuss the importance of honesty, respect for all viewpoints, courageous action and having fun and periods of reflection and rejuvenation. How wonderful it is to see a \`business book' speak of people as breathing, spiritual animals with intrinsic needs who are on a journey of self discovery towards becoming more whole, hence contributing far in excess of what many of us believe is \`normal' to contribute in the workplace.The book is quite right in arguing that breakthrough teams requires people who are whole - they understand their internal direction in life, have considered their values, mode of operating, their passions and come to others in a spirit of generosity, active listening and non-judgment. The true breakthrough that this book delivers is that its teachings are applicable to any domain because it has viewed, questioned and judged people not in a business context, yet in our natural environment of communities. The health of the group stems from the importance of the individual. Dowse the passion and you end up with breakup teams.This book stands as a litmus test not only for team leaders and organizations, yet for individuals who want to be part of a high performance team and enjoy and grow from every moment of their experience. This text provides the \`how to' tools that we all intrinsically have to create breakthrough teams - understand our own unique qualities followed by being honest with ourselves and everyone around us. If so, you will find work to be productive, rewarding, fun and rejuvenating.You will not find rules for behavior, decision making, rewards etc. The text is littered with succinct tools, helpful hints, guideposts and axioms that get you thinking and most importantly, reflecting about the way of work that is best for you.This text is quite simple. Its basis is the primal tenets of individual honesty and integrity, understanding our passions and what we want to contribute and courageously outlining these in the workplace. From this true open forum of genuine listening, respect and reflection, team visions, culture and work credos are developed. Resiliency muscles are developed to make the team grow stronger through the inevitable bad times.The value you derive from this book will be gained upon reflection on the axioms on which it is founded. Its primacy is the sacredness of the individual - their passions, dreams, values and boundaries. Breakthrough teams create a safe environment where people can be truly themselves, verbally and in action. They are contributing what they want, speaking truthfully and take deep responsibility for their words and actions. They listen with compassion and without judgment. Gundry and LaMantia have developed the principles that unlock our true selves, hence contributing our greatest talents and thereby not only developing breakthrough teams, yet also, more content, productive and whole people. Once we are on this road, our fears begin to vanish, and synchronicities begin to happen that help to make our dreams come true.Breakthrough Teams for Breakneck Times is a call to re-ignite the best of the human spirit. A seminal work that has caused me to deeply reflect about the people that I lead, the responsibilities that I choose and how to mold and improve not only the economic performance of my team, yet to also increase the deep intrinsic and individual satisfaction that I want each person to feel from our work as well as our interactions.Its time to go beyond vitas and technical qualifications and ask people what fire burns in their belly, where is their life going, what do they want to contribute and in what environment would they like to work?It is because of Gundry and LaMantia that I now have the \`stepping stones' to develop my team into a truly collaborative high performance unit. As well as delivering the outputs, we will also be having lots of fun.

In so doing, she manages to recreate, in writing, the exact sensation of being happily lost for an indeterminate time amid the paths and bridges that comprise this amazing place."},{"Title":"Venice","review":"Cities like Rome and Bologna have been important centers for hundreds or, in Rome's case, thousands of years. Today they are active cities that not only attract tourists, but have modern industry and culture. Venice is the old bones of an imperial power. The palaces, churches and art that exists in Venice are the relics of Venice's past wealth and power. Today Venice exists as a cultural tourist attraction.In planning to visit Venice, I've worried that it is a sort of cultural Disneyland. A place that exists only for tourists.When I think about traveling somewhere, I hope that it will be a wonderful experience. So I try to learn as much about a place as possible. Travel essays provide at least one person's view of a place. Venice by James Morris is a rich account of Venice and its history. Reading the book, I felt that I could feel the city through Morris' perspective.James Morris was one of the early transexuals and became Jan Morris, the noted travel writer. Venice was originally written when Jan was James and she did not change the authorship with later editions. From reading the introduction, I think that this is because in Jan's view James really did write the book. This was an earlier avitar of Jan's and she wishes to honor his perspective.Jan Morris is a wonderful, lyrical writer. Reading her writing, I feel a bit like I'm walking the canals and experiencing Venice. Reading this book made me much more sure about my decision to visit these old bones of empire."},{"Title":"Venice","review":"\\"Venice\\" is one of those very, very rare books that forces you to slow down your reading so as not to miss a word. This is not a travel guide... Morris lived in Venice for years, and writes as only one with intimate knowledge of every alleyway of a city's body and soul can. The writing is astonishing in its consistency: every paragraph holds a richness of language and of imagery that is at times breathtaking, and the writer's imagination routinely transforms the mundane into glorious metaphor. Here are (quite literally) random paragraphs, these on Venice and tourism in summer:-------------\\"Confronted by these multitudes, in summer the character of Venice abruptly coarsens. The cost of a coffee leaps, if you are anywhere near St. Mark's, and is gradually reduced, in topographical gradations, as you take your custom farther from that avaricious fulcrum. The waiters of the Piazza brush up their brusquest manners, in preparation for the several hundred people each day who understandably believe that there must be some mistake in the bill. Souvenir stalls spring up like garish fungi, and the market is suddenly flooded with straw hats, gondoliers shirts, maps printed on head-scarves, lead gondolas, spurious antiques, a million water-colours and a thousand paper-weights in the shape of St. Mark's Campanile.The unsuspecting visitor, stepping from the steamboat, is accosted by a pair of ferocious porters, who carry his bags the fifteen-odd feet into his hotel lobby and demand, as their compulsory payment for this service, the price of a substantial meal, with wine. The withered sacristans of the famous churches, brushing the dust from their cassocks, emerge eagerly from the shadows to drag you to the very last dismal pseudo-Titian of the vestry. Pampered young men pester you to visit their showrooms. The cry of Gondola! Gondola! follows you like an improper suggestion down the quays. There is a queue for the lift to the top of the bell-tower. Enough people peer into the horrors of the dungeons each morning to make Casanova s head reel. There is a shop near St. Mark's so well adapted to every possible shift in the balance of power that the homesick tourist may buy himself the flag of Yemen, the Ukraine, Bolivia, or even the United Nations.And chanting a sing-song melody of triumph, the guides of Venice come into their own again. \\"Guides\\", wrote Augustus Hare in the 1890's, \\"are usually ignorant, vulgar and stupid in Venice, and all but the most hopelessly imbecile visitors will find them an intolerable nuisance\\" (though in later editions of his book he dropped the bit about the imbeciles). Nevertheless the guides of Venice flourish, the directors of itineraries boom, and many a poor holiday-maker staggers home at the end of a day's pleasure as though she has been grinding corn on a tread mill, or attending some crucial and excruciating viva voce. There are 107 churches in Venice, and nearly every tourist feels he has seen at least 200 of them: for the guides and guide books presuppose an unflagging whip-lash energy in their victims, an utter disregard for regular meals, and an insatiable appetite for art of all periods, standards and purposes.\\"-------------Or this, about Venetian cats:-------------\\"Venice is... a metropolis of cats. Now and again the sanitary authorities have conducted a cat-hunt, to sweep away vagrants and scavengers: but so fond are the Venetians of their cats, even the mangiest and scabbiest of them, that these drives have always ended in ignominious failure, and the animals, spitting and scratching, have been hidden away in back yards and boxes until the hygiene men have gone. The population of cats thus increases each year. Some lead an eerily sheltered existence, and are rarely allowed out of doors, only appearing occasionally, like nuns, upon confined and inaccessible balconies. Many more are only half-domesticated, and live on charity, in old drain-pipes from which sympathetic citizens have removed the grilles, under the seats of laid-up gondolas, or in the tangled recesses of overgrown gardens. You may see them any morning wolfing the indigestible entrails, fish-tails and heads, wrapped in newspapers, which householders have laid down for them: and on most winter afternoons an old lady arrives to feed the cats of the Royal Gardens, near St. Mark's, while a man in a sweeping overcoat so manipulates the flow of a nearby drinking fountain that a jet of water is projected into a declivity among the paving-stones, forming a cat's basin, or a cat-bath.\\"-------------Sigh. Morris packs more imagery and life into each paragraph than most writers manage in a chapter - or an entire book. This is the type of book that makes those of us with delusions about our own writing want to give up and go home. Confronted by such richness, the would-be writer stalls. The one or two clever and (he feels) well-constructed phrases which he has turned over in his mind to describe some event, thought or feeling, and polished to what he has seen with a quietly sheltered pride as a burnished luster, suddenly seem, in comparison to just about anything Morris has written in this wonderful book, dull and sadly wanting. Rather like a teenaged girl who privately primps and fusses over her appearance in front of her bedroom mirror for hours until, finally satisfying herself that she must be irresistible to men, steps out of her front door to rudely discover that the street is full of supermodels.\\"Venice\\" is one of the best books I have ever read, and I have never found a book that so completely captures the life and character of a great city as this does. For those who love language - and Venice - it is pure pleasure from start to finish.Quick biographical note: Jan Morris was formerly James Morris - s/he underwent a sex change in 1964 (which explained the perplexing fact that I couldn't find any first editions under the author's female name)."},{"Title":"Venice","review":"The first time I read this book was after my first visit to Venice, sixteen years ago. I was fascinated by the virtuosity of the text but when the book was nearing it's end I've realized that the feeling I get now and then is not of elation but of a mild irritation. The tone the author chose is perfectly suitable for an essay, but at the longer run was beginning to feel a bit one note and repetitive, Morris hops from one theme to another looking to me less a virtuoso and more off an eccentric and even - forgive me for that blashemphy - a scatterbrain.But in 1996 I just thought that the reason for that exhaustion lies in my lack of true interest in Venice, it's not potent enough to carry me happily from the first page to the last.Since then I've read Norwich, Ackroyd, Tiziano Scarpa, Frederic Lane, Christopher Hibbert and others, last of all a very compilative and uninspired book of Paul Strathern, after which I've decided to revisit the work that had started me on this trip of learning - hopefully, as an antidote to Strathern.Finished rereading it couple days ago and have to admit I was getting irritated after first two thirds of the Morris' book - just like before. Author's relentless showing off, all these lists of different lions, all the chattering, hopping, making noises, not giving up on all this when you are already in the third hundred of pages made me realize my first impression was probably right, and it's not my faltering interest that I have to blame for failing to appreciate the style and substance of the classic."},{"Title":"Venice","review":"I recently bought this book for an upcoming trip I have to Venice.

B. Trudeau, who needed a reason that Williams would hire former Ambassador Duke as the General Manager for the Redskins, even in a comic strip. Then again, who else had better expertise in sports medicine? The experience could certainly not be any worse than having the man give a speech on a college campus. The \\"Doonesbury\\" daily comic strips collected in \\"But the Pension Fund Was Just Sitting There\\" are from 1978-1979, when President Jimmy Carter was looking over weapon systems and Georgetown students were protesting Professor Henry Kissinger giving a speech for at a dinner honoring the wife of the Shah of Iran (of course, it is impossible to read some of these strips and not remember what was to come in the years ahead). Meanwhile, Comrade Phred is the new Vietnamese ambassador to the U.N., Rick Redfern has to be part of the White House press corp, and Dr. Dan Asher, author of the phenomenally successful \\"Mellow: How to Get It\\" is on the Mark Slackmeyere show (but so is his old man and Congresswoman Lacey Davenport).Of course, today the idea of 390-pound linemen in the NFL does not sound so far fetched, but the strips that really hit home here are the ones where ABC's chief of programming Freddie Silverman checks out what NBC is doing in response to his \\"jiggle\\" shows and the solution is--full frontal nudity. Okay, so we are not there yet, but, then again, maybe I am just watching the wrong channel. Yes, these old Donnesbury strips are dated, but they rely as much on Trudeau's characters as they do on the headlines of the times and when it comes to caustic commentary on the national scene, there is nobody better."},{"Title":"AN Unwelcome Alliance","review":"Ellen Fitzgerald is a pseudonym for Florence Stevenson who also wrote gothics, regencies and even modern tales under four other names. I am only missing a few of her books and each has proved to be a gem.I've never read a Regency novel with quite the twist this one had. Lord Gerald Courlenay has not only become heir to his father upon the death of his elder brother but he also inherits his brother's betrothed. The engagement to Lady Belinda Deveraux who has a large dowry and an impeccable bloodline had been arranged long ago. Now she is 18 and the marriage is to occur. Early in the book, we are privy to the thoughts of each about their first meeting when Gerald was 11 and Belinda was 5 - hardly a good start since Gerald threw a rock at her for disturbing his fishing adventure! This makes for an appealing situation when they meet again as young adultsBut each loves another and yet, neither can stop the wedding. Descriptions of the wedding day were detailed and captivating. The marriage starts off rocky. Gerald remains loyal to his mistress (unknown to Belinda) and Belinda pines for intimacy and wishes she could have wed another man. But time proves to be all that is needed for each to realize they care and love each other. Gerald begins to realize the caresses from his mistress seem practiced and he longs to be with his innocent and passionate wife instead. Belinda eventually understands the older man she has adored for a lifetime is just an insubstantial infatuation.But there is slight villainy afoot from the jealous mistress, Felice, and her friend Chretien de Beaufort who is commissioned to paint Belinda's portrait. He intimates of the relationship her husband has with Felice and Belinda is heart broken and decides to return to her father's country home. Will Gerald be able to win her love back?The character development in this book is superb. Even secondary characters such as Belinda's friend Cornelia, Lord Fueneaux (Belinda's infatuation), parents of the couple and others are really well drawn. You empathize with many of them. I really liked the way this book switches between what each of the characters are thinking rather than one point of view. I just can't say enough good things about this book."},{"Title":"AN Unwelcome Alliance","review":"This book was entirely forgettable - which, for me, is quite rare. Usually there is at least something memorable about a character or a plotline. However, re-reading the synopsis six months after having read the book, I don't remember anything about the story, the characters or even reading the book. Based on my rating, I couldn't have been too enamored with it. It certainly didn't earn itself a place on my bookshelf, and I wouldn't waste my time reading it again."},{"Title":"The Hardgainer's Body Building Handbook: Workouts, Nutrition, and Results","review":"This book consists of:71 pages of large print, illustrated, generic information. 15 of those pages cover the basic information about hardgainers, but probably nothing you didn't already know. The remaining 56 pages contain the same basic information you'd read in any Muscle and Fitness magazine or the like. Eat a lot, take these supplements, rest, work out.The remaining 200 pages are photos (with one page explanations) of the same basic exercises anyone who has ever strength trained or bought a bodybuilding magazine has seen before: pure recycled material.The workouts included are almost ridiculous, and even though I've been weight training for several years, I found most of them impractical. For example, 10 sets of 10 pull-ups with 1 minute rest in between (after 100 reps of inclined barbell presses with no rest). It's sort of like someone saying, \\"Oh, you want to build up your endurance--why don't you run 20km everyday then?\\" While the book explicitly states it is aimed for folks who have already been doing weight training for 6 months, I found that most of its workouts are simply impossible for even the above-average fitness buff.Basically, this book is a waste of your money and time if you are really looking for information and a fitness program to put that 10 pounds on your frame that you've been hoping for. It's just another generic bodybuilding book like a dozen others on my shelf, although it is a little less informative than most of those others.A much BETTER selection, both in terms of content and realism, is Mejia's and Berardi'sScrawny to Brawny. Here's why:1) They actually provide real information about what makes a hardgainer a hardgainer rather than the same old, \\"Oh, it's the fast twitch/slow twitch difference.\\" Not only that, they do a good job telling you what you can do about it.2) The information they provide is not generic but is aimed at \\"scrawny guys\\" rather than rehashing the same old stuff and putting it under a new label.3) They don't just show you a bunch of dumb pictures of guys doing an exercise with a kindergarten-level explanation, but instead show you how to do them in a way that maximizes their effects for YOU as a hardgainer (someone who probably has shorter muscles, longer tendons, longer limbs, and predominantly slow-twitch muscle fiber composition).4) The exercise routines are tough, but they are at least realistic.Do they work? I'll let you know in six months."},{"Title":"The Hardgainer's Body Building Handbook: Workouts, Nutrition, and Results","review":"This book has great illustrations of exercises, nutrition plans, and workout plans but only for those who are exceptionally motivated. The nutrition plan is particularly hard to follow but I think if you use it only as a supplement to an already good eating plan it is workable. The workout plans are also very difficult to keep up with and to do in a traditional health club. I have to go as late as possible to my club because the supersets in the plan require alternating between equipment which stays very busy duing peak hours. I only rated this book three stars because of its difficulty for the busy adult to keep up with. However, if you are the self motivating type then you will benefit greatly from this book."},{"Title":"The Hardgainer's Body Building Handbook: Workouts, Nutrition, and Results","review":"Pros:-Exercises are well described and illustrated with caveats to avoid and variations.-A well organized plan for exercising.Cons:-Lots of editing mistakes-Using almost the same exercises over and over seems boring and counter productive-The book recommends you to limit your exercies to one hour yet the workout routines at a minimum contains 14 exercises of 2 sets each even for the beginner. With one minute rest between each exercise and one minute for performing the exercise and moving/changing plates/waiting for the rack to empty/etc at the very minimum that's already an hour (especially that exercises are superset so you will be doing a lot of moving around). Add warmup set to that and you've got a lot more than you anticipated.-Selection of exercises do not mention which exercises targets which muscles (i.e. only chest/back/shoulders). I would prefer mentioning what parts of the delts or which part of the chest.-Follows from the previous point also the author says \\"You can replace with another exercise ..\\" but doesn't tell you which exercise can be replaced with which. We know that not all chest exercise are created equal. Not enough information on that.-No mention of warmup. For example in the breakin routine which is supposedly for beginners, the book specifies 2 sets of 10 for most exercises. Now I can't imagine going straight ahead to the gym doing 2 sets of each exercise with a heavy weight that only allows 10 reps. Definitely that's the shortest way to injury and soreness. Also as you do the first set of 10 without prior warmup , the second set will be easier and you can increase the weight. So is that the goal? just doing 10 reps of whatever you can? not enough on that.-No mention of stretches prior or after workout. And given that warmup is not mentioned either, it seems it was just neglected rather than being intentionally designed out of the program.-The book website forums are almost ignored, no questions answered any recently, and sending email to the author doesn't seem to make any replies back."},{"Title":"The Hardgainer's Body Building Handbook: Workouts, Nutrition, and Results","review":"I read through this book in a few hours. I was thinking it was an \\"okay\\" book untill I got to the supplement section. I felt like it was a commercial. The author kept mentioning his favorite brands, which was usually one brand in particular. I wasn't surprised to see a magazine-style add in the back of the book for that brand. I have a hard time considering the recommendations credible when they are advertizing a body-building product. I also bought \\"Scrawny to Brawny\\" It took me over a week to read and the info is waayyyy better in my opinion!There was a good section that explained how to properly to the exercises which is the best part of the book"},{"Title":"The Hardgainer's Body Building Handbook: Workouts, Nutrition, and Results","review":"The Hardgainers' Bodybuilding Handbook is a fantastic guide for hardgainers like myself. For the first time I read a book on the subject that has all of the information that I needed to accomplish my goals.This book covers everything, from setting goals, to providing an exact workout routine that one can follow and that changes every so often in order to maximize results. The author calls this method periodization and he explains why this works better than just trying to constantly add weight to ones' exercises. Also, the best exercises for mass building are provided and Mr. Rivera even gives a solid explanation of why some exercises like the squat are better than others, like the leg press for instance. Rivera says that everytime you move your torso through space (as in the squat) more fibers are needed to move the weight so therefore the exercise is more effective and you build more mass.In addition, nutrition is really explained in detail with sample diets, nutritional information for foods and even shows you how to design and personalize your own diet. The supplement chapter I found to be extremely valuable as I used to go to the nutrition stores and buy everything and anything spending a fortune every time. Now by using Rivera's Essential list of supplements and some creatine and glutamine I have cut down on my supplements bill dramatically. I did not realize how much garbage I was getting that was really doing nothing.In addition to this, the book also has fantastic illustrations with realistic looking models and detailed exercise descriptions. While I did find a mistake on page 154 since it had the wrong illustration for the exercise I went ahead and sent an e-mail to the author (his website is listed on the book) and though it took him 7 days he did got back to me personally and set me straight. I was surprised that I got a personal reply from him as I am sure he is pretty busy. That alone made the purchase of the book worth it as I have bought many other bodybuilding books and #1 they do not cater to hardgainers and #2 the authors can never be reached.Another thing I liked about the book is how nicely organized the information is. If I need to refresh my memory on nutrition I just go to that chapter. For training I visit the training chapter and so on. Also the appendices on the back help with easy access of info too.I'll conclude this review by sharing that since I started the program in 10 weeks I have put on 15 lbs of solid muscle by following the advise from the book. My wife cannot believe the changes and neither do my co-workers. While the book advises to only work out 4 times a week, it is really hard work and the book indicates so from the get go; Rivera does not sugar coat things. Also while at first I was a bit scared as the volume of the training is higher than what I have seen in other hardgainer books, as long as you eat as advertised and rest you do grow. So if you are a hardgainer and really need a guide to set you straight on gaining muscle this guide may be as helpful to you as it has been to me."},{"Title":"The Hardgainer's Body Building Handbook: Workouts, Nutrition, and Results","review":"This is a review of the The Hardgainer's Body Building Handbook by Hugo Rivera. I was never sure if I fell into the \\"hardgainer\\" category, but with a short build and medium frame I figured this book might be one to try. I should note that I am 36, and I have been weight training on and off for 12 years. I have pretty much stayed in shape my whole life, but never focused on body building or serious weight training.I found the book easy to follow, and although there were some obvious errors and generalizations with this book, I felt the book was focused enough for me. The strength of the book was its focus on the workout routines and individual exercises. It provided an explanation of the different program \\"phases\\" the reader is supposed to go through. The program includes a volume training phase, muscle-growth phase, strength training phase, and an active recovery phase (not in that sequence). Each phase is preceded by an explanation of what the goal is. In most if not all cases, the program involves workouts that use forms of superset exercises. The rest durations are clearly defined for each superset interval. I made my own spreadsheet of each workout in the book (used the same table format) and brought it with me to the gym.The nutritional and supplement sections were interesting to read, but I felt that given my own dietary restrictions (type 1 diabetes), I would have to derive my own nutritional and supplement plans. Basically, I had to find a way to hit my calorie mark, but I could not consume all the carbohydrates that were prescribed.So the workout began, and I gave this book my best effort. The book pushes you to never miss a workout, and it supported its recovery considerations by scheduling no more than two consecutive days of workouts... with each workout lasting no more than an hour. My consulting profession currently enables me to work at home a few days each week, and that gave me the ability to use the gym often at non-peak hours. I realize most people won't have this advantage, but it became essential, as the superset workout plans required that you have (basically reserved) two to three pieces of gym equipment. Try that during the busy periods at your gym. With the somewhat shorter rest periods (30-90 seconds in most cases), it was difficult to follow the superset schedule as written if someone needed to use equipment I had in my set. In any case, I went through all phases of the program, and with much effort, I never missed a workout. I even made it to an out of town gym while on vacation.My results: I found that following this program did more for me than my previous \\"programs\\" or years of \\"winging it\\" in the gym. I definitely was more defined and built - but I did not put on the weight and mass that I thought I would. This may be because I had to eat fewer carbohydrates than the book prescribes, but I did manage to still get close to the calorie intake. I also used fish oil (omega 3) and protein supplements as the book prescribed. I believe that my results might have been better if the program I followed focused more on the heavier lifting with fewer reps, as I've done this since my program ended with good results. This is further proof to me that what works best for someone else may not be the best for me. Still, I found this program and its explanation of exercises very helpful, and it gave me the most success I have had in the gym.I will also note that I contacted the author (Rivera) by his noted email address in early 2006. I asked him a question about my nutritional options, and he responded the next day. I was very impressed by this - especially since he was able to comment on my dietary limitations.Overall, I believe this program (and book) would be a good one for a moderately experienced gymmer who has not found success with the standard 3 sets of 10 reps. The lighter weight, volume training phase did not work for me, but it might for you. I also believe that this program might be frustrating to those who work out at a busy gym. The program's supersets might be too difficult to pull off in a crowded gym with limited equipment. Still, I dedicated six or seven months to following this program, and I don't regret it."},{"Title":"The Hardgainer's Body Building Handbook: Workouts, Nutrition, and Results","review":"The success I'm having with this book amazes me. I'm on week 12 of the 21-week training program and my thigh measurement has increased one inch (2.54 centimeters). My lats have grown incredibly too - thicker.As background: I'm 49 years old. I've been skinny. I've seriously followed several bodybuilding routines, with varying degress of success. I know success when I see it. The exercise plan in this book (chapter 3) is the most successful I've ever followed.Other reviews of this book have mentioned frustration with access to equipment during busy times at their gym. Yes, it's true the exercise plan uses supersets. (Rant) But frustration with your overcrowded gym is NOT a limitation of this book. (End Rant) I'll admit to swearing under my breath when some pretty young thing sets up housekeeping on equipment I want to use. I've gotten pretty good at flaring my lats a little, smiling, and asking to jump-in for just one more set. These supersets work for me and I'm sticking with 'em.The chapter for 'Mass Building Nutrition' was somewhat interesting. It caused me to make minor adjustments. As opinion, I believe it might be a bad choice for me (at age 49) to begin eating +4,000 calories daily. I've begun gaining about 1 pound (0.453592 kg) each week. As opinion, I believe this gain comes from (A) doing less cardio and (B) allowing more recovery time between days when I lift. That being said - I admire the way the nutrition chapter is laid out. I wish the information for developing a meal plan had been available to me 25 years ago - back when 4,000 calories would've been a good choice for growing.BOTTOM LINE: This book delivered what it promised. This book genuinely is for the guy who has tried everything to bulk up, but nothing has worked."},{"Title":"The Hardgainer's Body Building Handbook: Workouts, Nutrition, and Results","review":"I'm not a hard gainer (a skinny guy having difficulty putting on muscle) but I bought this book to look over the methodology and exercises.When the book came, I was very impressed with the size.

I bought this book after stumbling across an ad on the internet about hardgainers and finally figured out that I am one. I had been sick with IBS for years and now have it cured\\\\under control I wanted to stop the ridicule and teasing about my size. Being called \\"skinny\\" is just as bad as being called \\"fat\\". Both words are offensive to the person being called it.After reading the book, I felt well enough to try it. I gained 1.5-2 lbs a day for 6 weeks and not fat, MUSCLE! I started at 162 lbs and peaked out at 186 lbs in 6 weeks and then it stopped. I haven't been able to gain anymore, I was hoping to get over 200 lbs maybe a bit realistic and impossible for a 41 year old but I wanted to try. I have since settled down to 176 lbs and have a nice build which my wife appreciates. I still hope to gain a bit more but i've started to have issues with the whey weight gain shake mixes and have to lay off them, switch brands etc. it's been over 6 months and I'm looking for other books to compare to to see if there is something I can kickstart the gain again.I e-mailed Hugo shortly after the weight gain stopped, never did get a reply.Since this review, I read the book Scrawny to Brawny.

The rountines are already laid out for you, and they show that Rivera deeply understands principles of building strength and mass. His rountines apply principles of periodization and they're very effective for increasing strength, size and improving your overall physical condition.If you want intense workouts that will help you reach your genetic potential, this book is for you. One of the best out there. Others that I would highly recommend are Pavel's Power to the People and Bompa's Serious Strength Training.

This is a comprehensive review of all five Omen books, i.e. The Omen (David Seltzer), Damien: Omen II (Joseph Howard), The Final Conflict: Omen III, (Gordon McGill), Armageddon: Omen IV (Gordon McGill) and The Abomination: Omen V ( Gordon McGill). Amazon.com also lists Damien: Omen Book II by David Seltzer. This I believe is a mistake and to my knowledge, Seltzer has authorwed only the original and the second sequel was by Joseph Howard. There is another book titled The Anti Christ:After the Omen by Frank Allnutt, though it is not connected with the series and is rather a behind the scenes look at the writing of Omen, the making of the movie, and the bizarre things that happened during filming.The Omen Series are the best of horror novels I have ever read. \\"Omen\\" was the story of the birth of Damien, the son of Satan. It followed the life of the devil child as a toddler. In Part II we find Damien now a teenager, who has slowly realized the potential of his power, and in Final Conflict, Damien is a young man, U.S. Ambassador to United Kingdom, who is slowly gearing up for world power. These three books, the original trilogy is a superior horror story, that will chill and thriller the horror lover. However, I believe that Part IV and V were an afterthought. After the death of Damien in Part III, book IV begins with the story of Damien's posthumous son, and the story ends with his end in Part V. The books were without mincing words boring, though I liked Part V better than IV. Again, the movie Omen IV has no bearing with the movie Omen IV (Omen IV: The Awakening was written by Harry Bernhard & Brian Taggerd and I believe no book version is available.)"},{"Title":"Omen 5: Abomination (Signet)","review":"Great sequel What else can I say?

I have often wondered if these two books by Gordon Mcgill were based upon what the original movie plan had been. Consider this: In Omen I Bugenhagen gave explicit instructions on how to use the 7 daggers. Specifically the first extinquished life and the others were to be placed in the shape of a cross on hallowed ground. At the end of The Final Conflict this did not happen and it is only in this book that the correct procedure is applied. I personally think these books would have made much better movies than the wretched Omen IV on the USA network a few years later."},{"Title":"Omen 5: Abomination (Signet)","review":"Investigative writer's next project is a biography of Damien Thorn, former AntiChrist.

The accounts detail what the residents like and don't like about Ocracoke living, the reasons some have transplanted themselves there and their predictions and hopes about the island's future in this age of soaring real estate prices and commercial over development.The book provides a very interesting look at the Ocracoke island life from those who have lived it."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"Amazon has 50+ reviews of How Israel Lost, The Four Questions (HIL), so why another? This review is unique: zero comments on accuracy, errors, and the author's slant; no pro- or anti- comments about Israel and \\"the conflict.\\" Those opinions are yours to make after your read.Independent of your interest (or lack of interest) in Israel, reading HIL serves another major purpose: It forces the reader to confront current US issues with new insight. This additional audience should easily exceed the number of all past readers.HIL is a fast, easy, enlightening, exciting, but very disturbing read; it challenges whatever givens, knowns, or truths you hold. It reminds that \\"...Harry Truman spoke about his opponent: \`It's not what he doesn't know that bothers me. It's what he knows for sure that's just plain wrong.'\\" (WMDs in Iraq!)Attack HIL with openness, keeping in mind the many major US issues of today: The US Military in Iraq and many other countries around the world; W's campaign statements, his Presidential decisions, and current priorities; US immigration problems and border security; laws passed by Congress over recent decades, especially thousands of pages of tax law exceptions to income; corporate conduct since the spread of Globalization; special interest groups and their well-paid lobbyists; decisions of courts: federal or state, criminal, civil, bankruptcy, appeal; and a major new concern: the possible tribalization of the US populace.Tribes are the top level of clan, kin, and families (or, in the US, special interest groups with a clear and common interest). Their goal is to maximize their take, whether measured in wives, animals, land, money, power, or influence, without regard for the greater good.HIL is hard hitting and questions everything. In Israel, they \\"...got addicted to cheap labor in every industry ... owners and managers ... hiring their own political prot&eacute;g&eacute;s and ordering the rest to toe the line - or else.\\" Today in the US, like in Israel, \\"...The big problem is, nothing spreads faster than a few little exceptions ... to the rule of law, ...[and] cohesion started breaking apart. ... Well. We'll deal with that later. This is war!\\" For Israel, the war is the conflict; for the US, it's W's worldwide war on terror.HIL is about Israel and \\"the conflict,\\" but is timely and relevant to many current US situations. The ...\\"grace and glue of ... society, which is honor; ...its absence is shame. ... In fact, without an awareness of honor, nothing can be made to stick - and nothing can be understood. When honor comes into conflict with facts - once again, honor is trump. ... Everybody [goes] back to business as usual ... there are powerful interests that prefer, instead, ... getting rich in the status quo ... [where] the muscle is money ... [and] the cheesy scrip of fear. It's easy to manufacture - easier still to put in circulation. [The] ruling elite ... they think [their] own thoughts ... they all come from the same old school ... wield all the power of government in Israel ... [and are] producing the terror that she claims to be fighting.\\"Sounds very much like the status quo in the US! Read HIL; you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"I read about 2 books on Israel-Palestine every week and had this in my wish list for whatever reason, and finally decided to order it. I read it in about 2 days and was pleasantly surprised throughout the book. I expected a generic interpretation of the conflict but instead stumbled upon a courageous and thorough book. He details what he considers to be the four main issues to wish Israel has utterly failed, namely why Palestinians do not have a state, why there is no peace, what is the meaning of a Jewish state, and what function Israel wishes to fulfill as a state. He details each of the problems as well as possible solutions to their intractable nature. I will not spoil the book by giving his answers, but will simply say he attacks all sides to the conflict in a very honest way. He does not pull his punches and even considering the background, the second intifada, he does not back down in his analysis.I highly recommend the book to those interested, you will not be disappointed, unless you are looking for generic apologist dribble."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"I enjoyed reading this book because it has honesty and real facts. It recognizes that the Palestinians deserve to live in dignity and honor but unfortunately such need is not expressed in other books or medias, I applaud the writer for his non-partisan stand in this case and I hope that people would buy books like this one to see the reality of the daily sufferance of the Palestinian people."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"This is a very accessible and sensible look at the conflict - very readable, does an excellent job of debunking many of the myths/propaganda that surrounds the struggle. Cramer provides an extensive background of the history involved, yet without turning it into a boring recitation. He criticizes the Israeli and Palestinian leadership equally for their responsibilites for the lack of progress, and yet is clearly on the side of those who say the Israeli occupation is the cause of the horror. The personal stories, his personal experiences in the region add a humanizing element that connects the conflict with its effect on real people. Hopefully this book will get people talking honestly and openly about the worst human rights issue of the past 35+ years. I think Cramer deserves another Pulitzer for this book - read it, and judge for yourself."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"A necessary addition to the pantheon of books on Israeli-Palestinian relations. Those who try to brand the author a &quot;self-hater&quot; or &quot;anti-semite&quot; or &quot;Arafat supporter&quot; have not read it or will not listen to anything critical of Israeli policy. The Arafat described in this book is a malign thug who asks young men to do his dirtywork while he grants favors, more mafioso than liberator. He has a willing counterpart in the Sharon described here, whose entire power base is dependant on continuing both the Arab apartheid and the conflict.Mr Ben Cramer has spent a great deal of time in Israel, both the 1948 settlements and the &quot;occupied&quot; zones. He clearly demonstrates how the occupation of lands won in the six-day war led to a fracturing of Israeli society, ending what had been a Social Republic and forming a tribal, disunited and reactionary state. There are also examples in the book on how the Israeli business climate is now dependant on fostering the continuing struggle and how Israeli society is unable to adapt to a peace setting. The book rightly condemns atrocities by both Arabs and Israelis, with many harrowing examples from both sides. Recommended for all concerned citizens with an open mind, it does not demonize but illuminates."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"This book explains the Palestinian-Israeli conflict by telling the individual stories of people living in Israel and the occupied territories. Written prior to Arafat's death, the author concludes that peace will not happen because it is not in the interest of the people in power in Israel and with the PLO. After reading this book, I have a much better understanding of news articles about the conflict."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"I bought this book when Richard Ben Cramer died and people raved about his writing. He is a good writer, but even though I agree with his perspective the anecdotes fail to hold together as a whole.

It is about the way in which the conflict has turned a cohesive, idealistic society into something else -- splintered, cynical, and tragic. And it is a cautionary tale for all of us here in the US -- a well-meaning country trying to occupy and police a people it doesn't understand. If this conflict has hurt Israel's standing in the world, it has also hurt ours. Read this and you will understand why.

It's a terribly written, factually inaccurate, deeply biased account that reduces Jews and Palestinians alike to simplistic, cartoonish stereotypes. Anyone familiar with the complexity of this conflict will be repulsed by this offensive, journalistic vulgarization. The mainstream reviewers have it right."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"This inaccurate and misleading book tries to make two completely invalid points, first that Israel is very, very important and second that Israel is very, very wrong.Cramer also implies that Israel is propped up by American money to the extent that it could not exist if it had to compete for itself in the real world. The truth is that Israelis are very productive and in peacetime would be a strong economic power without any help from anyone. Cramer knows that the 3 billion dollars we give to Israel each year is peanuts. That it is less than two per cent of their gross domestic product. And that much of it is given in US-made arms, and is never seen as money at all. And he knows that the money is far less than what we give to Western European nations, via NATO, or to Japan or Korea. But he doesn't tell us that!Cramer tells us that Israel is important enough so that all it has to do is give away a little land and there will be peace in a major conflict! Well, it just isn't that important, just as Czechoslovakia was not all that important in 1938. Cramer tells us that all Israel has to do is give away a little land and it will end all the killing. Well, if that is true, Israel is indeed very wrong. And if it is obviously true, then the Israelis, who aren't stupid, realize it as well. And if they avoid making peace in spite of realizing this, it is clear that the only reason they could have for doing so is that they are so weird that they would prefer to be poor and dead than rich, alive, and at peace. In spite of trying so hard to better their lives that they made the deserts bloom!So we can be sure Cramer is wrong. And, of course, given his wrong answer, it isn't surprising that his facts are off as well.Israeli paranoia is not the \\"justification\\" for the existence of Israel any more than Czech paranoia is a \\"justification\\" for the Czech Republic or Thai paranoia for Thailand. We know why Israel exists. It's because Jews wanted to be there and paid high prices for land, and then found out explicitly in 1939, with the British White Paper, that the land would be stolen from them (and that their lives would be at grave risk) unless they had a nation that let them keep their property and admit immigrants. So Cramer is wrong about why Israel exists.You might want to see what books Cramer lists as recommended in his acknowledgements. There are a few by reasonable authors, such as by Michael Oren, Walter Laquer, Amos Elon, Zev Chafets, and Yigal Allon. But most of the rest are by outright propagandists for Arab terror, such as Mahmoud Abbas, Hanan Ashrawi, Noam Chomsky, Norman Finkelstein, Baruch Kimmerling, and Ed Said. These works are intentionally misleading. So is Ben Cramer's."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"Cramer claims that Begin was as Polish as John Paul 2. Huh? Begin was Jewish with lots of Syrian blood. John was Polish with presumably only a little neolithic Syrian blood the kind pointed out by genetic scientist Spencer Wells in his excellent Journey of Man book. Of course Cramer could have meant in attitude Begin was as Polish as John but this is doubtful also as I know something about Begin's background and he was Jewishly religiously raised to quite a degree more than John presumably. On other matter, I disagree with what Cramer said about Jews not being as rich as American oilman."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"Richard Ben Cramer, whose previous books include biographies of Ted Williams and Joe DaMagio reveals a monumental ignorance of the Middle East, in this dull, poorly written book. He fails to mention the 3 nos of Khartoum &quot; no negotiation, no recognition ,no peace&quot; with which the Arab States answered Israel's forthcoming offer to evacuate the territories in 1967.His choice of title is interesting. It apparently refers to the four questions in the Passover Seder. The motif of four runs throughout this symbolic meal. There is also the 4 sons, one of whom the evil son, who sepperated himself from the fate of his people &quot; if he was there he would not have been redeemed&quot;. &quot;And those who would understand will understand&quot;!"},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"Richard Ben Cramer as so many others seek to delve into the conflict in the Middle East between the Palestinians and the Caucasians who came to occupy their land. So the Caucasians proclaim historical rights, slaughter the people and now call the land Israel. Palestinians are now hopeless on many counts, and by any means available they try to get their land back. Words have meaning so they are not freedom fighters or liberators but terrorists. When the Caucasian Jews were blowing up hotels and causing misery elsewhere, as in Lebanon, they were accommodated. They were offered land elsewhere but refused it. Instead they chose land that was already occupied. Certainly they have failed all four questions. It is not all that complicated an issue. This book is entertaining and informational though a bit biased. The fundamental point is that Israel has no right to exist in a humane world. It is a terrorist state. There would be a lot less tension in the world if Israel and Ariel Sharon did not exit."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"The author of this book says that the Middle East conflict can be solved in five minutes by anyone with half - a- brain. Many veteran citizens of the Middle East, historians who have studied the subject for years, people of good will who have striven to make peace (among them the vast majority of the citizens of Israel) hearing this can only wonder if Mr. Cramer has any brain at all.This book is a scandalous piece of defamation of a country which has struggled for its existence with great courage and decency ever since its founding.

In light of the recent PBS Frontline special on the recent election in Israel and on the stunning reversal of the newly elected leader with even Sharon (before his coma)on returning occupied territories the book is right on for understanding today. This book explains it all from an insider of sorts. Cramer gives us examples from his own reporter type interviews. He is Jewish yet seems to empathize with both the Palestinian and Jewish sides. It is not meant to be a scholarly history(although he does document who he is talking to) it is like a conversation with a friendly knowledgeable insider and has answered \\"what were they thinking and why?\\" on the sometimes, to me, unexplainable positions and actions of today. It was a fast and interesting very interesting read."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"This is an amazing inside view of the Israeli nation. R. J. Cramer revisited the land after decades and describes the change in mood and spirit its people have undergone. Many may think of this report as an overly clinical assessment, which is one-sided and too liberal, but I found it informative in many different aspects just the same. It describes the disillusionment present among its various groups as well as among American Jews and the decline of past nobility and naive idealism of how Israel \\"ought to be\\". He is critical of Ehud Barak's settlement offer to Arafat at the Camp David Conference in 2000 and describes it as euphemistic and unacceptable. He speaks of the poverty rate among the Palestinians living in a land dissected by settlements, highways and checkpoints. With equal cynicism he mentions \\"the gaggle of thugs and thieves\\" Arafat brought back from Tunisia. Intriguing is his description of the different Israeli population groups or \\"tribes\\", as he call them, who live in sequestered communities and neither speak with nor understand one another. The reader learns about those who do most of the manual work, those who run the show, those who are the \\"tanks-and-torah hardliners\\", and those who \\"free-load off the state\\". Cramer's description of the Arab concept of a \\"sulha\\" mediator and his task of restoring the all-important honor of an Arab's family and tribe is most instructive in understanding the mindset of the Arabs in this conflict. There is a raft of further lessons the non-Israeli reader learns from this book.I am certain there are more loving and laudatory accounts of that land and it has generated lively disagreement, but it is obvious that here is an author who did no more than consider, with deep concern, the challenges and problems faced by his own people."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"If you're curious but uninformed and want to understand the Israel-Palestinian conflict, this is a good book for you. Along the way to understanding what drives some of the issues in the West Bank and Gaza, Ben Cramer will have you laughing out loud (and crying sometimes) with some wonderful little stories that help illustrate his points. In fact, given the seriousness of the topic, you may be caught offguard early in the book by some of his offhandedness. I found myself rereading passages, thinking \\"does he really mean what he's saying\\". But once I realized he intended to inject some lightheartedness into the subject, then I relaxed and really enjoyed the book.I borrowed this book first from the library and liked it so much, I bought one on Amazon."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"This is a courageous (indeed it is always courageous when anyone speaks in opposition to any of Israel's policies) attempt to uncover the truth behind what's going on Israel. Cramer is actually critical of both sides, and his easy to read style makes the book flow so quickly and easily that you'll want to finish it the day you start it."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"Cramer hits on what EVERY American I know is feeling. No part of the Israeli government actually wants peace. Nor do the leaders in the U.S, nor to Hamas, and frankly, we are sick of it. If the leadership is incapable, the UN should send forces.All of you critics out there should be very carefull, because if there was a vote today among U.S citizens about whether or not Israel is even capable of dealing with this situation, there would be blue helmets on the ground by noon. We bombed Yugoslavia for less then what Israel has done.We are also sick of everytime someone says something critical that the ONLY thing most rightwing Israelis can even come up with, is that it is Anti-Semetic.What most of you rightwingers do not understand is, we want Israel to exist. But we also think Israel needs to draw a border and stick to it. Settlers and occupation will lead to the loss of support of most Americans, and the failing of the Israeli dream in the end.I watched Cramer last night on Cspan, and I admire his courage to take on the real issue and say what most people will not."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"This book is a wonderful introduction to the conflict -- like having a knowledgeable friend tell you what's really going on. It's so hard to trust a lot of the rhetoric. So often any principled criticism of Israel is dismissed as anti-semitic, as you can see in some of the wackier reviews on this page, so it's hard to find out what's really going on unless you read the Israeli papers, which are a lot more fair. Richard Ben Cramer is a great writer and is hard on BOTH sides. He cuts through so many myths, and his writing is always a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"Richard Ben Cramer, almost inspite of himself, has written a very hard book, after years as a mid east correspondent he has obviously had enough with the unbelieveable ignorance and misquided accounts of the Isarel-Palestine conflict available to most US citizens. The criticisms leveled at this book are to be expected in this country where there almost seems to be a conspiracy to keep people from knowing what most of the world already knows, that the palestinians are a mostly incarcerated people, this is a settler colonial occupation with the explicit intent of removing the Palestinians from their land and the US is directly responsible for supporting Israeli depredations against the Palestinians, indeed, Israel floats on a sea of US money and would not be a viable state save for the US. This could easily change, as Cramer points out, if there is a just peace and real normalcy returns to the region. Villifying the Palestinians in this matter is like villifying American Indians for attacking outpost families, 130 years later, almost everyone except for wacked reactionaries admit the terrible harm done to the Indians, too late of course. The problem here is that this occupation, and the main point of Cramer's book, is that this occupation is not only killing the Palestinians, but Israel too, its a terribly hard place to be and getting worse."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"It is clear that this book will raise hackles among the many zionists and their supporters who can't bear any criticism of Israel. But this book is a fond and worried look at what the occupation has done to a country the author clearly loves. Beautifully written and constructed, it is even funny at times, but never at the expense of real people, for whom the author has utmost compassion and care. We support Israel to the tune of some $3 billion a year, and it is up to us, the US, to call them to account for their actions, to be what we once said we were -- an honest broker -- not the terribly partisan, and thus hamstrung, unquestioning partner to Israel's self-destructive policies we have become."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"The title promises controversy, but the text delivered by a Pulitzer Prize winning author is warm and humorous. It examines public concern for a tiny state, the lack of Palestinian statehood, the nature of a religious state, and the lack of peace in an episodic narrative that's impossible to put down. This is a rare and refreshing account of subjects too often relegated by others to dry polemics."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"This book is terrific! Richard Ben Cramer is the first mainstream author to finally tell the truth about the Middle East conflict, without all of the usual piety and cant. He tells the story from the outside, as an objective observer, seeing both sides with humor and compassion. Read the great Israeli intellectual and bestselling author Amos Elon in the New York Review of Books, who agrees completely with Cramer's analysis, and says the story has never been told so well."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"I bought this book with an open mind, and was sorely disappointed. The author is so nasty toward Judaism and Jewish pride. The whole book is filled with cynicism and anger. My advice: Don't waste your time or money on this."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"If anything, \\"How Israel Lost\\" is not a wise and courageous book as another reviewer penned. It is an hand-wringing apology for Palestinian terrorism.Ben Cramer argues that Israel is losing its soul by occupying Judea-Samaria aka the West Bank. But he convienently ignores or whitewashes Arafat's decision to reject Barak's offer of a virtual Palestinian state encompassing almost all of the territories and even the unheard of offer to divide Israel's capital Jerusalem in favor of the murder, mayhem and terror that has engulfed Israel and the territories since September 2000.Even now Arafat's handpicked cronies cannot summon up either the courage or the will to put down the genocidal bombers, even as Ariel Sharon is willing to use force to dismantle Jewish settlements. Cramer barely addresses this in his paean to Peace Now.When nearly 90% of Palestinians still favor the eradication of Israel and its Jewish population, then books like Cramer's are useless. For the real facts and opinions, read Dershowitz's \\"A Case for Israel\\". Dershowitz, like Cramer is a Liberal, and is willing to see the Palestinian side of the coin, but unlike Cramer rightly places the blame for the end of peace on the shoulders of Arafat, Abbas, Qurei, Ashrawi and the rest of the PLO thugs.Cramer may be an excellent sports writer, but he is a babe in the woods when it comes to the Israel-Arab conflict. Stick to Babe Ruth, fella, not Arafat."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"The book is biased and innaccurate. Yes, he appears to give both sides' views...but the &quot;pro-Israeli&quot; viewpoints are patronizing and usually turn out to be anti-Israel in tone.example: &quot;... and that poor Mr. Klinghoffer, who got shoved off the cruise ship in his wheelchair ... as usual, the Palestinians undermined their own cause with thorough efficiency.) &quot;Here you see the mocking tone....&quot;poor Mr. Klinghoffer..&quot;...and then his critique of the Palestinians is not that there is something wrong with their ideology that allows terrorism, but that that pesky terrorism is sometimes keeping them from their goals....The book is error ridden in areas that show he has no depth of knowledge. A small example. He descibes The Israel Defense Forces after the Yom Kippur war as looking &quot;hapless and needy.&quot; Yes, Israel's intelligence and leadership was sorely lacking in that war but every analysis of the military that you can buy at Amazon describes their performace as extraordinary...much better than the 6 day war.... The Arabs were better trained and equiped and had total surprise (leadership/intelligence errors0 and the war ended with the UN stopping the fighting before Israel could get to Cairo and Damascus.Cramer's emphasis on aid given to Israel is presented in a very inflammatory manner. Even aid to Egypt is described as a payoff so that they will tolorate Israel.This book is really poor on all fronts. It is a point of view, an editorial argument... not the unbiased analysis that is touted."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"As someone who lives in Israel and thinks that there's lots of room for improvement here, I was very disappointed by this book.It is full of errors. This isn't historical fiction, the whole thesis of the book should be built on facts not errors.I get the impression that Mr Cramer studied this highly complex subject for a few months, decided he was an expert, and wrote a book.Believe me there are no simple answers."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"Review of \\"HOW ISRAEL LOST\\", by Richard Ben Cramer.It is said you can teach an parrot to become a reasonably good economist by training it to reply \\"Supply and Demand\\" to any economic question put to it.Now put to Cramer just one question, not 4, and he will answer: \\"Occupation\\" and so hope to elevate himself an expert on the Arab-Israeli Conflict. I hope you are not fooled.\\"It's the Occupation, Stupid!\\" Who doesn't love a simple, easily graspable idea that seems to explain so much? Cramer has been taken in by it. So he wrote a book.The truth of the matter is Cramer doesn't know what he's talking about. He writes as a yiddisher hipster thinking that will make him an insider understandable to \\"the tribe\\" but his work is devoid of serious , and certainly not, scholarly thought and reflection. His bibliography clearly shows he has not yet read enough of writers who take the issue seriously. His writing can be read as copy for a newspaper column with cute, smart-alack comments, lot's of \\"sound and fury\\" , meaning nothing, and making all manner of accusations, charges, or claims without fear of slander that is intended to amuse and endear himself to the casual newspaper reader, the mark of a good adversarial journalist, quick with a sassy line.I enjoyed reading the book, nevertheless, only because I know the facts and issues that permit Cramer to egregiously oversimplify and draw conclusions that contain an slim element of truth on which he can pretend to know more than he writes about.Yes, occupations are not nice and can debilitate. According to International Law, an occupation by a warring victor is not illegal, except if it is \\"too long\\". Every Israeli will tell you the occupation is too long. So what has Cramer discovered?[ As an aside, the United State has occupied the territory of Puerto Rico for 100 years and no one in the United Nations seems to complain They get away with it by making Puerto Ricans second-class citizens. Can you believe that? But I digress.]Yes, one can recite terribly anguishing anecdotes of suffering by innocent people on either side, as Cramer does, sometimes out of proportion to the point he wants to make, his but pointing to that fact does not elevate the sad descriptions to a level validating his basis for drawing the conclusions Cramer makes. One must keep in mind he's writing as a Journalist, not as scholar.Yes, there has been deceit , anger, fraud, corruption, and all manner of unforgivable behavior by many principal actors in the MidEast Conflict. One cannot wrap all this up and say \\"occupation\\" and not be thought a simpleton.As to Cramer work, I have read a dozen reviews of the book but when the reviewer allows Cramer to be short on fact and history I know I'm wasting my time reading all the accolades one can give him. I did not buy the book to become a fan of Cramer. I wanted to read his argument on the statement \\"How Israel Lost\\". As I last checked, Israel is well, alive and fighting .He's absolutely wrong in phrasing it in the past tense. It may be a journalist's catchy title and generate sales, but reading will reveal the writer is without clothes. That's a pity.Good writing is not a substitute for truth and penetrating analysis.

He presents a particular view that sees only from that one, incomplete, perspective.

Essentially, the book is full of mistakes, some so essential that you can't help but wonder wether the author really has any clue at all. Some are so basic that it starts to look as if they're not merely mistakes but indeed intentionally misleading or just outright lies.The book is rubbish, and fit for consumption only for those who've already made up their mind and still think Arafat is right up there with Ghandi as a Nobel Peaceprize winner."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"I gave it two stars instead of one because \\"Ben-Cramer\\" (mocking Israeli names like \\"Ben-Gurion\\"?) does do a good job of presenting a true understanding of what goes thru the minds of those on both sides of the conflict. But while I, also, question the value of endless, mindless Jewish (or other) rituals, I can see that \\"Ben-Cramer\\" has an underlying bias that Judaism and Israel are bad with maybe some positive elements. I would argue the truth is the other way around. He throws out the baby with the bathwater! He downplays the security concerns that come with giving up the disputed territory. And he seems to try to justify Arab-caused atrocities by pointing out that this is how they claim honor while hinting strongly that most Israeli-caused atrocities are done on purpose.Finally, \\"Ben-Cramer\\" seems to blame the Jews for the downsides of capitalism in Israel, which come in ANY capitalistic society. His mocking use of Yiddish/Hebrew/English Slang pretty much exposes his bias claiming that Israel and Jews are the problem. I would argue that certainly many of Israel's problems are indeed self-induced, but what society isn't this way? \\"Ben-Cramer's\\" basic hypothesis is wrong: there is no moral equivalent between Arab terrorism and the use of the Palestinians as pawns by their Arab brethren with securing the Jewish homeland."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"There has to be some rejoinder to the inexplicably positive reviews over this book. One place to begin is with Elena Lappin's review in the Sunday May 23, 2004 NY Times Book Review, page 15. In fact, on page 14 is a review of a book that I would recommend as an antidote to Cramer's claptrap, David Horowitz's &quot;Still Life with Bombers: Israel in the Age of Terrorism.&quot; One may start Cramer's description of the NY Times as &quot;the former house organ of American Zionism&quot; Really? I regard the Times, which I read everyday, as viciously anti-Israel, a sentiment that is widely shared by fellow Jews inside Israel and New York.One's views of the Times aside, Cramer's polemic description of it is as out of place in a purporedly serious work as it is wrong. And that's only the warm up: the scandalously inaccurate accusations over the incidents in Jenin have been repeatedly refuted with pictures and retractions, but Cramer seems not to have the slightest interest in going beyond propaganda put out by Arafat and the Arab League at the time. Other examples of Cramer's shameless Arab fawning and ignorance are given by Ms. Lappin. This book is crap and should be called that. It is self-haters like Cramer that are lost."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"Pat Buchanan recommends this book.

For this middle-aged, comfortable Christian American who has gone along since grade school with the, \\"Israel is like us and that's why we support them\\" line, the book was inciteful. The straightforward Four Questions are a great jumping-off point for clarification and discussion of the issues for those of us who haven't until now found the energy to delve into them.I gotta say, though, that I would have taken this book more seriously if it hadn't seemed rushed-to-print. (Was Cramer trying to get it out before the election?) Open to a page, any page, and you'll find ellipse after ellipse - and hyphen after hyphen. Some may claim this technique is \\"conversational,\\" but I call it distracting and just plain lazy. Furthermore, I'm no dumbie, but I found myself stopping constantly to reread sentences, not because they were so erudite, but because they were poorly written. Finally, while the glossary was nice, I would have preferred an index.All criticism of style aside, I'm so glad I read this book prior to the election of Abbas as the new President of the PA.Now, thanks to this book, instead of skipping over those daily boring newspaper articles on \\"the conflict,\\" I can read them with interest and some understanding."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"In the West, this book title is a big hit, since it defies the mainstream, blind support for Israel and indifference to the Palestinians. That is not so in the Islamic or Arab worlds. Muslims would ask this entirely different set of questions:Why Israel should not exist?A: Because God does not assign property based on faith.Why is there no peace without Islam?A: Because Islamic justice is superior to democratic justice.Why is there no need for imposed geographical borders between the same peoples?A: Because territorial conflicts consume human resources and ignite unnecessary wars.Why America plays the obsolete role of past British colonialism?A: Because of ignorance of international history and of different cultures.Yet, the author's upbringing in a liberal society (New York and Maryland), in addition to the lack of exposure to religious indoctrination, made him able to use penetrating humor and sarcasm in his analysis of the politics of the Jews and Arabs of the Middle East. The author focuses his microscope on four main questions that concern many Jewish Americans; with a hopeful intent to find solution, that saves Israel the fate of many previous lost nations, (the Turks, British, Romans, Greek, and Egyptians are few to mention).(1) In the chapter \\"Why do we care about Israel?\\"The author rebuts the claims that Israel is a foothold for the West in the Middle East and proceeded to claim that, without Israel, America would have better relationships with the Arabs. Though he attributes the blind support of America to Israel to the cleverness of the Israeli propaganda, he dismisses entirely the crucial roles of few Jewish congressmen, senators, governors, and influential figures in influencing the government foreign policy. His claim that Jews also protest against Israel does ignore the little impact of that protests on the government policy, compared to the influence of key zealous policy makers.(2) In the chapter, \\"Why don't the Palestinians have a state?\\"The author blames both sides but forgets to recognize that the Palestinians have no Air Force, no Army, and no weapons. Without force, no one would give them a state. The similarity with Russia and the independence of the Ukraine, Georgia, etc. does not hold, since Russia has plenty of resources that Israel does not have, in addition, Israel is run by religious nuts, with whom negotiation is fruitless. Israel did not give up Sinai without a fight and would not give the Palestinians a state without a fight.(3) In the chapter \\"What is a Jewish state?\\"The author presents very compelling explanation for why sticking \\"Judaism\\" to the state of Israel was a big mistake. Even Saudi Arabia did not make that mistake. King Saud named his kingdom the \\"The Saudi Arab Kingdom\\" in order to avoid implementing strict Islamic laws that would deprive the royal family from its illegitimate wealth that resulted from stealing public wealth. Thus, Israel has to live with the sin of feeding religious zealotry, which did nothing than creating counter forces of Islamic zealotry.(4) In the chapter, \\"Why is there no peace?\\"While the author has focused on the complacency of both sides, Israeli and Arabs, and the loss of national interest that is replaced by tribal and personal interests, the author has abandoned the wrong premises, on which Israel was built, as the major cause for the absence of peace. As the author has stated in other chapters, the confliction between \\"state democracy\\" and \\"religious domination\\" is the cause for permanent war.(a) Israel claims to aspire for democracy but denies the right of return to the original inhabitants of the land, replacing them with Jews from allover the world. Thus, this is a form of newly engineered democracy for a selected race of people.(b) Israel panders to the ultra-orthodox Jews, thus invokes strong anger among the Muslims and urges many of them to resort to the literal meaning of the Koran in order to restore their lost glory.The book concludes with a wishful hope that secures a piece of land for Jews to live free. How would that happen when the entire Middle East is flooded with tyranny and injustice that is condoned by the Western governments? Israel's only hope is capitulating to the reality of modern science and abandoning the delusion of religion.Mohamed F.

I truly recommend it to anyone who is not satisfied with the media coverage.I respect the author for being honest and brave to tell stories that few journalists would touch. These topics seem to be taboos for average journalists and I think Mr. Ben Cramer being Jewish helps in many ways.I very much appreciated learning more about the people of Israel. All we hear about in the media is the bombing statistics on the two sides. But this book describes ordinary and some not so ordinary people and their lives, as well.This book is very easy to read, as I think the author has full grasp of the topic."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"Four simple questions are given in this book. Why A Jewish State? Why no Palestinian State? Why do we care? Why is their no peace? The book then precedes to answer these questions. Many characters are brought in and many characters are quickly glossed over with aside comments, such as Tommy Lapid. References are made to infamous statements such as \`break their Bones' by Mr. Rabin. A whirlwind of information is sifted through, presupposing either that the reader is knowledgeable or gullible about the subject. And this is where the \`evidence' and the argument begins to unravel.The major drawback of this kind of book is that it gives the arm chair \`I could solve that' interpretation of events. Although background is given and fair shirking is given to both sides, for instance admitting that the Palestinian protests are over-emotional and the \`human rights' groups predictably overreact, there is still a slight bias against Israel. Unlike \\"Right to Exist' this book presupposes certain elements that are not entirely accurate. For instance the argument about peace is boiled down to \`Why didn't Barak give that three percent back' as if allowing the Palestinians stewardship over the Temple Mount would bring peace or tranquility, which it would not.As for the whirlwind tour through why Israel exists and why we care the book is perhaps more fair. The idea that Israel is a \`bulwark of imperialism' is quickly debunked.But in the end one is left with a real feeling of pedestrianism with this read. For Israel enthusiasts or those familiar with the conflict and its many sides this book will not add much kindling to the fire. For those looking for an introduction \`Case for Israel' or \`Right to Exist' is a good companion to this volume. As another viewpoint in the literature on the conflict this is certainly a welcomed addition.Seth J.

When will you run for office or get assigned as an ambassador?! Here's to your success!!!"},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"Pulitzer Prize-winning author, Richard Ben Cramer, has committed a courageous but relatively unpopular act by writing this book. He does not seem to fear sacred cows. Cramer dares to discuss Israel's activities in the occupied territories and the viability of an independent Palestinian State, and by this very act, he impacts the boundaries of the Israeli Palestinian discussion. American Jews are concerned, primarily, with the preservation and security of Israel. But are Israeli leaders as concerned with the principles the state was founded on - the principles I believed in while growing up? \\"We shall be like a light unto the nations of the world,\\" is what I was taught. Israel was to be a beacon of hope and democracy in a hostile world. Cramer, through personal observation and challenging arguments, questions whether the Israelis, and Jews who support them, have forgotten their original high standards and goals. Are we failing ourselves as a people, as a nation? Cramer's narrative revolves around four questions, a modification of the Four Questions asked during the Passover seder: \\"Why do we care about Israel? Why don't the Palestinians have a state? What is a Jewish state? Why is there no peace?\\"Cramer believes that Israel, as the occupier, has become just as much a victim of the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza as the Palestinians. He argues that the enduring occupation has corrupted and corroded both Israeli and Arab societies. And he asks, is Israel losing her very soul? I don't know if Mr. Cramer is saying anything here that hasn't been discussed before. All I know is that he has consolidated many of my own thoughts and clarified various issues which have weighed heavily on me for over 30 years. The rise of the Knesset's right wing coalition is discussed at length. The Israeli Supreme Court is taken on for its failure to issue injunctions against demolitions, security checkpoints, land expropriations, torture and assassinations that impact the lives of dozens of innocents along with those targeted. How is it possible for a just and humane society to treat the Palestinians so harshly? And, yes, I can ask this while understanding the violence the Israelis have been subjected to for more than half a century.Cramer paints an extraordinary realistic portrait of the two societies, highlighting people and situations with his wonderful humor and humanism. He is at his best when giving advice to Ariel Sharon and Yasser Arafat!! His writing and observations are startlingly clear, and his ability to work well with languages lend vigor and flair to the blunt, honest narrative. His anecdotes and personal observations are what make this book so compelling.This is journalism at its best and bound to spark conflict and controversy. I, myself felt, and continue to feel, conflicted about the issues discussed here. I grew up in a secular, Zionist household - Zionism meaning, (to me), \\"a political movement holding that the Jewish people constitute a nation and deserve a national homeland - a return of the Jewish people to their homeland and the resumption of Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel.\\" The joining of Jews of all persuasions, left and right, religious and secular, to work together toward tangible and spiritual goals. On the one hand, the author articulately expresses some of my complex feelings and emotions about the Jewish State - many of the problems and paradoxes confronting it - the terrible malaise afflicting it. I relate to his disillusionment. On the other hand I am the first to argue, to defend, to blame the violence, the Intifadas, etc., for the actions of the Israeli government.In Cramer's words, \\"To me, it's an open-and-shut case: You can't ask two generations of your boys to act in the territories as the brutal kings of all they survey ('Break their bones,' was the order to his troops from the sainted Yitzhak Rabin, during the first Intifada -- six years before he became Israel's martyr to peace) -- and then expect those boys to come home, and live in lamblike gentleness as citizens, husbands, dads.\\"A must-read for anyone interested in this major issue which so strongly impacts the today's world.JANA"},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"For two years here in America I've been trying from time to time to convey Israeli/Palestinian reality to Americans, with partial success.

I thought to myself: one should write a whole book, just to bring reality in.It turns out someone just did. It is Richard Ben Cramer, who won a Pulitzer prize for his Israel and Middle East reporting in the late '70's and early '80's. Now he returned to the land, and was so dismayed by what he found that he named his book \\"How Israel Lost\\". The name is perhaps an overkill (forgive the pun) and makes the book less attractive to some.Forget the name. Go to the nearest library or bookstore and get it. The thing I liked most about it was the unromantic approach and the off-the-cuff language. That's the way people think, act, write and talk in Israel/Palestine. The typical American sugar-coated texts seem to remove the essence of what's going on. Cramer's definitely a \\"leftist\\" in the sense that he thinks Israel's out of line with the Occupation - no excuses accepted - but you won't find any romantic admiration of Israel's peace movement (or of the Palestinian cause) in his book. In fact, there's not a single Israeli peace activist there (as far as I can remember). And not because he wants to portray Israelis as warlike: Cramer is simply interested in the mainstream, a place where the peace movement does not exist anymore. As he aptly describes.The book is divided into 4 parts, to \\"answer\\" 4 questions like the 4 questions of Passover eve. Parts 1 and 3 look at Israel, part 2 at Palestine, and part 4 wraps them up together. The first 3 parts are mostly based on individual stories. If by the end of part 1 you think Cramer is just another \\"self-hating anti-Israeli\\", hold your breath till part 2, where he lashes out equally harshly at the Palestinian leadership. In between he shows quite a bit of compassion and understanding to the people of both nations. He brings people, events and reports which are well-known (even iconic) to Israelis and Palestinians, but rarely make it past the American filters.As an Israeli I can testify that most of Cramer's analysis of Israel is right-on. He clearly has an insider's knowledge of the culture. Regarding Palestinians, I don't know enough to judge and seems like he too (as he admits) has less knowledge of them. Yet, the overall picture of \\"current status\\" in the land is by far the most reliable and accurate I've seen from an American, and his analysis places the ball squarely in... American and international hands.Which is another reason why you should go and read it. And if you like it, tell your friends. If enough people read this book, it might yet make a difference.ps: there are some inaccuracies in the book are regarding the wall/fence/barrier, but these seem to be mostly because at the time of the book's closing (late 2003), there was still a lot of uncertainty about what's going on. In fact, by now the fence/wall story has gone way worse than Cramer describes. The reasons for mild optimism he quotes at the end of the book have all but evaporated, while IDF Air commander, General Dan Halutz (who 'stars' in part 1) has been promoted to deputy chief of staff."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"Though Richard Ben Cramer's analysis would hardly raise eyebrows in Israel, where many people agree that the solution to the conflict -- if not the political will to achieve it -- is very simple, it is very difficult to discuss it in this country, where there is a very narrow definition, in public discourse, of what it means to be pro-Israel. Cramer believes, along with many Israeli intellectuals, that Israeli aggression against the Palestinians whose territory it has occupied since 1967, is hurting Israel, both militarily and morally. His beautiful stories about the victims on both sides of this tragedy are compassionate and compelling. The book has had rave reviews in the Denver Post, Washingtonian magazine, the Orlando Sentinel, Baltimore Sun, New York Review of Books (by the great Israeli intellectual Amos Elon), and other publications. But it's best to read it for yourself....you can't trust anyone to read a book on this subject and discuss it fairly and honestly. The argument is too polarized."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"The book is a breath of fresh air. It doesn't beat around the bush, and really gets to the point. Victories are not always material conquests, for I can say that our nation has truly lost its soul.Richard Ben-Cramer, a pulitzer prize winning journalist, would know best, for he has visited Israel in different stages in its development, and can compare and contrast the nation's ever changing (if not decaying) moral persona.To all his critics I say this, you can abuse him all you want, and throw at him phrases such as ever-worn out slurs of \\"Self-hating Jew\\". But atleast he fulfils a moral duty to make a case for positive change. For the many things he has proposed is much better then the suicidal status quo. Many people try to complicate matters that really have simple solutions. How many more deaths on both sides will it take to realize that maybe a COMPLETE end to the occupation is the starting point. But no, as the occupation has become an ego boost for many of our countrymen.I highly recommend this book, as it really is an eye-opener in many cases. May G-D pardon those who commit the henious crimes in the occupied territories, for our soldiers have become the standard international image of the ugly Israeli."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"For everyone who is tired of the polarisednature of the Middle East question this book(written by a Jewish American) is a superb antidote.--a) Its very easy to read - nice style and \\"un-put-downable\\".--b) It takes the discussion up to the level of human beings- their issues, their lives, their wants.

I see one common theme amongst all detractors - the closed mindedness of unwavering conviction - a common encounter when dealing with any criticism of the state of Israel . Having been to the West Bank (and I'm absolutely certain every single critic of the book has not), I find the true value of Cramer's book to be it's honesty and accuracy in capturing the true desparation, moral degradation, senseless violence and suffering that both Israelis and Palestinians live with daily. His second most important observation is that the power to change the situation lies almost solely in Israel's hands (and does all other types of power in the region). If you hate this book, it can ONLY be because you've already made up your mind that one side possesses absolute moral superiority over the other, and therefore you've missed the entire point and really shouldn't have bothered spending your money on this books in the first place or any other book for that matter. A must read for anyone who possesses any opinions on the subject or anyone who desires to get beyond headlines and sound bites and learn more about the root of the historical and ongoing conflict."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"Americans need to read this book. It is about how occupying another people's country can hurt the occupier as much as the occupied. The author, who clearly loves Israel, shows us just what has been lost there because of the occupation....and how valuable that something is. Hopefully, he will be able to redefine what it means for Americans to be FOR Israel. It cannot mean unconditional support for self-destructive policies, and it's too bad that so many American Zionists are too defensive to engage in an honest, intelligent discussion of this subject without resorting to name-calling. I guess they're just afraid. But they are not doing Israel -- or the US -- any favors."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"This book wanders a bit but renders a valuable service in speaking truth to power and considering, from a prize-winning investigative journalism perspective, \\"the story\\" of how Israel moved so far from its roots as a home for Jews, to a fanatical almost fascist and certainly zealot state concerned with its own survival. I recommend that the review by Mohamed F. El-Hewie, the New Jersey man with the Islam point of view be read in conjunction with this review.The author opens with an examination of how the \\"story of Israel\\" has gone from core reality (a place so barren it makes the Congo look good, Palestinians kicked off their land after Israeli terrorists expelled the British occupying power) to a \\"land of milk and honey\\" with deserts made prosperous by Israeli industry--he neglects to mention that Israeli agriculture contributes 3% of the GDP while using 50% of the water, and that most of the water is being stolen by Israeli from underneath land outside Israeli territory.From an \\"information operations\\" perspective, this is a really fascinating and well-told story of how Israel created several myths that sold not only in the USA but all over the world. I write in the margin, \\"Israel is the ultimate Potemkin village.\\" The author is also good at exploring the early signs that these myths are being exploded, the world is catching on, and US support for Israel may be on the verge (within five to seven years) of being withdrawn.As he is both an American Jew and a Pulitzer-prize winning journalist, I give this author special marks for combining a loyalty to his faith with a loyalty to the truth. The Islamic-oriented review from New Jersey adds a frame of reference I am not qualified to comment on, but I recognize it as valuable. Among the most important observations the author makes early on are these: 1) when Israel became an occupying power and got into the business of assassination as a routine method, censorship of Jews by Jews became commonplace--this was the \\"new aspect\\" of the Israeli regime. 2) At the same time, in America, self-censorship and popular protest of Jewish readers against Jewish writers critical of Israel, became more marked. The Jews of America--at least the vocal ones cited by the author--simply do not want to hear the truth--they are blindly bonded to the myths.Sharon is slammed in this book many times over. The author credits Sharon with being the original Israeli army sponsor for assignations, and the several pages on Israeli assassination history and policy are alone worth the price of the book (pages 39-51). Sharon is recalled in the book by General Pundak as \\"a disgraceful officer--a liar, cheater, a swindler and suck-up, a killer and a coward.\\" I believe this--sounds like Chalabi and Arafat--the three were made for each other and disgrace us all.The author explores a second crime against humanity characteristic of the Israeli bureaucracy: collective punishment. He builds a bridge from this--a policy that is explicitly forbidden by the Geneva Convention--to Israel's collective loss of shame and loss of emotional commitment to the \\"all for one and one for all\\" attitude that marked the early years. Now it is everyone for themselves, never mind what the authorities do \\"in our name.\\"The chapter on why Palestinians do not have a state is full of interesting observations, including the author's view that the US audience simply does not know the Palestinian side of the story; that the occupation is costing 18% of Israel's GDP (just 1% over the 17% of the Israeli government budget that we provide them out of the US taxpayer's pocket--two different stacks of money, but the comparison needs to be made); and that the isolation of Gaza, and the honeycomb nature of the walls and barriers, are so grotesque as to be both Kafkaesque and Warsaw ghettoish--the victim has indeed become the perpetrator, and Israel cannot be seen, in its treatment of the Palestinians, as anything other than fascist and abusive.Having torn apart the Israeli side, the author then moves to the Palestinian side, and two major ideas stay with me: first, the concept of honor so deeply rooted in Arab culture, an honor that the Israeli's are attacking with every humility they can impose; and second, the utter contemptible corruption of Arafat and the Palestinian security authorities.The book moves to a conclusion with a retrospective look at the bargain with the devil made by the Israeli security authorities very early on, when they accepted a dictatorship of the government from the zealot orthodox rabbis. He also explores the various \\"tribes\\" now within Israel, concluding that two thirds of the \\"new Jews\\" are not Jews at all, but simply Russian and other opportunists who have succumbed to the global covert and overt action operations of the Jewish state seeking to bring in more bodies as part of a demographic campaign plan.The author can be shocking. He makes a case that is the Jews of Israel who bear the bulk of the responsibility for starting \\"the hate\\" and that it is the Israeli government that originally funded Hamas as an alternative to Arafat--an unfortunate reminder of US government funding for Islamic fighters in Afghanistan who have now turned on us.The author's note and acknowledgements at the end of the book are worth reading carefully, and includes a list of other books on this topic.I expect a lot of negative votes on this review--that is the price we pay for offering honest opinions in a forum where a deliberate Jewish bloc attacks those like the author--and this reviewer--for seeking to move a balanced dialog forward. Amazon has new algorithms for detecting \\"hate votes\\" and \\"organized negative votes,\\" we shall see if those work here."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"This is SUCH a good book. Superb writing. It's one of those that makes me think, everyone should read this book. Ben Cramer's empathy and great story-telling skills are what makes the book so compelling, even 6 years after its publication. He is a truly great observer and reporter."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"Richard Ben Cramer is one of many honest Jews who has written the truth about the history of Israel and Palestine. In this book he documents the sad stories of Israelis and Palestinians who have suffered as a result of this conflict. He dispels long-held myths about the conflict and shows us that peace really is possible, but it cannot be achieved without the will of the US government. He criticizes Israel, the PLO, and the US for not doing more to achieve peace. He illustrates the corruption of the Palestinian Authority and how Yassir Arafat has failed the Palestinian people. I have read many books on this subject, and yet I have learned a great deal after reading \\"How Israel Lost.\\" It's a must read for anybody who is interesting in learning the history and nature of this conflict."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"This is probably the most important book of the year, and maybe of the last 10 years. It says things most journalists are too afraid to say about this conflict, but most of all it shows you the human cost. The author seems to care too much about Israel not to tell the truth about what he's seen there, no matter what it costs him. And knowing how this debate has gone in this country over the past 40 years, it's not surprising that he has gotten so much flack for what he has written from the most rabid Zionists. The surprising thing is how many people really are ready to hear and face the truth."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"Cramer's analysis of the Jewish State is entertaining but hamstrung by the author's secular tunnel vision. It's all well and good to bring a big bleeding heart and a comedic disdain to the task of dissecting the Middle East, but it's a difficult task when one dismisses the motivation of the Middle Easterns out of hand.Through poignant individual stories, Cramer paints the picture of an offensive, hijacked Israeli state playing a dangerous game for its own survival and racking up ever more enemies as it goes.Fair enough - the complexities of the Middle East make virtually any portrait realistic. One person can say \\"the Palestinians are the scum of the earth!\\" and the next person can say \\"the Israelis are murderous thugs,\\" and both people can be right. There's plenty of death on both sides, and no sign of a resolution in sight. It's a bit much to expect Cramer to have a definitive answer to this quagmire (though he proposes one with his title and his \\"questions.\\"And yet he ought to entertain the possibility that the perpetual war in the Middle East is about more than property rights and petty imperialism. As the nexus of the three great monotheistic religions, one would think that an analysis of Israel might pay more than passing notice to the interplay of these religions in the ongoing conflicts. But Cramer can't. Handicapped by his secular blindness, he charges along, missing the whole picture and presenting a petty (if wryly humorous) image that fits his own misconceptions."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"Richard Ben Cramer never loses sight of the fact that ultimately the conflict is about people not about politics."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"For someone with still unformed opinions about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I found this book to be a dangerous primer - unabashedly biased and shockingly slanted. While the writing style is engaging and intersting, the message is almost propagandistic. Only the Palestinian side is addressed with any sympathy - Israeli victims of terror are ignored and it is plainly unbalanced. It appears that most of the reviewers' on Amazon are letting their political opinions interfere with their objective review of the text. Needless to say, the issue is quite heated and this book does nothing but fan the flames. If you already have strong opinions and don't want to be bothered by a book that presents facts on both sides or has even the pretense of journalistic integrity, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"This book is an unfair tirade against Israel. First of all, he calls suicide bombing a &quot;lousy tactic&quot; rather than call it simply &quot;evil.&quot; He also uses offensive language to insult average Israelis, but i suppose he thinks that is ok since he himself is Jewish (but not all Israelis are by the way- Arabs have fought and died for Israel as well). On the other hand he speaks of Palestinians with profound admiration, calling them hospitable, rational, dignified, etc. Now I'm not one to disagree with that, many if not most Palestinians are like that, but so are Israelis or Turks, etc. Furthermore I do not know how rational or dignfied or kind it is to glorify in suicide bombers and dance in the streets when Jews are blown up. He also calls Hamas a resistence group, whereas Begin's pre-state Irgun are referred to as &quot;terrorists&quot; despite the fact that the Irgun never ever targeted civilians like Hamas nor was its goal the genocide of Arabs or British as Hamas' goal is the destruction of Israel. He also gives large attention to Meir Kahane, a Jewish anti-arab racist, but who was a marginal figure and whose political party was banned in Israel- he gives this marginal character more notice than the PLO or Islamic Jihad. He claims Israelis enjoy high living standards because Americans pay for it. First off, Egypt doesn't enjoy the same living standards even though America gives Egypt roughly the same amount of aid dollars per year. Secondly, since abandoning socialist economics, Israel's economy has grown as a result of trade and industry, not US dollars. Ultimately this book is a piece of anti-israel propaganda."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"The book is a good read. But if you looking for a good argument for the Palestinian cause you need a book that makes a reasoned argument without ignoring the facts. By mistating the facts the author leads one to believe that the Palestinians cause can not be justified once the truth is know. For example the author states as fact that &quot;In the summer of [Sharon's] first year, 2001, Hamas had observed a cease-fire on Israeli civilians for a couple of months, until July 31, when the Israelis assassinated two Hamas commanders in Nablus.&quot; But this is not true. According to one review of this book, between the June 1 attack on a discotheque that killed a bunch of teenagers and July 31 the following attacks on Israeli civilians took place:June 11, 2001: Yehuda Chaim Shoham, a five-month old boy is critically wounded in a stone throwing attack on his parents' car. He later dies. June 12, 2001: Gur Pzipokatsatakis, a 35-year-old Greek Orthodox monk, is shot in a drive-by attack, and dies. June 18, 2001: Doron Zisserman, 38, father of four, is shot in the head, and dies. June 20, 2001: Ilya Kirivitz, 62, is shot in the head, and dies. June 28, 2001: Ekaterina Weintraub, 24, is shot in the chest, and dies. July 2, 2001: Aharon Abadian, 41, father of four, is shot at point-blank range, and dies. July 2, 2001: Ya'ir Har-Sinai, 51, father of nine, is shot in the head and back, and dies. July 4, 2001: Eliyahu Naaman, 32, is shot at point-blank range, and dies. July 13, 2001: David Cohen, 31, is shot in the head and chest in a drive-by attack, and dies. July 24, 2001: Yuri Gushtzin, 18, is shot and stabbed to death. July 26, 2001: Ronen Landau, 17, is shot in a drive-by attack, and dies. The list excludes Israeli soldiers killed during this period such as the July 16 suicide bombing at the Binyamina railway stop, which killed two soldiers but was aimed at civilians. It excludes an attempt to stage an attack at the opening of the Maccabiah Games in Jerusalem, which failed when the bomb exploded prematurely. It excludes a foiled suicide attack in the town center of Afula.How do these facts fit into the author's statement that the cease fire was in effect until Israel broke it? By ignoring reality the author gives me the impression that there is no answer."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"How Israel Lost by Richard Ben Cramer contains no documentation of any kind; not even an index. (Surprisingly, there aren't even any endorsements on the back cover.) Rather it is a rambling first-person account of a visit to Israel by a man who had been a correspondent there over twenty years earlier. The book consists largely of brief anecdotes about various Arabs and Israelis Cramer met, many of which come across as unfinished. In discussing matters of religion, Cramer is very respectful towards Islam but quite contemptuous of Judaism, especially in its Orthodox form.Cramer considers Israel's ongoing occupation of lands gained the in 1967 Six-Day War to be the source of nearly all of its troubles. (That is \\"How Israel Lost.\\") He emphasizes that the occupation has been humiliating to the \\"Palestinian\\" Arabs, which it undoubtedly has been, and then concludes that if Israel would just go back to the pre-1967 borders then peace would break out and reign forever more. Cramer completely ignores the pre-1967 Arab-Israeli conflict-its origins and its true nature-namely that the vast majority of Arabs consider all of Israel to have been stolen from them. He is therefore unable to prove his thesis and hence his entire book rests on one untenable assumption."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"In his book, \\"How Israel Lost:The Four Questions\\" Cramer presents as fact a bogus anecdote about a \\"Sabbath buffet\\" in a Tel Aviv hotel--a story meant solely to ridicule the religious establishment in Israel. The refutation to the malicious story can follows. The question is--can a Pulitzer Prize winner be so ignorant as to be duped into believing this or does he have a more malicious motive?Cramer claims that a halachic question was raised by a tourist regarding the kashruth of a Sabbath buffet in a large hotel in Tel Aviv, in which both dairy and meat meals were served. (Although not impossible, it would be highly unusual for a kosher hotel to serve both dairy and meat at the same time.) Specifically, the question was raised as to whether the steam of hot meatballs would render dairy blintzes across the room non-kosher. According to Cramer, \\"a terrible crisis ensued\\" and the chief rabbi of Tel Aviv personally got involved and consulted with the Council of Torah Sages.This situation strains credibility, even accepting the highly unlikely premise that the hotel served both meat and dairy meals at the same time in the same place.1) All kosher hotels are required to have rabbinic supervision, which includes the presence of an onsite kashruth supervisor (mashgiach). It is highly unlikely that if the situation Cramer describes were indeed problematic, it would go undetected and unaddressed by the supervisors until a lone tourist from Cleveland noticed it.2) The issue raised is a straightforward halachic question of what constitutes a mixture of meat and milk and whether steam or vapor can be considered substantial. This is dealt with in the Jewish Code of Law and does not require the deliberation of the highest rabbinical councils. Questions of kashruth are dealt with by the hotel's kashruth supervisor or the local religious authorities charged with responsibility over kashruth affairs. They are not dealt with by the chief rabbi or the Council of Torah Sages who rule on policy issues. To suggest that the highest rabbinic authorities were asked to grapple with a simple question of kashruth is akin to having the Supreme Court directly adjudicate a simple legal question, bypassing the local authorities and lower courts.3) Not only does the concept of meat steam drifting across the room to render a far-away dairy dish non-kosher seem rather implausible, but Cramer's description of the resolution of the issue is based on false premises-something that could only be contrived by someone who knows nothing about Jewish law or kashruth. The answer to the question raised is determined according to the halachic principles of how taste is imparted.. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the principle of whether something is fit for canine consumption. (That is a completely different theoretical halachic concept. pertaining to the consumption of items, such as medicines, containing non-kosher ingredients.) Cramer's anecdote mixes up two different halachic concepts that any kashruth authority would be able to differentiate.5) Finally, Cramer's description of the actual experiment is preposterous. The halachic determination of whether an item falls under the heading of \\"unfit for canine consumption\\" is not based on a farcically staged \\"experiment\\" with a single dog, just as any modern day poll would not draw any conclusions based on interviewing one person."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"I agree with the criticisms posed in the New York Times, Washington Post, Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune, and other book reviews. This book is factually inaccurate. It oversimplifies a complex issue and presents an erronious conclusion. Author Richard Ben Cramer shows his dislike for Israelis with angry generalizations, while he demeans Palestinians by presenting them as some modern day &quot;noble savage.&quot; He ignores Hamas and other terrorist groups who are committed to eliminating the state of Israel when he presents his view, gained after &quot;ten minutes of thought,&quot; that achieving peace is as simple as Israel pulling back to its insecure pre-1967 lines. For people who want understanding of the complex problems making it difficult for Palestinians to achieve statehood, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"How Israel Lost : The Four Questions","review":"\\"How Israel Lost\\" is a sadly misguided attempt at legitimate scholarship: Cramer's views are narrow, naive, irretrievably microcosmic and hopelessly unrealistic. Cramer manages at once to reinforce damaging stereotypes about both Jews and Palestinians and to invoke the omnipresent double standard against Israel, while simultaneously claiming to clearly see the path to peace in the Middle East and tout terrorism as simply misguided military strategy. This book is a travesty of real research which masquerades under the guise of journalism; Cramer's lingual acrobatics distract from the book's Britney-like lack of substance.Cramer's fatal misstep is his analysis of the conflict on an INDIVIDUAL basis, rather than on a national political one. Cramer hilariously claims -- after a \\"no offense\\" disclaimer -- that he (and anyone for that matter who is not an Israeli and not psychotic -- his words!) could solve the dilemma of the Middle East with only TEN MINUTES' concentrated effort! Poor, deluded Richard. His be-all end-all solution to the crisis? Well, I doubt I can post a juicy spoiler like that in a review! Suffice it to say: no. Cramer's \\"solution\\" is a sweetly naive \\"Let's be honest! Let's be fair!\\" plea to the Israeli and Palestinian leadership which, while childishly endearing, is utterly, irredeemably, irretreievably impractical.

This bible is the updated New American Standard Bible. This bible is pretty easy to read (though not as easy as the NIV or NLT) but it is also considered to be the most literal English translation today.This is a nice personal sized bible, and it is perfect for a daily reader and a bible to take to bible studies and church. Every book has a summary at the beginning, and there are a couple of maps and other types of study aids that are scattered throughout the bible. Otherwise, it is a plain, center column reference bible and it is a red letter edition (which I personally like).But the one major problem I have had with this bible is the binding. The pages are simply glued into the spine, and because of that, after a few months, whole sections of my bible began to fall out. I had to use Elmer's glue to re-glue the sections back in, and thankfully, that seems to have done the trick for now.Still, the font size is nice, the center column references are nice, and the bible is a nice size and the price is fantastic. The only really complaint I have is the binding, and had the binding not been an issue, I would have given this bible 5 stars. But since losing whole sections from the binding isn't a small problem, I am forced to give this bible 3 stars.This bible is great for a daily reader, but if you're looking for a bible that is going to last a lifetime, or at least a really long time, I would suggest spending a little extra to make sure you get a bible that is bound better."},{"Title":"Classic Reference Bible, Updated NASB","review":"This is a great Bible in my opinion...

It does not do as well in presenting the true genius of science."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"This has to be one of the greatest medical/scientific novels but rarely seems to be read these days. Lewis won the Pulitzer prize for it and later won a Nobel literature prize but he seems generally forgotten these days.Anyways I think this is his best book - a great insight into scientific research as well as a cracking story."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"Arrowsmith is one of Sinclair Lewis' best works and has an important place in American literature. A major twentieth century novel, it is essential for anyone interested in Lewis, and multiple differences from his other work make it worthwhile for others.The book has significant style and plot similarities to prior Lewis novels; for example, the small town/country doctor bit recalls Main Street, and the Zenith section recalls - and even briefly features the title character of - Babbitt. Lewis is known as a satirist, and those novels virtually epitomize the genre, but Arrowsmith is not satire. It has satirical elements and is sometimes humorous but is essentially a straight realist novel with a more or less straight-up hero. Thus, though Lewis' absolute realism mastery is as strong as ever, one might think Arrowsmith sounds pedestrian or dull. This is thankfully not so because the title hero was a new type - an exponent of scientific idealism. The novel initially seems to offer an interesting but inherently limited inside look at the early twentieth century medical profession and is indeed valuable here as far as it goes. We get a good idea of what things such as medical school, internships, country practice, public health, and urban practice were like. Medicine has of course changed much since Arrowsmith's 1925 publication, giving it notable historical value, but the depiction is still largely accurate, lending considerable insight into an important profession. Lewis' usual excellences are also on prominent display. We get a panoramic grand tour of post-World War I, pre-Great Depression America from mid-size and urban Midwestern towns to the rural West to Chicago, New York, and more. Anyone curious about the era will learn much about everything from speech to social etiquette to fashion. We even get a rare up-close glimpse of an exotic non-American setting; this section is noteworthy for its grim realism and tragedy, showing Lewis has more range than he usually gets credit for. Lewis also continues his penetrating analysis of all that was hollow and cheap about American society, critiquing capitalism and honing in on race, class, and gender issues among others. He was noticeably ahead of his time here and says much that is important.Far more significant, though, is Lewis' portrait of Arrowsmith the scientist, an idealist dedicated to pure research. Like Main, the novel came at just the right time to ride a cultural wave; the idolization - one might almost say \\"cult\\" - of science so prominent in American society was really beginning, and Arrowsmith became its prototype. This vehicle lets Lewis explore important themes like the pros and cons of various medical specialties, medical ethics, medicine's social role, the economics of medicine, etc. The central issue is the all-important question of pure vs. applied research; Lewis clearly champions the latter but makes good arguments for the former, which cannot simply be dismissed.Yet this is not just a book about medicine or science; Arrowsmith has typological significance beyond the obvious. Critics of Main and Babbitt often complain that Lewis fails to see or ignores the near-spiritual idealism at Americana's heart. Arrowsmith takes it up. The protagonist's devotion to science is in many ways only a then-new way of showing the remarkable single-minded devotion running through American culture from the Puritans to the Founding Fathers to the Transcendentalists to Lincoln to the Progressive Era - to the science aesthetic. Arrowsmith was thus both the new and the classic American gospel, and Lewis preached to a supremely receptive audience, making him almost as much journalist as prophet. Like other Lewis works, the novel is thus worth reading as the portrait of an era, epitomizing a spiritual strain prominent before the Depression. But is also more than this - in fact speaks to a yearning at American culture's very heart. We may or may not agree with Arrowsmith; we may not even like him, as he can be easily denigrated in several ways. However, he is a hero in a way prior Lewis protagonists were not; Lewis clearly sympathizes rather than using him as a mockery target. A magnificent creation, fully alive and thoroughly believable, he is one of Lewis' best characters. Secondary characters are also unusually strong; Lewis had been lambasted for stock types, and there are certainly some here, but the major characters Leora and Gottlieb are also great. The former is widely recognized as Lewis' best female character, more earthy and sympathetic than Main's ambivalently depicted Carol; the latter is an idealist much like Arrowsmith but with many of his own nuances. Even less fully drawn characters are invariably interesting, bringing out these three by contrast or giving comic relief.The novel is not perfect. Its uniqueness may disappoint those wanting Lewis' usual style, though enough of that remains for its detractors to be unsatisfied also. For instance, some object to his episodic plots; Arrowsmith is more tightly written than Main or Babbitt but still essentially episodic, and tactics used to make it seem less so - recurring characters, a \\"Where are they now?\\" ending that still seems arbitrary - often seem contrived. Some may also find the ending, with its overt modernization of Transcendentalism's nature obsession, quite strained. That said, execution is generally strong, and Lewis' conversational verisimilitude is at full strength.All told, this is a must for fans, but anyone curious about Lewis should know that this is not representative. Elmer Gantry, Main, and Babbitt are probably better introductions, and those who do not like Arrowsmith should try one of them. In the end, though, the novel is strong enough to stand on its own and is highly recommended for anyone interested in American literature."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"Intellectually driven people are as F. Scott Fitzgerald would say: different. Eponymously named, this book follows the post-collegiate years of Arrowsmith to his early midlife, with great tales of unending frustration of not being the captain of his own ship.Often we love to watch the weak excel and do extraordinary things -Forrest Gumpbeing the most obvious. But, after such people achieve such great goals, we learn they are more than just \\"different\\" but really extraordinary.Being a medical student, one would think Arrowsmith is extraordinary. But, we learn, his struggles in and out of school are quite reflective of an ordinary person with ordinary abilities. Being thrust out of towns in South Dakota and Iowa, he seems to be a wrong fit for even grossly normal society.But, catlike coincidences abound and he ends up stopping the plague in the West Indies, and has experiments successfully deliver answers to medical mysteries which no man had previously resolved. His unending intellectual appetite never subsides, and from his perseverance he can assert acclaim and even fortune.But, his quest is not for anything more than the hunger to kill for more intellectual achievement. Noble is the man who seeks to help other man. Not the man who seeks to pad his own pocket with pharmaceuticals or patents or other money-constituted ventures which many people did or would do in his position. Arrowsmith is a rare man in American capitalistic society.Even after marrying a multi-millionaire (after being a widower to a plain Jane girl from the Dakotas), he wants to be left out of society's primrose elite and seeks retreat to forested Vermont, with outhouses and laboratories which cannot be interrupted. He is the personification of the great man theory: a philosophical theory that aims to explain history by the impact of \`great men', or heroes: highly influential individuals who, due to either their personal charisma, intelligence and wisdom or Machiavellianism, used power in a way that had a decisive historical impact.It has been many years since reading a Sinclair Lewis novel - in fact this is the first time I did so voluntarily.BabbittandMain Streetwere required reading in junior or senior high. And, whenever you are required to read something, it seems to be less satisfying.I was very impressed and pleasantly surprised that this author is as good as the teachers had apparently thought he was."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"As a biomedical researcher, I identify with Martin Arrowsmith so my review may be a bit biased. As a writer, Lewis is first-rate. Most of the novel (up until the climax; you'll know it when you get to it) is very tightly plotted and quite gripping. I first read it over 30 years ago and I re-read it yesterday; it speaks to me now as then and is one of my favorite novels containing one of my favorite lines: Professor Gottlieb's description of organic vs physical chemistry, which I agree with. Why Lewis refused to accept the Pulitzer for it astounds me to this day. Should be required reading for grad students."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"I picked up this book by chance in an airport bookstore. After reading the first section about Arrowsmith's great-grandmother and her determination to go west, I was hooked. The writing is crisp, the satire is sharp, and the characters are as alive as any on paper. Martin Arrowsmith has his weaknesses and waverings, but his resolute pursuit of his goals is inspiring; like his wife Leora, you're willing to follow him anywhere. This novel will be particularly interesting to those in the fields of science and medicine. But, to quote Martin, if you have ever wanted to be \\"anything but a machine for digestion and propagation and obedience,\\" you will find something in his character and adventures that will push you to live with greater purpose."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"Great story of young idealism and enthusiasm in struggle with bigotry, backwardness. Despite being set in its time and social circumstances, remains timeless. Highly recommended for those who aspire to become doctors, especially for those choosing academic and scientific careers. For others it is lasting reminder that to achieve something great in life one has to pay the price, that there are not only rewards."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"I picked this book up not knowing what it was about, just knowing that it had won the Pulitzer. I have now read it twice; the first time I read it I thought very highly of it, but the second time I read it I not only looked at it as one of the greatest American Classics of our time but I looked at it as a fun, early 1900's, college book. One part of the book I exspecially liked was when Martin confesed to both of his girlfriends that he was engaged to both of them at the same time! I love it! Sinclair Lewis was so ahead of his time with that episode! This is Lewis' finest work, a homage to the art of medicine and the spirit of a young man searching for himself and his career. A must have book!"},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"If you have any interest in science or research or medicine, you'll probably like it.I read it once about 2 years ago, and the character of Arrowsmith remains in my mind as potently as Huck Finn. It also paint's a pretty picture of 19th century North East America.The university and laboratory 'scenes' are realistic."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"Sinclair Lewis, in his novel, ARROWSMITH, reflects the common ordinary feelings that every student of graduate studies and those from junior colleges face, self confidence. Upon graduation, I always feared of making th grade in the real world. His charecters are among us, the chapters are metaphors of our own lives and dreams. Do read it and see the reflections Lewis carries to you."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"Sinclair Lewis is the bookend to F. Scott Fitzgerald. Both were born in Minnesota. Fitzgerald went to Princeton, Lewis to Yale. Both wrote their best books in the 1920s. Both drank, had women trouble, and turned bitter.But Fitzgerald is everyone's favorite author --- even the high school kids who are clueless about metaphors swoon over \\"The Great Gatsby.\\" You need an appreciation of satire to love Lewis; nobody does, and he goes unread.It's understandable. What would you rather read --- a romantic tale about a poor boy's rise and violent death on the glittering shores of Long Island (Gatsby) or a withering take on narrow-minded life in the midwest (Main Street)? Who's more interesting --- a criminal who went to Oxford (Jay Gatsby) or a blowhard whose ambition is total conformity to soul-deadening values (George Babbitt)?And yet. If you ask who describes America better, the more necessary writer is Sinclair Lewis. Main Street and Babbitt made his name, and most readers stop there. They shouldn't --- my wife, who once attended a one-room schoolhouse in Minnesota --- recently read \\"Main Street,\\" and found it a very close description of life in our chic Manhattan neighborhood. Dodsworth --- later made into a toweringly great movie --- is as fine a love story as Fitzgerald ever dreamed up, and a lot more realistic one, at that. It Can't Happen Here is a powerful political drama with a subject that's not as far-fetched as you might think: how fascism comes to America.And then there's Arrowsmith, which has an actual hero. Set in the midwest, it doesn't lack for satire; as Lewis depicts it, happiness in a small town seems to havbe the shelf life of about a year. And for a writer who won the Pulitzer Prize (and refused it), Lewis can write some dreadful dialogue. But the heroism thing --- that's compelling, and if you can move sprightly through the first half of the book, you'll find yourself getting excited and turning pages quickly for the right reason.The hero is Martin Arrowsmith. We meet him in 1897, in the midwest town of Elk Mills (\\"a dowdy red-brick village, smelling of apples\\"), where he is the 14-year-old helper of the local doctor. Martin is prone to hero worship --- he sees magic in the old man's love of puttering in a lab. That ignites a dream in Martin, and so, seven years later, he's in medical school. There he falls under the spell of bacteriology professor Max Gottlieb: \\"tall, lean, aloof\\" --- and a Jew.Gottlieb's love of science is pure; in an environment where many students and faculty think only of money, he alone seems to have ideals. Martin blossoms. But he's still a rube. He falls for a snooty graduate student in English and proposes marriage; later, he meets Leora, a nursing student, and proposes to her as well. His inept solution: to bring them together over lunch. Leora loves him more. They marry.Leora's family is important --- in their tiny town of Wheatsylvania, North Dakota. But don't call them cultured: They lived in a house \\"that has a large phonograph but no books.\\" Money talks, though. They bankroll Martin's first practice, and he settles into the life of a country doctor.The novel is about the impossibility of \\"settling\\" --- as Martin climbs the medical ladder, he can't ignore research, his first love. He has a knack for it, and, to his delight, he's invited to join Gottlieb at a prestigious New York research institute. And now the novel kicks into high gear --- the plague has broken out in the Caribbean, and the vaccine that Arrowsmith has been working on might just be the cure.Let me not spoil the thrill of these pages by revealing too much. Let's just say: success always comes at a price. And success doesn't always bring people what they most want. \\"Arrowsmith\\" is a book about the forces that fight to dominate us. As Lewis has it, that fight never ends.\\"Arrowsmith\\" is smart about the world of research, and drug companies, and the modest ambitions of many men and women in white coats. It is also about the love of knowledge and the desire to heal; it gets the blood pumping. My brother --- one of our best AIDS researchers --- tells me that \\"Arrowsmith\\" is the book that made him decide to study medicine. Long before page 450, I could see why."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"Author Sinclair Lewis had some exposure to the medical profession early in his life through his father, who was a country doctor. Yet, even with some personal exposure, it's amazing how much of the idealism and cynicism, evident in modern physician practice, Lewis portrays in his 1926 pulitizer prize winning book, &quot;Arrowsmith&quot;. Martin Arrowsmith, M.D. is a fictional idealist who is a human being before all else, but trying to bring science to the practice of Medicine. Actually, the story seems almost autobiographical due to the personal intensity and human fraility of the complex main character. As a registered nurse, reading Arrowsmith brings flashbacks of the past, like the cliches &quot;deja vu all over again&quot;, or worse, &quot;the more things change, the more they stay the same&quot;. Medicine for financial- profit, patient care challenges, personality conflicts, political shenanigans, professional competition, and overutilization of medical technology are some of the common problems Arrowsmith faces as he pursues a career in medicine after barely struggling through the politics of medical school in the mythical town of Wheatsylvania, Midwest, USA, in the early 20th century. This is not another novel about how physicians affect people's lives, but a masterpiece about the nuances of the medical profession as mysterious and suspect,of physicians who are heros and villans. Most surprising are the humerous vignettes sprinkled throughout the plot like bits and pieces of old Jack Benny radio show skits. When Martin Arrowsmith must decide if he is to fulfill his promise to marry Madeline Fox or betray her for his soul mate Leora Tozer, the genious writer Lewis creates such humor in the ensuing restaurant scene, that should be frought with melodrama, but, instead, is absolutely delightful reading. Similar humor engulfs the life portrayed of Arrowsmith's employer, Pickerbaugh, and his fleet of daughters named after flowers, like the saucy Orchid. Arrowsmith is simply a joy to read, especially for people who have a flair for some classic literature without getting too deep into concentrated philosophic thought. Simply put, Arrowsmith today, were he to practice in modern medicine, would probably be no better or worse off than he was in 1908 through circa 1920, when the novel takes place. Arrowsmith is a classic American novel and an entertaining story."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"This book won the 1926 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction. Lewis also won the 1930 Nobel Prize in Literature. It is the story of Martin Arrowsmith, a medical researcher who, while attending a mid-western medical school, is influenced by an aged bacteriologist. Arrowsmith marries a nurse, who will encourage his career in research, and tries his hand at private practice. However, he fails in that endeavor. After a number of positions he joins a research institute in New York where he discovers a new microorganism but is &quot;scooped.&quot; He travels to the West Indies to try his &quot;bacteriophage&quot; on an epidemic. After his wife and colleague die, he starts administering the serum indiscriminately, destroying the results of his experiment. He returns to New York and marries a rich widow. However, social life interferes with his research and his search for truth. He quits the Institute and establishes a lab in Vermont with Terry Wickett, an uncouth but conscientious chemist. The model for Terry Wickett was Dr. John Howard Northrup (1891-1987), who will later win the 1946 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Apparently, the model for Martin Arrowsmith was provided by the microbiologist and writer Paul de Kruif, whose book &quot;Microbe Hunters&quot; became very popular. The novel also contrasts the idealism of the research scientist, who unfortunately looses touch with those that care for him, and the apparent avarice of the medical profession."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"I'm giving Arrowsmith five stars because I read it many years ago and, like most of Sinclair Lewis's work, it is great. My criticism is of the Kindle version. In the preface we are told that some of the text has been rewritten because of \\"anachronisms that might jar the modern ear,\\" or something like that. I immediately clicked off Arrowsmith; I'll find the hard copy. I'd like to ask whoever made this unwise decision: don't you think that someone who is taking the time to read a book written in 1925 might WANT to have their ears jarred? Are you also rewriting Dickens and Shakespeare? I want to read the words of one of the masters, not the words of someone who thinks that he or she knows how a legendary author would write in 2011."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"I first read Arrowsmith as assigned reading while I was studying American Literature as a high school junior. As a boy already preparing for a career in science, I was shocked to find scientists portrayed as vain, publicity-seeking hacks! At the time I imagined that such was the nature of science in the early twentieth century; surely things had changed in the post-sputnik world of the Cold War America in which I lived. Once I went on to graduate school, however, I found a world very much like that portrayed by Sinclair Lewis! I continue to work as a scientist and researcher and continue to be amazed by the accuracy of this book! Happily, Arrowsmith provides a source of idealism as well as cynicism. Any young person who is considering a career in science or engineering research should read this book to prepare him or her for that which lies ahead."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"Once again, Sinclair Lewis engulfed me. This is the fourth of his works that I have read (Elmer Gantry, Main Street and Babbit being the others) and although I didn't like Arrowsmith quite as much as those three, I still couldn't put it down.Unlike so many novelists, Lewis' endings are impossible to predict. They're not necessarily happy, or tragic, they're open-ended, which often mirrors real life. For Martin Arrowsmith, he ends up, in a sense, free and able to devote the rest of his life to research without any distractions. At the same time, he's lost his first wife and deserted his second and their son.Like the main characters of Lewis' other books, Elmer Gantry, Carol Kennicot and George Babbit, Martin Arrowsmith is not clearly a protagonist or an antagonist. The reader sympathizes with his frustrations, especially in dealing with his first wife's knee-jerk family. At the same time, I found myself rather angry with Martin's attitude now and then. Many of the other major characters: Max Gottleib (Arrowsmith's mentor), Almus Pickerbrauh, and Terry Wickett (Arrowsmith's friend and partner) evoke the same mixed reactions. Once again, I think this is an example of Lewis' realism, for in real life, there are few &quot;pure&quot; heroes; and even the noblest soul is tainted at times.Read this book to understand the personal frustrations and conflicts that infect everyone's soul; read it for a contrasted depiction of American life in small towns, mid-sized cities and large metropolis' in the earlier 20th century. But read it."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"Read Arrowsmith early in life, and you'll want to become a doctor, marry a Leora, and read everything else Sinclair Lewis wrote. While not &quot;fashionable,&quot; Arrowsmith's search for truth and his relationship with Leora are far beyond any politically correct world view. The writing is incredible. When I first read it (a dozen or so times ago), I could not fathom how any writer could be so creative, so different, so perfect. Give it to your favorite teenager. You could change his or her life."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"A period piece of early twentieth century America, this book still remains a worthwhile read in spite of typed, flat, and cardboard caricatures of the players in the story. The sometimes didactic discussion of \`doing the right thing' is timeless and worth consideration by any generation of readers. The tension of what is right versus what is good in Arrowsmith's science and medical profession can be teased and tested beyond that parochial domain. Every reader's battle with that tension will find a thorough airing of important considerations for their own lives through Arrowsmith's saga."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"Martin Arrowsmith is a man with a mission, a scientific truth-seeker, an idealist who perpetually returns to his pure research interests despite the material influences and social pressures of the world around him.Lewis's biographical novel portrays Arrowsmith, accompanied by his sympathetic wife, Leora, in a roundabout career from medical student to small-town doctor to public health administrator to bacteriology researcher. From boyhood to middle age, Arrowsmith walks a lonesome road, placing verifiable scientific knowledge and sincere craftsmanship above money, publicity, political power and social status (this is Lewis's affront to American \\"commercialism\\"). Ultimately, Arrowsmith is heroic in his remarkable perseverance and quest for truth, although some might label him a cold-hearted escapist for deserting his wealthy second wife, young child and promising New York City career in favor of a rustic laboratory and rugged backwoods existence on a fellow rebel researcher's Vermont farm.Modern readers will find Arrowsmith's devotion to his early 20th century \\"science as truth\\" dogma somewhat tiring, narrow and dated. Yet, in a broader sense, what is most important is that Arrowsmith consistently remains true to his core personal belief (which in his case just so happens to be scientific truth). His unwavering self-honesty is what makes Arrowsmith an eternally heroic figure.However powerful its message, the novel unfortunately reads like a patchwork of stages in our hero's career, somewhat artificially connected with the support of unconvincing reappearances of Arrowsmith's medical school classmates later in their careers (e.g., the sudden reappearance of the crazed, doctor-turned-missionary Reverend Ira Hinkley on Arrowsmith's trip to fight the plague in the West Indies, where incidentally Leora tragically dies). I conjecture that in reaching beyond the familiarity of his family's medical practice and venturing into the more rarified realm of scientific research, Lewis has stretched--as a chronicler commonly does but, I would say, a novelist should not--too far outside his own life experiences. The result is that this classic novel falls short of becoming a more emotionally engaging literary work with a truly believable flow of realistic life events."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"The central conflict of this novel--commercialism versus scientific idealism--reveals a different sort of author than we see in Babbitt and Elmer Gantry. In these earlier novels, Lewis neglects to offer a clear alternative to the unspiritual, conformist materialism of George Babbitt and Elmer Gantry.(O.K., Seneca Doane and Frank Shallard do represent an antidote of sorts. But Doane gets little attention in Babbitt and, considering his condition at the end of Elmer Gantry, Shallard's &quot;philosophy&quot; seems as futile as Gantry's.)In Arrowsmith, readers finally get a clear sense of one sort of life--and one sort of culture--that Lewis would prefer, namely, one dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge rather than material gain or intellectual homogeneity. In his pursuit of truth, Martin Arrowsmith faces many obstacles. He must overcome the accepted belief that one's duty in life is to make other people comfortable with themselves, no matter how shallow or simple-minded they might be. He must overcome the natural human desires for love, fame, money, respect, etc. Lewis's recognition of such conflicts makes Martin Arrowsmith's life more believable. But, at the same time, Arrowsmith's imperviousness to the usual effects of these conflicts--pessimism, greater self-awareness, less self-confidence, to name a few--seems suspiciously optimistic.I doubt many readers will recognize Leora Tozer as a legitimate female character, some critics to the contrary. No doubt she represents an ideal from the perspective of many men: she lives ONLY to care for and to please Martin Arrowsmith. But does anyone know such a woman?"},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"Martin Arrowsmith is a semi-competent, ne'er-do-well whiner. I stopped rooting for him about a third of the way through the book. A \\"hero\\" can't shoot himself in the foot a dozen times and remain a hero. At least I've never seen anyone outside a Woody Allen movie pull it off.Martin isn't helped by Sinclair Lewis's habitual \\"telling,\\" rather than \\"showing,\\" and by his tin-ear for dialogue, which comes in two voices: Finishing School and School of Hard Knocks. Martin--one of the few college graduates in his medical school class--speaks in Hard-Knocks English, and a rather forced version at that. Compare the masterful dialogue of Twain's illiterate and semi-literate characters in Huck Finn, written forty years earlier. Compare also the clear, realistic dialogue of Lewis's contemporaries, Hemingway and Dos Passos.Finally, if the writing of Arrowsmith were a meal, Sinclair Lewis finished his dinner around the close of Chapter 35, when Martin returns from St. Hubert. After that, Lewis just played with his food.Arrowsmith is a much more ambitious work than The Great Gatsby, also published in 1925, or The Sun Also Rises, published a year later. But unlike Arrowsmith, these other novels still hold up well, as does Dos Passos's much-more-ambitious USA Trilogy. If Sinclair Lewis's star has fallen in the last fifty years, it's easy to see why, reading this book."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"... the John Deere tractor of fiction, a paint-by-the-chapter-numbers novelist! Sinclair Lewis, America's first winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, did indeed write the same novel time after time. Babbitt the Man of Business, Gantry the Man of Religion, and Arrowsmith the Man of Science are identical triplets. Their life stories all begin as a child who feels exceptional in the drab materialist monotony of a provincial town, who thus foolishly overestimates his own abilities and his proximity to the center of Fate. They make their first escape toward a larger world, only to be hobbled by sexual vulnerability, by the \`natural enemy' of their ego-fulfillment, Woman. On they forge, nevertheless, through chapter after chapter of compromised achievements and mitigated failures, until it seems that the novel per se is merely a contraption for humbling the perennial American Young Man of Promise. No novelist has ever humilated his heroes as vindictively as Lewis, or portrayed every one of his characters with such grim contumely and condescension.But wait! Isn't that Young Man -- Gantry/Arrowsmith/Babbitt; Gantabbitsmith -- oddly familiar? Aren't all those vulgar small-minded philistines perfectly recognizable? Neighbors and kinfolk at some stage of your life? Isn't it lucky for my own self-esteem that Lewis never wrote a book called \\"Bruno\\", about the man of Music?Arrowsmith aspires to a kind of distinction, in science and medicine, that makes his struggles more estimable, and his eventual shortcomings more painful than those of Gantry, but the point of the novel is much the same: the mightiest tree can only grow in fertile soil, and the soil of American culture, as Lewis saw it in the 1920s, was sterile. One has to wonder whether Lewis's fervid denuciations of American pretensions weren't perhaps the qualities most admired in his writing by the judges of the Nobel committee.There are slashes of scalpel-sharp satire in Arrowsmith, though it's hardly a book that you'll roll on the floor laughing over. And it's remarkably pertinent, even after 80 years, to many of the debates over education today, especially at the university level. Every one of the little debacles that beset the life of Arrowsmith in the first decades of the 20th C is just as likely to beset the life of a bright, ambitious youth in America today. That's the weakness of Lewis as a novelist, that he is as episodic as a soap-opera, and almost as predictable. But his strength is that he relentlessly told Americans the truth about themselves, then and now.Unlike Gantry or Babbit, however, as Arrowsmith bumbles through his failures as a small town citizen-doctor and eventually reconnects with his 'counterpart', the immigrant Jewish bacteriologist Gottlieb, his fundamental integrity and decency always survives. Arrowsmith is not a tale of moral degeneration like Elmer Gantry. One can sincerely 'root' for Arrowsmith to come though with his 'self' intact. And then, the surprise: the last large episode of Arrowsmith is uncharacteristically gripping, a genuine adventure that I do not wish to spoil by disclosure, except to note that it takes place on a Caribbean island that sounds identical to Domenica, one of my own Blessed isles. But this is the part of the book that troubles me most; Lewis seems committed to a view of science and scientists as Promethean rebels, only true to themselves when they strive in uncompromising individualism to light some sacred fire. It's that 19th C \\"Hero\\", the exceptional man extolled by 'lofty thinkers' from Carlyle to Rand and beyond. The vision of science as a collaborative triumph of society and government - the vision I share - seems to have horrified Sinclair Lewis. The great scoffer at folly of American literature disappoints me here; he could measure the shallows but he couldn't sound the depths.Arrowsmith is a book that grows as you read it, but I wouldn't suggest this novel for a first approach to Sinclair Lewis. The iconoclastic Elmer Gantry, addressed to religious hypocrisy and opportunism, shoots its barbs of scorn at a bigger target, and tells an uglier truth. Arrowsmith is \\"a good read\\" but Elmer Gantry is salubrious bitter medicine.Did Sinclair Lewis deserve the vaunted Nobel Prize? Sentence by sentence, as a wordsmith, certainly not! But as a social commentator, as a portraitist of a culture with all its warts and pimples, certainly yes! And consider some of the other winners: Rudolf Eucken, Paul Heyse, Romain Rolland, Anatole France, Grazia Deledda, John Galsworthy, Pearl Buck, Frans Sillanp&auml;&auml;, Johannes Jensen, Mikhail Sholokov, Patrick White, William Golding, Claude Simon, Toni Morrison, Orhan Pamuk ... Did any of them produce a body of work of stronger fiber and deeper insight than Sinclair Lewis? Or of greater permanence?Read the eloquent review of a few days past, by Mr. Schneider, for a similar perspective."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"While reading some older pulitzer winner's, I found a copy of &quot;Arrowsmith&quot; and decided to plunge in. This is a deliteful story about an ambitious young doctor in the 1920's, and his struggle to find a &quot;worthy&quot; use of his medical skills. A thinly veiled contempt for commercialized medicine runs throughout the story, but never gets too &quot;preachy&quot;. A very good choice for any med student or young doctor, or anyone at all"},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"After randomly choosing Arrowsmith for a Year 11 assignment on American Literature I was pleasantly surprised to get such an amazing, and enthralling book.Being already intersted in science, particularly medical research I was exited to read such a detailed (I dont know about accurate, it certainly seems to be)insight in to the world of medicine and science in general. It certainly set the ambition clear in my mind and renewed my desire at 16 to enter the medical world. It is a great book and anyone who reads it will feel the same compulsion I did if they have any interest whatsoever in medicine."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"&quot;Arrowsmith&quot; plays a key role in the new book &quot;Time, Love, Memory&quot; by Jonathan Weiner.

The main themes of the book seem to be about the pursuit of money vs. the pursuit of science and about the character flaws of many research scientists and medical practitioners.What's good about the book is that the plot is pretty interesting. I kept wanting to know what would happen next and how it would all turn out. Unfortunately, the ending wasn't so great. I end up agreeing with another reviewer that after the part on St. Hubert's island (about 3/4 of the way through) the rest is pretty dull--at least in comparison.The main problem with the book is that the characters are one-dimensional, especially the female supporting characters. The main character, Martin, is too cold, heartless, and selfish to really get behind even though I don't think Lewis intended it. He marries two women during the course of the book. The first one, Leora, is a boring little dishrag. As for the second wife, I didn't see the point of introducing her so late in the book since she didn't really seem to motivate any purpose or action, other than Martin's continued heartlessness in leaving her and their son. However, since she was pretty much just a rich society type with no real personality or apparent goodness, I didn't have a whole lot of sympathy for her and the kid was like a non-entity so I didn't get too worked up about him either. I could go on, but that's the main problem with the book --- no characters that I could care about."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"One of the coolest American books, I've read it twice"},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"This is an excellent novel. It tells the story of a brilliant man who, unlike his fellow graduates, wants to prevent disease and death.

If, on the other hand, an author wanted to write a lasting novel of top quality, I believe that there is no other way than to develop one or several characters in as much depth as possible, to plumb their very souls (as they say in the classics !) Irving Stone-style fictionalized biographies are another way possible way to go-you can combine the two genres. What Sinclair Lewis created in ARROWSMITH is a piece of socialist realism that drags dreadfully, a book in which no character is open to us, a psychological void. The novel is more a sociology of the American medical profession in the first decades of the 20th century, a kind of uninspired expos&eacute; of medical colleges, country doctors, pharmaceutical firms, big city surgeons, and top-level research institutions---a social catalogue peopled with insipid characters that lack all the zany but convincing frenzy of Lewis' other books. We follow Martin Arrowsmith's career from small town to university to North Dakota hick town and on up. It's not an easy climb; it's not a Hollywood story, I'll grant you that. There is an exotic interlude on a plague-stricken West Indian island to liven up the far reaches of the novel, but nothing can really stir you much if you've hung on till then. The basic problem is, as I've already claimed, that the characters take second place to the process. Who can forget Babbitt or Elmer Gantry ? There are no such larger-than-life figures marching through ARROWSMITH. The protagonist's first wife is so thinly-drawn as to be almost invisible, like some cardboard cutout instead of a flesh and blood woman. She conveniently takes a back seat to her husband's career. The characters tend towards stereotype. A couple characters from other novels---George Babbitt and Chum Frick---have walk-on appearances, and there is a Prof. Schlemihl, (who, so satisfyingly, Lewis did not fail to mention, was quite a porker) but none of the main actors in ARROWSMITH will stick in your mind. Romantic interests are added from time to time, like salt to soup. I felt, as I read, that Lewis' real talent lay in caricature. When he wrote, tongue-in-cheek, about the \\"small town glories\\" of 1920s and \`30s America, and he let his imagination soar, he was unbeatable. When he reined himself in, trying to be \`serious' and \`natural', he lost touch with that special genius. Written in between four of his greatest novels---\\"Main Street\\" and \\"Babbitt\\" came before and \\"Elmer Gantry\\" and \\"Dodsworth\\" came after, I can only think that Lewis' imagination faltered when he wrote ARROWSMITH. It comes to an unsatisfying conclusion and is entirely forgettable."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"There's a lot of intelligent commentary in the reviews on this novel. My contribution: *Arrowsmith* is a great read."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"The challenge to readers of Sinclair Lewis's 1925 masterpiece ARROWSMITH is that so much is known about the author that it is hard to focus on the novel.We have the Yale and University of Texas collections of the author's typescripts and notes, including Lewis's sketches of floor plans of the all important fictional McGurk Institute in New York. We know what first wife Gracie added, what massive collaborator Paul De Kruif contributed. We know how badly Sinclair Lewis wanted to prove to critics that he was not just a \\"knocker\\" of flawed characters and a negative satirst of an America full of Babbitts. We know how the researching, planning and writing of ARROWSMITH created and consolidated a method of doing fiction that Sinclair Lewis used over and over again. A method hammered out with Paul De Kruif.We think of parallels between the collaborators' nine week research jaunt by ship through the Caribbean and Graham Greene's turning his travels in Liberia and Mexico into books. We wonder why only in ARROWSMITH Sinclair Lewis created one heroic figure -- again, we notice, in collaboration with a Paul De Kruif whom Lewis taught to write and who taught Lewis about science and scientific role models.We think of the huge impact of Lewis and ARROWSMITH on the contemporary world, not just in the USA. No potboiler novel could have drawn John Ford to direct the 1931 movie ARROWSMITH. Ronald Coleman played Martin Arrowsmith, Helen Hayes was Leora Tozer and Myrna Loy played Arrowsmith's temptress during the plague on the sultry West Indian isle.In the novel Dr Martin Arrowsmith oscillates between medical careerism and self-sacrificial idealistic devotion to a cause: pure research. There is little room for women in his life, especially if they try to shape the hero up into being a competent tennis player and snappy dresser. In the end, Martin Arrowsmith can become Martin Arrowsmith only in a simply living, tiny male celibate community in the woods of Vermont. Shades of John Henry Newman at Littlemore!Try to read this book just for itself. Caveat: that is easier said than done. But the novel has its own charm apart from its history and impact."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"I read below that several reviewers didn't appreciate this story even though it won a Pulitzer Prize.

The nickname of the title character, Sandy, is well-known by today's readers for the mayhem that it caused in the Northeastern seaboard of the United States just before Halloween, 2012. Most of the mayhem caused by Martin Arrowsmith is to himself.The title character objects to society's terms and standards of appropriateness, and constantly pushes the envelope. He proposed to two women at the same time, and then arranged a dinner for both women to meet each other. He defended a classmate, Clif Clawson, after he tossed a pancreas in the hat of a visiting dignitary to the college. He strayed from his wife by showing ardor toward the daughter of his boss. Yet, his personal faux pas were child's play to the career-limiting moves of his professional life.Sandy quit medical school in a move thought out as well as Michael Scott's resignation from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. When he established a small-town medical practice, Arrowsmith chewed out a local supplier of pharmaceuticals and was forced to purchase medical supplies from a less convenient location. As head of public medical institutions, Arrowsmith established dictates without considering their political ramifications - and then fought those ramifications even when it was inexpedient and sometimes, unnecessary.Martin Arrowsmith could have used a lesson from Benjamin Franklin, who worked hard but also publicized the fact that he did. Yet, Arrowsmith could never be like Franklin; in fact, Martin would have dismissed the Philadelphia statesman as a man of measured merriment.The character of Martin Arrowsmith is based, in part, on a French-Canadian microbiologist named Felix d'Herelle, and also, in part, on American microbiologist Paul de Kruif, who was not officially a co-author of the novel but contributed heavily to the ideas and characters involved. Yet Arrowsmith is more complex: he is a character who must choose his path in medicine. Martin is distracted from his calling as a scientist by being, at times, a physician, and a medical health official. He derisively refers to the 'men of measured merriment' yet also covets many of their trappings. Arrowsmith despises, at first, the scientist Terry Wickert, but also discovers that the scientist Wickert is the man that he wants to be.Max Gottlieb, who is somewhat of a mentor to Martin Arrowsmith, is based on two real-life characters from the medical world. One is the German-born American physiologist and biologist, Jacques Loeb, and another is Dr. Frederick G. Novy, synonymous with the Medical School at the University of Michigan. The McGurk Institute is modeled after the Rockefeller Institute, which is called The Rockefeller University today. These characters and places were influences to de Kruif, whose book, \`The Microbe Hunters,' is probably his most notable accomplishment. Unfortunately, Lewis and de Kruif had a falling out after Arrowsmith was published, with de Kruif believing he was a co-author of the book, while settling for a thank-you page and part of the novel's profits.No matter what your profession, Arrowsmith is a fine novel. His career-limiting moves are lessons to all professions, and his journey is something that all people have to consider in discovering their calling in life."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"This story rings true about someone living a life full of thought and desire to do good.

She didn't really have a personality, a character except being passive and almost non-existant.The book as a whole however, was a great experience.

Because this novel was written in 1925, it gives us a good view of what was then the current study and practice of medicine. It will seem dated because the development of the tools to fight infectious diseases (vaccines and antibiotics) was in its infancy, and the lack of these tools took a large toll on human life. Sinclair Lewis wrote an amazing book, both because of the compelling story and great use of language. Indeed, Sinclair won a Pulitzer Prize for this book, which he declined. Adding to the greatness of the story was the material provided by Paul de Kruif, a microbiologist who it is said contributed around a quarter of the story. This added a lot of then-contemporary medical science. I first came across de Kruif in The Microbe Hunters, another fabulous book (see my previous review of this). I strongly recommend Arrowsmith for anyone interested in the history of science or anyone who just wants to read a great book."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"In ARROWSMITH, Sinclair Lewis tells the story of idealistic Martin Arrowsmith, born poor, who rises through hard work, a passionate dedication to \\"the truth\\", and two advantageous marriages to become one of the world's leading medical scientists. Writing in 1961, Lewis's main biographer Mark Schorer said that ARROWSMITH remained the most widely read of Lewis's novels, and that in its day of 1925 it was \\"another instant success.... (it) stilled those carping voices that had complained that in MAIN STREET and BABBITT Lewis... lacked 'spiritual gifts'.\\" Stung by these criticisms, and determined to write a \\"heroic\\" novel that would silence his critics and give him a shot at the big prizes (his calculations were spot on, as ARROWSMITH did win him a Pulitzer), Lewis concocted a thrilling plot which includes elopement, angry parents, tempting young women, professional intrigue, a bubonic plague epidemic, and an oddly modern finale in which adequately heroic Martin quits his post at a major research institute and retreats to a startup in the backwoods of Vermont.The sentimental seriousness with which Lewis chronicles Martin's career and marriage to one of the most unrealistically ideal wives in literature marks a sad departure from the sardonic wit with which Lewis observed George Babbitt go about his daily American life. When Babbitt meets his wife after an absence during which he's been trying hard to stray from the confines of marriage, \\"he was dreading the moment when he would be alone with his wife and she would patiently expect him to be ardent.\\" How amusing and deadly that picture of Myrna's patient endurance of Babbitt's dreaded ardor compared to Martin's reaction when he's separated by the epidemic from his long-suffering and thus insufferable (to me, not Martin) wife Leora and tempted by lovely Joyce: \\"Did he really want Leora here, with Joyce... in the house? (Dear Leora, who was the source of life! Was she now... missing him, lying awake for him?) Suddenly he was out of bed, kneeling, praying to Leora.\\" Dear Leora, sticking to her usual policy of self-sacrifice for Martin's sake, conveniently dies, allowing Martin to marry the lovely and very rich Joyce with a clear conscience.ARROWSMITH marks not just a transition in Lewis's work from satire to heroic seriousness but is also the point at which Lewis turns away from seeing marriage from the female as well as the male point of view, and fixes his sympathies firmly with the men. Lewis is sympathetic enough towards Martin's first wife Leora, but how could he be otherwise, since she obliterates herself when her presence isn't required by Martin or the plot. She has the trick of napping \\"inoffensively\\" while Martin works, and remaining \\"unannoyingly silent.\\" But once Leora has been finally obliterated by bubonic plague, the silences of wives in Lewis's novels will invariably be annoying and their napping, offensive. This more limited patriarchal perspective, plus its deadly seriousness and mawkish sentimentality, are good enough reasons for ARROWSMITH to be almost completely forgotten today. Yet there are still reasons for reading it, chief among them the way Lewis, writing in 1925, manages to reveal so much about contemporary American life. Our obsession with the tricks and toys of science while we at the same time venerate a simpler more \\"natural\\" way of life. Our belief that intelligence and sporadic bursts of overwork will more than compensate for periods of drug-soaked dissolution and mediocrity (as they did in Lewis's own case). The tensions and power struggles in a marriage where the wife has money of her own. The vilification of socialism and organized labor by the comfortably middle-class. Reading even the most mediocre of Lewis's novels (which might be ARROWSMITH) lets us see how much of what we think of as modern about modern life has been part of American culture for at least four generations."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"I'm surprised to see so many less than stellar reviews of this book, because I really enjoyed it. Those who like tales of the early discoveries in classical microbiology, told with excitement as in Paul de Kruif's Microbe Hunters, will find plenty to love in these albeit fictional chapters. While the story can really get you excited about science, it also shows that, no matter how well-intentioned and important one's work may be, there can be exorbitant costs associated with too much passion for it. Good lessons for anyone contemplating in a career in science, which can easily consume too much of one's life, in my opinion. Beyond this, I throroghly enjoyed the characters, humor and description of the places and times. This is a book that is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"Arrowsmith is a 1925 novel by Sinclair Lewis (with considerable contributions from Dr. Paul de Kruif); it won the 1926 Pulitzer Prize, but Lewis rejected the award because the thought it promoted pandering in writers. The book chronicles the life of Martin Arrowsmith, a young medical student who tries to make it both as a practicing doctor and as a research scientist.Arrowsmith is always readable but never particularly interesting. It is rather loosely plotted (although for Lewis it's rather tightly plotted). Martin Arrowsmith is a headstrong, bridge-burning, tantrum-throwing idealist, and Lewis generates most of the novel's tension and conflict by throwing the most obnoxious, contrary characters Lewis can think up at him, and letting nature take its course. Much has been made about Arrowsmith being a \\"heroic\\" character; this is obviously debatable based on how one defines \\"heroic\\". Lewis certainly makes him a hero of medical idealism; but at the same time Arrowsmith is never particularly sympathetic.The novel is one great commentary on the medical and scientific professions. In fact, any time Lewis shifts the narrative focus away from Arrowsmith to other characters (which seems to happen unnecessarily often), the reader gets nothing but commentary. How applicable are these comments today? Well, that's nearly impossible for anyone outside the medical field to say.Today, Arrowsmith is likely to have an extremely limited appeal: those interested in medicine should find it quite engaging, but few others will."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"Sinclair Lewis's novels typically look at a facet of American life, circa 1920, via an &quot;biography&quot; of a fictional character. _Babbit_ examined the world of a boobish, hapless real-estate dealer. _Elmer Gantry_ showed us the lives of preachers and clergymen and charlatans._Arrowsmith_ is recognizably another entry in this series. It is partially set in the fictional midwestern state of Winnemac, and George Babbit makes a cameo appearance. This time around, we see the state of the medical profession, from the practice of a small-town doctor to high-end clinics and public health offices. But unlike George Babbit or the hilarious scoundrel Gantry, Martin Arrowsmith M.D. is someone with ideals. He's no saint; he occasionally neglects an understanding wife and &quot;blows&quot; many opportunities to advance his career by spending too much time in a lab, persuing basic research.But Martin eventually does succeed on his own terms, idealism intact, a rare victory for a Lewis character._Arrowsmith_ was definitely a slog compared to _Babbit_ or _Elmer Gantry_. There are plenty of satirical bits, but they are fewer and far between. Those interested in the nitty-gritty of medicine and scientific research before electronic gear, electron microscropes, and computers might forgive the relatively slow pace."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"As a current MD/PhD student, I was struck by how much the protagonist's experiences in medical education in the early 20th century mirrored mine in the beginning of the 21st century. In part, this underscores the large human component of medicine. Beneath the increasingly technological facade, the qualities of a good doctor and the struggles that medical education entails change little because human nature remains little changed throughout history. The book is well-written, if in sarcastic and satiric slang, that captures the inner conflicts of Dr. Arrowsmith. Although Lewis was known for satire, this book and at least its main character and his mentor Dr. Gottlieb are nuanced portrayals of archetypes. Lewis puts the characters in human circumstances such as when the reknowned scientist Gottlieb is rendered powerless next to a country doctor over the sickness of his wife because he has lost all his knowledge of clinical medicine. It is well-worth reading a fine piece of American literature and especially for anyone in medical school (especially when preparing for the Boards) who becomes too focused on their circumstance and what to add emotion and depth to the conviction that score of doctors before and after will trod the same path."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"Arrowsmith is one of Sinclair Lewis' best works and has an important place in American literature. A major twentieth century novel, it is essential for anyone interested in Lewis, and multiple differences from his other work make it worthwhile for others.The book has significant style and plot similarities to prior Lewis novels; for example, the small town/country doctor bit recalls Main Street, and the Zenith section recalls - and even briefly features the title character of - Babbitt. Lewis is known as a satirist, and those novels virtually epitomize the genre, but Arrowsmith is not satire. It has satirical elements and is sometimes humorous but is essentially a straight realist novel with a more or less straight-up hero. Thus, though Lewis' absolute realism mastery is as strong as ever, one might think Arrowsmith sounds pedestrian or dull. This is thankfully not so because the title hero was a new type - an exponent of scientific idealism. The novel initially seems to offer an interesting but inherently limited inside look at the early twentieth century medical profession and is indeed valuable here as far as it goes. We get a good idea of what things such as medical school, internships, country practice, public health, and urban practice were like. Medicine has of course changed much since Arrowsmith's 1925 publication, giving it notable historical value, but the depiction is still largely accurate, lending considerable insight into an important profession. Lewis' usual excellences are also on prominent display. We get a panoramic grand tour of post-World War I, pre-Great Depression America from mid-size and urban Midwestern towns to the rural West to Chicago, New York, and more. Anyone curious about the era will learn much about everything from speech to social etiquette to fashion. We even get a rare up-close glimpse of an exotic non-American setting; this section is noteworthy for its grim realism and tragedy, showing Lewis has more range than he usually gets credit for. Lewis also continues his penetrating analysis of all that was hollow and cheap about American society, critiquing capitalism and honing in on race, class, and gender issues among others. He was noticeably ahead of his time here and says much that is important.Far more significant, though, is Lewis' portrait of Arrowsmith the scientist, an idealist dedicated to pure research. Like Main, the novel came at just the right time to ride a cultural wave; the idolization - one might almost say \\"cult\\" - of science so prominent in American society was really beginning, and Arrowsmith became its prototype. This vehicle lets Lewis explore important themes like the pros and cons of various medical specialties, medical ethics, medicine's social role, the economics of medicine, etc. The central issue is the all-important question of pure vs. applied research; Lewis clearly champions the latter but makes good arguments for the former, which cannot simply be dismissed.Yet this is not just a book about medicine or science; Arrowsmith has typological significance beyond the obvious. Critics of Main and Babbitt often complain that Lewis fails to see or ignores the near-spiritual idealism at Americana's heart. Arrowsmith takes it up. The protagonist's devotion to science is in many ways only a then-new way of showing the remarkable single-minded devotion running through American culture from the Puritans to the Founding Fathers to the Transcendentalists to Lincoln to the Progressive Era - to the science aesthetic. Arrowsmith was thus both the new and the classic American gospel, and Lewis preached to a supremely receptive audience, making him almost as much journalist as prophet. Like other Lewis works, the novel is thus worth reading as the portrait of an era, epitomizing a spiritual strain prominent before the Depression. But is also more than this - in fact speaks to a yearning at American culture's very heart. We may or may not agree with Arrowsmith; we may not even like him, as he can be easily denigrated in several ways. However, he is a hero in a way prior Lewis protagonists were not; Lewis clearly sympathizes rather than using him as a mockery target. A magnificent creation, fully alive and thoroughly believable, he is one of Lewis' best characters. Secondary characters are also unusually strong; Lewis had been lambasted for stock types, and there are certainly some here, but the major characters Leora and Gottlieb are also great. The former is widely recognized as Lewis' best female character, more earthy and sympathetic than Main's ambivalently depicted Carol; the latter is an idealist much like Arrowsmith but with many of his own nuances. Even less fully drawn characters are invariably interesting, bringing out these three by contrast or giving comic relief.The novel is not perfect. Its uniqueness may disappoint those wanting Lewis' usual style, though enough of that remains for its detractors to be unsatisfied also. For instance, some object to his episodic plots; Arrowsmith is more tightly written than Main or Babbitt but still essentially episodic, and tactics used to make it seem less so - recurring characters, a \\"Where are they now?\\" ending that still seems arbitrary - often seem contrived. Some may also find the ending, with its overt modernization of Transcendentalism's nature obsession, quite strained. That said, execution is generally strong, and Lewis' conversational verisimilitude is at full strength.All told, this is a must for fans, but anyone curious about Lewis should know that this is not representative. Elmer Gantry, Main, and Babbitt are probably better introductions, and those who do not like Arrowsmith should try one of them. In the end, though, the novel is strong enough to stand on its own and is highly recommended for anyone interested in American literature.As for this edition, it has a fine Afterword by noted Lewis scholar Mark Schorer with background on Lewis, the novel, and the historical context plus some initial analysis; there is also a short bibliography. Several later editions are likely at least as good, but anyone who comes across this will get a quality version."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"Lewis writes, in very basic prose, of a turn-of-the-century man and his love for science. We follow young Martin Arrowsmith through his schooling and then into the upper echelons of doctor's officies, hospitals and laboratories. He grapples with several women and gradually finds himself staring down the figurative barrel of an increasingly-ignorant and hypocritical society. Some things go well for Arrowsmith, some things don't, and it's all wrapped up with a climactic, surreal and satisfying conclusion. I'd say it's a Great American Novel if there ever was one, and certainly another testament to Lewis's mastery.And oddly enough, I found Arrowsmith's story to be every bit as compelling as the finest of the thriller and mystery genres. A cursory glance will more than likely yield skepticism, but give it a few pages and you'll more than likely be hooked. Despite its subject matter, the novel rarely demands familiarity with the world of science and medicine. Lewis's writing is simple, easy to follow along with, and never dry or rambling. Those who are tired of being force-fed Fitzgerald and Steinbeck and Salinger, but still want to sample some of the early 20th Century's greatest literature, should invest some time in Lewis's work. He's a criminally overlooked novelist who deserves a hell of a lot more attention than he gets these days."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"Arrowsmith is the story of a young man who constantly tries to find himself and his place in the world.

When he takes a course in bacteriology he realizes the need for advancements in this science and his lifelong obsession for research is born.Needing a place to relax, he visits a city called Zenith and meets Madeline Fox who was working on her grad school courses and seemed to be searching for a husband. Eventually, they become engaged and she proceeds to attempt to change Martin's habits and mannerisms to the man she would like him to be.As he continues medical school, he's sent to Zenith Hospital where he meets a young nursing student, Leora Tozer. They become attracted to each other and have more in common than Martin and Madeline. They also become engaged and not knowing what to do, he introduces both women to each other and tells them he's engaged to both. Madeline's condescending attitude toward Leora and her comments about Leora's coming from a country place like North Dakota sways Martin to Leora.We follow Martin as he finished Medical school and moves to Leora's home town to set up family practice. It is interesting to see small town life in the western part of the country in the early nineteen hundreds. They have their own ideas about consuming alcohol, gambling, pharmacical drugs and medicine in general. Martin tries to fit in with the preconceived ideas of the farming community but eventually moves to the city where he will have more freedom.Martin tries a number of areas in his medical practice but his love is research and he takes a position in that area. During WWI, he joins the military and later is active doing research and helping with an epidemic of bubonic plague.The novel is well written but perhaps goes off the subject to moralize a bit too much.

Sinclair Lewis is a master craftsman of cumulative narratives. It becomes a matter of collating details and making a composite.The protagonist in this novel is a bit different from Lewis' other lead characters. Whereas Babbitt was always a sell out and phony, and while Carol Kennicott succumbs to a parochial mindset at the end of Main Street (whether or not she admits it), Martin's retirement to a cabin with friend Terry Wicket is an indicator of something rare and refreshing in a Lewis novel: A leading light who doesn't sacrifice integrity for reknown. There are any number of interesting minor characters to keep it interesting. Leora Tozer, Martin's first wife, is a poignant dim wit, and the story of Max Gottlieb's (Martin's college idol) hard-luck-to-sell-out story is a perfect and diverting trial for Martin, a man dedicated to pure research without sponsorship from some results-and-profit obsessed pharmaceutical company.This book is amazing, as are all Lewis novels I've encountered, in its intelligent depiction of unintelligent or, in some cases, misguided characters. It is something of a departure to find Lewis treating a character as an honorable, not a money-grubbing, human. This deserved its Pulitzer. And, considering Lewis' opprobrium for the greedy American mentality, it's not hard to see him refusing said prize."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"Having never previously read any of Lewis' books, I enjoyed this story of Dr Arrowsmith's career and the tension between &quot;commercialism&quot; and &quot;research&quot; that plays out in his life. Although it reads easily, I still find myself (days after finishing the book) thinking about it, relating it to my own life. I think this classic story is relevant for any professional."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"This novel won the Pulitzer Prize in 1926 (for whatever reason) which the author refused to accept (maybe he agreed with some of the reviews). The author later won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1930. The novel is about a fictional person growing up in a fictional state, going to a fictional university, etc. I may get jumped on by some people for saying so, but personally I found the story dull and tedious (a good cure for insomnia). It does not compare with other prize winning novels which I have read that were written during the same era (Pearl Buck's \\"The Good Earth,\\" Booth Tarkington's \\"The Magnificent Ambersons,\\" etc.). I suppose this is one of those novels that you must read if you are a literature student, but I would not recommend it to anyone else. If you have an interest in the author, I would suggest trying one of his other novels."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"It is incredible that Arrowsmith was published in 1925, the same year as The Great Gatsby, and yet won the the Pulitzer Prize (refused by Lewis for rather specious reasons, the only time, I believe, that a Pulitzer has been refused)over Gatsby. This is a testament to how times and tastes change. Today, Gatsby is acknowledged as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, fictional English novel of the 20th century while Arrowsmith is ignored and for good reason.I had been a fan of Lewis, having read Main Street, Babbitt and Elmer Gantry years ago. Those were good reads and effective period pieces of American life in the 1920's. Since then, though, I have read so much more of Hemingway, Faulkner, Fitzgerald and so many other fine authors that, coming back to Lewis, makes it so disheartening by comparison. Sinclair Lewis seems now to me to be so pedestrian and overly obvious in his writing, at least in this book.Arrowsmith is too long and boring. My major problem, however, is with the character. Martin Arrowsmith is not a heroic character, as depicted by so many others, but rather a narrow, obsessed scientist who forgets all his human values along the way. I realize that Lewis was depicting the clash between science and idealism, corruption within the medical establishment, the rapidly evolving state of science at the time, etc. but if his aim was to express the heroic pursuit of science (at any cost?) through Martin Arrowsmith he couldn't have chosen a worse vehicle as a character. It is the cost in human terms that bothers me.Martin Arrowsmith commences as a naive, rustic bumpkin in medical school. Thereafter, he fails in his medical practice, fails as a public health officer and as a pathologist until he is finally brought to a research institute where he can be secluded in a laboratory. It appears that only in a lab, where he doesn't have to relate to humans, is where Arrowsmith can succeed and he does at the expense of everything else. What is the cost? Well, he has a near tryst with a underage girl along the way, in the end he completely ignores his long-suffering first wife (Leora)in his pursuit of experiment. Later, in essence he allows Leora to die on the Caribbean island where they are battling bubonic plague through neglect because he is under the charms of another woman (Joyce)whom he marries later. But the real kicker is that he actually consents to witholding vaccine to certain natives, at the risk of their lives, to validate scientific experimentation!Arrowsmith's slavish devotion to his German mentor, Gottlieb, is also sickening. Gottlieb's cold, impersonal devotion to science only would have made him a great Nazi doctor years later.In the end, Lewis seems to try to redeem his main character as he tries to get back to nature and follow pure research. But, at what cost? Only his abandonment of his second wife Joyce and their young son.If I thought that Lewis was trying to show scientific pursuit, among his other themes, in all its good and ugly aspects, with Arrowsmith at the exemplar, I would feel differently. It is his sympathetic treatment, in my opinion, of Arrowsmith the character and use as the vehicle to caricature and satirize the rest in the plot that bothers me. Arrowsmith, the unfeeling, irresponsible, inhuman and very unheroic automaton is not the proper vehicle for this purpose. At least in my book."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"Sinclair Lewis defines Martin Arrowsmith as \`a young man who was in no degree a hero, who regarded himself as a seeker of truth, yet who stumbled and slid back all his life and bogged in every obvious morass.' He is \`a snuffing beagle', who in his lifespan covered in this book never was in control of his destiny.This book touches all kind of important themes:- Commercialism and the religion of a scientist: \`Knowledge is the greatest thing in the medical world, but it's no good whatever if you can't sell it.'- Commercialism and profession: \`Explain to a patient, also his stricken and anxious family, the hard work and thought you are giving to his case, and so make him feel that the good you have done to him, is even greater than the fee you plan to charge.'- Public v. private health system: \`to get rid of avoidable diseases and produce a healthy population is killing commercialization, making money. Therefore doctors must become public health officers.'- Psycho-analysts as guess-scientists.- General human problems: \`the cruelty of nature kicking human beings by every gay device of moonlight and white limbs into heaving babies.- Influence of the Church on the irrationality of the masses. Its battle against free-thinking.- Personal problems: alcoholism, marriage.None of these themes is properly developed.The scientific basis of this book is very poor: fighting the plague with bacteriophages.Into the bargain, there is virtually no plot: the human relations with friends, colleagues, professors or women are more or less accidental. Also, after a far too long itinerary, the story ends abruptly.This book is a big disappointment and can only be recommended to Sinclair Lewis fans."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"I read this book as part of my participation in the high school extracurricular event Academic Decathlon. From this book, I was supposed to learn about the medical profession, the scientific research profession, the lives of scientists and doctors and how they fared in a rural, Midwestern America populated by bible-thumpers, illiterates, country hicks, and indigent farmers. What I got was the biography of a workaholic.Martin Arrowsmith, the protagonist of this book, is devoted to basic medical research, and is willing to sacrifice much in life to do it. These include money, fame, time with his loving wife, and time to himself to do things like exercise, go on a vacation, go out for a good meal, etc... In short, Mr. Arrowsmith is a workaholic, pure and simple. Just because his work is medical research instead of say selling cars does not excuse his undying love of work. In reading this book I saw the reflection of many people I know; single or divorced workaholics. Yes their jobs are important and yes they love their jobs, but they, like Arrowsmith, lack balance in their life. Overall, I found the book quite boring, and do not believe it should have won the Pulitzer Prize."},{"Title":"Arrowsmith","review":"I have to say that i do love to read a variety of books, but Sinclair Lewis' novel Arrowsmith was absolutely horrible, and discouraged me from reading any other novels by Lewis. The novel was dull and boring. There was no excitement or suspense. There wasn't even a interesting plot. The novel also had an extreme amount of unnecessary characters,and it was too long which made the novel even more ridiculous. From most novels, you learn some values or something, but I didn't learn anything from Arrowsmith, except that sometimes a nap can be more interesting than reading a book."},{"Title":"One Plus One Equals Nineteen: Married: The Second Time Around","review":"I know everyone would enjoy reading it. It is a story full of life, humor, challenges, compassion, and sharing. The excitement for the family combining to nineteen persons in a large home is never ending. How this was accomplished and how the problems were solved are enlightening and inspiring. The planning, organizing and control is a leasson in good management. Once you start reading, you can't put it down until you finish. The book is easy reading and a happy story. The problems for step parents and step children are very different and are solved to bring a happy home. This is a unique true story of the big family life in the big city."},{"Title":"One Plus One Equals Nineteen: Married: The Second Time Around","review":"I read the book in two nights and I have so many other things to do.

Riley's poems has a \\"long left behind\\" connection for me--When I was a youngster, mom would come into my bedroom on rare special late nights and in total darkness give a spirited verbatim recitation of \\"Little Orphant Annie.\\" This is the story of a hired colored woman who kept her charges in line by telling them a ghost story with this frightening refrain:An' the Gobble-uns'll git youEf you Don't Watch Out!Widely read in late 19th and early 20th Century America, \\"The Hoosier Poet\\" James Whitcomb Riley (Oct. 7, 1849 - Jul. 22, 1916) is nearly forgotten today. A recent example of the continued slighting of Riley occurs during the credit scroll of the 2011 crime drama,TEXAS KILLING FIELDS, where a sung version of \\"Orphant Annie\\" is credited only to the music's composer.James W.'s rhymes are often in dialect:\\"Hain't that-air Squire Hanch's oldBuggy,\\" he says, \\"and claybank mare?\\"Says I, \\"Le' 's git out the cold--Your company's nigh 'bout froze!\\"No wonder then that Riley's celebrity faded long ago.

My satisfaction rate was very high with this product...until I went to France to teach for a year. My French exchange partner alerted me to the myriad of errors, anglicisms, and outdated or incorrect pictures in the text. I loved the methodology (in spite of its lack of cultural information), but I would recommend that McGraw Hill correct the errors."},{"Title":"Deux mondes: A Communicative Approach (Student Edition) + Listening Comprehension Audio CD","review":"I've studied college French for 3 years and taken French 1 and 2 twice. Of all the text books used I find this one the most accessible. Yes its sometimes silly and yes all the topics are geared towards learners 18-28 (I'm in my late 40's), however, the grammatical organization of the blue pages and the topical vocabulary lists are invaluable. Some have complained that there are grammatical errors. A few typos yes, but not really grammatical errors so much as not quite telling the whole truth to a beginner, because doing so would make approaching the material overwhelming. When you get past French 3 and 4 and keep at it trying to become a half way decent french speaker, one discovers that while all the grammar is more or less presented by French 3 -its much more in depth and flushed out as you delve a bit deeper and by the time you've made your way into French 4 and beyond, you're pretty committed so finding out its a bit more complex than you thought, doesn't put you off your entire adventure and dream to speak French relatively well.Because of its clarity and simplicity and direct access to grammar via the blue pages, this is an excellent resource. Lots of exercises per chapter as well to grease your wheels and get them turning. EAsy snapshot essays of French peoples lives are insightful and peppered throughout the topically organized chapters. I still use this text to refer back to when I get into sticky grammatical questions of \\"when this rule vs when this rule\\". I've posted sticky notes that extend outside of the chapters like tabs w/subtitles of grammar covered in that chapter so I can just open the book quickly to where I need to get to.

Moreover, it should appeal to anyone interested in the &quot;culture wars&quot; that have unfortunately become a part of higher education in the USA. The book chronicles the struggles of a Chinese woman who is persecuted by Red Guards and Communist authorities during that country's insanity in the 1960s. After &quot;escaping&quot; to study in the USA, she learns that she must conform and obey the politically correct authorities who control her university or suffer the consequences. It appears that China doesn't have a monopoly on political insanity! The book is interesting and provocative. When reading the text--particularly the portion of her experiences in the USA--a reader doesn't know whether he or she should laugh or cry (probably both). One thing is for sure, you won't put this volume down until you have completed reading it! I rate this book Five Stars out of Five Stars!"},{"Title":"Dog's Daughter: My Life in Communist China and Liberal America","review":"Lei Wang was born to parents condemned as counter-revolutionaries during the time of Mao. She was raised by politically out-of-favor grandparents. She endured abuse from officials, teachers, Red Guards, and her peers, who called her &quot;dog's daughter,&quot; lowest of the wretched.Mao died and the political line changed. Lei distinguished herself as a student and teacher. She came to the United States for further study. She hoped that the United States was different. But what she experienced was a similar form of persecution from the liberal academic establishment.Mostly this book is about courage. Lei has the courage to believe in reasonable, scientifically supported facts that contradict politically correct ones. She has the courage to express those ideas in hostile circumstances where a price is paid. And she has the courage to endure, believing in the value of even a lone voice of sanity.I'm a retired teacher. I can attest to Lei's characterization of the educational establishment.

The musical accompanimentwas provided by Gabriel, and angels were so happy that ten thousandof them danced on the head of a pin.I was mesmerized from that point on . . . and each chapter seeminglykept getting better, covering such diverse topics as aging, learning,vacationing, sexuality, teaching and violence."},{"Title":"Even the Stars Look Lonesome","review":"I was looking to get something else when I first bought this book....but, nevertheless, its message resonated with me where, on page 174-175, Maya eloquently pens about Dr. Martin Luther King saying that we all are related to one another and that we all share same demons and divines. Then she writes about W.E. R. Dubois, the first African-American to attend Harvard University who said ALL people, of all colours, age and status dream of a fair and workable future.....the message could not be more important today in a rising economic depression, loss of wealth and purchasing power of poor and middle-class Americans, and growing fascism that is beginning to creep into America today thanks to the cold and calculated Neocon influence."},{"Title":"Even the Stars Look Lonesome","review":"When Maya Angelou was a young woman -- &quot;in the crisp days of my youth,&quot; she says -- she carried with her a secret conviction that she wouldn't live past the age of 28. Raped by her mother's boyfriend at 8 and a mother herself since she graduated from high school, she supported herself and her son, Guy, through a series of careers and buoyed by an implacable ambition to escape what might have been a half-lived, ground-down life of poverty and despair. &quot;For it is hateful to be young, bright, ambitious and poor,&quot; Angelou observes. &quot;The added insult is to be aware of one's poverty.&quot; In &quot;Even the Stars Look Lonesome,&quot; a collection of reflective autobiographical essays, Angelou gives no further explanation for her &quot;profound belief&quot; that she would die young.&quot;I was thirty-six before I realized that I had lived years beyond my deadline and needed to revise my thinking about an early death,&quot; she recalls. &quot;With that realization life waxed sweeter. Old acquaintances became friendships, and new clever acquaintances showed themselves more interesting. Old loves burdened with memories of disappointments and betrayals packed up and left town, leaving no forwarding address, and new loves came calling.&quot;Angelou, looking at tailights of her 20's, is the nearest thing America has to a sacred institution, a high priestess of culture and love in the tradition of such distaff luminaries (all of them, hitherto, white) as Isadora Duncan and Pearl S. Buck, with a bit of Eleanor Roosevelt and Aim&eacute;e Semple MacPherson thrown into the mix.&quot;She was born poor and powerless in a land where/power is money and money is adored,&quot; the poet Angelou writes in tribute to another astonishing black woman of our time, Oprah Winfrey. &quot;Born black in a land where might is white/and white is adored./Born female in a land where decisions are masculine/and masculinity controls.&quot; Angelou's lifelong effort to escape and expose the &quot;national, racial and historical hallucinations&quot; that have burdened black women in America and replace them with a shining exemplar of power, achievement and generosity of spirit is as miraculous as she says it is, even if one suspects that in &quot;real life&quot; Angelou must be a little hard to take.&quot;I would have my ears filled with the world's music,&quot; she writes, &quot;the grunts of hewers of wood, the cackle of old folks sitting in the last sunlight and the whir of busy bees in the early morning ... All sounds of life and living, death and dying are welcome to my ears.&quot; At times Angelou seems more like a blast from Olympus than a woman of flesh and blood.Reading these essays, I found myself longing somewhat guiltily for evidence of smallness on her part, of pettiness, even -- some sign that even an icon as monumental as she is might occasionally allow herself an irritated moment, a lapse into cynicism, or humor that wasn't so resolutely seasoned and wise.On the other hand, smallness isn't what Maya Angelou stands for. Ordinary is not what she does. Only a cynic, a smaller mind than Angelou's, could fail to welcome the gifts she offers."},{"Title":"Even the Stars Look Lonesome","review":"&quot;Even The Stars Look Lonesome&quot;, by Maya Angelou is a collection of short insights into things that are important to her.

She also reveals her knowledge to the reader on sensuality and how everyone has the right to sexuality. My favorite one is her essay on how her thoughts of growing old have changed since she has become old. In her book she shows the downside of having pride in her fame and she also tells of the unforgetable lessons she has learned of violence and anger. There is also a short profile of Oprah and other stories fo being an African-American. &quot;Even The Stars Look Lonesome&quot; is Maya Angelou's book of things that she believes must be learned throught one's lifetime."},{"Title":"Even the Stars Look Lonesome","review":"What a Voice!

This book was an intelligent continuation of her best selling book Wouldn't Take Anything from my Journey Now. Taking life one day at a time, and learning from each experience is what this book is all about. The recreating of each memorable happening from love and intimacy to rage and violence, not discounting her remarkable outlook on age, fame, and perhaps the most impotent, the comfort and security you find in a home and a family. The experiences would relate more to elder women looking for advice and insight on common life issues.In this novel, Maya Angelou has combined a wonderful collection of life experiences that have formed and made her the person she is today. Each chapter reflects an important stepping-stone of her life. The book consists of twenty chapters that are mumbled together and yet stayed in order of the way they took place.The plot is always changing each chapter is like a different book. Towards the beginning of the novel, love and divorce where the experience of choice and she soon moves in to her times in Africa, and how challenging it is to be an African American Women earning her well deserved respect. Maya Angelou's novel also voices her opinion on age, denial, and anger to an older age group of African American women, using emotionally over powering stories. The chapters are short and moderately easy to get through, if you're good at combing facts and clues to complete the final picture.Coming to a conclusion of the eye opening novel Even the Star Look Lonesome we feel as though the experiences displayed in this book would better relate to women between the ages of 20 and 80. The reason for that relation is due to the fact not many people have experienced the things talked about until theses ages have been reached. Also the group felt the book was directed towards African Americans and the troubles that race encounters."},{"Title":"Even the Stars Look Lonesome","review":"Although I did not find this book as good as some of her others, the experiences and feelings that Maya conveys are rich with detail and passion.

The issues explored within the volume include the level of the problem in the United States; is this in fact a serious problem or one that is heighted by the media? Are gangs active outside major urban areas? The factors that influence gang membership are explored, including family issues, respect and self-esteem issues, and desire for money. The various palns for eliminating or reigning in gang activity are explored, including the idea that gangs themselves can be brought to end the violence by themselves.Overall, this is a very good beginners book to the issue. It helps to set the guidelines for debate and discussion. There is an appendix with facts and statistics about the gangs and gang activities, study questions, further reading suggestions and an index. The author, Gail B. Stewart, has written over 80 books for children and young adults on a wide range of topics."},{"Title":"David Bowie: Out of the Cool","review":"After reading the excellently written and extremely well researched &quot;Alias David Bowie&quot;, this book is a farce.

Writing is in this case a misnomer because as the title suggests the emphasis is on calligraphy. The workbook, which is about the size of a standard magazine, starts with how to make a reed pen for calligraphy. The next part concentrates on the mufradaat (single letters), followed by murakkabaat (joined letters) and kalimaat (words). The book finishes with a gallery of beautiful examples of naskh calligraphy taken from throughout history. The presentation within each section is jumbled and unsystematic but not so much so that the text isn't worthwhile. The book is especially good at depicting the correct stroke order and the letters are large sized which a great help when just starting out. If you are a novice you will probably be happy with this book but will have preferred a more methodical, step-by-step presentation of the material.For those without who want to learn to read as well write in Arabic The Arabic Alphabet by Awde and Samano is about as good of an introduction as one can find, however it doesn't have the beautiful examples of scripts and the large-size lettering that Arabic Calligraphy has (both books are cheap so go ahead and get the two of them.) If Arabic Calligraphy stimulates your appetite for more check out the richly illustrated Arabic Script: Styles, Variants, and Calligraphic Adaptations by Gabriel Mandel Khan. It depicts many of the styles besides naskh, traces their historical development, and discusses the latent symbolism that is present in many of these beautiful forms."},{"Title":"Arabic Calligraphy: Naskh Script for Beginners","review":"Though I've only read through this book, not yet having 'road-tested' it, I am thoroughly delighted in finding this slim volume and hope that further series (amateur, advanced, specialised) are forthcoming.For starters, I think it should be stated that this book is not for someone who wants to gain an understanding of the Arabic alphabet, i.e. pronunciation. This is a book for someone who knows what the letters sound like and has a pretty good understanding of which letter is which. I don't see this as a fault at all and I hope no one else does. At some point, you have to stop second guessing your audience. That said, this book carefully details, just as Roman alphabet calligraphy books, the finer points of how to scribe each and every letter of the Arabic alphabet. All in all, this book is excellent for someone wanting more than the average 'how to write arabic' primer. It gives proper form as a guideline, while expressing that of course ideals cannot be exact on every writing. It gives hints on how to perfect the line of each letter and the best part: it carefully goes over possible forms and joinings of seperate letters with each other. There is a brief display of ligatures, which the author states is a whole new subject outside the scope of the book. I can only hope that is his way of hinting at a sequel!"},{"Title":"Arabic Calligraphy: Naskh Script for Beginners","review":"For those who want to learn Arabic calligraphy then this the book you need. It is not about the Arabic language but it rather instructs you how to write Arabic in a beautiful way. People starting to learn Arabic calligraphy begin with the 'Naskh' style which is a simple and yet very beautiful script. It is a very widely used script and mostly used in writing the Holy Quran. The book can also help those who want to improve their handwriting. The instructions given are very easy to follow."},{"Title":"Arabic Calligraphy: Naskh Script for Beginners","review":"It's very hard to find ANY book like this one: an actual aid to those to whom Arabic script is completely unfamiliar. This book fills the bill, even for a senior (77) citizen learning Persian!"},{"Title":"Arabic Calligraphy: Naskh Script for Beginners","review":"This is absolutely the best \\"how to\\" book on Arabic calligraphy!! I have searched for years to find the perfect book and my perseverance has paid off. This book shows everything needed to be an expert in the fine art of Arabic calligraphy. I have made my own pens, as per the author's instructions, and I must say that that exercise alone prepared my for the task ahead.I have coupled this book with others that I have on the history of the script and the language; a very good mix. Excellent book; it accomplishes all it claims."},{"Title":"The Meaning of Love","review":"Montagu edits this volume of essays on love, written by a variety of scientists, physicians, and a theologian in the early 1950's. Among the authors are Abraham Maslow, Pitirim A. Sorokin, and James Luther Adams. The editor writes that these essays find their purpose in \\"helping to liberate the love that is within, to enable more people to understand, feel, and enjoy the great power that is within them, the need which they have to give and receive love\\" (v). Montagu believes that inquiring into the various meanings of love may give clues for understanding love and the capacity to express love more adequately."},{"Title":"God's Orchard","review":"Friesen's book is an excellent introduction to two things -- what the fruit of the Spirit really means, and the dangers that people who want to make peace in a broken world face. It is must reading for those who think that they would like to serve God and their fellow human beings by working in tough areas of the world. Working in tough areas means facing intergroup conflict, but it also means facing live plundering mobs,rapists, even live hand grenades. The most valuable aspect of the book is that it demonstrates the different that the fruit of the spirit makes in tackling these issues."},{"Title":"Horseless carriage days.","review":"Hiram Percy Maxim is the son of Hiram Stevens Maxim, inventor of the machine gun. Hiram Percy Maxim's legacy is in automobiles, sound deadening, and the founding of the amateur radio society (ARRL).This book however, deals explicitly with his experiences with the earliest motor cars, from 1893-1901. (You'll be surprised to learn the degree of sophistication things had reached by 1901.) Hiram's first invention involves mounting a gasoline engine of his own design on an old tandem tricycle. It doesn't work well but gets him a job with the Pope Manufacturing company, bicycle manufacturer. Ultimately he leads them to build both gasoline and electric vehicles with great success.The charm of the book however, is all in Hiram's descriptions of \\"firsts\\". The first time he heard his gasoline engine run he thought something had exploded, he'd never heard one before. His first vehicles didn't have brakes, or clutches, etc. until he discovered the need! Plus his description of buying gasoline in paint shops by the ounce and the pitiful condition of the roads is quite vivid. (The roads were in worse shape than ever because the railroad had put the stagecoaches out of business.)The writing is fascinating and charming. This is a fine book."},{"Title":"Funny Stories for Nine Year Olds","review":"I bought this book to read to a third grade class, but I'm glad I didn't! The description sounds great and the titles of the short stories are creative and capture your attention, but when you start reading the stories you realize the book is very dated and has inappropriate content for current socially acceptable behavior. It includes smoking on a train and punks with loud music disturbing others and thinking it's funny to turn the music up. The funny and 'wonderfully entertaining' parts aren't funny or entertaining, they're just anti-social and negative behaviors. It's so difficult to find a silly, funny, happy book for 3rd-5th graders! I asked librarians for recommendations too, they suggested theSideways Stories from Wayside Schooland the series of these books. I also read the picture books by Rob Scotton -Splat the CatandMinnie and Moo: The Case of the Missing Jelly Donut (I Can Read Book 3), these are silly, harmless, funny books. We just couldn't find a short stories book for this age group that was a great 'giggle-at' book to read... any suggestions would be welcome and it seems very needed! Anyone want to write one?!! I'd buy it!"},{"Title":"The Legal Lampoon: A Biased, Unfair, and completely accurate law review from Non Sequitur","review":"You will like this book if youa) appreciate the humor and superb drawing-style of Wileyb) really, really hate lawyersc) you are a kind of lawyer yourself.If all of the above applies, I can guarantee that you will love this book. I do."},{"Title":"The Legal Lampoon: A Biased, Unfair, and completely accurate law review from Non Sequitur","review":"Wiley Miller skewers life in a wonderful way. Targeting lawyers (I have a couple in the family) is almost too easy, but he carries it off perfectly. My daughter the lawyer loved it!"},{"Title":"The Legal Lampoon: A Biased, Unfair, and completely accurate law review from Non Sequitur","review":"What can I say; as a lawyer in training, its good to get the perspective of how I am going to be viewed in society. My personal favorite strip from the book involves Ernie the Sociopath, but you will have to buy it to figure out what he does. This book is hilarious, and is perfect if you have regular dealings with those in the law profession. I would not recommend giving this as a gift to an attorney; after all, we know how sensitive they are.Overall, Wiley is one of the best comic strip artists today. The art is crisp and clear, and more importantly, the strips are not dominated by dialogue. Many of the strips in this collection involve a small caption and then just art. As I am currently in law school, I feel I have the privilege to paraphrase his introduction, which is to the effect that so long as we have ambitionless kids, whose only desire is to make money, our law schools will always be full. This sentiment is expressed clearly throughout this collection, and will leave anyone rolling on the floor in laughter at the \\"legalities\\" attorney's are there to protect."},{"Title":"The Legal Lampoon: A Biased, Unfair, and completely accurate law review from Non Sequitur","review":"As a lawyer, I detest lawyer jokes--unless I tell them!The Legal Lampoon includes the jokes I would like to have told first, in cartoon form. As with the book, I look forward to each day a lawyer strip appears from Non Sequitur.If you like lawyers, and particularly if you don't, you will like these!"},{"Title":"The Legal Lampoon: A Biased, Unfair, and completely accurate law review from Non Sequitur","review":"I discovered Non Sequitur a couple of years ago and always look forward to more of this wonderful humor."},{"Title":"The Legal Lampoon: A Biased, Unfair, and completely accurate law review from Non Sequitur","review":"First there was Larson, and then, there was Wiley... When Larson stopped making cartoons, the world groaned - and I found Non Sequitur! If you love dry humour in cartoons and an 'outside in looking out' type of outlook on life, then you'll love just about anything concerning Non Sequitur. Unlike Larson, Wiley is more diverse in what he pokes fun at, and this book is a special collection of the fun he pokes at the humourless legal profession. It plays on stereotypes, it probably preys on reality, but the end result is a hilarious collection of books aimed at gently lampooning the legal profession."},{"Title":"The Legal Lampoon: A Biased, Unfair, and completely accurate law review from Non Sequitur","review":"Lawyers, and the law as it's actually practiced, are baffling, convoluted, and impossible for the layman to understand.Thank you, Wiley, for giving the clearest, most understandable interpretation to date!If you don't already love Wiley's outrageous, piercing humor, treat yourself. The only thing wrong with this book is that it ends - I finished the last page ready for more."},{"Title":"WILD ORCHARD A Novel of Down Under","review":"Just off the continent of Australia lies the island of Tasmania. It was to this pleasant land in the year 1840 that Jan Halifax brought his lovely young bride, Harriat Bracken. Theirs had been a quick and stormy courtship. Overriding the restrictions of the conventional clergyman'. family into which the beautiful Harriat had been born, Jan wooed her and carried her away to face with him the adventures of Van Dieman's Land, as Tasmania was then called. She was equipped with no knowledge of what lay before her, but she loved her husband. That was enough. Wild Orchard is the story of how they strive to wrench a home out of the stubborn, discouraging \\"bush\\", and establish the name Halifax gloriously and solidly--in Island history. Fire swept away their promised house but friendly neighbors and willing workmen helped them build again. Ex-convicts were their servants, and the lawlessness of a raw country sometimes frightened the gently bred Harriat.78"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Taoist on Wall Street","review":"I read this book years ago, and still think of it fondly as one of my lifetime favorites. I am going to try to find out if there's an audio version, or audios of Payne's other books. I almost envy those who haven't read it yet. And for those who haven't - you're in for a delicious treat!"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Taoist on Wall Street","review":"I, too, read this book several years ago and remember it vividly. For a long time it was almost like a bible for me. I carried it everywhere, would read parts of it to friends. I found that it engaged every emotion. I particularly enjoyed the first part, where the&quot;orphan' boy sets out on his journey from the great canyons of China to find his father in the great canyons of Wall Street. Every scene is vivid and gripping, especially the one in which he comes upon the great panda bear - a terrifying and thrilling omen (no cuddly stereotyping here!) This is a book that is very funny and mysterious at the same time, a combination of gloppy egg foo yung and stirring oriental mysticism. (With a little deli thrown in for variety). How did he manage to do it? This writer is a magician and &quot;Confessions&quot; is a literary classic - your loss if you miss it."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Taoist on Wall Street","review":"I love his work. It is compelling and beautiful and this is his most incredible story. It is about adventure, family, love and the search for self. It is a life changing book and I wish he would hurry up with that sequel to Ruin Creek!"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Taoist on Wall Street","review":"This book is a book of a lifetime. It is a book that I respect and pay tribute to. David Paynes masterpiece! East to West this story implants characters and circumstances that cultivate your mind. This book is an inspiration to entering life and its stages."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Taoist on Wall Street","review":"This book carried me away. I was stuck thinking about it for years. David Payne followed this book with &quot;Early From the Dance&quot;. He is a moving writer. You could think of him as a cross between J.R.R. Tolkien and Anne Tyler. Go ahead, read it, you'll see what I mean."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Taoist on Wall Street","review":"He rings the bell often for any who have ever delved into and admired philosophical Taoism, but not without a price as paid to Christianity, contemporary Judaism and Acquisitionism... Payne has obviously paid his dues in all quarters and more importantly, to erudition. A masterful work complete with episodic prose-poetry."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Taoist on Wall Street","review":"The pace, style, characters reflected the East vs. West throughout the book. The journey of discovery was spiritual, enlightening, comical, cynical, allegorical.....a wonderful experience!"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Taoist on Wall Street","review":"This book is a book of a lifetime.

This book is an inspiration to entering life and its stages."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Taoist on Wall Street","review":"The Yin and Yang of it all ... I've finished reading David Payne's Confessions of a Taoist on Wall Street and was telling the boss about the most wonderful aspect of this read being the absolute emotional tug of war (speaking of Ying & Yang) readers will experience as they follow the adventures of half-Chinese/half-American, Sun I (pronounced Sun-Yee) as he confronts life outside the Taoist priesthood (he'd been dedicated to) to pursue an ultimate enlightenment (through his American father's world) on Wall Street (the Tao within the Dow and vice versa). Confessions is a lesson in philosophy and vocabulary amidst so much more. While the author can write spot-on dialogue of any kind (including Brooklynese), his vocabulary (for this reader) requires a dictionary be handy. I was jotting down words (to look up later) like a dervish.Confessions starts in China and ends up in lower Manhattan. We root for this guy at every turn, even when we see him turning from mellow to monster ... he's befriended by another Chinese-American already living here. Wo is one of life's poor slobs who (like so many of us) works hard while constantly falling behind ... he owns his own restaurant in Chinatown and has two daughters (one gorgeous, the other pretty; the former somewhat icily pragmatic, the other mellow and forgiving). We want Sun I to fall for the latter, of course (Yin-Mi), but he falls for the former (Li). And just when we think we can safely dislike Li, that old Yin and Yang acts up again and we find ourselves rooting for her (to escape). Hey, no spoilers here ... go read the thing. It's a terrific book by one of my favorite American authors. The characters are as rich as any I've ever read. Payne paints Wall Street with the Dickensian brush it deserves. My favorite character throughout this wonderful read was a Jewish seat holder named Kahn. This guy's monologues are Roth-like. He's hilarious and profound. Author Payne is from the south, but you'll never guess it. The bonus (to all great reads, I feel) is the education you get: Confessions offers Chinese philosophy, Greek mythology, all forms of literature and poetry, Yiddish, business (to include stock market parlance) and a genuine touch of New York (and China). This guy (David Payne) is one of the best around, amici ... so go READ him."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Taoist on Wall Street","review":"I was fascinated with this book in many regards. First, it is a truly a masterpiece which one can't stop reading until it's over. Second, most importantly, the author was able to grasp in depth and reveal in a very accessible way two seemingly opposite life philosophies and eras as represented by Eastern Tao and Western Dow."},{"Title":"Confessions of a Taoist on Wall Street","review":"couldn't put it down. Do get a copy but take your dictionary with you as a guide. The vocabulary is rich and you will be amazed at some of his clever wording. I hope his other books are the equal.

And I have read many, many books over the years.I would get lost in f/stops and shutter-speeds and light-meters and fiddle endlessly with my SLR camera. I bought this book after I had just sold my SLR and got my first digital camera, a Canon S50. My eyesight is not so good anymore and I wanted an easy to use point and shoot with some manual features.After reading this book, I have been getting some pretty amazing pictures with my new digital camera. I shoot many, many pictures and come up close to the subject and a lot of the time, just turn off the flash. And the pictures that have resulted are the best I have ever taken (I love taking people-pictures).Some 30 pictures I took recently of a little girl in a matter of about 45 minutes came out so good, her dad couldnt stop thanking me for the great pictures. To me only two of them were outstanding. Is this my new skill, am I now a terrific photographer? Pshaw ! I simply followed Nick Kelsh's advice and just came in close and shot many pictures. And some of them came out just great. Really !I now have this book plus Kelsh's &quot;Family&quot; and &quot;Baby&quot; books.

In simple language, it explains how to make good photos with any camera. There is no deep technical analysis (Like Ansel Adams in \\"The Camera\\", \\"The Negative\\" or John Shaw's Nature Photography Field Guide). There are no guidelines how to improve your creativity (like \\"Learning to See Creatively: Design, Color & Composition in Photography or Photography and the Art of Seeing\\" by Freeman Patterson or \\"A Visual Perception Workshop for Film and Digital Photography\\" by Bryan Peterson). This books are great but doesn't answer simple way for simple questions (like questions many my friends asked me). Book covers most common shooting situations and explains how to avoid common mistakes and make your photo looks much better and more interesting. I red a lot of books on this topic (good books), but they mostly dedicated to people who want to become professional photographer or photo artist. Even I already know all ideas presented in this book, it was helpful for me to read this."},{"Title":"How to Photograph Your Life: Capturing Everyday Moments with Your Camera and Your Heart","review":"As a working pro, people often ask me how to take better pictures. I simply give them the guidelines Nick gives in this book, and then point them to a copy of it. He talks in accessible language, with no jargon, and no special tools needed. You can apply his thoughts to pictures you take with a disposable camera.More importantly, Nick shows you what he would do... and he took the photos in the book with his wife's point and shoot. By showing you what the average person would do and what he would do, it helps you learn how to compose pictures. But what makes Nick special is that he also shows you not a thought process, but a heart process, one that takes photography out of the realm of souvenir shooting and into the place where people make emotional connections to the moments that make up our lives and our families. This is the genius of the book: You learn how to feel with a camera as an extension of your heart.I have yet to see a friend look inside this book, even just to skim it, and not come away as a better photographer."},{"Title":"How to Photograph Your Life: Capturing Everyday Moments with Your Camera and Your Heart","review":"Nick Kelsh's books have seriously inspired me to kick my photography skills up a notch without overwhelming me. I saw the titles to his books in Lasting Memories magazine and knew I wanted to read them.

I now am finding myself looking at everyday life events and saying how that would make a great picture. I now carry my camera around with me all the time waiting for getting that perfect shot."},{"Title":"How to Photograph Your Life: Capturing Everyday Moments with Your Camera and Your Heart","review":"I purchased this along with How to Photograph Your Baby by the same author. The equipment is a little dated, but proves that the camera isn't the limiting factor.

I am sorely disappointed that this is the last in the series at this time. But, hope spings eternal that another volume of the lives of Richard Canidy, Jim Whittaker, Lt. Colonel Douglass, and Erik Fulmar and the women they love will continue the story of the OSS. After all another addition to the Brotherhood of War series is due out in January, 2001. Griffin is a wonderful storyteller with the experience that makes you want to believe that the stories really are more truth than fiction."},{"Title":"The Fighting Agents","review":"After some lackluster recent efforts, Griffin reminds us why he's considered one of the most capable military fiction authors out there.Excitement level is good; as is often the case, Griffin takes us to a new region (Yugoslavia/Hungary) and shows good area and language knowledge. He leaves the future and survival of one of the main characters of the series in real doubt throughout most of the book. The recent tendency of Griffin to be over-reliant on sex and infidelity as themes is absent. Either the original version (of which this is a republishing) lacked those themes, or it was rewritten. Either way, the romantic stuff doesn't detract from the storytelling, which is classic Griffin.As a bonus, we see some of the less-emphasized characters of the series gain development and fullness. The afterword, which I will not spoil for you except to say that it refers to Griffin's real world acquaintance with historical figures, is revealing and interesting.If you've read the first three, this is a strong continuation. If you have not, the whole series is worth your time and money."},{"Title":"The Fighting Agents","review":"This is the fourth and final book in the series originally published under the nom de plume, Alex Baldwin. Griffin does his usual excellent job of writing a compelling piece of fiction in a setting of historical events. Bitter, Canidy, Whittaker, Fulmar and company continue their exploits, now in the middle of WW II. The question is, now that the publisher has run out of books to reprint, will Mr. Griffin give us something new in the series -- I've been waiting since 1986 to see this series continue."},{"Title":"The Fighting Agents","review":"This was a great book, but it was definately the weakest of the series. Splitting Whittaker and Canidy into seperate story threads may have made sense, but it diluted both stories and the breaks between the two threads seemed contrived.The treatment of minor characters like Lt. Cdr. Dolan and Joe Kennedy is, once again, one of the major draws to this series. The main characters are excellent, as always, but it is usually the secondary characters who flesh out the story lines.I would have to say that Griffin's treatment of women is uneven, at best, in this series. The emergence of Charity Hoche as a genius/super analyst is unbelievable, due to the lack of a convincing setup, and is quite irritating. Her whole character seems to be contrived, and it seems Griffin makes her a &quot;genius&quot; to make up for using her as a sex object. While it might be possible to put those two characteristics together, Griffin fails.Griffin also continues his theme that his hero is always right, especially, if the big wigs disagree with him. Canidy's &quot;rogue&quot; actions rank right up there with Killer McCoy (in The Corps). Just once, it would be good if the over cocky hero would screw up really bad."},{"Title":"The Fighting Agents","review":"For those who have not tried W.E.B. Griffin because they don't wish to commit to reading 9 volumes in The Corps or Brotherhood of War series, I highly recommend trying this 4-book series (#1 Last Heroes, #2 Secret Warriors, #3 Soldier Spies, and #4 Fighting Agents). While I would love to see future installments of the Men at War Series, I thought that Griffin does a very good job of &quot;wrapping up&quot; with The Fighting Agents. I enjoyed it the most out of the 4 in this particular series because I felt that it was more operational and thus contained more action and suspense."},{"Title":"The Fighting Agents","review":"I started this series about 15 years ago when it was published under the nom-de -plume of &quot;Alex Baldwin&quot;. W.E.B. Griffin's writing style was really evident at the time--too unique and &quot;salty&quot; to imitate. Now that the series is in print under the Griffin name I am wondering whether he plans to continue the the plot to a time-line conclusion. In this , the fourth volume of the O.S.S. saga , the major character Richard Cannidy , plans and executes the extraction of Eric Fulmar , Gisella Dyer , and Professor Dyer from Hungary. As a separate counter-plot , Captain Jim Whittaker returns to the Phillipines with aid for &quot;General&quot; Wendell Fertig who is attempting to conduct operations against the Japanese on the island of Mindinao. These operations are set against the background of the machinations of the O.S.S. hierarchy , the sexual/bedroom antics of the protagonists , and an episode of &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot;. I particularly liked Commander John Dolan as a character , and the cameo of Joe Kennedy Jr. seemed correct. In this series , tho' W.E.B. tries to compress alot of subplots into far too little space to be satisfying. If this is the end of the series , then the author needs to concentrate on The Corps , which I consider to be his &quot;Flagship&quot; series. The Wendell Fertig story was fleshed out pretty well in &quot;Behind the Lines&quot;.On the other hand , one more volume in &quot;Men at War&quot; could conclude this particular timeline in a satisfying manner.Overall this particular volume was an enjoyable read ; not one of W.E.B.'s very best , but good enough for 4 stars."},{"Title":"The Fighting Agents","review":"This book was origanally publish in 1987 under the pen name &quot;Alex Baldwin&quot;. It is a good story in the series about OSS agents Canidy and Whittaker, and the forces in the Philippines under Brig. Gen. Fertig."},{"Title":"The Fighting Agents","review":"As always the weaving of historical fact and fictional characters continues to amaze me. I have read most of his war novels and they all are fine offerings. only one mistake, on page 243 the discription of D as dah dah dah is actually o not d. Only a Navy ex-radioman second class would have caught that and what would it matter with his rich discriptions of everything else."},{"Title":"The Fighting Agents","review":"Griffin does it again. Canidy is still tilting at windmills. Fertig is having a better day. You need to read this book. I recommend a hardcover copy, you will re-read it over and over again. I can't wait for W.E.B.'s next book."},{"Title":"The Fighting Agents","review":"I think the best feature of W.E.B. Griffin's books is the way he mixes fact with fiction. In &quot;The Fighting Agents&quot;, he does this very well in telling us the story of Wendell Fertig. I never heard this story until I read about it in Griffin's book."},{"Title":"The Fighting Agents","review":"Typical WEB Griffin Book - A great read.

It features two different OSS operations on opposite sides of the globe. Both stories are good and are told in classic Griffin style.I was a bit disappointed, however, because I chose this book for the story of Wendell Fertig and his guerillas in the Phillipines. Despite indications to the contrary on the book jacket, the Fertig story represented only about 20% of the book. The balance was devoted to the story of getting scientists out of Germany through Hungary.

So it was with great expectations that I bought this novel...perhaps too great! The characters, although many, are well-developed and fun to get to know. The other aspect of this book that I liked was that Griffin spices things up with a little sex here and there, unlike his colleagues Clancy, Higgins, and Coontz. But in the end, I was sorely disappointed with the story's climax -- or lack thereof."},{"Title":"The Fighting Agents","review":"W.E.B. Griffin's books have been praised for so-called &quot;historical accuracy.&quot; However, when he refers to branches of military service during World War Two, he repeatedly speaks of &quot;Army Air Corps,&quot; the &quot;Air Corps&quot; and the &quot;USAAC&quot; (for Unites States Army Air Corps).But, there was no such branch of service during World War Two.It was almost six months BEFORE Pearl Harbor - and America's entry into World War Two - that the old reference of &quot;Army Air Corps&quot; was officially dropped, and this branch of the service became the &quot;Army Air Force&quot; (AAF). This happened on June 27, 1941.So, some six months prior to America's entry into World War Two, the old &quot;Air Corps&quot; ceased to be. Those who served in the Army's air arm during World War Two actually served in the Army Air FORCE, and certainly NOT in the Army Air CORPS. (Touching bases with the historical branch of the United States Air Force would have clarified this matter prior to the publication of any of Griffin's books.)If W.E.B. Griffin is to be praised for &quot;historical accuracy,&quot; then he'll have to re-write his books and correct this mistake. As the publisher of his books, Penguin Putnam, Inc. should have caught this error long ago. It certainly detracts from the thread of authenticity that the author is obivously trying to impart. W.E.B. Griffin now has on the market a multitude of books of varying titles in which this glaring error continues to perpetuate itself. It's a shame that such fine stories have to be tarnished with such continued inaccuracies."},{"Title":"The Fighting Agents","review":"Most, if not all, of the Griffin series of Military novels have one continuing factor I find most irritating. That is his worship of the Officer Corps of the Armed Services. In his novels, he portrays the Enlisted Man as a personna who is not capable of resolving any difficulty without the &quot;expertise&quot; of an Officer. He should take notes from real authors such as, William Manchester and Clancy. However, If the H.L.Menken school of Writing advice still exists( you will never go broke Underestimating the taste of the public) Then Griffin should continue to make money with his scribblings."},{"Title":"The Fighting Agents","review":"The book was well written and held my attention thru out the entire book.

His sagas span several different action themes, but they are all either military, police or intelligence services.

My wife also enjoys the books so I would say they are suitable for all readers."},{"Title":"The Fighting Agents","review":"I am generally a fan of the various Griffin series, but I just can't like this book. It's the first Griffin book I wasn't really eager to get back to reading.I think my biggest problem is the fragmented way that two stories are being told. We get a few pages each in different locations telling what's happening on an operation in Europe from several viewpoints. That's fine and somewhat normal for Griffin. The problem is that these snippets are also interspersed with some reports on what's happening on a different operation in the Pacific. With minor exceptions, the only connection is that they are occurring at the same time. Neither of them depends on the other in any way that I could see. This organization both detracts from the flow and reduces the space which could have been spent on either operation.It also seems that this series isn't as well developed as The Corps and Brotherhood of War."},{"Title":"ExamKrackers: Complete MCAT Study Package (5 vol. set)","review":"I bought this 5 volume set and the Audio Osmosis CDs and spent 3 weeks pouring over them in preparation for the August 2002 MCAT. Additionally, I purchased the 1001 question series for the subjects in which I was feeling weak. I was barely able to get to any of the 1001 question books in that time.10 years after originally taking the courses covered on the exam, I managed to score in the 80-90 percentiles. Considering how many new graduates I was testing against, I am happy with that result. I thank the Examkrackers series for my good score.The books and CD lectures cover all of the subjects on the MCAT and allow you to realize your weak spots.I made a set of flash cards from the CD lectures and books on points of information that I was rusty on. I then memorized those flash cards. I understand Jon and Jordan are coming out with a set of flash cards so that may save you a step.As a bonus to buying their books, you can access their website at examkrackers com and chat with Jon and Jordan themselves. They will personally answer any questions you have. Also, they have a medical career counselor who will answer your career based questions. From their website, I see that they offer in-class preparation courses on the East Coast. That may be a good option for people living in that area.Hands down this is the best series for MCAT preparation."},{"Title":"ExamKrackers: Complete MCAT Study Package (5 vol. set)","review":"As a non-science major, I used these books and the AAMC practice exams and scored a 13V 10P 10B S on the April 2002 MCAT. These are wonderful books, especially if you're self-studying (if you haven't considered this option, DO IT! It is possible to study on your own, do well, and save HUNDREDS of dollars in the process!!) The books are easy to understand and emphasize important information you need to know for the MCAT rather than getting bogged down in tons of facts that won't be on the exam anyway. Best of all, there are mini-exams and quiz-type questions throughout the book, so you can constantly assess how you're doing and know which areas you need more work on. The message boards on the examkrackers website are also a GREAT help for any self-studier because you can post questions and the writers of the materials respond in less than 24 hours. I strongly support these books!

The princeton review material was far more extensive, but none of the extra material was on the MCAT.The princeton review exam's were also much harder than the actual MCAT or the examkracker tests (which were of the same difficultly). I guess their theory is that if you can handle their material the MCAT will be a snap. This a disserice to their students as it both demoralizes them and doesnt realistically prepare them for the exam.Another advantage the examkracker books had was that they were nearly mistake free while the PR had many glaring mistakes."},{"Title":"ExamKrackers: Complete MCAT Study Package (5 vol. set)","review":"These books go above and beyond all other MCAT review books. I studied from these for a month and then went on to other books (Princeton Review and Kaplan) thinking that it would help me cover everything. The material in those books was explained so poorly that I always ended up going back to Examkrackers for clarification. In the end, I just gave up and sold everything else because it was wasting my time.The material in Examkrackers is so well explained that it is interesting and fun to work through these books. The science is covered thoroughly enough that anyone should be able to understand it. I would recommend taking the real MCAT exams as the only supplement to these books. The audio Examkrackers is also good for reviewing, but I wouldn't rely solely on that for preparation.

When PARANORMAL EXPERIENCES VOLUME ONE, published by New Age Dimensions Publishing, came up for grabs to be read and reviewed, I jumped at the chance. I've always been interested in all things paranormal-the presence of ghosts and spirits, the ability to see the future, the use of tarot cards and runes to predict the future. After reading the book, which I did in one sitting, I can honestly say that all lovers of the paranormal should read these true-life experiences!The book is broken up into several short \\"experiences\\" told from the author's perspective. Titles of these stories include THE NEST, STRANGE SEQUENCE, VEILED REVELATIONS, THE VISIT, EMBRACING MY INSTINCTS, DESTINY DISRUPTED, HIGH PLANES DRIFTER, A GIFT OF LIGHT, CALL ME ANGEL, AND THE SUN WITH THE MOON SHALL SHINE, THE SILVER HAIRED LADY, RECOGNITION OF SPIRIT, and A CHILD REMEMBERS. We're also treated to a wonderful foreword by the Grand Dame of romance herself, Kathryn Falk, an introduction by New Age Dimensions Publishing founder Melissa Alvarez, individual author biographies, and a glossary of terms used throughout the book.We read about ghostly hauntings, visits from recently departed dead loved ones, warnings to avoid perilous situations, and spirits having hissy-fits. The stories are alternately spine-tingling, spooky, sad, and downright funny. I have to mention here that HIGH PLANES DRIFTER, by Rob Riser, had me laughing out loud several times. THE SILVER HAIRED LADY had me crying for a dead woman seeking justice from the grave, and DESTINY DISRUPTED gave me chills with its forecast of a deadly situation.The glossary alone is worth the time to read this book. Covering terms from acupressure to Zodiac and everything in between, this is a comprehensive list of terms that one might find when dealing with the paranormal. The author bios are fun and informative, and you just might find a few new books you want to read! And the foreword by Ms. Falk is interesting and entertaining, dealing with humans needs to know and understand the \\"spirits\\" that live among us.All in all, PARANORMAL EXPERIENCES VOLUME ONE is one non-fiction book that I'm glad I picked up-and I'm sure you'll be glad, too!"},{"Title":"Contemporary Analytic Philosophy: Core Readings (2nd Edition)","review":"Contemporary Analytic Philosophy by James Bailie originally published in 1997 provides an overview of analytic philosophy from Frege to the present. It is a strong mix of key writings by leading thinkers in the analytic tradition as well as some clear and helpful analysis by Bailie. As with all these types of essay collections, it is advisable to look at the on-line table of comments, prior to purchasing. This excellent small anthology may be well suited to use in an introductory course on analytic philosophy.I had recently read Scott Soames' excellent two-volume series on analytic philosophy and found it and the present work to be quite complementary. Soames' coverage is narrower and deeper - its one significant short-coming being the omission of Frege. Bailie's work is broader and shallower including classic pieces from each of the writers. A few of lesser figures were also included; e.g. Austin, Grice and Putnam, which was nice to see. Davidson is the only inclusion that I would question - I just don't see him as particularly significant - perhaps a limitation on my part.Overall excellent work if wildly overpriced. I picked it up new at a book sale for $3; its probably worth at most $30."},{"Title":"Contemporary Analytic Philosophy: Core Readings (2nd Edition)","review":"This single book serves as an excellent intro to analytic philosophy.

There are twelve pieces in this set in the following tunings: Four in Dropped D; Three in Open D; Two in Standard; and Three in Open G. She plays each piece and will talk you through the fingerings. Her instruction is clear and easy to follow, and the pieces are all classics. I would rate this set at Level 3(Intermediate). She sings the songs, but lyrics are not included with the tab. No one else I know of teaches the thumps and slaps that make Delta-style blues so unique and interesting. All of Rory Block's instructional material is well worth the money."},{"Title":"The Ocean World of Jacques Cousteau - Volume 2 - the Act of Life","review":"Over time, several people have mentioned their confusion over the many different books which appear to have the same name of \`The Ocean World of Jacques Cousteau' and, because no other person appears to have submitted a review for any of these excellent books, I offer this explanation which I hope is helpful.In 1972/3 Jacques Cousteau produced a book of 20 volumes under the overall title \`The Ocean World of Jacques Cousteau' with each volume covering a different aspect of the sea. Over time, different publishers reproduced this series of books in their own matching style. That is to say, the content remained the same but the covers varied - with some editions being clearly numbered 1-20. In 1978, Volume 21 was added and this was a complete expos&eacute; of his famous research ship \`Calypso' (currently being restored in France!). Finding a matching set of the first 20 volumes is difficult enough and a matching set of all 21 is almost impossible.That said, full matching sets of either 20 or 21 books are occasionally offered for sale but they are soon snapped up. My own 21 volumes were purchased here and there and do not match at all. Nevertheless, I would much rather own a complete unmatched set than not have these books readily to hand because they are full of information which is as relevant today as it ever was.The volumes are: 1. Oasis in Space, 2. The Act of Life, 3. Quest for Food, 4. Window in the Sea, 5. The Art of Motion, 6, Attack and Defence, 7. Invisible Messages, 8. Instinct and Intelligence, 9. Pharaohs of the Sea, 10. Mammals in the Sea, 11. Provinces of the Sea, 12. Man Re-Enters Sea, 13. A Sea of Legends, 14. Adventure of Life, 15. Outer and Inner Space, 16. The Whitecaps, 17. Riches of the Sea, 18. Challenges of the Sea, 19. The Sea in Danger, 20. Guide to the Sea and Index and, of course, 21. Calypso.Each book is approx. 145 pages and by purchasing individual volumes at the best possible price, it is comparatively easy to collect a full unmatched set.Many years later, the content was condensed into a single book called \`The Ocean World' although this is slightly different.Whereas some information may be out-of-date, the reality of the underlying message in each volume remains as relevant today as it was when first written and I fully recommend this series of books.Altogether, well worth the effort of obtaining a full set of 21!NM"},{"Title":"98 Degrees","review":"this is the best book! it tells how the group got started and a lot of other personal stuff about the guys. like there favorite movie,food,color,actor\\\\actress,etc. over i thought it was awesome!!"},{"Title":"98 Degrees","review":"This was the best book for 98 degrees yet it was full of info that i haddent already known.

Eternal Stories from the Upanishads. She and her teenage son were sharing some quality time reading one of the twelve stories every night, and they were enjoying both the story content and the feeling of settledness that resulted from reading uplifting, classic-style literature. The book jacket comments, &quot;The timeless and universal wisdom expressed in these twelve stories reminds us of the natural flow of life towards its supreme goal.&quot; And a reviewer goes on to say, &quot;The Upanishads are perhaps the greatest works of wisdom known to man.&quot; I was further enticed and purchased the book. Now, I read and reread a story and stop to savor a descriptive phrase, such as &quot;...stars, scattered across the sky like a thousand sugar crystals.&quot; And I pause now and then and realize that these stories reflect some greater, spiritual truth in my own life. All Love Flows to the Self takes the reader to a deeper, refreshing level.

The world that we know is gone and the status quo has changed. White people no longer exist and dark skin is valued over light skin. The book follows Amhara, the darkest child in her family as she learns about the world outside her tribe, and comes to understand the prejudices and fears of her people who condemn anyone born with a light skin to death or lowly servitude. It is only when she falls in love with a white Drone, found on her travels with a group of disparate people that she begins to realise that her people must learn tolerance or forever live in the shadow of a history they have always despised; a history of white supremacy and disregard for humanity because of the colour of someone's skin.

Riley lives in North Carolina has done award winning works for numerous magazines and other publications. On his journey to the Emerald Isle, Riley incorporate in his photos a conjoining of dramatic elements.The photographs are so absolutely beautiful it gives the viewer a sense of a Victorian era painting. The artist gives you the feeling of haunting sounds of music and gentle breezes. The sounds so lovely and celestial like an ethereal song-as he describes his visit in Co. Kerry at the gate entrance of St. Senan's Holy Well. The place inspires the spirit of the breezes tumbling about the metal pipes of the gate [on the front cover]. It's looking at the land with a sense of grace and prefection. Not seeing it as a picture postcard snapshot. Like a scene out of a cinema graphic still with soft overtones. He gives his images a vintage look yet bringing out the realness of their simplicity.Nuala O'Faolain's author of 'Are You Somebody: The Accidental Memoir of a Dublin Woman', poetic words in the introduction expresses the photogrpher's broader ego to the spirit of the place.

Riley doesn't just look &quot;at&quot; Ireland, but looks &quot;into&quot; the spirit of Ireland. The photographs and the words, both Riley's and O'Faolain's, give the viewer a sense of, not only seeing images of Ireland, but feeling, hearing and almost smelling the countryside.

The author, a teacher at Tel Aviv University, previously worked as a senior news editor at two of Israel's leading newspapers.All Israel's major papers reported that the army, secret service and police agreed that the second Intifada was caused by popular frustration at the long stalemate in negotiations and by anger at Sharon's visit to Temple Mount. Yet they all chose to lead with Prime Minister Barak's claim that Arafat was entirely to blame, supposedly because he had rejected Barak's \`generous' peace offer at Camp David.But sources close to Sharon were reported as saying in April 2002, \\"We are crazed now. Dear friends, please welcome Crazy Israel! It should be clear to everyone that Israel is no longer a doormat, a victim, a silent victim. From now on, we'll screw anyone who hurts us. Palestinians crossing the line? We'll give it to them. Syrians crossing the border in Lebanon? We'll screw them. The Palestinian Authority turning into a terror factory. We'll exterminate it. From now on, these are the rules of the game. The only rules.\\"The media reflect the government's belief that Israel is an innocent society only ever forced into violence by the Palestinians. The media always present Israel's aim as self-defence and the Palestinians' aim as destroying a state (Israel), not as creating one (Palestine): this avoids all mention of the Palestinians' central demand for national self-determination.The media present Israeli bad deeds as exceptions, mistakes, unintended, Palestinian bad deeds as innate, typical, deliberate. As Dor writes, \\"all the different media ... suppressed ... reports which would suggest unreasonable or immoral acts committed by Israel intentionally, both at the level of government policy and at the level of IDF conduct on the ground. Most significantly, the media suppressed reports which strongly indicated that the goal of the entire operation was not the fight against terrorism, but the reoccupation of the West Bank and the destruction of the Palestinian Authority.\\"Dor's account shows how the media reflect and maintain people's sense of themselves, presenting the news in a way that supports existing opinions. He sums up, \\"the Israeli media effectively prevent Israeli society from developing a discourse of responsibility, a discourse which, regardless of the struggle over the \`origins of the conflict', understands that Israel, and Israelis, have to assume responsibility for the solution of the conflict, because at present, in reality, the Palestinians are under Israeli occupation and not the other way around. In this, the Israeli media effectively contribute to the continuation of violence.\\""},{"Title":"The Suppression of Guilt: The Israeli Media and the Reoccupation of the West","review":"As in his book Intifada Hits the Headlines, Professor Dor demonstrates how tunnel vision, timidity and collective myth-making have too often divorced Israeli editors from the real \\"facts on the ground.\\" He has opened a vital debate on the Israeli media.Keith SpicerDirectorInstitute for Media, Peace & SecurityUniversity for PeaceGeneva"},{"Title":"The Suppression of Guilt: The Israeli Media and the Reoccupation of the West","review":"I think that for humans to cooperate, it is best if we value truth. Sometimes that truth makes us look good, and sometimes it does not. But we ought to accept it either way. False confessions of wrongdoing are counterproductive. And suppression of guilt is no good either.In 1943, some Jews in Warsaw broke the law and fought the Germans. Now, should they suppress their guilt? Well, um, what guilt? The law was no good. The guilty ones were the Germans.In the Arab-Israeli war, just as in World War One, World War Two, the American Civil War, and a bunch of other wars, there is some individual guilt on both sides. But it would be silly to pretend that we Americans were wrong to fight against the Axis powers, that the Axis powers were basically innocent, and that a big problem was and is the suppression of guilt by the victorious Allies. Worse than silly.I think it would dramatically enhance prospects for peace were the Arabs to quit suppressing their guilt. When confronted with human beings who had a right to bid for land, they reacted in a vicious and racist manner. They sold the land at high prices, but then tried to steal it back, and tried to assert themselves as somehow superior to the Jews who bought the land. So superior that they had a right to rob, slander, and murder their Jewish neighbors. This reaction to the emancipation of the Jews has been the cause of decades of strife. A really big Arab apology would go a long ways towards ending the conflict.In this book, Daniel Dor misses the opportunity to discuss the suppression of guilt by so many Arabs. Instead, he blames the victims, and basically asks them to apologize when they merely supported human rights and defended themselves. And I feel that what he's doing is similar to demanding that the Warsaw ghetto fighters falsely confess to malicious wrongdoing.When the International Court of Justice at the Hague, in an enormous travesty of justice, ruled that Israel was wrong to try to reduce civilian deaths from terrorist attacks by building a barrier to defend its citizens, many in the media reacted sarcastically, asking their readers to be the judges. Dor sneers at the media for all this. And he does so at one of the few times when I haven't sneered at the media for its tolerance of anti-Zionist slanders and terrorist attacks.Um, Daniel, the reason that so many Israelis feel that the Arabs are the ones who launched an attack on them after Camp David is that the Arabs actually did launch such an attack! Not because they are suppressing guilt! The Arabs are the ones who launched the attack; that is a fact. It was a bad idea for them to do so, but they were the ones who were motivated to commit such a crime, and they did it.I'm simply flabbergasted that anyone would write such a horrible book. I didn't see books complaining about how Pravda hadn't been misleading enough! And I find it hard to imagine what the world would be like if everyone attacked truth with such vehemence. I strongly doubt that there could be a place for human civilization in it.Let's all try to value truth and improve adherence to journalistic standards. Books such as this one, which urge us to make matters even worse are simply counterproductive. All they do is encourage more fighting and destruction."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"The book \\"Silent Spring\\" By Rachel Carson is not by any means a novel. This book examines the assertion of an early environmentalist (Rachel Carson) that the use of pesticides and poisons for agricultural purposes is destroying the earth's environment. To the average reader this book will pose a challenge of comprehension and completion. With no interesting characters and/or exciting plot this book is difficult to read. The redeeming value in this book is that we are made to think about the consequences of our actions with chemicals released to the environment. This is good, as it would not always be considered good to sprout a third arm as did Zaphod Beeblebrox. From a moral perspective the courage of the main character to stick to her story, despite everyone trying to discredit her, is impressive. A more responsible (older) person may even use the word \\"inspiring.\\" With a name like \\"Silent Spring\\" you would think that there would be a story similar to \\"Tuck Everlasting\\" where a family drinks from a spring in the forest which gives them eternal life. \\"Silent Spring\\" would be like a water spring which turns you invisible or grants you the ability to be absolutely quite no matter what you do. But no, this book is entirely factual with no plot, and not a real cool story.A word to the wise; do not read this book if you want a good story. If you want a cool story read \\"Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy\\" by Douglass Adams. For all you tree huggers out there this story is a good morale booster which should be placed on your tofu table as a conversational piece."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"I found myself transfixed by Carson's language and her arguments.

Most of what I can say about the book -summary, analysis, opinion- has already been written in other reviews. My 5 stars is about the book, but I do want to mention a few points about the Kindle version.I've been waiting a long time for SS to port to Kindle. I already had the DTB and am now very happy to have the Kindle version, which I can carry around in my Kindle 3. Being a text-intensive book, it is as easy to read on the K3 as it is on the DX. The black and white drawings look as good on the screen as on paper. The Kindle version doesn't replicate the cover (there is a blank page) and oddly, the table of contents is not linked to the chapters! The list of sources is given by page number.But here's the neat thing- the index is hot-linked to the text! The keywords in the index have symbols after them that look like |>|. When you click on it, it brings you to the location in the text where the keyword is found. If there are multiple instances, there are multiple symbols."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"\\"The obligation to endure gives us the right to know\\". Those words lingered in my mind even after finishing the entire book. Rachel Carson's 'Silent Spring' is written with a mission - to kindle the light of environmentalism, to direct the attention of the political world towards treating environment as a fragile support system we are part of and dependent upon. The book was written in during postwar American Era when science was god and science was male. Till the arrival of the book, there were several articles, papers and studies related to the effects of chemicals on the natural world but not a single book that unified them all under one theme and connected them with a common thread. Rarely was such an effort attempted before. It is not a book based on conjectures and emotions but on the contemporary research.The book is divided into seventeen chapters along with an elaborate list of principal sources used in writing the book. The first chapter is very short, titled \\"A fable for tomorrow\\" where the author starts with a surreal surrounding and gradually moves towards a horrifying scenario full of disasters related to indiscriminate use of chemicals. In the second chapter \\"The Obligation to Endure\\", author makes the argument about why people should me made aware of all the known and unknown dangers of the chemicals they are subjected to. The third chapter \\"The Elixirs of Death\\" lists various \\"chlorinated hydrocarbons\\" and \\"organic phosphorous insecticides\\". In fourth, fifth and sixth chapter, the author describes the effects of contaminants on water, soil and wildlife. Seventh chapter onwards the books transitions towards the \\"Needless Havoc\\" which we have created for ourselves. In these chapters the author takes us through various case studies exemplifying the destruction of the terrestrial and aquatic biota.The twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth chapters of the book introduce the readers to the new philosophy of environmentalism and the ill-effects of ignoring the premonitions. In these chapters the author focuses on the price humans have started to pay. She discusses the change in molecular and genetic levels. The book introduces the reader to the carcinogens we have been producing in the name of manufacturing \\"insecticides\\" and \\"pesticides\\". In the last three chapters the author writes about how nature (specially insects) is constantly adapting to our chemical warfare and how this is getting transformed into a guerrilla warfare. She talks about various factors whose effects are understudied. In the last chapter \\"The Other Road\\", the author provides some alternatives to the heavy barrage of chemicals. The book starts that with a gloomy, eerie tone ends with a confident and hopeful note. As Linda puts it, \\"\\"This is a book to relish: not for the dark side of human nature, but for the promise of life's possibility\\""},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"The value of this book, more than 40 years after it was published, is not what it tells us about DDT. Regardless of whether or not you think DDT causes cancer in humans, we don't have it to kick around anymore -- DDT is effectively outside the zone of reasonable environmental policy debate. Instead, focus on what Silent Spring tells us about the interconnectedness of nature, the unintended consequences of our attempts to control it, and the forces that might be trying to deny those consequences exist. Those are lessons that apply not just to DDT but to industrial agriculture, genetically modified organisms, and other more current topics. This is a very insightful book, even for 2005."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"This book was written in 1962 and was the first to introduce the dangers of DDT and other pesticides. This book systematically reveals realistic statistics of the effects of pesticides worldwide. Examples from pesticide control in Europe, Asia, and the US expose the impacts of human actions on nature. Rachel Carson pioneers in describing the impact of pesticides in all parts of nature. In response to the harmful disadvantages to chemical pesticides, Carson offers biological controls which have succeeded in maintaining pests. Though Silent Spring is factual, it is repetative at times. It also emotionally describes environmental aspects. However, Silent Spring is indeed an eye-opening book which allows one to see the impacts of humans and pesticides."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Rachel Carson's Silent Spring was a landmark book at the time and sparked an entire generation's interest in environmental care and issues. Former US President had the claims made in the book investigated by his Science Advisory Committee which vindicated her claims and led to the immediate strengthening of chemical pesticide regulations. If you are looking to read one of the most influential books on environmental protection, this is one of the earliest, as well as one of the most renowned and popular. It is often cited and recommended in Environmental Issues classes."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"I have just finished reading the 1962 printing of Rachel Carson's \\"Silent Spring\\". Ms. Carson draws our attention to the effects of pesticides on all tiers of life-forms. It is the book that made the American people aware of what our Department of Agriculture and the Department of Forestry were doing to destroy life as we know it in this country. Carson writes in an easy-to-understand language that readers at the high-school level will get, and I urge ALL high-school students to read this! &quot;Silent Spring&quot; will have you running for the Organically Grown food section of your grocery store the next time you shop!"},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"The novel made the reader aware of the dangers of incecticides and pesticides by detailing the destruction the poisons cause. Extensive research and direct quotes made the points more effective. Also, the way the chapters were seperated helped to focus on more specific points at a time. Too much of reading it at once could become redundant as many of the topics related to eachother. The parts that were too scientific became hard to focus on, but when human examples were used it regained its sense of importance. After reading the book you can not disagree with the fact that humans should not attempt to control nature."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Rachel Carson's \\"Silent Spring\\" was the impetus that brought about the environmental movement as we know it today. Her unparalleled research, during 1962, exposed and condemned the use of DDT and ADT as forms of chemical pesticides and insecticides. The book provides shocking evidence and anecdotes of the affects of contamination, which often lead to death. Her stories and evidence was shocking because it not only opened the eyes of millions Americans to the carcinogens they were eating daily, but it opened up an entirely different area of environmental science. No long was it limited to preservation, such as the Sierra Club, but now the idea that humans have a negative impact on the environment.I believe Carson wrote this book as a wake up call to the American Public. After observing a \\"Silent Spring\\", in which no birds chirped or bugs buzzed, she dug deeper into the extent at which these chemicals were being used. She was compelled to do research and write this book because she wanted people to know what havoc these chemicals were having on the earth.If you are interested in environmental science I feel this book is a great tool for learning where environmental history begins, a lot of it begins with this book. If Carson hadn't written this book, then the use of DDT and ADT would still be in effect today. That thought alone would provide us with a much different future, in both a negative and positive light, because while DDT and ADT were bad, we have to this day, not found equivalent replacements that are as effective."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Haven't had time to read the book, but the service was great--book came well within the timeframe promised, and it's in as-promised condition."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Silent SPring is a ook that everybody should read. It alerts individuals of the potent hazards of pesticides. THe book provides specific examples of chemical poisoning and its effect on the environment. On the campus of Michigan State University a place hwere robins were once known for their dominating presence. DDT was sprayed on the Elm trees. THe next year, dead robins appeared everywhere on campus, and few baby robins hatched. THis type of devestation is just one example Rachel Carson uses to portray the horrid consequences of pesiticide use. Carson writes with an exuberant manner that the average person can read. Though her writing was repetitive at times it is important to read this book because of the understanding it gives you about the harmful effects of pesticides."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Silent Springs must be recognized as Rachel Carson's best work. Also, it's the greatest piece of writing that narrates pesticide problems throughout time. It must be said that for some people, the reading content might be heavy and tedious. Still, its filled with interesting and shocking facts and stories. Reading this book really makes you think about questions like:&quot; Can a single person really make a difference by him/herself?&quot; People do not imagine that pesticides have been around for so long. Also, they aren't aware of the serious damage they cause nature as well as humans. I suggest this book be used as a text book in schools. This way, children will get an insight of the danger of pesticides, and will be more interested in nature as adults."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"I read Silent Spring as an assignment for my ecology class and even though I began to read it as an obligation, later on I found huge amounts of interesting data that captured my eye. One example of this data were the multiple effects that pesticides have on humans and their surroundings (including animals, plants, water sources, human genetic material, etc). I never imagined such harmful effects could result from the use of pesticides. Another thing think captures the readers attention is the way Silent Spring is written. It isn't written in such a boring and dense form like an encyclopedia. It is easy to read. It uses both subjective points of view from the author and points of view from scientists and even points of view from affected people. It is a good book, however I is an old book and some of the information is old. The good side about it being an old book is that we can learn from the cases mentioned in it and try not to make the same errors. Rachel Carson's Silent Spring is a book that will make you think and learn that our actions are like boomerangs that in a short or long run will return to us, however most of the times they return with a stronger force. Not being able to catch them they will slap our faces and even more, our whole world."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Rachel Carson's &quot;Silent Spring&quot; is just defined in one word: Revolutionary.The author take us beyond our trashy city-park, beyond our polluted city, she takes us to explore the world being attacked by the human kind.&quot;Silent Spring&quot; was published a couple of decades ago, but we can see that what this book said was true and what Rachel Carson predicted is yet becoming our reality.The book is very interesting and we may appreciate that the author made a huge research in this topic, basically DDT spraying and treatment.The book emphasizes on the problems pesticides cause, not only to humans but to nature itself. The author tries to change people thoughts, and make us aware of the danger this chemicals being poured into our fields represent.The book also gives alternatives to common pesticides and investigates each case of alternatives that is, or was, used.As we know, Rachel Carson wrote this book long ago, making it now old, or out of date, but as you read it you realize that &quot;Silent Spring&quot; is clearly showing our modern date ecological problems.So, with all this, I think Rachel Carson's &quot;Silent Spring&quot; is a magnificent book, a bit polluted in the way is written, but a magnificent work."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Although this book was published more than 40 years ago, it's still worth a read. I found it interesting, informative and disturbing. Although I know DDT has been banned, I can't help but worry about some of the lasting effects of it and other chemicals used as pesticides or insecticides."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"This book is a pessimisitic, unflattering view of pesticides and their effects on the world. Rachel Carson seems to drone for a long time about how man is killing the world, only submitting to a positive approach on 15 out of the 300 pages. Despite this overriding negative tone, the book has some very clear strengths. The book activily explores the interlocking connections of our world, connecting life, to soil, to air, to water, and all of them together. She explains those connections by the transfer of pesticides through the environment and food chains, but that concept transfers outside of pesticides too.Although this book may have some exceedingly pesismistic points to it, it does have historical value, and some strong scientific value."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"This book's greatness varies by how you approach it. If you are looking for a thick, heavy load of information, statistics, and facts on the destructiveness of pesticides, then go for it, you will enjoy the book. But if you want a story, try something else a little lighter.Rachel Carson does make a very important and serious point that isn't presented this well anywhere else I have seen. If you are interested in the topic of environmental conservation, then you will enjoy the book. Overall I think it was worth the read; for some, it could get dull."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"When I first read the title of this book, I though about a little girl that would play in this huge garden and a boy who would be in love with her, but as I started to read it, I discovered that my perception was entirely wrong. Silent Spring is one of the most amazing books I have ever read, and I can imagine how the people that lived during the time it was published (1950's), reacted to Rachel Carson's work. This book deals with a big problem that will chase humanity for some time, the problem of hazardous chemicals used as pesticides. Rachel Carson tells us the atrocities that DDT, organophosphates, and other chemicals have done to our environment and our bodies. Rachel Carson explains in her book the composition of these chemicals and the way they affect us. How we continue poisoning the earth and our food. I had never thought of the ecology before or the conservation of our species, but this book changed my view of seeing things.The warning that Rachel Carson give us in this book is to re-considerate in every step we take, and start thinking for one time only in ourselves. To see the world that surrounds us and learn to live with it. To admire and thank God for the singing of a bird, and to live with the security that we will be able to continue living.This is a book every person should read so that the world can start making conscience and worrying about the world we live on. Even though it was written some years ago, it is really important and still concern us. We are driving in a very fast highway towards a cliff and unless we slow down, we will not be able to stop ourselves from destroying the life in this planet. This is the best book that describes the horrible effects of mankind's unconsciousness and careless, in the field of chemicals and biology."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"When I picked up Silent Spring in 1995 I was hooked from the first few pages. Here was a lady way before her time. She writes intelligently and fluently. When I read Rachel Carson I get lost in her world of woods, coast, or sea.Under the sea was the next book, and am still mezmerized by the &quot;great abyss&quot;. For the first time I really wanted to know what was down there, in the deep, black sea. I believe Silent Spring should be a must read for all nature lovers, but more importantly for those who aren't."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"A book about man made chemicals and the effects they have on the earth. A specifici example DDT. She discusses thge destruction of the earth and she wants to create awareness of the problem, and not an attack on people. This book was good but got boring at times. She gets very specific but i feel that it is a book that is necessary for people to read and understand the pesticide problem in the world"},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Silent Spring, written by Rachel Carson was presented to the world half century ago. Although old, this book is a new overview and reflection of the power humans have to destroy. The book does not only give detailed information about each kind of pesticide, but it also presents a general picture of what the world might become if we don't stop the imprudent use of these deadly chemicals. This book set a precedent for modern biologists and ecologists. It also changed the view that mankind had toward the lethal weapons it didn't know how to use. Thanks to the advice and research of Rachel Carson, innovative ways of handling pesticides have been developed and human concern for the environment has been greatly awakened in the last half of the century. This is a magnificient work in which not only information has been recopilated, but also expresses human nature and sense for preserving our only home and partners, the animals."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"rachel carson's book, Silent Spring was and is a true classic. That book was the first one to bring the dangers of wreckless utilization of technology to light. The information in the bok is sound. The style of writing is not so academic, that it puts a person to sleep. Stylistically and academically, Rachel states the reasons for using pesticides, the hazardous effects of using pesticides and solutions to using those chemicals. This was truly a book that started the environmentalism movement in America much like Ralph Nader's book, Unsafe at Any Speed started the automobile safety movement in the U.S. Much of the information is still relevant today even though the book is has been published for 38 years. The book is a great book even though the pundants of that era did not give it an award."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"The book is in fairly good condition but it has a musty smell to it when you open it. The pages are not torn and the paper cover is on it with a plastic protector. This is a withdrawn library book."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Chemicals are not dangerous and there is no such thing as global warming. Sarah Palin is so much more in tune with the environment than Rachel Carson was. Know what's nice about seeing American Eagles?

It is a true eye opener."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Very important work by a very important figure in history, get it, read it, pass it on."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Silent Spring by Rachel Carson provides an in-depth look of how the world was changing in the 1940s and 50s. After World War II, man began to develop very hazardous chemicals and decided to combat the insects without, many times, legitamste reasons. Carson's analysis of these new chemicals, such as DDT, was revolutionary and changed the scope of how these pesticides were handled in the future. she provides many real life examples and paints a very grim picture in order to try to reach out to the ignorant people of the time. the common person was very unaware of the potential danger these chemicals presented to them. Carson talks about many relevant topics including the effects on wildlife, livestock, the water, and even humans. she is able to tell the story by breaking down complex science terms for the common person to understand. Overall the book was very engrossing, but at times it can be a bit repetitive. It was a stepping stone to awareness of the situation at the time. You can even say with the help of carson the end of the world as we know it was averted."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Overall, I thought the book was very informative. Even though it was extremely repetative. The book talked about pesticides and their effect on the environment. Pesticides seap into the earth's biogeological cycles and disrupt all life. Often the organisms intended to be eradicated are not the only ones harmed. Pesticides harm everything. The use of natural controls would be better because the cost less, are more effective, and are safe to human life. Unfortunately this book could have gotten its point across in half the chapters. Rachel Carson wrote this book a long time ago and it is amazing how much she changed the public's view on pesticides. Overall, pesticides are bad. I recomend this book to anyone interested in environmental science."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Rachel Carson opens your mind and heart to the misuse of chemicals and how it effects everyone and everything. This book is truly a treasure that everyone should read, not just people concerned with the environment. Very similar to Silent Spring is Don Hutchins', Walking by day, which outlines problems with the environment and how these issues are handled."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"The previous review gives one star for political reasons, not for the quality of the writing or argument presented in Silent Spring. It is not apparent that this reviewer has read the book at all. We do a service to the Earth when we show compassion for all life, and cease to think in terms of sacrificing one life for another. Read the book, research the problem, and draw your conclusions based on the evidence, not someone else's hot-headed opinions."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Because all of the quotes I've read from Silent Spring have been emotional appeals, I was worried the book would be all poetic descriptions, poorly grounded in science. Instead I found that, as the introduction claimed, Rachel Carson not only had a \\"lyrical, poetic voice\\" but also offered sound \\"scientific expertise\\" and an impressive \\"synthesis of wide-ranging material\\".The introduction really helped place the book for me, in a period before environmentalism; after the cold war, when unpatriotic suggestions that we couldn't control nature were frowned upon; and during a time when radiation was a recently recognized danger. Reading through the book without the introduction, Carson's repetitive comparisons of chemical sprays to radiation might have become annoying. However, as the introduction pointed out, this was a rather clever move on her part given public consciousness of radiation as a real danger. The afterward also did a really good job of placing the book in relation to the following environmental movement and current ecological concerns. If you're going to read Silent Spring, I would strongly recommend the 40th anniversary edition for these nice contextual additions.As anticipated, the writing was often very beautiful. Despite my half-dozen or so biology classes, I've never found the inner workings of the cell half as beautiful as I did reading Rachel Carson's descriptions. At other times, her writing did become over the top with references to \\"the chemical death rain\\", but her descriptions of the results of these chemicals made the hyperbole seem warranted. In fact, finishing this book I actually felt a profound sense of relief that we don't live in a world without birds, because of the damages these chemicals caused.My only complaint with this read was that it quickly became repetitive. Although Rachel Carson's point was novel at the time and people may have required more convincing, I was a convert pretty early on. In part because of the repetitiveness, I found the book informative but never really engaging. With a really great book, there's always that point where you've really gotten into it and don't want to put it down, except maybe to sleep...if you absolutely have to. With this read, I just never got to that point. Instead I felt like I had to force myself back into it whenever I took a break. Despite not getting really sucked in, this was an interesting and informative read which I think provides a great introduction for anyone interested in the history of the environmentalist movement."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"This was a required book for an \\"Environment Change & Sustainability\\" class I'm taking, and its been a great book to read."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"This book is an early environmental movement classic, in which Rachel Carson exposes the dangers of thoughtless application of pesticides and herbicides. Given it's relatively early date, the book is quite comprehensive, authoritatively addressing the unwanted killing of animals not targeted for destruction, bio-accumulation, development of resistance, and human cancers caused by incidental or indirect exposure, among many other issues. The book is elucidating and genuinely frightening - if a little maudlin at points. For most modern environmental readers, however, the book will likely be of only historical interest. Silent Spring is thorough and well-reasoned, but its message has been delivered thousands of times since this book's publication. Many modern environmental readers will, thus, have encountered much, if not all, of this material many times before. Carson is a good writer, though, with a good story, and it's important (in my opinion) to know the genesis of important ideas. As such, Silent Spring is worth a nerve-wracking read."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Rachel Carson's expose of the broad, deep, complex, hidden, irreversible and unconsidered effects of man-made chemicals was earth shaking in its day. She exhibited great courage in challenging the commercial and political interests who benefited from the public policy status quo. Her writing is smooth and informed. Her argument could truly be understood by John Q. Public. She carefully and accurately explained scientific concepts and findings that were new to most people. She is rightly hailed as a founder of the environmental movement and those positive steps that have been taken to protect the environment, inform public debate and raise substantive question's about man's role in modifying nature.On the other hand, her book overstates its case, demonizes opponents and discredits other more balanced approaches to public policy positions. On balance, I am thankful for her writing this book at a time when environmental issues were not on the radar screen. The basic improvements made since that time depended upon the awareness she generated. The real disappointment is with our lack of progress as a nation and a world in evaluating environmental issues such as global warming. We generate much more heat than light."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Our environment is affected by everything that we do. We have the tendency to cut out the things that can be good for our environment but might be ecstatically pleasing to the eye or we don't understand their function within the environment. Since the industrial revolution, we have put more toxins into the our environment and used them to cut out these inconveniencies. It was only until 1962 when Rachel Carson wrote Silent Spring that these poisons were even looked into with much scrutiny. This brought the environmental revolution where the people wanted these toxins to be controlled or, more hopefully, eliminated from use.Within Carson's book, the author describes how everything is connected and affected by each other. Our system has been abused by our need to make things more convenient like less gnats on lake water or less weeds within our lawns or on the roadside. The poisons used, like DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), caused catastrophe within all systems of the environment. This toxin affects and kills everything it comes in contact with, manipulating even the molecular level. All in all, creating an environment that we thought would be better into something that will take years to recuperate from. We have made our environment into something ugly when it should be good."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Joni Mitchell perhaps most aptly summarizes the driving idea of Silent Spring in her song \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\": \\"Hey farmer farmer / Put away that DDT now / Give me spots on my apples / But leave me the birds and the bees. Please!\\" While both the book and the song are a bit outdated in the United States as DDT was banned in 1972, it's still an interesting analysis of insecticides/herbicides, societies relationship with science, and the effects a capitalistic driven culture has on the environment. Likewise, the interaction of the natural web and human's impact on it is greatly emphasized. Something I've always found interesting about Carson and her book was the publics (often misogynistic) reaction to her as being \\"hysterical\\" and my favorite quote from a board member of the Federal Pest Control Review Board: \\"I thought she was a spinster. What's she so worried about genetics for?\\""},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Carson's slient spring is a well-written, heavily profound commentary on the dangers of Persistant Organic Pollutants (POPs) and their effects on every aspect of nature. Driving home point after point about different harms brought about by these chemicals, her study clearly earned the critical acclaim it has received over the last 40 years.Her prose is extremely easy to follow for a technical book, and nearly anyone can read it. I am only mildly interested in science, and even less interested in ecology. However, I had no trouble grasping the concepts she brought up in her report. All of her anecdotes and evidence are presented in a manner simple enough for the layman but profound enough for the most educated professionals"},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"When Rachel Carson published &quot;Silent Spring&quot; in 1962, her goal was to make everyone aware of what the toxic substance DDT was doing to the delicate ecosystems in North America, most notable its role in the destruction of bird populations. After reading &quot;Silent Spring&quot;, one can see why the book was a turning point in the movement of environmentalism.Rachel Carson did a massive amount of research to study the effects that pesticides like DDT had on the environment. Her chapters are filled with highly-documented scientific facts, but they also possess a poignant element which helped stir the nation into doing something about it in the late sixties-early seventies after the book's release.Al Gore's introduction eloquently details the sentiments and actions that this book prompted and it compliments the text very well.This book is high on my list of recommendations."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Rachel Louise Carson (1907-1964) was an American marine biologist and conservationist whose writings are credited with advancing the global environmental movement. (She also inspired Lucy of \\"Peanuts\\" fame, who said, \\"We girls need our heroines.\\") Carson also wrote books such asThe Sea Around UsandThe Sense of Wonder. (She never married, and her long friendship with Dorothy Freeman has raised some inquiring eyebrows in the modern world.) Sadly, she died of breast cancer and a heart attack at a relatively young age.(NOTE: Page references refer to the 1962 304-page Fawcett paperback edition.)This book, of course, is famous for bringing to public attention the effects of pesticides such as DDT. (Commercial propaganda films from the 1950s would show groups of kids sitting at a picnic table eating hot dogs, who were sprayed with DDT, but continued blithely eating their hot dogs, assured that \\"It's completely safe!\\") She makes a sobering case for the \\"subsequent accumulation\\" of small amounts of pesticides which are only slowly excreted from the body, so that \\"the threat of chronic poisoning and degenerative changes of the liver and other organs is very real.\\" (Pg. 30) This threat accumulates as it works its way up the Food Chain---i.e., with birds eating fish, which in turn had eaten plankton and smaller organisms (Pg. 52).She observes that the use of \\"weed killers\\" eliminates a useful function that such \\"natural plant communities\\" serve---such as serving as an indicator of the condition of the soil. (Pg. 78)She wrote with barely-concealed passion that insecticides are \\"not selective poisons,\\" and can just as easily poison the family cat, the farmer's cattle, the rabbit in the field, and the lark in the sky; and such death is \\"not only sudden but horrible.\\" She says, \\"By acquiescing in an act that can cause such suffering to a living creature, who among us is not diminished as a human being?\\" (Pg. 95-96)She asks the poignant question of WHO has made the decision that set in motion these \\"chains of poisonings,\\" and decided that eradicating plant-eating insects is worth the later death of birds. \\"Who had decided... for the countless legions of people who were not consulted that the supreme value is a world without insects, even though it be a sterile world ungraced by the curving wing of a bird in flight?\\" (Pg. 118)She points out that ant mounds on lawns or school playgrounds can be dealt with individually, and need not require \\"drenching\\" millions of acres in poisons. (Pg. 149) She also observes that different people (e.g., children, women, those with allergic sensibilities) may be more suceptible to pesticides than others are.She makes a strong case for trying to prevent carcinogenic agents from entering the environment, rather than trying to \\"cure\\" cancer once it is found. (Pg. 214-215)She concludes the book by noting the hopeful promise of other technologies (e.g., ultrasonic sound) being used to kill harmful insects, rather than using pesticides.This foundational book is still \\"inspirational\\" reading for those modern people concerned with the environment."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"What followed was a malaria epidemic the likes of which South Africa had never seen. The death rate increased tenfold, but in 2000 South Africa re-introduced DDT spraying and malaria was reduced by 80 percent."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Dramatic title to the review - huh? But it is true. Thanks to Carson's ability to paint a picture of dying birds and mutating children with the ink of lies and now-discredited studies, probably more people have died of malaria than Hitler killed in WW2. DDT will never be available again thanks to the slander it received here in this book, and malaria is again able to kill tens of thousands of people each year in undeveloped countries.West nile virus? Probably wouldn't be here if we had DDT.Here's the deal, if you read this book and you already think DDT is bad, you'll agree with this book. If you have an open mind (and who really does anymore?) and read this book, and fact-check the book, you'll find that Rachel Carson committed a crime against humanity."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"This book is responsible for the deaths of several million people.Largely due to the fallout from this book, DDT was banned worldwide. Even though the ban was based on shoddy and now discredited science, this book sparked the popular imagination and chemoparanoia of scientific illiterates everywhere. As a consequence, a cheap, effective, and SAFE pesticide was denied to the poorest countries who needed it most. Malarial mosquitoes that were just beginning to come under contol instead rebounded, and rates of malaria -- often fatal in poor countries -- skyrocketed. Millions have died as result.Of course, none of this mattered to Ms. Carson, or to her legions of acolytes. To them, feeling good about supposedly \\"pwotecting the enviwoment\\" was more important about getting their facts right, and infinitely more important than the lives of the people their carelessness has cost."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Rachel Carson forgets to mention the huge benefits that pesticides have brought the world and massively overplays their supposed downside. Even the hated DDT has almost certainly saved millions of lives by helping to eradicate malaria in many parts of the now developed world. Pesticide use has resulted in a far higher fruit yield than would otherwise have been possible allowing more people to eat more fruit - and as everyone knows, fruit contains many anti-cancer substances. Set against this, the slight cancer risks caused by using pesticides,if there are any at all, are more than worth paying."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"This book started the leftist, environmentalist revolution. Carson, like so many others today, appeals to emotion and twisted findings rather than scientific facts. For one, she fails to mention that DDT is similar to saccharin in that it is only somewhat harmful in HUGE doses of usage. What is even more baffling than her distortion of the facts is that many people, including the many members of US government, buy into it. Before you jump to any conclusions, consider true scientific findings and research, done by groups other than Green Peace; and pay attention to both sides of the issue."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Read about the scourge of Malaria and people who could've been saved by DDT. A plague on the Africans from this book."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"This is a remarkable book, because it paved the way for the needless deaths of millions of people. This book was largely responsible for the assault on DDT, and the restrictions and bans on DDT that followed (which were based on passion and fear, and in the absence of evidence). DDT is the principal tool in the fight against malaria. Estimates now place the number of *unnecessary* (ie, preventable) human deaths by malaria between 30 and 60 million people. The New York Times writes: \\"Humans are far better off exposed to DDT than exposted to malaria.\\" As Dr. Elizabeth Whelan of the American Council on Science and Health said, there \\"has never been a documented case of human illness or death in the US as a result of the standard and accepted use of pesticides.\\" The British medical journal The Lancet has looked for a DDT connection for 40 years and a significant health threat from DDT has yet to be found. In 1996, South Africa stopped using DDT and malaria increased 10 times. Unfortunately they did not reverse their decision until 2000, after the deaths of millions more. A book with disasterous results to human life--because the writer was creative and imaginative and riding the wave of an ideology. Yet, to this day, it is highly rated by readers who cling to that ideology. Post Script: The World Health Organization recently reversed its previous ban on DDT and now recommends it as a highly effective and safe way of fighting malaria. So world opinion is finally starting to correct itself. But it's amazing how pockets of passionate illogic can influence public opinion for so long."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Do I have your attention? \\"Silent Spring\\" represents the basest sort of non-intellectual, politically self-serving, pseudo-science ever foisted upon the American public. The vehicle for persuasion is emotional. What little science is involved is speculative and irrelevant in the greater context of quality-of-life issues for human beings. That fact should be abundantly clear to anyone with proper academic credentials. In others words, none of the other reviewers. The inclusion of Al Gore's name on the book condemns it. \\"Earth in the Balance\\" is a political tract completely bereft of scientific value and full of blatant lies. In the past forty years over thirty million souls have been lost to malaria alone. Desperately poor people eking out an existence in the world's backwaters, the vast majority of whom could have been spared agonizing debilitation and death by the prudent use of DDT or other pesticides, with little harm to the environment. Rachel Carson is the small, flawed messiah of the environmentalists. A movement which have amply demonstrated their concern for plants and animals by their flagrant contempt for their fellow man."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"I am sure that The Silent Spring is now only printed on recycled paper. Even so, it is one of the biggest wastes of a supposedly precious natural resource, paper. None of the claims she put forth in this book were really ever proven true, and the only thing that has come of it is an expansion in government at both the state and federal levels in this country and other countries as well. the Earth is not fragile; its &quot;ecosystem&quot; was created by God, and Ms. Carson, judging from this book, seemed to completely disregard this fact. The senseless fury ignited by this book (and carried on in our day by well-meaning and otherwise intelligent people) has been of tremendous hurt to both individual freedoms and to businesses both large and small (though the small businesses certainly take the bigger hit, and some businesses that would have thrived before this book was published can't even get off the ground). There is a watershed in Brookeville, Maryland-not far from my home- named after Ms. Carson. I shudder every time I pass by it, and I feel no desire to thank her for the fact that I can breath cleaner air or drink cleaner water than I would have five decades ago. The &quot;cleanup&quot; of the environment was due to technological advancements, and not to the strict regulations that have been piled up on businesses, communities and individuals over the last three decades. The best place for this book is---followers of Ms. Carson will hate this---the recycling bin."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"People have died from malaria because of this book.

Most people related, and not related, but that are concerned on nature and its endangerment have read this book. As an example myself, an Ecology student that has been asinged to read it.The style on which is written appeals for reading. However, what makes people like Silent Spring is the topic of it, unknown for many at that time, but a reality for all of us on modern days. Even when I liked the book, I only rate it with four stars because in some cases, in fact in only few cases, the descriptions on the specific examples were too detailed. This was not a terrible mistake, but still it makes it a little boring if you want to read it on a certain time, in fact you need to be on a certain mood to read, lets say fifty pages of it.This book is to be written on a slow way, not because it is difficult to comprehend, but because in that way you may relate it to what happens these days. Its kind of amazing that most problems described in the book are still present issues, and some even have been getting worse. Rachel Carson had a very accurate view of the consequences that problems that time would bring to our days, it's a shame her many people thought she was exaggerating."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"First of all, this book may have been an eye opener when it came out, but this book is outdated. We have new technology that allows us to rid ourselves of certain pests that we did not have in the 1950's and 1960's. With new methods we have created new problems and eliminated a few of the old ones. Books should be recomended that discuss current problems rather than outdated ones. Although this book was a pioneer in alerting the country of environmental hazards it overexagerates situations to unrealistic levels. It does however suggest a few natural ways to rid communities and farms of certain insects.

In a recent lecture about science and ecology, author Michael Crichton, no conservative, says the following: \\"DDT is not a carcinogen and did not cause birds to die and should never have been banned. I can tell you that the people who banned it knew that it wasn't carcinogenic and banned it anyway. I can tell you that the DDT ban has caused the deaths of tens of millions of poor people, mostly children, whose deaths are directly attributable to a callous, technologically advanced western society that promoted the new cause of environmentalism by pushing a fantasy about a pesticide, and thus irrevocably harmed the third world. Banning DDT is one of the most disgraceful episodes in the twentieth century history of America. We knew better, and we did it anyway, and we let people around the world die and didn't give a damn.\\" Carson was a wonderful writer and doesn't deserve all the blame -- that belongs to the politicians who exploited the issue -- but the book is wrong and led to the unnecessary death of 30 million to Malaria (a disease nearly eradicated before the ban).

Perhaps the rate at which the disaster is increasing has been slowed, but that itself is a disturbing thought. Since the publication of Silent Spring, pesticide use on farms alone has doubled to 1.1 billion tons a year, and production of these dangerous chemicals has increased by 400 percent. We have banned certain pesticides at home, but we still produce them and export them to other countries. This not only involves a readiness to profit by selling others a hazard we will not accept for ourselves; it also reflects an elemental failure to comprehend that the laws of science do not observe the boundaries of politics. Poisoning the food chain anywhere ultimately poisons the food chain everywhere. -Al GoreIt is the premise of Silent Spring that the Age of Chemicals represents an impending disaster for mankind, that use and overuse of chemical compounds is going to cause enormous health problems by both direct contact and as they work their way up the food chain. Carson seized on declining bird populations as an early warning sign that the effects were already being felt in animal populations. She used the metaphor of a Silent Spring, a Spring without birdsong, to convey the horror of where we were headed. As Al Gore laments above, her warnings were largely unheeded and the use of chemicals has grown rapidly. So, we should all be dead right?That's the problem with calling this one of the &quot;Best&quot; books of the century. The title &quot;Best&quot; should indicate that the book conveys some fundamental and timeless human truths. It would be more accurate to say that Silent Spring is a &quot;great&quot; book. Even then, Silent Spring is undoubtedly an important and influential book, but it is great only in the sense that Thomas Malthus' Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) was great (or The Communist Manifesto and The Protocols of the Elders of Zion and Mein Kampf for that matter). It is great because it had a profound influence on attitudes and actions, despite the fact that it was completely wrong. At the end of a Century that has seen the widespread use of chemicals accompany tremendous lengthening of human life spans, deep cuts in infant mortality rates and the revival of most endangered species, isn't it time to acknowledge that the argument of Rachel Carson's Silent Spring was a complete fallacy? Apparently the intelligentsia doesn't think so.GRADE: F"},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"I've seen many reviewers argue that the use of DDT to prevent malaria deaths in the developing world is unjustified because 1) it may cause greater long-term harm to the environment, and 2) mosquitoes will eventually develop resistance to the insecticide.One San Francisco reviewer even claimed \\"We have no idea of how many millions, or billions, of people globally have been impacted by its use in the forms of debilitating illnesses and death from cancer and the like.\\" According to her, it's irresponsible to use DDT when we have no idea to what extent the negative impact, if any (although \\"billions of people\\" is a bit ridiculous), is of using it.But there's no question what the negative impact has been of banning it: millions and millions of preventable deaths. So some environmentalists are apparently more than happy to allow an absolute--millions dead--in exchange for an unknown.Part of the reason why it's so easy for them to trade lives for theory is that they don't give much day to day thought about malaria. It's a disease that doesn't worry people in the developed world. It happens \\"over there\\" in the third world, and if we actually get it over here, well, no worries--we get treated and fully cured with relatively affordable drugs. Who in the West actually worries day to day about dying from malaria contracted from a mosquito bite? It ranks up there with polio and typhoid.But what would the \\"ban DDT no matter what the cost\\" environmentalists be saying if HIV suddenly became transmittable by mosquitoes? Would they continue to argue \\"we have no idea how many millions of people have been impacted by DDT's use\\" if they were one mosquito bite away from a death sentence with no cure (as peoples of the third world don't have or can't afford a cure for malaria)?Nope, you can bet your bottom dollar virtually every one of them would change their tune pretty quickly--especially here in San Francisco. All their objections about \\"long term damage to the environment\\" and \\"resistance to insecticide\\" would suddenly transform into a mere theory once faced with the possibility their own lives could be in mortal danger. Activists would be storming the streets demanding the return of DDT with the same vengeance they exhibit today when marching for a solution to HIV/AIDS. Because it's a different story when it's no longer someone else's life that's on the line.And hence we would have an even clearer expression of the hypocrisy of the new environmental imperialism they impose on the third world today--the kind that makes activists feel better about themselves from the comfort of latte studios and Volvo station wagons. Every day they tell the third world \\"we have cures for these diseases that you don't, so it matters not to us that our environmental crusade will take away your line of defense and you die by the millions\\" in exchange for good conversation at Starbucks. It's an easy trade when mosquito-borne death isn't tugging at *your* arm every day."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Man's attempt to control environment and nature was born out of arrogance and has its roots in a primitive stage of biology that assumed that nature exists for man to do as he will with it. Carson calls the use of chemicals to control plants and insects a stone age method. She proposes a variety of biological solutions to the insect problems and more effort to study them instead of resorting to the chemical menace. She describes how the screwworm that afflicts livestock and wild animals was eliminated in Florida, after first being tested on an island, by releasing irradiated sterile male flies. Other biological efforts described are the use of artificial lures, ultrasound, bacterial infections, importing natural enemies like spiders, ants, and the use of small mammals.The above is the conclusion of this classic work that was a huge stepping stone in environmentalism that grew in the 1960's and 70's and owed much of its impetus to this scientist who chapter by chapter unveils the follies of chemical spraying as a means of attacking a particular insect or plant with no regard to the consequences."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Excellent - and still very relevant today. Rachel Carson had great foresight at a time when DDT was being sprayed everywhere - remember how all the neighborhood children enjoyed running into the DDT fog as it was being sprayed? Unfortunately, DDT is still widely being used in third world courtries today. As follow-up reading to this book, I highly recommend &quot;Our Stolen Future&quot; by Theo Colborn (1997). What Rachel was to the sixties, Theo is to the nineties. Largely because of her work and her book, we are now realizing that in addition to cancer and loss of wildlife, pesticides pose a set of dangers that are more subtle, but may ultimately be more damaging - they may threaten our children's ability to have children. Sperm counts have dropped up to 50% in recent decades. The chemicals have blanketed the earth, and every human, now matter how remotely located, now has significant concentrations of persistent pesticides and PCBs stored in their fat tissues. Another related book I highly recommend is &quot;Toxic Sludge is Good for You - Lies, Damn Lies and the Public Relations Industry&quot; by John Stauber (1995). It explains how industry continues to manufacture thousands of extremely poisonous chemicals with abandon, despite the efforts of so many environmental groups. It turns out that many (but not all) of the so-called environmental and scientific groups are not much more than clever PR fronts funded by mainly by industry."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"This book will explain to you why and how pesticides affect the enviroment, you and your family. It opened my eyes on the importance of organic agriculture to my health.I read one of the reviews, and it pointed out that someone drank DDT and didn't get affected... Well, in the book, a scientist drank DDT, and died immediately. The negative affects of pesticides have been widely documented, and not just in this book.One big draw back of this book! It's excruciatingly boring.The bottom line:this is a classic book;if you don't believe in why organic is important, read the book;if you believe that pesticide/chemical environment is bad for your health, read it if you want to know the scientific explanation."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"I didn't think that this book was very interesting and I didn't think that this book was very dull either. It made me think about some of the current issues of today that deal with pesticides. Rachel Carson talks about how insecticides are sprayed to kill insects, but they not only kill the target insects, but also those that no one wants to kill. Now, in present day, there have been sprayings to get ride of the mosquitoes carrying the West Nile Virus. I was wondering what other insects/animals we are killing. Even though the West Nile virus is a serious disease, it does not affect the majority of the population. Less then one percent! Is that enough to risk endangerment of hundreds of animals? Or even humans that will come in contact with the insecticides?Also, she talks about how once pesticides are in the water; it is very hard to get rid of them. This reminded me of a present day issue about the \\"Frankinfish.\\" They are putting pesticides into the water to try to rid this area of the fish, but are they thinking about the other animals that they are endangering? We are already destroying habitats of animals that we have not even discovered, why do we want to kill more?All in all, this book made me wonder about how all of this is still relevant to life in the twenty-first century and what we can do to get the results that we want without using harsh chemicals."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Rachel Carson's Silent Spring is an excellent book. Although Carson published the book over 30 years ago, its message about the dangers of pesticides and man's attempts to control nature are true today. Clearly an environmentalist, Carson presents a balanced picture of how pesticides contaminate our water, atmosphere, and food. For example, she examines how DDT used to control worms, ants, and grubs ultimately kills birds and other mammals and enters our streams and lakes from runoff and kills fish. She examines the history of Clear Lake, California, where scientists used a pesticide to destroy a small gnat that annoyed fishermen. The pesticide was later found in birds, fish and larger predators. Scientists discovered that initial small doses of the insecticide increases as it is consumed along the food chain and that as waters are contaminated with pesticides, there is a danger that cancer-producing substances are being introduced, too.While Carson accepts some limited pesticide use, she fully supports biological solutions which she feels can be used to control unwanted insect and plant populations without compromising our health. For example, she points out that in California, scientists brought in two species of beetle to control the unwanted Klamath weed. She uses our fight against the Japanese beetle as another support for biological solutions to unwanted insects. In the East, scientists used an imported parasitic wasp and the milky spore disease to wipe out the Japanese beetle. In Michigan and Illinois, scientists dusted with aldrin and dieldrin to control the beetle. The pesticides only endangered birds, rabbits, muskrats, fish and people and did not solve the Japanese beetle problem. Carson notes that insects are becoming resistant to pesticides and that nature, not man, is the best control of unwanted pests.While her book was attacked and discredited by the pesticide industry, her findings have been confirmed and today environmental issues are a major national concern. The book is easy to read and contains excellent examples and explanations of the interrelationships in nature. Anyone who is interested in the environment should read this book."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"I read Silent Spring years ago. In the last 10 years, BASF, the Chemical Company and Dow and etc., etc., put out a chemical to kill all things... called Arsenal/Imazapyr. They used it throughout the United States and other places. They sprayed it to kill invader species... without telling anyone. It killed birds, cats, gave children asthma and death in the night. It caused people to cough blood and have heart attacks, along with deadly strokes. Much data has been compiled by ecologists from New Mexico... Rachel Carson is not just talking about DDT... she is talking about the very essence of life. ATP to ADP... that kills your DNA... So, read her... teach her.. tell the world that we are being poisoned to death with chemicals. I am an evolutionary ecologist. I saw and recorded what this organophosphate and neuro-toxin can do to the planet... linked with Roundup!!! Read and hand out copies of Silent Spring like it was candy... Thank you E.O Wilson...."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"This reviewer remembers, as a small child, watching crop duster planes spraying the farm fields eastern Long Island, NY. That would have been in the early 50s. 10 years later, Rachel Carson wrote \\"Silent Spring\\". It was those very same crop-spraying activities that were the focus of her concern. All those pesticides, herbicides, insecticides and defoliants extract an enormous long term toll from our environment. Miss Carson's contention, hammered home again and again, is that so many elements in our environment are inter-related and inter-dependent. DDT and other noxious chemical compounds seep into our drinking water. They adversely affect insects, fish, plants, soils, water, birds, livestock and even domestic pets. It is not always easy for the reader to follow Carson's technical details. The reader should certainly get the drift, especially since it is repeated often! We also do not have to understand all of SS to appreciate and even enjoy it. SS has a wide range of review ratings, as much as this reader has experienced on amazon. The call here is for a full 5 stars due to the importance of the subject matter. Miss Carson started the environmentally-conscious movement that persists to this day.

Carson's body is almost is a metaphor for the planet. The so-called \\"environmental movement\\" - which the book is commonly thought to have started - is really about human justice, people are part of the environment and justice for the environment is justice for people. By reading Carson today and remembering how and when she died, we are reminded that keeping our campsites in better condition than we found them (old Boy Scout motto), not trashing our backyards, is a moral consideration both about nature and people, ultimately one and the same. Carson's appeal for justice from the grave has not been met, her predictions have come true: cancer is epidemic, public health in general is eroded, and DDT and other chemicals now permeate the earth from the Arctic to our mothers milk. Progress has been made but \\"environmentalism\\" still carries a heavy stigma among many. The American pledge ends with \\"and justice for all\\" - human justice can never be obtained so long as nature, of which humans are a part, continues to be debased."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"4 1/2 starsI think I read this shortly after it came out, or perhaps it was justquoted so extensively everywhere that I came to believe I had. Carsonwas a gifted and powerful writer who apparently struggled to finishthis as she suffered from the cancer that killed her a year or twolater. All the time I was reading it I wanted annotation about howthings that she was discussing turned out; and where science has gone sinceher time. Some of that is obvious --cancer rates have risen continuously, male sperm rates are slowly butinexorably falling, and environmental disasters continue. The hubrisshe describes, of agencies rashly using broad poisons to attackspecific pests, no doubt continues. Her caution was notable -- shenever actually said that those agencies were corrupted by thecompanies selling poisons. It's a shock to remember the insanity ofthose times, when because of overproduction the government paid farmernot to grow crops on land, and then spent money spreading vast amountsof poison to increase farmers' output on the land they did plant. Butwe're still doing that, aren't we?Despite their terror of the atom bomb, she describes a naive faithin technology and its ability to fix everything easily and quickly,a belief in a \\"free lunch\\" of high-tech fixes. Now, I think, we beginto realize that there are few quick fixes without serious costs.There are many reminders that we live in a very different time now.Carson constantly refers to \\"medical men\\", \\"research men\\", \\"men ofindustry\\", even though one knew, even then, that there were a fewwomen doctors, scientists, etc. She has to address a far lessscientifically sophisticated audience than now exists. Watson, Crickand their colleagues like Rosalind Franklin were just working out thedetails of DNA, so she only mentioned genes and chromosomes in SilentSpring.The drawings in this edition are enchanting, by Lois and Louis Darling.Anyone who is interested in the environment and environmentalismshould read this book. I found the first hundred pages or sofascinating and an easy, quick and horrifying read. After that itbecame a bit repetitive as shock fatigue set in.

After nearly 45 years, DDT is no longer used. Every organism on the planet has what was once considered a lethal quantity of it in its cells and the human ones are still alive to whine about the worms in their raspberries.Should you read this book? Yes. It's a thought-provoking indictment, and, like The Jungle 60 years before it, helped shape the world in which we now live. I only wish that all you young, unshaven tree-huggers would understand that panic-peddling is a business just like everything else. Some want to sell you books, others \\"organic\\" fruit and others still want to ride panic where politics failed them like a certain secretary of vice presidency or whatever it was Gore did in the 90s."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Silent Spring by Rachel Carson was a very fascinating novel. It is the \\"Environmental Bible\\" and started the environmental conservation movement.She directly focuses on the issue of DDT and other toxic chemicals that are used as pesticides and insecticides. Carson states how we, as humans, have caused many of the problems that Earth has encountered. Many organisms are no longer in existence because of our decisions and actions. I really enjoy how she gives a plethora of examples for each topic. Each chapter focuses on a cause of the environmental issues as well as the effects. I also enjoy her choice in the title of the novel. The first chapter is short and sweet; she speaks of birds that are no longer in existence or no longer living in that particular area and states how it was a silent spring. You learn a lot from her novel and if you're interested in environmental issues and even chemistry this book is vital to your studies. Overall, the book was good. However there were a few minor things I did not care much for. She was quite repetitious at times and got into depth a bit too much. I also felt that the book sort of lacked a plot which made itdifficult to stay focused. Other than that, Silent Spring is a brilliant novel and Rachel Carson deserves big time kudos for her excellent job in reshaping many people's views of the environment."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Rachel Carson's Silent Spring is good in its factual reference Although it is very informative, to some it may seem boring.

Everyone needs to have an appreciation of the biodiversity on earth - and this book hits home. Capitalism and Industry have done their damage - it's time to pay the piper - we need to clean up the abandoned oil wells, our polluted runoff, and our dumped chemicals. 'Silent Spring' is still going on - plants and animals are still being killed by our pollutive actions - reading this book is an excellent start into the understanding of what sort of impact a single species (i.e. humans) can have on a planet."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Rachel Carson's Silent Spring is a book primarily concerning environmental issues, past and present. Her book is a must read for anyone who has a concern for the environment and the wonders the biosphere has to offer us. She talks about the diversity of life and the intricate differentiations in organisms, and what harm is becoming them.Personally, I think Rachel Carson's novel is very pertinent in today's society even though it was first published in the 1960s. I think we still have too much environmental ignorance today, and a few examples would be the many chemicals we are pumping into our biosphere. Carson stresses on the fact that we are using numerous pesticides on plants, yet they affect all of the organisms around them.Some people would consider this book to be a tofu eating, tree hugger's book, but I dissent. I think that this novel is relevant to anyone, and it will give the reader realizations on just what is causing the problems within our environment. This insight is perfect for today's modern, industrious world. Occasionally we forget the bigger picture, and mankind does things that they would be better off not doing to our Earth.Some may also say that Carson's novel is too repetitive. I think that she stresses on pesticides and harmful chemicals because they do harm our ecosystems. Someone who is not concerned with environmental issues may disagree that these chemicals have a harmful nature and grow crops using \\"biocides\\" regardless. In the end, when we think we are just affecting insects, we are hurting other organisms and ourselves.If you happen to be the type of person that wants to learn about why things go horribly wrong in our biosphere, I would strongly recommend this book. However, if you cannot bear to listen to our own fate if we do not do something about harmful chemicals, I would not recommend this book.To quote from one of Rachel Carson's key lines in her novel, \\"No witchcraft, no enemy action had silenced the rebirth of new life in this stricken world. The people had done it to themselves.\\" It may sound extremist but life, as we know it, will change if we do not take action ourselves and learn from previous mistakes."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"What can I say?

This book was mentioned a number of times in teh environmental studies degree I did at university, and it now hangs (in my mind at least) as one of those books that one day I'd like to get around to reading. There's a good chance that I'll do this within the next 12-24 months as I believe the person I bought it for will have finished it by then. They're not a slow reader, but they need to finish something for me before I will give them this book - it's like an incentive for them - and I believe they will finish this thing soon, meaning I will give them the book, which they will read (and very much enjoy I no doubt), at which time they will allow me to read it also. I am interested in reading this book. Thank you for asking."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Rachel Carson did the world a big favor in 1962 by writing this book. To a large extent the world has not listened and still is not listening. Man-made chemicals are very dangerous for not too complicated reasons. All living things are made up of chemical systems that evolved over millions of years. Before man-made chemicals were introduced chemical changes in the environment were very gradual. Now introduced chemicals are very powerful (spoken of in terms such as 3 parts per million) because the biological systems have no previous exposure to these introduced chemicals in the DNA code.Rarely does a single book alter the course of history, but Carson's \\"Silent Spring\\" did that, but not to the extent needed to fully protect the environment. As of 2004 the environment is losing and the chemicals are winning. Rachel Carson's message is now more important than ever.

It brought up many points that alot of people have probably never even thought of. The concept of humans doing such unspeakable and irreversable things to our environment is a scary reality.The way that Rachel Carson used real examples and incedents made me realize that these kind of things are real, and that no matter how much we ignore these problems, they will persist. Many of these issues could be easily resolved, or at least the results of our misconduct lessened, if we realized the severity of these actions and did a few simple things to reduce such misconduct.As far as the actual writing was concerned, I was a little lost at first. Carson's language was written differently than I'm used to reading. However, as I read more of the book, I found it easier to understand what she was saying. The book had a good structure and I found it easy and very interesting to read once I understood.The author must have conducted a vast amount of research before writing this book. There is an absolutely tremendous quantity of information in its pages.If nothing else, you should read this just to learn about what is really going on out there. Its kind of scary to find out what we are getting ourselves into without even fully understanding the consequenses. Hopefully, we will realize what we are doing to our earth before it's to late. This book does an excellent job of making you realize that we are eventually going to regret what we have done, and what we continue to do. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the earth, conservationism and to anyone who wants to find out what kind of world their children will be living in."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Silent Spring, published fifty years ago, is the original environmental work.

Carson appeals to the reader's emotions by first describing a calm, undisturbed land. She then illustrates the destruction caused by DDT, short for dichloro-diphenyl-trichloro-ethane, and how it affects plant, human, and animal life. Through her delicate balance of emotion vs. science, Rachel Carson proves that scientific theories can be easily understood by the average reader though a book.Carson's strong scientific background knowledge is evident from the beginning of Silent Spring. The first chapter, \\"A Fable for Tomorrow,\\" is by far the most powerful and thought provoking chapter in the book. This chapter outlines a fictional town, but the town she describes is easily believed by the reader to be their own. The belief that this poison could harm this simple little town has imprinted the significance of DDT from the start. Her foundation and background were so skillfully laid that the reader is already curious in her ideas and excited to read on.Carson clearly presents her problem of DDT poisoning in the third chapter. From then on, the idea of DDT is the main idea of all of her chapters, stories, and experimental data. Each chapter lays out a particular theme, such as soil destruction, water poisoning, animal poisoning, and so forth. After these individual ideas are explained, Carson begins to logically tie them together in the middle of the book by explaining each one's role in the food chain.Rachel Carson is very passionate about her topic of the destruction caused by DDT. Because of this, each chapter is full of reasons why each and every person should be actively involved in the fight against insecticides and poisons. The significance is that she alerts us that each and every plant, animal, and human is at a potential risk for poisoning. She carefully outlines how each are destroyed, have been destroyed, and what we can do to prevent it. The book also uses emotional devices such as story telling and hypothetical situations to draw the reader closer to the topic.The author's diction and tone is right on target with the average reader's intelligence. She does not include lengthy, scientific words and she explains every abbreviation. She also balances her amount of detail and description with the reader's previous knowledge. Carson includes details that can be understood, and leaves out those that could be misunderstood or complicated. However, to fully grasp the understanding of each chapter, it may be necessary to reread it to fully comprehend the literature.Rachel Carson's book is filled to the brim with opinions, stories, and warnings, but it is also filled with factual information. With 50 pages of works cited, Carson has not only proved herself, but has proved her information to be reliable and accurate. Her book is a far cry from others that are simply an overabundance of opinion that lack facts. Carson's hard work and dedication have paid off and has created a timeless non-fiction piece that stands the test of time."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"As an environmental science student at Melbourne University, I was told \\"Silent Spring\\" launched the environmental movement and paved the way for much greater knowledge of the environment. In contrast, on conservative book lists, the book is sometimes listed as a bigger killer thanMein Kampfbecause of its ban on DDT, but the liberal \\"Modern Library\\" listed it as the fifth best nonfiction book of the twentieth century.The reality is that \\"Silent Spring\\" is neither quite the pioneer in ecology that it is sometimes supposed to be nor could anything in it be said to pave the way for a huge number of deaths from the spread of malaria. First of all, the book does not offer any serious insight into the actual functioning of ecosystems, even though Carson must have known quite a lot about these questions considering the amount she wrote about marine biology. There is nothing in \\"Silent Spring\\" that discusses even the most basic human ecology or resource depletion problems. Although the book's viewpoint that humans were capable of altering the environment is drastic manners via the use of artificial chemicals, was a genuine revelation, anybody seeking a precursor toMarc Reisner,Tim Flanneryor evenSylvia Earlewill be disappointed.On the other hand, though the descriptions of the way in which pesticides killed fish in many American rivers is truly graphic and all the better for it, claims that Rachel Carson actually advocated the complete banning of pesticides that killed malarial mosquitoes can be shown in the book itself to be false. It was only the hysteria that came after the book that led many people to advocate complete bans on pesticides, and those who see her as a mass murderer overlook two facts.The first is that one of \\"Silent Spring\\"'s most essential points - that insects become resistant to specialised insecticides very quickly - means that it is exceptionally unlikely DDT is likely to keep malaria eradicated for long periods. The second is that Carson was not nearly so misanthropic as her critics would have it. Rather than advocating rapid growth of pests that would reduce the food supply, she advocated much more efficient use of pesticides that would probably serve to reduce resistance and make for much less ecological damage as well as potentially lower costs. The fact that oil's cheapness is \\"Silent Spring\\"'s day eliminated this potential gain is consistently but naturally overlooked by her critics.What makes \\"Silent Spring\\" valuable is not that it merely shows pesticides have done damage, but that it is able to see far worse consequences. The most telling are the way in which the absence of one insect from spraying leads to another becoming a worse pest, which has an (unfortunately overlooked) analog in the biological control which Carson advocates as the answer to pest problems - though I know all too well from studying the cane toad that such a view is simplistic and Carson fails to mention that agents used for biological control as often as not become pests themselves. Her idea of using such methods as fertility control, however, is actually further ahead of its time than anything else in \\"Silent Spring\\" as it was not studied significantly before the 1990s.This ability to move beyond simplistic arguments has had many benefits for \\"Silent Spring\\" over the years. Most especially, Carson's ability to see beyond simplistic cause-and-effect analyses is one reason why \\"Silent Spring\\" has held up with age vastly better thanThe Population BomborUnsafe at Any Speed, which are so often bracketed with it. I sincerely hope people can get beyond the hype to see a book that has held up very well and remains an impressive read even a half-century later as well as a superb look into the technology and life of its time. Such is a rare combination."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"When Silent Spring was first published I was a young chemist working for a chemical company in Philadelphia. I remember well how she was engaged in a TV debate with one of the big guns from one of the major manufacturers of insecticides. I thought she handled herself very well then and for the remainder of her life while she endured withering attacks from vested interests and people who want to live in a dream world. To the people who say she caused the deaths of millions because she stopped the use of DDT, you didn't read the book! Mosquito resistance to DDT is easily developed and its continued use will lead to mosquitos of greater resistance. It may be true there are application methods for DDT that are relatively safe for protection against various mosquito borne diseases but she did not cause them to be outlawed. Even though the Government screws up often,it does ocasionally makes fact based decisions that are correct. If DDT is outlawed, it is because the facts dictate it, not Rachel Carson.For those misinformed souls who think DDT is not toxic, you lie or you have been lied to. Just goggle \\"DDT toxicity\\" and you will find out what a danger this chemical really is.Her science is sound. After 44 years, her book is still worth a read.

The book used terminology and presented concepts that we have learned in Ap environmental science; therefore, i think it was a good way to apply our past knowledge to this book. Although it was not the most exciting book i have ever read, it presents a very convincing case against the use of pesticide that changed my mind about using them."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"This book is a classic observational study of the effects of man-made chemicals on the natural world. Carson, a biologist and writer, turned her attention to the natural consequences of the new practices of trying to control insect pests with chemical treatments. She begins the book by explaining the chemistry behind the commonly used agricultural chemicals such as DDT and Parathion. She then examines the fate of the chemicals, in water, soil, plants, animals, and people. She notes that not only are the chemicals causing health problems for animals and people, but they don't even maintain their effectiveness for pest or weed control for long because Nature finds a way around them. She documents disease and death in birds, fish, and humans, and explains some of the biochemical pathways for cellular damage. At the end of the book, she discusses some non-chemical alternatives for achieving the same agricultural aims.It's hard to believe that this book was written so many years ago, since the points Carson makes are still so relevant today. Because of the importance the book had in launching a much greater awareness of ecology, it's very exciting to read. It is superbly written, accessible to high school students yet still informative for those with backgrounds in the relevant fields."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Silent Spring, written by Rachel Carson was presented to the world half century ago. Although old, this book is a new overview and reflection of the power humans have to destroy. The book does not only give detailed information about each kind of pesticide, but it also presents a general picture of what the world might become if we don't stop the imprudent use of these deadly chemicals. This book set a precedent for modern biologists and ecologists. It also changed the view that mankind had toward the lethal weapons it didn't know how to use. Thanks to the advice and research of Rachel Carson, innovative ways of handling pesticides have been developed and human concern for the environment has been greatly awakened in the last half of the century. This is a magnificient work in which not only information has been recopilated, but also expresses human nature and sense for preserving our only home and partners, the animals."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Call me old fashioned, but I still think there is nothing like a good hard-copy book on a cold winter's day. silent Spring is one of those must reads from the past that one needs to reread from time to time to be reminded of man's past mistakes that severely affected man and nature, and to ensure our future."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"What more could I possibly say about this book? It is legendary. Rachel Carson changed the world with Silent Spring. Its combination of hard science and passionate, eloquent writing makes it one of the most effective, poigniant works in history.

We Americans like to think that these problems have been solved, these chemicals eradicated. But they have not. DDT is banned from domestic use in the US because of Silent Spring, but it is still produced -only now it is just sold to other countries for use. Think of that. Where do your fruits and veggies come from? And an alarming number of chemicals Carson names are still perfectly legal (and toxic) in the US today.It is true that Carson made some factual mistakes, but they were not made out of ignorance or a willingness to mislead. They were made because scientists now (thanks to Carson) have studied the subject more in-depth and have greater knowledge about the effects. And Carson got a disturbing number of facts correct. Anyone who labels this book \\"junk science\\" is clearly not paying attention. 50 pages of meticulous notes, and a manuscript signed off on by several of the time's top ecologists and biologists. Carson's book did the best it could in the situation and for the time.This is an important book because the American public needs to be reawakened to these problems. Too many of us do feel many changes have been made, when in reality, we lag far behind places like Western Europe. The reality is: We live in a toxic world. I think everyone needs Carson to remind them of that."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"For those of the reviewers who claim how much human lives are saved by using DDT, why don't you consider some disvantages from using DDT too? Aren't human beings are so self-interested. Though using DDT might save millions of people and create more (good looking) food, it threatens many faunas and might eventually be harmful to human in a long term. \\"Silent Spring\\" was written 4 decades ago so there might not be many scientific researches related to the use of DDT at the time. Never theless, consider the bald eagle, they are endangered right now due to the thinning of eggs, caused by accumulation of the pesticide. The problem is still present, even though DDT is banned since 1972 in the United States. Pesticide might also be harmful to useful insects-that means, the pollinators can be killed, less fertilization, and the fruit production might actually decrease compare to when the pesticide is not used and other methods are used to control pests. Other natural substances can be used as substitute. For malaria problem, will it be better to try to find a new method to control mosquitoes than keep saying that DDT is the best and we shall not stop using it? Long evolution creates a way that balance the ecosystem itself: malaria-resistance trait is highly present where more malaria breaks out. Moreover, there are many natural ways that can help to prevent the problem, but they just might be less convenience than DDT. We just have learn how to. Long term effect of DDT might not be so wonderful as you thought.As a reviewer says that DDT does not persist long in the environment and 92% of DDT in a closed container degraded within a month, you didn't really tell what it degrades into. DDT can be degraded into DDD and DDE, which are still found in sediment cores (at least from the Hudson River where I actually study the sediment). DDD and DDE are still harmful, though slighly less than the DDT itself. I look up some research papers and still found the same thing I used to understand: DDT DO accumulate through the food chain.For the claim that numbers of bird was increasing from 1941 to 1962 because of the use of DDT, I'm wondering what area the information is representing. With my knowledge, increasing number of species are recognized each year due to more interest in discovering species and new technologies that help in finding and comparing species. Thus, the number of species recorded at one year from a large area might not truly represent the number of species that exists in that area. The higher crops yeild might not benefit carnivorous birds since their food (insects) is lower. Also, the higher crops yeild with more birds eating the seeds, wouldn't that eventually damage the crops (less food for human)?Though the \\"Silent Spring\\" might contain some errors and does not refer to any new researches (because it might be impossible for RC to do so in 1960s), people should still consider to read this classic book and increase the awareness in doing anything. With our knowledge at this point, many evidences support that human beings have done so many negative impact on this planet without knowing at the time or without consideration that we are a part of the planet. For example, it took decades for us to know that the wonderful chemical CFCs in the past are very harmful the ozone layer. Every unit in the ecosystem is also important and has a reason be to here and we should respect them all."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Why don't all of you start sprinkling it on your corn flakes in the morning and see just how harmless it is?

After it, and the subsequent ban on DDT, millions of people have suffered and died needlessly. For example, in Sri Lanka in 1948, there were 2.8 million malaria cases and 7,300 malaria deaths. With widespread DDT use, malaria cases fell to 17 and no deaths in 1963. After DDT use was discontinued, Sri Lankan malaria cases rose to 2.5 million in the years 1968 and 1969, and the disease remains a killer in Sri Lanka today.Carson' science is dodgy, her conclusions false and her prescriptions plain wrong.

I have a big vocabulary for my age, but some of those words defied explanation. It was extremely difficult, and I am in a language arts class way above average. I am usually interested in science-related items, but this was ridiculous! As you can figure, if this is my reaction to one chapter, imagine the whole book . . . ouch.

Most of the stuff is things that I think the general public already knows, or things that we learned in biology class. I think for a great deal of the book she is explaining basic biology to people who don't know biology. Maybe it was revolutionary back then, but now society has advanced and DDT and a lot of these extremely poisonous chemicals have been outlawed.In spite of that, I did learn a couple of things:1) The extent to which these chemical sprays were being used back then. People would just literally fly these planes over an area and drop the poison, and EVERYTHING would die. Plants, animals, everything. People's livestock, beautiful songbirds, beautiful flowers, everything, which people actually wanted to preserve, and the people themselves would get sick too. It doesn't seem like they exercised a lot of common sense, but the big pesticide companies were pushing these eradication programs so they would make a lot of money, and so it happened. As Rachel Carson said somewhere, these kinds of poisons would normally be kept in a jar with a skull and crossbones on it, but now we just drop them \\"indiscriminately from the skies,\\" as one of the chapters is titled. After I read this book, I went on Youtube to look up more, and I was watching this black and white video from back then, where they were literally spraying people with DDT while they were in the swimming pool or some other recreation, and these people looked like they were having such a good time.2) The chapter on cancer was somewhat illuminating. Nowadays, it seems like everybody gets cancer. People do die from other things too, but a great deal of it is cancer. People keep talking about finding a cure for cancer, like some kind of miracle cure. Rachel Carson, even back then, was advocating prevention not cure, taking the toxic chemicals out of our environment, and not introducing them in the first place. I never knew that cancer wasn't really common until the start of the Industrial Revolution, so that was something I learned. Prevention not cure is still relevant today. People are still talking about a cure for cancer, like some kind of miracle cure, and are not really thinking about prevention, nor are they connecting the cancer epidemic with the toxicity of the environment. Even I didn't make that connection before I read this book. I knew environmental factors could cause cancer, but I didn't know that it was causing ALL of the cancer that we have now. That is something we should still listen to Rachel Carson on. It's like how Carson said somewhere, we want these chemicals, and then we want a pill to deal with the side effects, and then another pill to deal with THOSE side effects, instead of not causing the illness in the first place.It all reminds me of the time when I was babysitting a kid, and the mother was telling me about his food allergies. And she commented, \\"When we were young in Taiwan, we never had food allergies or anything like that. It must be something in the environment.\\" I wonder if environmental pollution is causing food allergies too, just like it causes cancer.I have never felt that America was beautiful, but America is supposed to be beautiful, in all the songs and stuff. But driving around the American countryside, I have never felt it. I wonder if it has something to do with the mass killing back then.All this just goes to show that when you spread death around, it reaches you eventually."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"We needed more than 30 years to understand that Rachel Carson was not an alarmist. This prophetic book about our environment is very well written."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Rachel Carson had the ability to communicate to a broad audience. She wrote to the point but with a skill that makes reading Silent Spring enjoyable. Speaking as a scientist that reads many dry &quot;scientific&quot; books and journals, I found Rachel Carson to be an enjoyable, informative read."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Silent Spring created a stir when it was first published and reading it nearly 50 years later feels, in many ways, like deja vu. The specific details may be different, but the overall picture is far too familiar. Chemical companies, government agencies, popular media, special interests, all continue to tell us that we must destroy every organism that might conceivably cause discomfort or inconvenience to our perceived \\"good\\" life. The fact remains that heavy-handed, get-them-before-they-get-us,kill-them-all-off mentality will, in the end, do just that - destroying the very life it strives, supposedly, to protect. The more things change, the more they stay the same."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"In most countries, DDT was banned only for agricultural use, NOT for control of malaria, in fact it is still widely used today for that purpose.

However, the book can be dull at times. If you muddle through those parts, it gets better. The last chapter, on alternatives to chemical control of pests and weeds, is the most interesting and practical. Another problem with the book is that Rachel Carson often uses overly sensational wording to convey the threat from widespread use of chemicals. She was clearly on a mission. The final flaw I found with the book is some logical errors in her arguments. If you can overlook those relatively minor points, it is very worth reading. The book is extremely well researched and provides a wealth of information. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Rachel Carson's novel Silent Spring was written in order to express the author's many concerns over the affects of DDT and other chemicals on the environment. The author takes facts from personal stories that she has read about, while at the same time incorporating some of her own opinions on those individuals who blindly use chemicals as a way to control the environment. Her charges against major chemical companies opened a new window to the public, and made aware the growing problem of man's abuse of their environment. Carson shows the effects of these chemicals on plants, animals, water and humans through a natural chain of events.The author believes that in this small world all beings are linked, and a defilement of one creature will affect the rest. Rather than use chemicals to wipe out growing species of insects, it is important to use foreign insects to aid in decreasing the number of potentially dangerous species with the aid of Mother Nature. Carson felt that in the end these chemical sprayings were ineffective and potentially harmful to innocent people.Silent Spring has been considered one of the most significant books in the nation's history, because it brought to light the abuse of the environment by man. In the novel's introduction, Vice President Al Gore states that \\"In 1962, when Silent Spring was first published, \`environment' was not even an entry in the vocabulary of public policy\\" (Carson xv). The novel forced political officials to take a closer look at this growing problem. Her book even influenced President Kennedy, to call for testing of the chemicals that were mentioned in the text. The book introduced the average citizen to the environment's unstable state, which was caused by man and his chemicals.Overall I was impressed by the novel, because it gave excellent facts that could convince any reader while at the same time incorporating the author's own passionate opinions. A book that has such a profound impact on American politics and society should be read by everyone."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Rachel Carson writes a truly amazing account of humankind's need to destroy itself and everything around us. What amazes me is that even after the first birds began to fall from the rain of pesticides, the government continued to spray year after year! The way in which we go blindly into the world assuming every new invention and chemical to be 'safe' because the companies that make them say so will never cease to boggle my mind. When iit comes down to making money, big companies will say anything about their products to get them sold. PBS just ran a very interesting documentary on the subject of chemicals in our workplace and environment see pbs.org for a time when it is to be rebroadcast.I must say that the book did seem a bit repetitive at times, but nontheless, I think this was Carson objective, to hammer home how truly stupid we humans can be."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"I recently read Slient Spring and it had its downs and its up (only one of them)Some infomartion that Carson used to show the effects of DDT on bird eggs were misleading and others were outright lies. Some of the lies she wrote were bogus numbers of deaths and even the &quot;effects&quot; that DDT had. If we had DDT today, I doubt that there would be West Nile in the effect that it is today or Malaria would be as powerful as it is now in Third World nations.The one plus side of Silent Spring was that it had solid writing. The words and &quot;information&quot; flowed easily onto paper.So in the end Silent Spring is a good example of how to write, but not how to do research."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"It's hard to imagine that this was the first of its kind - a popular science discussion on why __ is bad for us and what we have to look forward to as its consequences in the 21st century. Isn't it true that most of these books are apocalyptic, if not obviously at least subtly? In this one, Carson warns us against relying on chemicals to treat agricultural bug infestations because as we know today the main chemical used in her time (1950's) was DDT which happens to range from somewhat-deadly to really-deadly to humans and animals. And since we all know this now, why should you read this book anyway? Because the truly alarming thread laced throughout Carson's concerns is the apathy and even the downright refusal of both the government agencies and the money-making public to even acknowledge the existence of a deadly serious problem: \\"It is human nature to shrug off what may seem to us a vague threat of future disaster.\\" By reading this, you will also learn about the lengths people will go to, to push their agendas at great cost to 'the public', or more directly, people's lives. Her research, which is still very current, and her poignant, fluid language on topics like the explosion of cancer in the western world, make for some thought-provoking reading, whether or not that's particularly your cup of tea.If you're into dystopian fiction, you would enjoy this book - although you might want to pretend it's just dystopian fiction, instead of the frightening reality of our past, present and sadly probable future. Carson lived from 1907 to 1964, spending her career as a marine biologist with the US Fish and Wildlife Service and writing books about the sea until, knowing of the seriousness of pesticide/chemical usage in the world and the ineffectualness of government regulations to curb it, she felt obliged to write Silent Spring. I would be hard-pressed to believe that there is any other science/nature writer today who knows what they're talking about as much as Carson knew about her subject as presented here. Highly recommended to everyone, ever."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Holy cow. What a well-written book. I can totally understand how Rachel Carson's Silent Spring (1962) jump-started the modern environmental movement.The 300 page book starts and ends with hopeful fables of a healthy environment full of vibrant flora and fauna. The middle 15 chapters document, in painful detail, the damage that synthetic chemicals inflict on life. The book is famous for exposing the dangers of DDT (and aldrin and heptachlor), but I was shocked and angered by the bigger problem: All knowing bureaucrats over-applying chemicals in places that do not need them, to fight bugs that may not be present, without a clue of the collateral damage that they are causing.Yes, we're talking about the USDA (and various government \\"landscaping\\" bureaucracies).I took a few notes while reading the book:* Carson started speaking out about DDT in 1945. It was banned in the US in response to her book.* She too respected, intelligent and careful to ignore. She died in 1964, of cancer.** DDT went everywhere, even hundreds of kilometers from where it was sprayed.* She wrote, consistently, about the need to be careful about using chemicals and pesticides. She did not advocate bans on chemicals, per se.*** Monsanto appears as the face of evil -- as they have recently, twice, thrice.* Western Sagebrush was labeled a \\"weed\\" and sprayed with herbicides, with massive bad results.* Same thing in Maine and Michigan, where they devastated thousands of acres of ALL life, by overspraying for insect populations that were NOT out of control. Spraying frequently led to massive rebounds and much more damage, often by killing predator and competator species.* California rice growers sprayed their fields. Local insects, fish and migratory birds died.* Fisheries (salmon, trout, bass, etc.) were destroyed (by direct damage and starvation for lack of insect food), but people were also harmed by eating fish that had bioaccumulated DDT and related chemicals.* The USDA's campaign against the fire ant is a case-study in the chemical abuse, money waste, and massive environmental destruction [p. 171]:In 1959... the Agriculture Department offered the chemicals free to Texas landowners who would sign a release absolving federal, state and local governments of responsibility for damage. In the same year, the State of Alabama, alarmed and angry at the damage done by the chemicals, refused to appropriate further funds to the project. One of its officials characterized the whole program as \\"ill advised, hastily conceived, poorly planned, and a glaring example of riding roughshod over the responsibilities of other public and private agencies.\\"[USDA incompetence made me want to throw the book across the room at this point. I feel the same about corn ethanol. I bet politicians were involved...]* Many entomologists (bug scientists) worked for chemical companies, either on staff or at universities, because these companies funded their research. Not surprisingly, these \\"professionals\\" supported chemical control of insects.A big thought: Most farmers will tell you that they minimize the volume of chemicals (and fertilizer) that they apply to their land, because they do not want to waste money and time on over-application. It's thus important (and sad) to note that the biggest abusers of chemicals in Silent Spring are bureaucrats whose jobs dictate that they should \\"do something\\" with other people's money (OPM!) and homeowners who do not understand the dangers of the chemicals they use and who think that \\"some is good, so more is better\\" when applying them to their yards. Both groups are convinced to buy and use by salesmen and advertising;*** both groups have little idea of how effective chemicals are (they do not watch yields); and both groups do not suffer the consequences from over-use of chemicals. Bureaucrats apply them to other people's land; homeowners just wash excess into storm drains and distant environments. Farmers may be willing to chemically sterilize their land, but at least they experience most of the costs and benefits of those actions.She concludes with [p. 297]:The \\"control of nature\\" is a phrase conceived in arrogance, born of the Neanderthal age of biology and philosophy, when it was supposed that nature exists for the convenience of man. The concepts and practices of applied entomology for the most part date from the Stone age of science. It is our alarming misfortune that so primitive a science has armed itself with the most modern and terrible weapons, and that in turning them against the insects it has also turned them against the earth.Bottom Line: FIVE STARS. Be careful with poisons; they can kill you and everything that you love.* Scientists suggest that cancer is purely man-made, as in the Egyptians -- old Egyptians -- didn't have it. Mukherjee claims that it's been with us for a long time, but his book summarizes ancient references to \\"tumors\\" that may not be cancerous.** Protecting rainforests and draining hatching sites is more effective controlling mosquitoes (malaria) than DDT.*** My favorite is pine-scented bug killer.

We have no idea of how many millions, or billions, of people globally have been impacted by its use in the forms of debilitating illnesses and death from cancer and the like.

Nonsensical at best."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"The book is very emotional and is an interesting read, I'll give it that. Carson is a good writer presents a compelling case, but it is supported by lies and half-truths. I'll mention a couple of them below...Carson wrote, \\"Dr. DeWitt's now classic experiments [on quail and pheasants] have now established the fact that exposure to DDT, even when doing no observable harm to the birds, may seriously affect reproduction. Quail into whose diet DDT was introduced throughout the breeding season survived and even produced normal numbers of fertile eggs. But few of the eggs hatched.\\" But Dr. DeWitt's actual article yielded different conclusions. Quail that were fed DDT hatched 80% of their eggs, while the control group that wasn't fed DDT hatched 83.9% of their eggs. Hardly a significant difference. Carson also \\"conveniently\\" forgot to mention that DeWitt's control group of pheasants hatched only 57% of their eggs, while those fed DDT in high levels for an entire year hatched more than 80% of their eggs.Carson seemed to believe that DDT was responsible for declining bird populations. Yet somehow she forgot that the bald eagles were threatened with extinction in 1921, 25 years before widespread use with DDT. The peregrine falcon and brown pelican populations also declined significantly before widespread use of DDT. So don't blame DDT for that.Yet another thing she forgot was the millions of humans saved, with little real damage to the environment. DDT was only shown to be harmful in HUGE doses; i.e. doses that are many, many times higher than could possibly be encountered through normal usage.In summary, read this book if you like to be scared, but don't take it too seriously. It's kind of depressing that this piece of trash was taken as fact and started a movement, at the expense of millions of human lives due to insect-carried diseases. There are problems with the environment, sure, but DDT is not one of them. This book was written with an agenda, and it succeeded in that regard. So we have wonderful Rachel Carson to thank for many of our pest and disease problems we have today. Give her a round of applause."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"I'm sorry but I have to do this. Silent Spring is not the masterpiece that everyone says it is. Yes it might be considered revolutionary FOR THE TIME but reading it today seems compeltely pointless.Silent Spring is one of the most repetative books I've ever read. The only part where it was interesting was when she went off topic to explain the inner workings of the cell. All 300 pages could literally have been summed up on the front and back of a single sheet of paper. In this day and age, there ARE better ways of becomming aware of polution than putting so much time into such an outdated book.The entire book is about DDT and how it affects the planet. The point that DDT and other chemicles will turn up in unforseen places if dumped somewhere is hammered into the reader thoughout the whole book. And that's really all there is to say. If you want to learn about polution, go to a more recent and refined resorce."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"This book was well written and researched, we also decided that we would never read this on our own. We found it extremely repetitive. Each chapters said the same thing over and over. It always talked about how we should use natures checks instead of controling with nature. It also mentions foreign insects a lot, one example being the Japanese beetle. The book also made us very aware and scared about the effects. It made us realize the dangers of these chemicals. People can get cancer from these sprays,leukemia being one of them. It made us want to keep up to date on what was going on in the world with pesticides."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"While Rachel's theories were ahead of her time 40 years ago, many now believe DDT is not the toxin/poison that her book helped label the chemical as. One thing is for SURE: malaria kills millions, including children, in Africa each and every year. DDT could prevent those deaths at a very affordable cost. Malaria in Africa -- one of those unseen ripples in the pond...."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"The book &quot;Silent Spring&quot; written by Rachel Carson is a call for mankind to stop destroying our environment and in an indirect way, destroying ourselves. I think this book is perfectly written and exposes good ideas, on thing I disliked about the book is that it was sort of repetitive and didn't explain in a concise for all the information. I think Ms. Carson could have exposed her ideas just as well in much less words. The idea though is good and I say I agree with her in many ways. The book basically explains a series of events in many parts of the world (mostly the US) were the chemical pesticides have failed the purpose of controlling pests, and also most of the times the use of chemical pesticides have backfired and caused more damage than the original pest caused. Also, a chapter or two in the book give possible solutions and directs a path of a new biological warfare against pests. Although this book was written like 50 years ago (approximately) the ideas are pretty contemporary to modern days. I guess human beings haven't learned the lesson yet, and we continue to make the same mistakes over and over. Now I ask, what will it take to make humans stop destroying our world? I fear we will not stop until it's too late, I hope time proves me wrong. Rachel Carson saw this problem and began a revolution against the chemical warfare against pests. Its good to see that as time passes more and more people realize that pesticides are a real danger and that it's not a problem of someone else, but it's a problem of you and me that needs to be solved soon. There's no better time then now, no better place then here; let's change and avoid the use of chemicals in our houses and working areas. If each person contributes a little we can still save the world. We can't change the past but we can still save the past... Dream on"},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"For my book choice I chose to read Silent Spring by Rachel Carson. Having read selections for a paper I had to do earlier last semester, I was intrigued about reading the book in it's entirety and get the whole picture the author was trying to paint when talking about the dangers to our environment. Written in the early 1960's it sparked a lot of debate and talk about pesticides and how they are effecting and changing the environment around us. The book stresses the potential danger that will come with the consequences of using such poisons on the land.She was the first of her kind to branch out and talk about the environment and in some ways started the movement for a healthier planet. The book talks about a \\"Silent Spring\\" in which no one can hear the songs of the birds because they have did out due to the pesticide exposure. That is generally the main theme of the book and I used as an image to show how different and drastic the land would be changed and ravaged by our actions. She then delves deeper into this concept by talking also about how it will only kill birds and animals but then soon it will affect humans and the way of life and pace at which we operate and change the environment to frightening landscapes.I personally thought the book was mediocre. I say this for the fact that I don't think pesticides are as much of a problem today as they were fifty years ago but its message is great as it is really the first tome to speak on the issue of planetary rejuvenation and cleaning the world up for future generations. From a historical perspective it's interesting to trace the roots of the green movement, and this would be one of the first books speaking about the topic, so if history interests you about environmental care this book is for you. But if you are looking for just a casual read not the best book to look at for an impact on today's society."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Many people are accusing this book for causing deaths in places like Africa from malaria. They aren't paying attention to what this book is trying to say. She may have said several times that DDT is dangerous, and should not be used, but she also mentioned how quickly these insects are going to evolve and adapt to it. It will not stay poisonous to them forever. Once they have adapted to it malaria will once again be a problem, and our environment will be hurt. This world is meant for many different organisms to live on. We should try our best not to interupt the cycle of nature, because we too make up a small part of nature. I thionk it is time we start thinking about every animal that will be affected, and what might happen in the long run. Please people, think seriously about this situation, don't continue on the same path of ignorance and greed!"},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"I found Silent Spring to be monotonous and depressing. Carson's 355 page book is filled with 17 different chapters, with the last 59 pages dedicated to footnotes. She draws the reader in, at first, with painting a beautiful countryside, then destroying it. She calls her short story \\"A Fable for Tomorrow\\", and then backs up the horror by telling us all the different maladies that overcame her perfect town actually happened in reality.However, this haunting beginning is followed by a two chapters (\\"The Obligation to Endure\\" and \\"Elixirs of Death\\") that merely describe what poisons we use and why. They are morbidly interesting, since she follows up each deathly \\"elixir\\" with a more potent, more frightening one, up to the most deadly of them all, endrin, which can be up to 300 times more poisonous as DDT to some birds.Now that the reader has a who's who of poisons, Carson then moves on through the next 6 chapters to show us their effect in water (\\"Surface Waters and Underground Seas\\"), soil (\\"Realms of the Soil\\"), plants (\\"The Earth's Green Mantle\\"), wildlife (\\"Needless Havoc\\"), birds (\\"And No Birds Sing\\"), and fish (\\"Rivers of Death\\"). With each chapter, she shows us a picture of how life was before the pesticides, and then tells us the story of how it was destroyed. She lists example after example of life wilting before the toxins. Birds are found trembling or dead, fish are eradicated from major rivers for miles and miles. I found it to be extremely depressing at first, then, after several chapters, it became numbing and monotonous. I hear about so much death, so many losses, the only comfort I have is to know that laws prohibit the same flow of toxins into our environment, through it is a naivet&eacute; that is quickly dissipating. But I digress.Chapter 10, \\"Indiscriminately from the Skies\\", details the effects and cost of aerial spraying with pesticides. The next four chapters (\\"Beyond the Dreams of the Borgias\\", \\"The Human Price\\", \\"Through a Narrow Window\\", and \\"One in Every Four\\".) explain the effect of pesticides on humans. The last of the four is upsetting, to say the least. The title is an estimation of how many people will develop cancer, and quotes the American Cancer society in predicting that it will strike two out of every three families. It is within this chapter Carson blames DDT for being a carcinogen.And just when things seemed they could not get worse, Carson throws two last, depressing chapters at us. \\"Nature Fights Back\\" and \\"The Rumblings of an Avalanche\\" describe how the pesticides we use today are becoming ineffective as insects adapt, evolve, and resist our battles, and come back stronger than before, now that their predators are poisoned to eradication. This unfortunately results in the use of more powerful chemicals, and then, in time, the cycle repeats itself and even more powerful chemicals are required.In her last chapter, \\"The Other Road\\", Carson gives us a solution. Through sterilization methods, lures, repellants, venoms, bacterial diseases, and biological control (importing their natural enemies), insects can be controlled continuously, and, she adds, some pesticide control is not out of order now and then.Though Carson's style of writing did not change throughout the book, I found the facts haunting, and understand how this book may have been the stone that started the avalanche that changed how people look at a tree, a forest, and the world."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"This is one of the most influential books of our time. Even now, it contributes to the death of one child every 12 seconds, mostly in the Third World, because it helped to bring about the ban of DDT with a resulting resurgence of malaria and other insect-borne diseases.Entomologist G. Gordon Edwards wrote: \`\`In 1962, Rachel Carson published Silent Spring, and because of my 25 years of nature study I expected to be delighted....It didn't take long to learn that she had filled the book with great numbers of untruthful things. Vice President Al Gore has stated that Rachel Carson turned his life around. She turned mine around, too, but in the opposite direction,...from an 'environmentalist' to a scientist with a desire to keep truth in science and environmentalism.''Audubon magazine refused to publish the other side of the DDT story and accused Edwards of being in the pay of the pesticide industry. He won a libel suit against them. In fact, many scientists were going along with the anti-DDT propaganda in order to get paid for flawed experiments.DDT was actually good for birds. There is a vast amount of material to refute assertions to the contrary. Bird counts in 1960 (after DDT) vs. 1941 (before DDT) showed 12 times more robins, 21 times more cowbirds, 38 times more blackbirds, 131 times more grackles, etc. Possible protective effects include: increasing plant yields; increasing protective cover; eliminating mosquito-borne bird diseases; and inducing liver enzymes that break down naturally occurring environmental toxins and carcinogens.It was said that DDT was killing eagles and other predatory birds. In fact, eagles were endangered long before DDt was discovered. Yes, eggshells were thinner in birds that were fed DDT--but only when the birds were also deprived of calcium. DDT does NOT undergo biomagnification in the food chain. Scientists &quot;proved&quot; that it does by comparing concentrations in hawk brains with that in fish muscle. Comparing muscle with muscle shows no such effect. DDT does not persist for a long time in the environment. In 38 days, 92% of the DDT in a sealed container of sea water disappeared. One can &quot;find&quot; DDT--in samples sealed decades before DDT was discovered-- by using methods that detect interfering substances found in fluorescent light ballast or plastic tubing.It is true that in one experiment &quot;DDT-fed mice developed cancers&quot;--but the control animals that were NOT fed DDT developed almost 25% MORE cancers.Dr. Edwards is so convinced of DDT's safety that he used to eat a tablespoon of DDT powder at the beginning of every speech. In 1971, Robert and Louise Loibl took a capsule of 10 mg of DDT (a full year's intake for an average American) every day for 3 months without ill effect.Rachel Carson dedicated her book to Albert Schweitzer, who said \`\`Man has lost the capacity to foresee and to forestall. He will end by destroying the earth.''\`\`Miss Carson knew,'' Edwards states, that \`\`he was referring to atomic warfare when she quoted that, but she implied that he meant there were deadly hazards from pesticides such as DDT. I got a copy of Schweitzer's autobiography to see if he really mentioned DDT. He did, writing (p. 262): 'How much labor and waste of time these wicked insects do cause us...but a ray of hope, in the use of DDT, is now held out to us'.''The ban on DDT was based on a tissue of lies and half truths, for which Rachel Carson must be held partly responsible. Babies are being sacrificed for the welfare of the birds--and they are dying in vain."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Rachel created a saga of facts about what damage we have done with insecticides and herbicides throughout the US without any thought to the environment or ourselves. She showed in this book our many errors in judgement and backs everything up with facts. She also tells about some new ideas(back then they were new)that would fix some of our \\"bug\\" problems but not with chemicals that will ultimately hurt people. Too bad it took so long for us to START paying attention to what she wrote so many years ago."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"I love this book. Mostly because of its beauty and poignancy in its ability to make true science and ecology accessible to the average reader.Unfortunantly, this book has also been used, and misused, by both sides of the environmentalist movement to justify there rather flawed beliefs.You see, because of the wide ban of DDT, the death rate of malaria has grown tremendously over the past 40+ years. The reason is because uninformed individuals misunderstand the purpose behind the book. Carson's concern was the use of DDT for AGRICULTURAL purposes, NOT health care purposes.Unfortunantly, social conservatives have used this rather unfortunante and tragic mistake from the environmentalist movement as ammo against the environmentalist movement as a whole, using a gross and unfair generalization that is just as tragic as the millions who have died from malaria due to the irresponsible and uninformed DDT regulations in our country.Be smart, be open minded, be knowledgeable, and THEN read this book, and its true purpose and beauty will eventually come to you quite easily, and you will be informed."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Many of the points are just as fresh today as they were in 1962. Carson had a knack for getting people to think about what we are doing to the earth in the name of greed and ignorant business interests. I would hope every high school senior could read this book, so they can reflect on what vehicles, smokestacks, etc. are doing to our precious environment. How about species still disappearing at an alarming rate and mainstream America seems not to care enough?Carson has many common sense solutions, that would be seriously considered and implemented today, as one reviewer writes: \\"Many insects have natural enemies that, if introduced into a problem area, will keep down pest populations. Even localized spraying will work better than mass, indiscriminate spraying. Carson argues that biological control methods are increasingly important because insects are building up resistance to pesticides, requiring the creation of even more virulent poisons in a never-ending cycle where nobody wins.\\"She was telling people bad news, when most people want to hear good news. The same goes for today's society. George Bush is telling people good news, news they want to hear, while people like Howard Dean lost because he wasn't telling the people what they wanted to hear. Politicians need a lot of courage these days if they want to tell the truth and do what's right on environmental issues and other issues."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"First of all, this book may have been an eye opener when it came out, but this book is outdated. We have new technology that allows us to rid ourselves of certain pests that we did not have in the 1950's and 1960's. With new methods we have created new problems and eliminated a few of the old ones. Books should be recomended that discuss current problems rather than outdated ones. Although this book was a pioneer in alerting the country of environmental hazards it overexagerates situations to unrealistic levels. It does however suggest a few natural ways to rid communities and farms of certain insects. All in all, I was informed of a few new things that opened my eyes, but like I said, they are problems that are now mostly in the past."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"This book has been justly acclaimed for 35 years. It is a primer for environmental awareness, and finer words than these have been written in praise of this book. But there are two things I have noticed in this book that I have not seen mentioned. One is the implied conclusion we have to make about the condition of man, and his folly. His often ignorant and worse, arrogant manner of interacting with nature and other men. The often less than honorable relationship between the federal government and big business, without whom these lessons hard learned on the hazards of insecticides would probably not have been necessary. What impressed me so was the way that people continued to use these harmful products after obvious hazard to themselves and nature by being convinced by the government that it was safe to do so. They were so trusting and so wrong. Their belief that they could alter nature to suit their needs indefinitely speaks of their ignorance.The other point I would like to make is that I found Ms. Carson's prose to be nearly as delightful as poetry. Her writing style is beautiful, refined, and yet her intellect and strength of character shine through. While the topic of this book is profoundly disturbing, Ms. Carson's writing made it curiously pleasant. It is easy to read, and still a relevant topic after so many years. I will be anxious to read the follow-up books on this subject."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Silent Spring is a book that has been read by many people and is written by Rachel Carson. In this book she writes about the disturbances that had been created in nature, and almost all of them created by humans. The use of pesticides has been a terrible damage to animals, plants, and even persons, as a result, in the time where this was seriously happening, like about in the 1960's, there was a huge decline in some of out beautiness of our nature, as birds and other animals that ineract with each other. Rachel Carson wrote this book so everybody could see how those pesticides or chemicals were destroying our environment and for people to realize what we need to think before we destroy our place, and for companies to rebuild an idea of what they're making. Silent Spring talks about an specific pesticide that was the first originated and that caused a lot of damage, panic, and troubleness among people and species, that was the use od DDT, this was a phenomenom that wasn't easily to get rid off and to fins s solution to the long effects that caused, such as the different diseases in persons, etc. I think that Silent Spring is an interesting book that students in high school should read, if interested, to realize what were the views over 30 years ago, and that we now can still see them, of the damage in the environment and the species in general."},{"Title":"Silent Spring","review":"Rachel Carson did a job for society, a job that required many hours of research and thinking. It is not a matter of thanking her, but a matter of what we should do now, now that we have the knowledge that something is deeply wrong with our insecticide use. The one daunting realization that comes to mind when talking about action in a field like this, is that one either needs to be overly zealous to save the environment--for whoever decides to take up the environmentalism battle will face many obstacles--or one needs to be connected (e.g., be the president or vice president). The next thought is just how hard it will be to find one&#8217;s way around all the lies, and all the bribes and corruption that will surely find the person who gets up high enough to make changes.
