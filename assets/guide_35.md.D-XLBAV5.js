This book is nothing but fluff. If you are anything more than a newbie, it's got nothing and if you're a complete newbie there's just enough information to be dangerous. She promises periodically that more information will be given about actually growing certain plants, but that information is never forthcoming.It's full of personal anectdotes that have little to do with the topic at hand, the tone is condescending and she encourages the use of poisons. She anthropomorphizes plants in an embarrassing way, telling a story about a poisonous plant she accidentally purchased as if it had a personal vendetta against her and her family. Her attitude toward plants goes beyond respect into something slightly off-kilter.The book is good for a giggle. If you must read it, make sure you have a firm grasp of both gardening and herbal magic first. Otherwise you could well follow this lady into lala land."},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"I have really enjoyed reading this book cover to cover.

I know it will always be a work in progress and I'm OK with that, in fact I love that it will be. As I change, my garden will be changing right with me. I no longer feel that I have to spend lots of money at the garden center, just use what comes naturaly!"},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"I really liked this book and i do think anyone that has a little bit of garden or interior balcony space should read it. There are many nice idea's both for the city pagan and the country one."},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"I love this book. Ellen Dugan is funny, down-to-earth, and no-nonsense. She's so charming and informative that it's easy to forgive her unabashed adoration of knick-knacks and over-the-top holiday decorations. A real treat for a kindred garden witch. Thanks and write some more books please!"},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"This is definitely the most informitive and intertaining books of study that I own. This book is written with a sense of humor and contains the information that both novice and practitioner will find invaluable. This book is an absolute necessity for any wiccan library."},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"While I may be new to wiccan books and the academic study of wicca I am very much familiar with gardening and my spiritual connection with the earth. I have always used my gardening to commune with the forces of nature and the sentient beings of this planet. This book gave the impression of being about two of my favorite subjects. Also, the cover of this book is quite beautiful, evoking feelings of enchantment and mystery. In reality a more appropriate cover would have been a silly cartoon witch, flying on her broom, with a big silly grin. If that's your thing more power to you! However, I found this book to be nearly useless and often idiotic. I appreciated the few sections where she managed to give the reader REAL tools and methods for the garden witch but the majority of this book was utter FLUFF! The author is obnoxiously chatty, subjecting us with story after mundane story of her family and their, in my opinion, AWFUL approach to gardening and magick. Firstly, by using synthetic fertilizers and pesticides she violates the rule of harming none. If anyone finds this to be an overly judgemental, harsh, and or extreme view point I think a review of the state of our planet and agricultural system is in order. I take my role as a witch in service to this planet SERIOUSLY! Especially now because our treatment of our earth is completely out of balance. Ellen mentions next to nothing of the pressing matters facing us and how our gardening can be a force of good or harm!My second issue with the book and author, while rather unimportant, is no less annoying. Her approach to ritual and the use of decoration is CHEEZY! Kitchy halloween cloth and silly scarecrows are not my thing. I'm writing this for anyone that may feel as I do. Save your money and if it IS your thing more power to you. I'm very grateful this only cost me a trip to the library."},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"I thought this book was a fun read! It had a lot of info on several topics related to garden witchery and the author is rather funny. I would have liked the book to have more depth, go more into detail rather than tell me I have to go find that info myself at the library&gt;&gt; !It was a little fluffy for my liking, but that did keep the feel of the book non-intimidating. Good section on Faeries. Good personal stories. Great suggestions for planting magickal gardens. Overall I enjoyed it and refered to it while planting my own Witch Garden!"},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"I really enjoy Ellen Dugan's style of writing. It reminds me of talking over the rose hedge to my next-door neighbor (who just happens to be a witch like me), getting advice on all things magical. Using what I learned from this book, I created a beautiful new perrinial garden in the front of my home this spring. In addition to being beautiful, it is also an abundant supply of magical herbs and flowers that I already use in my celebration of the Lord and Lady. No more expensive trips to the cheesy witch store to get herbs! I recommend this book for the beginning garden witch as well as the more advanced practitioner. It is entertaining and informative on magical gardening as well as flower folklore and the language of tussy-mussies. Before this book, I didnt know what a tussie-mussy was. Now I love to give them to family and friends!"},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"If you come across an old spell calling for bat wings...what is it really asking for? If you don't know, then this book is for you!Garden Witchery is a jewel! I would recommend it to any pagan who loves nature and is drawn to digging in the dirt.It is practical and full of useful information. Especially meaningful to me is the way it explains how to design your sacred garden space and what planting material to consider. I especially enjoyed the careful way the author tied together how to use magical plants in the proper phase of the moon, as well as the most opportune day of the week in order to enhance success.This book is enjoyable to read. The author's warm and friendly writing style and the glimpses she provides into her magical home life, makes for a fun, relaxing reading experience.Garden Witchery definately rates a place of honor in my magical reference library."},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"Garden Witchery is a great how to do it book. The authors Humor carries the Book. Her antecdotal style both makes you think and laugh out loud.

Sadly, the last place I felt that was at my grandmother's (250miles away) and wasn't sure I could re-create that. Well, this book showed me how! I had a lot of questions answered in this book and most definetly will be getting her other books.The book is easy to read, makes a LOT of sense and can be just the thing that us gardenless witches need to get a jump start back on track. I also highly recommend her book, Cottage Witchery - another excellent read and again, such a helpful book!Honestly - if you have an inkling that you're magick lies in the garden or the hearth, but you've never practiced in a place like that I very much getting this book and reading through it. It can help you find the best place for you!"},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"This was my first book I had ever read on wicca and I was so relieved that Ellen Dugan didn't try to gussy it up like some know it all.It felt so down to earth, as if a friend was just chatting with me. At first I attempted to highlight the key ponits,definitions,etc. but ended up draining my highlighter because almost the whole book was neon yellow by the time I finished! In all I adore this book, it is my favorite, and I use it like a manual.Her soul is reflected in all her words and her passion for this \\"natural way\\" is absolutely lovely!"},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"Garden Witchery brings fun back into the garden chores. Ellen Dugan, Master Gardener and witch has written a manual to delight anyone. Dugan writes as if she were speaking to you while wandering though her own garden. This book is extremely practical and fun to read. The stories and wisdom on her own gardening experiences sprinkled throughout the book help to illustrate and remind the reader that gardening is a process and mistakes happen. There aren't many pictures in the book but it does contain some decorative illustrations and charts. As a new homeowner with a yard waiting to be sculpted, Garden Witchery got me excited about planting and making my gardens magickal.The book opens with gardening basics. While she lives down south, Dugan presents her gardening wisdom as generically as possible. This section includes a copy of the US Hardiness Zones chart that explains how to pick the best plants according to the weather. Some might find such practicality odd to include in a pagan-themed book. But Dugan points out that gardening and planting is fun and very magickal. She shows readers how to plan their garden, select plants and which ones to avoid. Plants, flowers, herbs and trees are discussed equally in the book. She explains that a magickal garden doesn't need to include exotic and expensive flowers, or flowers that aren't native to the area. Instead she invites the reader to look outside and within their local area to see what it has to offer their magickal gardens.She includes a chapter devoted to different types of gardens that focus magickal energy into different intentions. Shade gardens, cottage gardens, moon gardens, faerie gardens and more. Dugan makes each garden magickal by listing a \\"witches dozen\\" listing of plants one can add to their garden. She also gives spell and ritual suggestions for each garden. The plants in Garden Witchery are chosen for their \\"witchyness\\" as well as their ease to plant, locate and grow. Like the circle of life, Dugan teaches that with garden magick, everything is interconnected. The magick represented in this book connects and grows from one another.Dugan starts imbedding her magickal knowledge by sharing her ideas on planting correspondences tables. She believes that the seasons, time of day and the day you choose to plant something affects the plants, their blooms, and the magick you can draw from them. Then she relates all those correspondences back to the lists of plants and trees the book contains. The spells, rituals, simples and other crafty examples all draw from the plants she includes in the book. The book includes an entire chapter written about the art of florigraphy (the meaning of flowers) and flower lore. Then she ties the magick back into a whole garden by giving the reader ideas on how to construct their own Garden Book of Shadows and spells.The book ends with a garden journal for the reader to record his or her own thoughts. However, I found that it's not the end of what the book has to teach. After having read this book I found that I became more knowledgeable and aware of the soil my yard has. I also know more about what plants I do currently own and can get to incorporate into my spells and rituals. Garden Witchery helped me see the value and fun in planting and keeping gardens."},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"As a beginner, I found this book informative and enjoyable.It was easy for me to understand and i came away with wonderful ideas for my small Magikal Garden.I now also understand why I feel so good in my small Garden space!!!Chalice"},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"dugan's book is a basic, broad collection of practical gardening tips, lore and herbal/garden magic. i found it fairly helpful, since i'm new to the realm of magic, in coordinating gardening practices and magical ones. however, i'm not new to gardening and would recommend that those who are new acquire books that deal specifically with gardening, whether on veggies, herbs, fruit trees, etc. one thing that i appreciated was that the lists of common herbs, flowers, and trees for her area (missiouri) corresponded quite nicely to my area's native plants, with a few exceptions. i must admit that although i am still searching for that &quot;perfect&quot; herb/garden book filled with practical tips, regional lore and magical hints, dugan's book has helped pacify my craving for now."},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"I haven't gotten all the way thru this book yet, but I have to say that so far I like it. The main thing I like is that it's not boring! I like the author's way of writing and the book just has a magical feel to it. Makes me want to make something more of my garden and yard. Yes, it's from Llewllyn (sp?), but don't let that discourage you. If you're well practiced, it's old hat for you and is a nice refresher. If you're new to it, it's pretty entertaining.

It is very distracting."},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"I honestly adored this book! The only reason I docked a star was that I expected more spells.

This recent purchase was for my daughgter and she is very happy with it."},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"I spent a lot of time carefully picking my selection of books and glad this is one of them. This is a great introduction book for those looking to expand their knowledge on magical plants and herbs. Along with a lot of starter information on planting with the moon cycles and the properties of each plant.Dugan also gives a lot of information to help the reader find where to expand upon the knowledge gained from this book which I thought was a terrific help. The writing style is friendly and easy to follow, I read this book in a day as I could not put it down.I love that she injects a lot of her own personal experiences and personality into her writing rather than feeling as though you're reading a textbook. I feel her personal experiences really helped put things into perspective beyond belief and taught me a lot.Each section of course is a little limited, but she is trying to put a very large amount of information into the book for a vast area of subjects so only being able to put what she can makes sense. But I feel it is great for those who are new and a good read for the more experienced. Dugan always supplies a lot of crafty ideas on things to make also.All-in-all I would suggest this book, even if you know everything in it it is great to just hear some of her stories and wisdom."},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"This was my first introduction into the world of Ellen Dugan and a pleasant surprise. I was excited to find a book that combined my love of gardening and my growing curiosity of Wicca or the Pagan lifestyle. Ms. Dugan writes in a simplistic manner that is very easy to follow. She includes humor, folklore, and shares her experiences, thus making for an enjoyable read. I also find myself using this book as a reference of sort. She includes items such a flower correspondence, spells, rituals, and creating an environment. This book has suggestions for everyone!You may be surprised...you may have a new sparkle ~*~ when working out in your garden!I would recommend this book for the new, emerging, and curious reader. Someone with an open mind and who can appreciate all that nature has to offer. Take a stroll down the garden path and create a little magick of your own.Enjoy..."},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"Ellen Dugan holds \`Master Gardener' status through the University of Missouri and according to her bio has many years of nursery and gardening experience. She is also clairvoyant and a witch with a sense of humor. As she is raising three teenagers all these skills are useful.Dugan's book is a \\"user-friendly\\" introduction and guide to witchcraft. GARDEN WITCHERY is also a great resource for mothers and aunts and anyone else interested in fun-filled ideas for creating special gardens, places for divination and spell casting, Sabat holiday decor, and other pagan treats that can be enjoyed by adults and children alike. Many of her suggestions, such as dying Easter Eggs with red cabbage leaves, can be found elsewhere, but Dugan is a practical witch and suggests it is not un-witchlike to buy Easter Egg dye. She uses natural materials at hand for many of her projects, but she recommends craft stores and yard sales as great places to stock up on supplies such as orange lights for Samhain or plastic colored eggs for Ostara.Dugan not only provides the instructions for making and using many scented items, she includes some suggestions for growing the ingredients-although this is not a gardening book per se. I grow many of the herbs she recommends, and can testify it isn't hard to maintain pots of lavender, scented geraniums, and other plants on a patio, porch, or balcony-as long as you have adequate sun and remember to water them occasionally. And, it is extremely rewarding to make sachets and other scented items with plant material you grew yourself. If you intend to use Dugan's recipes and want to grow your own ingredients, however, buy a good gardening book such as Rodale's ENCYCLOPEDIA OF HERBS which includes detailed information about the cultivation and uses of herbs (as well as how to grow them organically AND when they are noxious!!).Although Dugan has many nifty ideas about gardening, the one concern I have concerning her advice is her recommended use of pesticides. This is quite ironic as she lists \\"eagle watching\\" as a fall pastime her family enjoys. If you can skip the poisons (some witches do use them) and stick to her other suggestions, this is a nifty source for many child-centered or adult \\"fun\\" activities."},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"Ellen Dugan has written a very entertaining book, but I wouldn't suggest it as something to garden by. She leaves out some very important information on the plants she suggests. An example would be her recommendations for shade gardening, while the plants she list will indeed grow in shade, she neglects to mention the soil conditions required for those plants. Shaded areas can vary from bone dry to boggy and if you plant a fern or cardinal flower in a bone dry area failure is certain unless you plan to water constantly to keep the area moist. The other concern is that some of the plants that she recommends are highly invasive, mints (which should always be container grown!!), ivy, morning glories and periwinkle! These plants can over take entire gardens in a short amount of time. Check with your local master gardeners to be sure that these plants aren't listed in the noxious weeds list in your area. If you are going to follow her suggestions make certain that you research the plants that you choose, nothing is more disappointing then buying new plants and then killing them by accident!"},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"They say life began in a garden and so it did for me one day - I love gardening so much and to find a book like this pulls together a number of things I love to leartn about and play with. One of the things I love about this book is that its such a fun, easy read. There are quotes from the likes of Milton, Seton, Shakespeare, Wolfe, and lots of authors I'm not familiar with but who came up with some really neat lines. There's a section on moon gardening - something I've been planning to do and bought some additional books on. There's flower folklore which is always fun. There's a section on celebrations for the seasons, as well as a section on crafts (like making dream pillows, charm bags, etc.) For those new to gardening there are zone mapstips on planting certain plants (like trees), lists of magical plants &amp; trees, flowers of the month (e.g. January is the month of the carnation - bestows energy &amp; healing). Its just a really full, fun book that captivated me and inspire me to get rid-of more of the lawn and plant more gardens (using native plants of course :)"},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"Dugan's book is fine...but just fine. She draws a lot from Cunningham. I bought this book though for help in the basics, the how-tos, which I thought she would cover. She didn't. She uses terms like mulching and deadheading without ever defining them or saying *how* to do them. Instead she spends a lot of time or correspondences and the practical witchery aspects of gardening. She also talks about crafts and craft projects, which was a real plus for me."},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"This marvellous book is an instruction manual on how to create your own enchanted garden with trees, shrubs or flowers. It's not all airy-fairy stuff though, as it also deals with very practical matters like cold hardiness zones and soil requirements.In many ways the book provides delightful reading on the magical meaning of plants based on their shapes, fragrances and colours, plus sound advice on designing, maintaining and planning different kinds of enchanted spaces including shade, container, tree, shrub, groundcover, houseplant and fairy gardens.The text is interspersed with charming floral and herbal spells, faerie magick and information on feast days and the making of sachets, wreaths and charm bags. You'll be amazed at the wealth of practical applications and flower spells that are available to make life more interesting.Garden Witchery is an enchanting read as it takes one from practical gardening advice through magickal correspondences and flower folklore to the author's humorous observations and anecdotes. The book contains lovely illustrations and concludes with a glossary of terms, a bibliography and an index."},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"I also would like to disagree with the reader from Jersey who completely slammed Garden Witchery. As a gardener with a couple years experience, I found this book to be quite useful. This book includes help/ideas on how to plan a garden, it goes over the different types of gardens, has info on pH levels in soil, fertilization, how to take care of your garden (i.e. pruning, dead-heading, etc.) and also includes fun &quot;magical&quot; correspondences to plants, flowers and trees. If you love to garden, you will enjoy this book, even if you're not into the whole &quot;magical&quot; aspect of it all. Even then, that information is at least fun and interesting to read.

Read the book- you'll see..."},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"Ellen Dugan really proves her stuff, meaning she is the best kept secret in Llewellyn's mostly pretentious list of authors! She is the Garden Witch, like myself. I have been practicing since my Scott Cunningham days in the late 1980s. Ellen is the only author who can follw in his footsteps.This book covers all the basics and assumes we should have a little experience. This is fine with me. Indeed, it as if Ellenknew my grandmother and her friends with many of these hints. I use pesticides according to experience. this is only common sense.Her theme gardens are wonderful and I have a few in my yard. This year, I am trying my first pumpkin garden. What an idea.The list of her shade garden plants are right on the money. The Craft section redefines Witch-craft for me. She is great with this section.The only problem with the book is the language she uses. This is fine for high school students. I hope many of them begin to work the garden at an early age. It is a lifetime reward. I am happy with Ellen's honesty here."},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"To repeat what others have said, this is a fun and informative book on how to continue your magickal self out to your yard. I love the tips on how to do discreet, subtle things (like knowing someone it the neighborhood is a witch because they plant red geraniums or red begonias in circles around their trees and in window boxes)as much as the larger, more obvious tricks.The Author has a GREAT sense of humor and it seems like she is writing just for me.I only wish their were pictures. Next book maybe??You will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"I had to post this review after seeing the latest one from &quot;The Reader&quot; in Jersey. I totally disagree with you on this book. It was wonderful! I thought that Garden Witchery had plenty of solid and practical magical gardening information. It is light, funny and I learned quite a bit from this book.As a gardener for more than 20 years, I found the information that was presented to be useful for both ordinary, and magical gardeners. This is a thorough gardening book that even discusses cold hardiness zones, soil and shade requirements. The chapter on the faeries was great and I really enjoyed the tips, tricks and plant recomendations. The gardening journal is a nice bonus.If you are looking for a fun, clever and magical book to read this summer, this would be the one to try."},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"Written in a friendly down to earth (no pun intended) style, this book contains gardening advice from both a practical and witchy perspective (with the emphasis on gardening). It includes detailed information on what kinds of plants do best in sun or shade, with the focus being on those that a witch would use most (moonlight gardens too). Tying into this are chapters on flower, tree and grown cover magick.The chapters on flower folklore, faery magick and specialty gardens are \\"good to knows\\", especially for green witches. Those on the Esbats and Sabbats contain something for any witch interested in working with their gardens and what they produce during these times."},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"Garden Witchery is the perfect companion book for any gardener looking to infuse a little of themselves with Mother Nature.

I will be using a lot of her thoughts and planning when I am crafting my garden this year."},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"We have recommended this book to our congregation for use by beginners. Ellen Dugan has not only included a wealth of information regarding plants and gardens, she has also included all the wiccan holidays, suggestions for celebrating at home, color, day-of-the-week and planetary associations and a guide to learning that is easily understood by the beginner.It is not necessary to read this book cover-to-cover, although that is also enjoyable for people who have the time to do so. The book is very well indexed, and individual subjects can be looked up from the back of the book very easily. The way the book is organized makes it quick and easy to find the basics on most topics of interest to the beginner, and also to well seasoned Pagan worshippers.Her writing style is entertaining, and her ethics are exemplary. This is a highly recommended book for people just starting out, and a really nice addition to an existing library. I hope that, when members of our congregation go shopping for a basic manual about holidays and practices that can be done easily and safely from home, this is the book they consider bringing home instead of purchasing some of the more difficult or unethical books on the market."},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"I loved this book and reread various parts often.

Cottage Witchery is also great."},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"I am not a witch - though some have said..well, never mind. I buy all of Dugan's books. I don't practice the spells or charms but I enjoy reading about them AND I am a gardener. This book gives valuable information about planting at certain times, where to plant, what to plant - how to decorate your garden to enjoy it. This book is a charm - and so is Ms. Dugan. She's a fun writer and a wonderful addition to my garden book shelf."},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"I was given this book by a friend and even though I don't have a knack for gardening, I did enjoy this book. As a resource book for the craft of garden witchery (or hedge and green witchery) this book is an excellent source. Dugan writes as if she is ssitting across the table from her readers, drinking a cup of herbal tea and simply explaining what it is she does and how others can do the same.As a gardening book, this may not be the best source and certainly not the onle source, I recommend any gardener has a basic gardening book or know-how prior to using the information here. But, it is not really meant to be the only gardening book you will ever need but more of as a supplement. this book will explain how and why to choose certain plants/herbs for your garden, what can be done with those, and gives a very decent outlook on this craft/path. For someone who is trying to find their path, this book can be used as an educational tool into what garden/hedge witchery is all about.Her spells and rituals are simple and can be adapted into any belief system and she explains things in a manner that new practitioners can understand and yet long-time practitioners will still find something new and useful in Dugan's book.It is a favorite part of my magickal library and for anyone interested in gardening as part of their magickal or spiritual practices I do recommend it."},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"I just love this book. It has tons of info on when/where to plant along with why and how. She lists planterary info so you can plant by the Moon and Planets and on what days of the week. I like her sense of humor and the tone of her book. This has been a book I've just been able to sit down and read for an hour or more at a time and still want more. This book was well worth the price and I am very happy I bought it!!!"},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"When I recieved my copy of Ellen Dugans Garden Witchery, I was impressed because it was so beautiful, as I thumbed through it, I couldn\`t put it on the shelf. After reading it, I can tell you not only is this a lovely book, but this little gem is just full of lots of information on plants, flowers, magickal correspondences, and specialty gardens for the magickal practitioner. She inspires the reader to create a sacred space close to nature and commune with the spirits of magickal plants. This is getting back to why many people practice nature religions like Wicca and other forms of Paganism, reverence for the earth and nature!This book was a very refreshing escape from all the 101 books out there, although, I could see it being enjoyed by Witches and non Witches alike. All that is required is a love of nature, and an open mind. It seamlessly combines practical gardening informtion with magickal advice on when to plant, gardening with the cycles of the earth and moon, how to invite blessings into the garden, and more. Ellen Dugans warm and friendly writing style makes this book a joy to read and I even found myself snickering out loud at points. Mrs. Dugan even shares with us information about the language of flowers that she unearthed in a book from 1845! It is a treasure trove of Natural Magick, including practical spells, and Garden Witch crafts like dream pillows and charm bags.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves Magick or gardening. I am now planning new additions to my gardens for the spring based on suggestions in Garden Witchery."},{"Title":"Garden Witchery: Magick from the Ground Up","review":"I was very excited when I found this book. Gardening and Wicca - what could be better!?! Obviously, quite a bit could be better. I was very, very disappointed and quite honestly very disturbed that a self-proclaimed practicing witch condones the use of pesticides and chemicals. Excuse me, but what happened to &quot;HARM NONE&quot;? Anyone with an elementary knowledge of nature knows that any chemicals and pesticides used in the garden kill bees (an extremely vital link in our ecological chain), not to mention other beneficial insects. After one season of being plagued with squash beetles, she gave up and used chemicals!?!? What does that teach anyone? If you truly want to be in balance with nature, you must be a purist or at the very least practicing organic methods (beware some organic products harm bees too). There are ways to save your crops and not damage the environment. The great wise women and men of old didn't have Miracle-Gro and bug spray. Please. They learned to live in balance with nature and let nature help them."},{"Title":"Powderhouse: Scientific Postscript and Last Protocol","review":"POWDERHOUSE is the second installment of Bjorneboe's trilogy, generally known as \\"The History of Bestiality.\\" The narrator is a \\"renovation worker\\"--i.e., \\"sanitation engineer\\"--at an asylum for the criminally insane in the south of France. The institution occupies the buildings of La Poudriere, a former munitions depot with a stone tower (the powderhouse), which is surrounded by a large park; the renovation worker occupies one of the outlying peasant cottages and has a delightful little sunlit garden. Here he rests from his daily chores, eating simple but satisfying meals, drinking a variety of wines, entertaining guests, sometimes smoking hashish, sometimes taking a hit of LSD, sometimes enjoying the embraces of a little brown nurse and every night feeding a friendly hedgehog. His chief occupation after cleaning the grounds is writing The History of Bestiality, and his discussions with visitors deal either with this theme or with the doings of madmen. Nevertheless, the halcyon air of the garden lends a pastoral atmosphere to the proceedings, an idyllic enchantment to recitations of the most zealous campaigns of carnage in history. Thus paradise, realized here and now, is contrasted with the hell that has become the wide earth, and the reading is oddly both horrifying and delightful at the same time.Bjorneboe gives more attention to form in this novel. He draws a series of colorful characters with independent roles, creates a bit of a murder mystery and devises a mechanism for the insertion of factual horrors: Dr. Lefevre, the chief of staff, believes that it is good therapy for residents of the Powderhouse to deliver and hear lectures on themes that disturb them. Thus three long lectures are laid out in chronological order and provide a solid structure to the six-chapter novel, leaving no gaps, expanses of uncertain time or cessation of forward movement as in MOMENT OF FREEDOM.The centerpiece is the second lecture, delivered by an inmate named Lacroix. It has no title, but might be called \\"Sympathy for the Executioner.\\" Speaking from experience, Lacroix reminds his audience that executioners carry out the will of society; they are hired for their \\"special qualifications,\\" paid with taxpayer money and approved for their performance. They execute criminals legally condemned to death by a court, yet they are shunned and despised by society. He then bemoans the difficulty of killing people neatly, especially when they turn to the executioner and ask for a speedy dispatch. Each method of execution designed to be merciful, such as long-drop hangings, beheadings and firing squads, proves to be unreliable, so that the executed may struggle to live for a long time. For the executioner these experiences are ultimately debilitating; the profession brings physical and mental illnesses and often leads to suicide. Although approved by society, the executioner bears the blood of the human race and stands guilty before humanity and before God; but who, Lacroix cries out in despair, who thinks of him?The speech is nothing less than a masterpiece of world literature, as piercing in its humor as Voltaire's CANDIDE (1759) and as consistent in its wrong logic as Desiderius Erasmus' IN PRAISE OF FOLLY (1511). It takes the reader into an extreme reach of black humor which passes beyond definition--something way over the top, revoltingly gruesome and wildly hilarious and close to the quick at the same time. After this, the novel tends to get preachy, yet it deserves to be read for its entrancing mood and its flashes of bitter genius. Once again, the work is beautifully translated by Esther Greenleaf Murer."},{"Title":"Powderhouse: Scientific Postscript and Last Protocol","review":"I read this book in my early teens, and it made an enormous impression on me. This is the first book in the trilogy &quot;History of bestiality&quot; I read, I have also read the last two. This is painful book to read! Many times I wanted to throw away the book, and forget that all this pain, madness and evil existed, but I couldn't. In many ways I think it changed the way I saw the world. This is book is meant for a more grown up public than I was when I first read it."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"Fielding's basic concept is describing 'manners, not men.'His main characters are two paragons of chastity (Joseph and his girlfriend Fanny) and a model Christian (parson Abraham Adams).During their tumultuous itinerary, they are confronted with vanity, avarice, envy, ambition, ingratitude, selfishness, intolerance, venality, hate, lust, folly, malice, deceit, rage and all this behind a veil of hypocrisy (Do as I say, not as I do): 'Lord, it is true I never obeyed one of thy commandments, yet punish me not, for I believe them all.'The overall mentality is calvinist fatalism: 'We must submit to Providence', and 'no accident happens to us without the Divine permission ... the same power which made us, rules over us, and we are absolutely at his disposal, he may do with us what he pleases, nor have we any right to complain.'There is also a Malthusian accent: 'he shall not settle here, and bring a nest of beggars into the parish.'Christianity is only a tiny film of varnish: 'that it was possible in a country professing Christianity, for a wretch to starve in the midst of his fellow-creatures who abounded.'Socially, the few wealthy rule over the many poor. 'The worst consequence of poverty is dependence on the great.'Another characteristic is the blatant misogyny, through its picture of the lewdness and vulgarity of women (in sharp contrast with Fanny's manners): 'I am no meat for a footman.'This rich, lively, fresh and satirical text contains anti-novel sparks and many modern ingredients ('a set of jolly companions ... Their best conversation was nothing but noise.')But the novel as a whole is loosely built (no real plot) and sometimes too scholarly and boring. It ends in a pure Menander-style.Still, it is a worth-while read."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"As I first time reader of Fielding I found this book unexpectedly comical. In the same line as going to church to hear a boring old pastor and finding your self humoured throughout the sermon. The charactors keep their distance through the third person narrative which allows the reader to judge, pity and find in the case of Fanny and Joseph perfection which is annoyingly unreal.As for Parson Adams he well may be a saintly man but surely someone other than myself finds his lack of tact, condenscending tone and total innocence extremely irritating."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"This book actually pokes on Henry's contemporaries and describes series of events which will eventaully lead to a horrendous headache to be suffered by the reader. On the other hand, Fielding's Tom Jones is a delight and mustn't be missed at any cost! This book is a total waste, though!"},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"This is an incredible book about real friendship,chastity and honesty written in the most humorous fashion.Fielding brings out the true values of friendship beteween Parson Adams and Joseph and true love between the latter and Funny.He points out the sad but true &quot;false&quot; nature of the upper class and brings out questions about real life.I like this book because it encourages chastity and esteems honesty."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"The prize of this novel is the ability of the author to actually poke fun at his own readers...Fielding encourages us to stop, take a break at each short chapter; at some points he even laments that certain passages aren't worth reading, and just skipping over them would lose nothing in the reader's understanding of the content. This of course, works for us in that it makes us more prone to envelop ourselves in every chapter, following the always clumsy journey and comic circumstance of Parson Adams and Joseph Andrews. The journey from country to city is a prevalent theme in the novel, and through these distinctions, we are able to pinpoint the nuanced comedy Fielding finds in living in his own time period. To understand this you must put yourself inside of the 18th century, and more helpful would be to read the novel that this book is a parody of, \\"Pamela\\". Fielding challenges the notions of love and chastity in his time in a hysterical way; that is, if you can follow the winding text and dated grammar....But what a great book. Really."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"Second only to Voltaire'sCandide: Or Optimism (Penguin Classics), Henry Fielding's Joseph Andrews is the funniest, most intelligent, satirical commentary I've ever read. Actually, let's get rid of the qualifiers, Joseph Andrews is one of the two funniest books I've ever read. (I first read it in college and it introduced me to the idea that important old books could also be highly entertaining, interesting, and illuminating.)The book was first published in 1742 under the title \\"The History of the Adventures of Joseph Andrews, and of His Friend Mr. Abraham Adams\\" to some controversy. Fielding did not hesitate to poke merciless fun at just about everything 'respectable': religion, the law, lords and ladies, and sexual mores. Fielding attacked the moral hypocrisy of Joseph Richardson's popularPamela: Or Virtue Rewarded (Oxford World's Classics). (Fielding also wrote a short work, Shamela, that was a direct response to Pamela. Shamela is often sold together with Joseph Andrews See e.g.,Joseph Andrews and Shamela (Penguin Classics).) Pamela created a huge literary controversy; Shamela and Joseph Andrews were just two of many mocking responses, although few others survive (see, e.g.Anti-Pamela and Shamela).Joseph (who is Pamela's brother!) is a genial but nave rustic and a footman in the service of Lady Booby (wink, wink, nudge, nudge). When Joseph rejects her very direct and bawdy advances, Lady Booby sends him packing. Joseph then begins walking home from London to the country to seek out (and marry) Fanny Goodwill, his lifelong sweetheart. Along the way he meets his hometown friend the amiable and forgetful Parson Abraham Adams. Parson Adams is on his way to London to sell his sermons for publication. When Adams discovers he has forgotten to pack said sermons, he and Joseph decide to travel home together. The trip is the departure point for many adventures and mishaps that expose the society's hypocrisy and inequities. Along the way, the reader meets many colorful characters whose pretensions often land them in dire circumstances - furnishing much hilarity to us.Fielding purported to aim at nothing less the invention of a new literary form, the \\"comic epic-poem in prose\\". He says in his Preface, \\"it may not be improper to premise a few words concerning this kind of writing, which I do not remember to have seen hitherto attempted in our language.\\" Fielding, however, was also known to write 'serio-comic', ironic introductions to his works, so some caution is in order. Nonetheless, the Preface accurately describes his \\"comic epic-poem in prose\\" as \\"differing from comedy, as the serious epic from tragedy: its action being more extended and comprehensive; containing a much larger circle of incidents, and introducing a greater variety of characters. It differs from the serious romance in its fable and action, in this: that as in the one these are grave and solemn, so in the other they are light and ridiculous; it differs in its characters, by introducing persons of inferiour rank, and consequently of inferiour manners, whereas the grave romance sets the highest before us; lastly in its sentiments and diction; by preserving the ludicrous instead of the sublime.\\"Absolutely the highest possible recommendation."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"I bought this book for one of my literature classes at the beginning of the term (It was the last book on the syllabus) because it was only available online and no longer in printing production. The book arrived late compared to when it was supposed to arrive ( I live in OR and the book was coming from CA). Other than that, I was satisfied with my purchase overall."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"Henry Fielding has written a very funny novel that attacks the hypocrisy and vanity of the times (around 1740's London). Just about every character in the novel suffers from one or both of these traits. The barbs the author throws at these characters are often hilarious. His writing style is a treasure, and his sentence structure is overloaded (lots of commas, semicolons, dashes, etc. in his sentences). Furthermore, the author quite readily goes off on very long tangents.For example, the main characters Joseph Andrews, his friend Parson Adams, and Joseph's love Fanny, happen upon the home of a very noble gentleman. The book then goes and liberally describes the history of this man they met - which really has nothing to do with the novel (at least at the time it occurs). Now that I think about it, this wasn't an unnecessary tangent, as it has meaning at the very end of the novel.Nonetheless, there are many instances in the novel where the main character happen upon someone, or someplace, and all of the sudden we are fully thrust into this direction that takes us away from the simple journey of these characters. This stream of consciousness is seen in the later novels of Thomas Pynchon - and this is important to me as Pynchon is one of my favorite authors. As I read the novel, I really felt a strong presence of Pynchon's novel \\"Mason and Dixon\\".Now, Fielding writes in a very fluent, and complex dialogue which I found a little easier to read in a flowing way than I felt with Pynchon. His flowery wording perfectly describes scenes, people, and attitudes, and the laughs are much funnier with his writing style than if told straight up.Everyone is exposed as a hypocrite or quite vain, except for Joseph Andrews himself. It's evident that the author uses him as a paradigm for how to behave in this world. Parson Adams comes a close second, but even he suffers from some of the things he preaches against. Fanny doesn't really do much but look pretty and serves primarily as Joseph's love interest - although I believe the author indicates that she is very virtuous.The primary plot of the novel involves a journey by Joseph and Parson Adams, and the adventures they get into along the way. Near the end of the novel, it shifts focus to some elderly ladies who fancy Joseph to the degree that they lose all sense of propriety in trying to have him. Additionally, the supposed gentlemen of their relation desire to have Fanny. If I had to hazard a guess, I would say the author is indicating that the only people who are good enough for either Fanny or Joseph are Joseph and Fanny, as they seem to be the only ones lacking in either vanity or hypocrisy. Additionally, each of those two hold onto their virginity, waiting for their impending marriage (which is not a sure thing as the novel shows).The ending of the novel allows for what the author promises at the beginning of the novel, and that is in the realm of the ridiculous. This part of the novel - I don't want to say much - had to be the inspiration for some of our situational comedies of today.Please read this novel, if for no other reason, because it can be screamingly funny in parts - I laughed out loud in several places.As a last note, the themes addressed by Fielding are very relevant today, so this novel has a certain timelessness to it - but just know that it does occur in the 1740's, so there will be some things common to that time which are unusual to someone not acquainted with London in that time period. But the writing is so good and easy to understand, that I don't think it will be much of a problem."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"Henry Fielding wrote one of the great comic novels in Tom Jones. Joseph Andrews is similar in nature but falls far short of Fielding's, masterpiece. The book starts out well enough. A handsome, viral young man of low birth (Andrews) is placed in the family of Lord and Lady Booby. The mistress takes a fancy to Andrews and makes him her footman. Lord Booby dies and the lady tries to force her affections on poor Joseph. Being virtuous, as well as attractive to the opposite sex, he refuses her advances and is promptly dismissed. Joseph then sets out to London to meet his true love, Fanny, and along the way joins up with his mentor, Parson Adams, a kind of Don Quixote character complete with a stumbling horse. Before too long Fanny joins the retinue. A good start.But Fielding gets into trouble because he can't seem to make up his mind as to who his protagonist is. As Joseph begins his journey he is set upon by a group of robbers, beaten, and left naked in a ditch. A coach comes by and the passengers debate whether or not to save him. At last, persuaded that if they did not try they might be liable to be sued for his death they agree to take him up. But a \\"lady\\" riding inside the coach refuses to allow a naked man to be placed beside her. There then ensues a debate over who will give their coat to cover Joseph. This depiction is both humorous and a telling commentary of British values in the first half of the eighteenth century. But Andrews it seems is too staid and pure to be the target of the kind low slapstick comedy that Fielding has in mind, thus much of the remainder of the book focuses on the adventures and foibles of the good parson. Joseph is reduced to the role of defender of Fanny and the parson from various assaults on their person and character.Fielding also goes off on tangents such as the story of Leonora, Mr. Wilson's life history and the tale told by the parson's son toward the end of the book. Fielding's intent is to display some aspects of the social mores of the times, but these asides distract from the flow of the story. At the end of the book Mr. Wilson's history does, in fact, come to play an important part in the story, but the others are mere sidebars to the action. One interesting diversion does occur when Fielding, as an author talking directly to the reader, interjects into the story to provide a rationale for why books are divided into chapters.Finally, after a series of humorous and often outrageous adventures Joseph, Fanny and Parson Adams return home and face a new series of problems when Lady Booby re-enters the picture and continues her pursuit of Joseph. At his point other characters including Joseph's sister, Pamela and her husband, Mr. Booby (Lady Booby's nephew), a pedlar, an obsequious character, Beau Didapper who lusts after Fanny, the elder Mr. and Mrs. Andrews and finally Mr. and Mrs. Wilson add to the complications. This section of the book is filled with rollicking humor (including a wonderful scene where Parson Adams mistakes Mrs. Slipslop for a man and battles with her in bed and then wanders into Fanny's bed where he is discovered by Joseph), mystery, and problematic situations (including the possibility that Joseph and Fanny are really brother and sister!), until after a tortuous series of events all ends well with even Lady Booby finding love, or at least lust.I give the book four stars because it really is not on a par with the great comic novels. But it is a fun and enjoyable read. Joseph Andrews is a humorous book and Fielding provides a look at the foibles and character of various English types in his era. The book is well worth reading even though it falls short of the great pieces of satire and humorous literature."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"This is a fine work both to allow the reader insight into England in the 18th century away from court and cathedral, and to provide a peek into the early invention of the English novel.Fielding's characters paint a vivid picture of how well, or how poorly, people reside within their assigned class levels. Parson Adams, though often playing the naive fool, establishes an expectation of noble Christian behaviour against which Fielding's 'Canterbury Tale'-like characters can be measured. At the same time, Fielding uses Adams to allow the title character to evolve from the pure innocent, who falls into difficulty, to become resurrected as the fully realized, real-life hero.As a story of life among the lower and middle classes, this is a fine read. But I found the brilliant, excellent construction of this novel to be a real eye-opener as far as the development of the early novel is concerned."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"This book was assigned to me in my British Literature class for a book club. Shortly after being assigned this book, I quickly went out and began reading it. While Fielding's writing style does seem to run on a bit, his narrative wit and dialogue is enjoyable.I found myself liking the three main characters, Parson Adams in particular. He told some interesting stories, and has kind of an older brother relationship with Joesph, making him a good side character. The brief moments of action were pretty good in the story, as were the humorous bits. Its easy to see why this novel will go down as one a classic in literature."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"Henry Fielding wrote SHAMELA for the best of all reasons: he needed the money. The fact that Richardson's earlier PAMELA had been begging for burlesque in its absurdities and pretensions can be seen only as a contributory reason. In his preface, Fielding makes it clear that he has placed Richardson's heroine squarely in his sights. He attempts to expose \\"the many notorious Falsehoods and Misrepresentations of a Book called Pamela, Are exposed and refuted; and all of the matchless Arts of that young Politician, set in a true and just Light.\\" He makes it pretty clear that in the controversy as to whether Pamela's motivation for marrying the cad who tried mightily to seduce her are innocent or mercenary Fielding sees as the latter.Like PAMELA, SHAMELA is a novel (much briefer than PAMELA) written as letters. But in Fielding's hands, Shamela is seen as the master manipulator. Where Pamela faints whenever her Mr. B. grabs her, Shamela swoons too-but in coarse delight. With each passing episode, Fielding inverts the moral universe of Richardson so that when one considers Richardson's subtitle of PAMELA as \\"Virtue rewarded,\\" one now sees with crystal clarity that virtue does indeed earn a reward, but the virtue of Pamela and the virtue of Shamela are alike only in their spelling. I am glad that I read PAMELA first, for if I had come across SHAMELA first, I am pretty sure that I would have hooted and guffawed at a young innocent whose only crime was to follow on stage a deadly mimic."},{"Title":"Joseph Andrews","review":"I enjoyed Fielding's sense of humor, his appreciation of human foibles.

Deftly interweaving dense historical detail with keen close readings, Brown persuades us that the &quot;cultural fables&quot; she describes were key elements in the period's understanding of the massive changes of modernity. These fables include those of expansion, comprising the metropolis (in figures of sewers) and the notion of imperial fate (in figures of torrents and oceans; those of exchange, comprising finance (in the image of lady credit) and capitalism (in fables of a new world); and those of alterity (in the story of the native prince and of animals, figured as a means of commenting on and assimilating new worlds and peoples).

Readers will get the most out of these volumes if they take their time reading it and meditating on it. Some of the language and phrasing is hard and confusing to understand and some of the strong language is hard to swallow for sensitive Western Christianity.Though everyone seems to have an opinion of Calvin's theology, very few people have actually read anything he has written. As a Calvinist in my soteriology myself, I was surprised by the Institutes. Not surprised because I was disappointed but because I realized how wrong people are about Calvin and his thought.Here are some general observations about the book:1. Due to the contemporary discussion on Calvinism, Calvin has been accused of twisting Scripture to fit his soteriology. Though I am a Calvinist in my soteriology, I was surprised to see how much Calvin stuck to the text of Scripture in his discussion of salvation. Most of the time he quoted Scripture and then made some comments on it that were well within the perview of the text.2. Readers will note how much Calvin quotes Augustine which speaks to the continued impact Augustine's theology had on Christianity many centuries after his death.3. One obvious thread that runs throughout the book is how much Calvin's discussion is intentionally aimed against the Roman Catholic Church of his day. This is to be expected given that he was part of the Reformation. Given this, there may be many things that readers will have a hard time understanding if they are not familiar with Catholicism in general and the issues of the Reformation in particular.4. While much of the contemporary discussion on Calvin's theology is dominated by the issue of Calvinism, the Institutes are not dominated with election, predestination and the like. What the observant and careful reader will see is Calvin's unwavering focus on the glory of God and the magnificence of Christ.5. Some of the best sections of the Institutes are his discussion on salvation, Scripture, the Ten Commandments and the Lord's Supper (even if you disagree with his view of it).I recommend the Institutes for all Christians to read at least once in their life."},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":"John Calvin's timeless work still speaks to us today about issues that are important to any Bible reader... who is God? How do we know Him? What is wrong with the world? What is God's solution? Calvin writes with a unique eye on the glory and joy of God as the ultimate purpose for which all things were created. While many Christian books focus on God from a human-centric perspective, the Institutes wake us up to a sobering but more satisfying reality: In order to know ourselves, we must know God as He reveals Himself to us in the Bible and nature."},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":"This is a timeless classic that is a must read (study) for any believer that seeks to really \\"know\\" God. John Calvin is widely acknowledged to be \\"The Theologian\\" and for good reason. Calvin possessed a very deep understanding of the human condition (nature) along with an even deeper understanding of God as revealed in Scripture. He packs an awful lot of deep thinking and understanding into an economy of words. After a reading session, I often would give a summary to my wife regarding what I had read. Several times she remarked that someone should write a concise, abridged version of this work. It is simply not possible. Virtually nothing can be eliminated and any attempt to do so would be a grave injustice to this work. Personally, I found that it was best to read this material slowly and typically covered only about 10 pages per day. This is not baby's milk, its meat and needs to be treated as such. If you are accustomed to simple, candy-coated, modern interpretation and exegeses, you might be in for a shock, so take it slow. This work will vastly increase your knowledge, understanding, and faith. Over the years, I've read many excellent works, including Charles Hodge's \\"Systematic Theology.\\" Nothing I have ever read compares to this. Simply put, I cannot recommend Calvin's \\"Institutes\\" enough!"},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":"Calvin was a thinker and a man of God. He wrote very much and often very helpfully. His commentaries are deliberate and his sermons are surprisingly (perhaps unsurprisingly when you think about it?) warm and often full of challenging spirit-given heralding of the truth. His Institutes are no less, although this translation is not as good as the 19th C Beveridge translation which can be found online and contains a noticeable bias in translation when compared side-by-side, to make Calvin say things sometimes in English he did not in the original.Nevertheless, there is much here in this printing also than can be read with great profit as a readily accessible book version. As a systematic theology it does a good job and it is highly recommended for every student of the Scriptures. However, Calvin didn't invent his theology, as is often mistakenly spoken. He perhaps in this book laid it out more systematically than others before him had, but it was there all along and believed all along by the Church. Calvin was only used of God to gather it in a more condensed form together, and even then it is only an aid by way of condensed reference to what the Scriptures themselves say clearly.It is worth noting as is inescapably the case that Calvin was a man of his times. Some things that related to the so-called Church of his day are either not as relevant or as the true Church has grown and been more clearly discernible, are not the focal concerns - especially with relation to the state. That being said, what he does say is thought-provoking even on that subject.W."},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":"I have been reading through this edition of the Institutes for a little over seven months with the goal to finish it within a year.

The 2 Vol set gives insight into Calvin's mind, which was moved by a passion for his belief system and a sometimes misguided anger to those who had a different view point. The reformed movement suffered from a lack of compassion, which often erupted in physical violence and murder. Calvin's fervor was undeniable and so was his rather cold sense of logic.

The main intellectual architect of the Protestant Reformation, his influence casts a shadow over everything from the Wars of Religion to the English Civil War, to the bitter split in Western Christendom between the Catholic Church and Protestantism, which continues today.However contemporaries describe Calvin as a fairly meek and mild figure; prone to poor health and fits of coughing, Calvin died at a fairly early age by modern standards. Yet during this time he was remarkably productive, producing his brilliant magnum opus 'The Institutes of Christian Religion', his commentaries on the Bible, creeds and catechisms, as well as taking a very active life in the form of both theologian and public administrator.Calvin's controversy comes from a certain part of his systematic theology, predestination. The logic of predestination is this; if God is omnipotent and omniescent, it is a logical necesscity that God forsaw the fall of Adam and Eve and of all of humanity. Since the Bible seems to indicate only those in Jesus Christ will be saved, it seems God has pre-destined most of humanity to eternal damnation to hell for original sin, even before they are born.Predestination in fact does not form the central focus of Calvin's theology itself, at least as much as it did in later Calvinists. However Calvin simply felt he was returning to the theology of Augustine, which he felt (asides from the unhealthy influence of Platonism and Manicheiasm on his thought) largely got Christian theology correct. Similar positions to Calvin can also be found particularly in St Anselm and also in Jansen, before the Reformation.Whatever the role of predestination, Calvin aimed to produce a new systematic theology which was truer to the Bible than corrupt scholastic Catholicism had been, in much the same spirit as Luther, though Calvin is more logical and systematic than Luther, having recieved a far better liberal education in the form of his humanistic studies and Law background. He is also an excellent biblical exegete, and one of the first modern exegetes who pays close attention to the original Hebrew of the text and its literal meaning, something neglected since the time of Origen and St Jerome. It is no doubt in the spirit of Calvin that Protestantism produces some of the greatest bible scholars and commentators who healthily remind other Christians to pay close attention to the Bible and its context, before wandering off into other roads.Yet I also feel Calvin's legacy has some great weaknesses; his attachment to Augustine's rigid predestination is hard to defend when now we know the majority of the world's peoples don't know or never knew Christ at all, and that many religions have very different concepts of God or reality than the Christian one. His instances of religious intolerance and bigotry, particularly towards Catholics, and his brutal heartlesseness towards the 'heretic' Michael Servetus (noted with particular disgust by the Protestant historian Edward Gibbon) in allowing him to be executed, are certainly not in my view exemplars of behaviour to be allowed in society today. He was also in many ways blind to the beauty and power of Philosophy, seeing that humanity was hopelessly lost and corrupt in ignorance outside of what revelation could teach, a position I find hard to accept given the remarkable progress the human mind has made in understanding our own nature and that of the universe.Despite these reservations, Calvin is a brilliant mind who sheds much new light on Christian theology and is a pivotal figure during the time of the Reformation, and cannot be ignored by any student of this period of history."},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":". . .because I am not a Calvinist!HOWEVER, there is no denying that John Calvin was one of the greatest theological thinkers of all time, regardless of whether one accepts his views. Certainly, among Protestantism, his work represents the first, and until Karl Barth's &quot;Church Dogmatics&quot;, the greatest attempt at Systematic Theology in the Reform Protestant tradition. His work gave legitimate academic and philosophical credibility to the Reformation.His &quot;Institutes&quot; deserve a place in the library of every theologian, regardless of denominational affiliation or level of agreement. It's too important an historical resource to be without."},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":"Please find hereby a small bucket (or large glass) of lukewarm (Rev 3) and fog-dispensing water to cast upon this Calvin lovefest. I come not to praise Calvin but to bury him (for those who think this man carried off as Elijah never seeing death).It cannot be doubted that our Jean Cauvin was mightily used by our gracious and sovereign God in the furtherance of many aspects of His Kingdom, including, perhaps most fundamentally, a renewed and disciplined return to the scriptures as the comprehensive foundation of our theology. For this, young Jean (he was approx. 27 when he published the 1st edition) deserves our unqualified commendations and a warm place in our collective hearts.But taken for all and all, Calvin (Cauvin, fr.)was yet a man, and as all men, full of deceit, compromised motives, and sinful conduct. Although our Cal's theology was gloriously used to overthrow tyranny and despotism throught the Occident (the English and American revolutions as but two examples), in Cal's own Geneve their was only an increase of Caesar's power of coersion over the church, family and individual, all under Cal's approving eye (or willing arm, e.g. Servetus).In summary, Calvin of Geneve was indisputably a petty tyrant who, by mistaking his every opinion for the equivalent of God's Holy Word, suffered no other opinion of theological, ecclesiastical or political import to exist free from his virulent persecution. Sadly, this aspect of Calvin's arrogance is found througout his Institutes. Calvin habitually refers to any who express a different interpretation of a passage or doctrine as &quot;virulent dogs,&quot; &quot;pigs,&quot; &quot;swine,&quot; and most fouly &quot;enemies of God's grace.&quot; Calvin's incredible arrogance (his defender's will say &quot;sincerity&quot;) damns all who disagree with even his most absurd interpretations (c.f. Gen 4, Cal claims that God is addressing Able in his address to Cain).This understood, the Institues are still filled with many passages of profound and upright doctrine, legitimate exegesis and wise insight.It is only warned the reader that there be many tares among the wheat in both Calvin's life and his writings."},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":"I have the Institutes and I have read with careful atention Calvin\`s Doctrine of Salvation. He teaches pretty well some christian truths. He uses the bible and the church fathers, but when Calvin gives his (or Luther\`s) peculiar teachings, he shows how unchristian his doctrine really is by NOT quoting a single NT text or church father to support what is nothing more than an heretic view. Just to give an example: he teaches in this book that the good works of the christian stink, smell horrible, but Calvin doesn\`t give a single quote from the NT or the fathers to support this view. His teaching is clearly anti biblical. One more: When he teaches about Righteousness he never quotes Matthew 5:20. In this text Jesus tells us that if our justice is not superior than the scribes' we won\`t enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Justice for Matthew is good work of love for God and the needy (Mt 6:1). Calvin simply doesn\`t quote this biblical text, and just read his commentary on his \\"Harmony of the Gospels\\" and you will see how in some 29 lines Calvin just run from the simple sense of this text, and that\`s because Mt 5:20 goes against his doctrine (salvation by faith alone).Calvin taught that salvation can\`t be lost, even tough this doctrine wasn\`t taught by the church fathers (not even by Augustine). Read Daniel Corner\`s Conditional Security of the believer\\"Yes you will find in this book his classic insult to God: that He has predestined some people to hell. And Calvin\`s use of violence to support his views is well known. Let\`s reread the Bible without Calvin\`s lens."},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":"John Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion is a monumental work that stands among the greatest works of Christian theology and Western literature. It ranks with works such as St. Augustine's Confessions and City of God in value, insight and significance. The Institutes have molded the church's understanding of Christian doctrine for generations and has had untold influence in the development of Western thought in both the religious and civil arenas.Calvin's Institutes represent his life work in teaching theology. They first appeared in 1536 and went through three significant revisions - each expanding and building upon the previous. This particular edition represents the final form and of which Calvin was very pleased.Originally written to give basic understanding of Christian doctrine, they became one of the earliest systematic theologies of the Reformed tradition. Calvin's stated desire is to give the reader the necessary background to read and accurately handle the great doctrines and promises of the Bible.Calvin sent a copy to the King Francis I to encourage him to stop persecuting the Christians who were embracing the gospel as taught by the Reformers. His basic argument was that if the king understood what these people believed he would stop killing them as heretics but rather see them as faithful adherents of historical Christianity. Calvin was no lover of novelty and throughout the Institutes copiously sights from the early church fathers and the long history of the Church's understanding of doctrine.This two-volume work is broken down into four books that loosely follow the outline of the Apostle's Creed. Book 1 concerns knowledge of God. Book 2 is about Jesus Christ as redeemer. Book 3 is about the Holy Spirit's role in applying Christ's redeeming graces. Book 4 is about the church and practice.This particular edition, translated by Battles and edited by McNeil is more expensive than the one produce by Beverage, but it is worth every extra dollar you spend. While the church is indebted to Beverage for his labor of love in getting many works by Calvin translated into English, his command of both French and Latin were not as strong as Battles. They were originally produced in both Latin and French and Battles' work demonstrates his competency in dealing with both languages. Also, Battles' mastery of Calvin's other writings is reflected in his voluminous footnotes, many of them very helpful to the reader for clarifying, further reading and cross-referencing. In addition, the indexes in the Battles edition are invaluable not only for searching the Institutes for topics but for gleaming Calvin's understanding of the church fathers.Agree or disagree with Calvin, these are a necessary read for anyone who desires an understanding of the development of Western thought, literature and theology. They are not only great theology; they represent excellent writing and development of an argument. They are also highly pastoral and devotional. They are not like reading a modern systematic theology. Calvin understood doctrine to be more than theory, but something to mold our understanding of God, ourselves and the world in which we live. Carefully working through the Institutes is a journey worth taking!Soli Deo Gloria!"},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":"Why you should read this book:1. It's not to heavy (thought it does make you think a lot). I have read a couple of puritan book of the 17th century and they are filled with great stuff but because you read them in the original English it's hard going, but this book translated from the Latin is much more readable. Although the book is v. long it is not as hard as you think it is - trust me.2. It is nice to read a good theologian not setting out purely with the aim of defending the doctrines his own denomination has been teaching for centuries. Although is influenced by tradition he is not as obsessed by it as some Protestants today. He does suffer slightly sometimes, i.e. has some wrong ideas about minor points (e.g. the ancient church on confirmation), because he is not just re-plowing a furrow that has be furrowed a thousand times, but these slips are usually picked up in the notes. It's so refreshing.3. He really, really cares about the truth. Yes he does sometimes call his opponents &quot;dogs&quot; and &quot;swine&quot; which is less acceptable now than it once was, but he calls them that because he is angry because he sees heretics catching Christians in their nets, are you not upset when you see that?Earlier reviewers have called him a tyrant because he used his limited power (he wasn't even a citizen of Geneva) to try to stop people sinning as much. Sometimes he went a bit overboard but at least he cared.4. He uses the church fathers a lot more than anyone else I've ever read. He had read so much compared to now. I have heard that he worked very hard, 4hrs sleep, into an early grave etc, and it's not hard to see what he did. He was a full time pastor and yet had read all these books. Scripture is infinitely better than the fathers, but Calvin was concerned about the Catholics and he uses Augustine etc to show the Catholics of then and now that their beloved fathers would have hated the RC church post-500ish. You won't get that much elsewhere.5. His chapters on providence and man's sinfulness. People think this book is all about predestination to salvation, but it doesn't really have a central theme like that. But essential to your understanding of election is God's providence and our depravity and Calvin gives these the right weight and makes so much so clear. However overriding all his writing on election and everything else is that we should try to understand as much as the bible tells us but go no further. He was, it seems to me (&lt;I can't see his heart like God can), really humble before God and his word.The fact that this review is so badly written should prove to you that I am not an eminent scholar, just a lowly maths student, and so this book is easy enough for most to read. Don't bother with an abridged version spend the rather large amount of money and get this book - it is worth it. If you want a big book mainly for reference get Systematic Theology by Louis Berkhof which though not perfect (no book by man ever will be) has more scripture references and less human writing.However, if there was one book other than the Bible with me on a desert island it would be this one. No other human author has ever been as edifying for me. He helped me realize for the first time since I had started calling myself a Christian a few months earlier that I was saved totally by grace and am myself the most vile creature on earth when you realize God's holiness (read Hopeful's story in Pilgrim's Progress that's me). This book (would you believe it a 16th century work) truly drove me to my knees. Buy it! Sorry for rambling."},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":"There's so much here, it's difficult to write a review of it.Perhaps my main recommendation of this book is that it presents such a clear, organized outline of the &quot;basics&quot; of the Christian faith. Regardless of one's position on the man or his theology, one cannot escape the fact that this man's faith was obviously vital to him, and he passionately describes his beliefs in these volumes.Reading Calvin's Institutes was, for me, quite valuable in finally being able to separate John Calvin and his theology from later &quot;Calvinism&quot; that followed, including some of its excesses. I found John Calvin's Institutes to be a balanced, easily understood outline of biblical Christianity.My final commendation would address the organization of the work. The fact that Calvin has provided the reader with a clear outline and direction in his writing, and addressed each point of his outline in concise, manageable units makes the reading of this immense work much more approachable; the brief readings on each topic, with the saturation of biblical references throughout, makes the reading of the Institutes almost a devotional experience."},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":"This is simply the finest translation of Calvin's Insitutes.

This was written for everyone from kings to the street sweeper. Calvin is amazingly bright. Institutes consists of four parts: God the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit, the Church. Book four contains devastating critiques and historical analysis of the Catholic church. Calvin also uses early church fathers and Scriptures to show what the church looked like before the rise of the archbishops, esp. the bishop of Rome. His quotes of Jerome will make Catholics irate.This book is also historically important, as it was mightily used by God. You don't have to agree with Calvinism to appreciate or find this book useful.

Father Simon, a Roman Catholic, declared unequivocally, &quot;Calvin possessed a sublime genius.&quot; Scalinger, the 16th cent. classical linguist and historian (best known for his study of methods of calculating time)wrote: &quot;Oh, how well Calvin has reached the meaning of Scripture!&quot; B. B. Warfield, possibly the finest theologian writing in English in the early 20th cent., appraised: &quot;In Calvin theism and evangelicalism come to their own.&quot;The &lt;&lt;Institutes of the Christian Religion&gt;&gt; -- I own the Henry Beveridge translation -- is Calvin's greatest work. Over a quarter of a century, until this massive treatise reached its definitive form in 1559, he expended his utmost powers in revision and expansion of this, his masterpiece. The &lt;&lt;Institutes&gt;&gt; is the representative treatise of the Reformation. It was this work that gave to the Protestant Church the systematic presentation of doctrine and the apologetic defence of Protestantism indispensable to the polemic being conducted with Rome. It was the &lt;&lt;Institutes&gt;&gt; that turned the battle to the gate.Calvin, to do full justice to his body of writings (and it is HUGE) is *par excellence* the chief theologian of the Protestant faith. The editors of the Brunswick edition of his works have not exaggerated by saying: &quot; If Luther was supremely great as a man, Zwingli second to none as a Christian citizen, Melanchthon rightly designated the most learned of teachers, Calvin may justly be called the prince and standard-bearer of theologians. Or, again in Warfield's words: &quot;What Thucydidies is among Greek, or Gibbon among 18th cent. English historians, what Plato is among philosophers, or the Illad among epics, or Shakespeare among dramatists, that Calvin's 'Institutes' is among theological treatises.&quot;The &lt;&lt;Institutes&gt;&gt; is an immense work by anyone's reckoning. Yet, why do I recommend that we read any portion of it today? Because, although Calvin was a man of his age, the fact is that he remains to a remarkable extent (and to an extent hardly equalled by any other) a man of every subsequent generation. He was a humanist before he was a reformer. And logic in argumentation and in the sequence and arrangement of his topics is manifest on every page. But surpassing this gift was the biblically oriented and biblically conditioned way in which the material is treated that makes Calvin's presentation abidingly and irresistably relevant to all times. In sum, a magisterial production from an intellectual and spiritual giant."},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":"John Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion is a classic. And the two most frequently suggested English translations seem to be the older Henry Beveridge translation and the newer John McNeill and Ford Lewis Battles translation. But it's hard for a layperson like me to know which English translation is \\"best.\\" So for what it's worth, if anything, I thought the following quotations from Christian scholars might be helpful to some people:1. Here's what Reformed Christian scholar and theological philosopher Paul Helm (who himself has studied and contributed several works on John Calvin) says:\\"Incidentally, if you have the need of a translation of the Institutes, then the reissue of the Beveridge translation (newly published by Hendrickson) may be just the thing. It has new indexes, and has been 'gently edited', which means, I hope, only the removal of typos and other detritus. (I have not yet had the chance to check). Beveridge is superior to Battles in sticking closer to the original Latin, and having less intrusive editorial paraphernalia.\\"2. Here's another Calvin scholar, Richard A. Muller, on the two translations (from the preface of The Unaccommodated Calvin):\\"I have also consulted the older translations of the Institutes, namely those of Norton, Allen and Beveridge, in view of both the accuracy of those translation and the relationship in which they stand to the older or 'precritical' text tradition of Calvin's original. Both in its apparatus and in its editorial approach to the text, the McNeill-Battles translation suffers from the mentality of the text-critic who hides the original ambience of the text even as he attempts to reveal all its secrets to the modern reader.\\"3. The following is from J.I. Packer in the foreword to A Theological Guide to Calvin's Institutes:\\"No English translation fully matches Calvin's Latin; that of the Elizabethan, Thomas Norton, perhaps gets closest; Beveridge gives us Calvin's feistiness but not always his precision; Battles gives us the precision but not always the punchiness, and fleetness of foot; Allen is smooth and clear, but low-key.\\"4. Finally, the following is from David Calhoun:\\"Let me just say a few words about English translations. The first was Thomas Norton back in the sixteenth century. Calvin was very fortunate with his first English translator. Norton did an exceptionally good job. Very soon after the completion of the Institutes in 1559, which was written in Latin, it was translated by Calvin into French and then quite soon into English. John Allen was the second translator. John Allen and Henry Beveridge were both nineteenth-century translators. The Beveridge translation is still in print. It was until fairly recently anyway. Those are not bad but not very good either. Ford Lewis Battles' 1960 translation is the one that we are using. Even though it has been criticized some, it is by far the most superior translation that we have at present.\\"Once again, I hope this might be helpful to some people."},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":"This book is certainly not for the light-hearted! Divided into two volumes that add up to around 1500 pages in length, this is a definitive work of the Reformation movement that fundamentally challenged the Catholic Church in Europe and altered every aspect of life up to today. The author of this massive work, Jean Cauvin, known in English as John Calvin, was one of the great thinkers of the Reformation, second only to Martin Luther in influence. Calvin was born in France and received an education in the classics (common for the time) and went on to train as a lawyer. Both of these influences help shape this book. Many classical references abound, and Calvin's legal thought helps him organize and argue his positions. Calvin left France under less than ideal circumstances, and he quickly set up shop in Geneva and became a central figure there to other Reformation figures, as well as formulating a church system quite different from the Catholic Church. Probably the most impressive aspect of Calvin is how prolific he was. He wrote this book over the space of several decades, but also wrote numerous sermons, tracts and letters. He also wrote commentaries on nearly every book in the Old and New Testaments, a collection that stuns the eye and one that would cause many bookcases to collapse under its sheer weight.The main purpose of the Institutes is to establish a theology, but it also is a detailed rebuttal of many arguments by both Catholic theologians and Reformation figures. The language is bracing; Calvin calls his foes dogs and even says that some of them are sick enough to require medication! What is most impressive about this book is the number of scriptural references Calvin makes. It seems as though he knows the Bible by heart, and he uses this knowledge to excellent effect. He also quotes Aquinas, Augustine, Cicero, Luther, and a million other figures both major and minor. His knowledge is truly amazing and puts most modern scholars to shame.It just isn't possible to summarize Calvin's theological positions in this review. There isn't enough room for it. It is safe to say that Calvin believes that the Bible is the absolute word of God, and that to know God, we have to read the Bible. But Calvin also believes in the sovereignty of God, which is that we can't know what God thinks or does, or even understand much of what God does. We have to have faith that God does what God does because he has a plan. Calvin also touches on faith, justification and salvation, and predestination. His doctrine of predestination was (and still is) very controversial, as it strikes directly at the heart of Catholic dogma. Essentially, Calvin believes that some have been predestined to salvation, and that many of us have not.There is so much I'm skipping out on, and some could probably argue with the little that I've written. I particularly enjoyed Calvin's argument that most of the Old Testament figures were actually proto-Christians, as well as his examination on how the Catholic Church became a hulking corruption. Calvin goes so far to call the office of the pope an Anti-Christ! You have to admire Calvin for making such brave accusations in a time when doing so could cost you your life. I read this book over an entire semester for a class on John Calvin. Whether you are a Catholic or a Protestant, or even of no faith, you could find much to enjoy in this book. Recommended."},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":"Calvin is insightful and indispensable for anyone who wants to study modern theology. I don't, however, mean to review this book on Calvin's merits, but only to lend 5 stars to the editors and commentators who made this edition. The notes are extensive, the indices are well compiled, the page-paper is smooth and of good quality, the typeface is pleasant, and the book itself is well constructed. This takes all the revisions Calvin made (from the Latin and French versions) and includes information concerning which revision is used or omitted in certain areas. The reason why this comes in two volumes whereas others can be condensed into one is because of the wealth of footnotes. If you're not interested in commentaries and other references, then they can easily be skipped; but for those who like to read other studies pertaining to Calvin's doctrines and gain a bit of insight into the earlier texts Calvin was drawing from, then these are very useful and well arranged.And I also need to note the clarity of the translation. While at times it may seem a bit archaic, in select areas it needs must be. If you look at other translations of the text, sometimes they're impossible for the modern English-speaker to interpret while hearing Calvin's voice. The translator and editors made an effort to use modern vernacular and avoid Latinate terms as much as is appropriate, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":"The definitive English translation of this important work by the reformer John Calvin, this is a must for any theological or devotional library. This is also an important work to read, understand and interact with if one is going to ultimately dismiss Calvin's theology since saying \\"Calvin was a fatalist, so I want nothing to do with him\\" is intellectually dishonesty at high (if not highest) form. Pick this up, read it, compare it to Scripture...and know what you believe and why you believe it."},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":"The 1536 edition of John Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion or his \\"little book\\" as he calls it is an excellent introduction to Calvin's thought in its earliest form as well as a nice alternative for those who find the much thicker 1559 edition to large and daunting of a prospect.The structure of the book is simple: it is divided into six chapters with an epistle dedicatory to Francis, the King of France. The opening epistle serves as both an apologetic defending the bourgeoning Protestant movement against seven charges as well as a preface to the catechetical nature of the rest of the book.Calvin begins the Institutes proper with a chapter on Law. While mostly an exposition on the Ten Commandments, this chapter is noteworthy in that it provides a positive basis for a Christian appreciation and appropriation of the Law. Unlike Luther, Calvin goes beyond recognizing the Law as a vehicle that 1) convicts humanity of sin and 2) constrains human propensity and inclination towards evil, Calvin posits a third and more positive function 3) guidance as to behavior God deems as good and pleasing.The second chapter titled \\"Faith\\" is an explanation of the Apostles Creed. Of note is his introduction which proposes the Word of God, that is Jesus Christ, as both the object and target of our faith. This type of faith is more than a mental exercise acknowledging the existence of God and Christ but a whole-life orientation and obedience to God in life and death.Unlike many of his contemporaries, Calvin devoted a chapter on prayer. Following the pattern established in the first two chapters, beginning with an introduction to the subject-matter at hand followed by an exposition of a significant pillar of the Christian faith, this time the Lord's Prayer. For Calvin there are two major rules of prayer: 1) to abandon all pretense of our own glory and 2) to sense our own insufficiency as we turn toward God to meet all our needs. In this attitude of prayer, there are also two parts: petition and thanksgiving both of which Calvin finds expressed in the Lord's prayer.Considering it was the issue du jour, it is not surprising Calvin spends two chapters on the Sacraments: first he his understanding of the two Sacraments: baptism and the Lord's Supper. Then he devotes an entire chapter to Roman Catholicism's \\"Five False Sacraments\\". As someone both unfamiliar and uninterested in such debates I found the later chapter tedious. However for someone interested in such questions, it is a gold-mine of material on a 16th century Protestant critique of Roman Catholic sacramentalism. As a Presbyterian, I found his chapter on his understanding of the Sacraments to be enlightening and rewarding as one can trace a direct link from Calvin's views on the Sacraments to many of the views expressed in both the Book of Confessions and the Book of Order. It bears mentioning Calvin's wonderful definition of a sacrament: \\"An outward sign by which the Lord represents and attests to us his good will toward us to sustain the weakness of our faith.\\" (If you want to know more about Calvin's view on the Sacraments, particularly the Lord's Supper - I have written a paper on it.)Perhaps my favorite chapter is the final: \\"Christian Freedom, Ecclesial Power, and Political Administration\\". For Calvin, Christian freedom consists in three parts: 1) \\"the consciences of believers, while having to seek assurance of their justification before God, should rise above and advance beyond the law, forgetting all law-righteousness.\\" That is to say that through the atoning work of Jesus Christ we have imputed righteousness. Thus, the Christian freedom is a freedom from - freedom from a binding and strict obedience of the law. Still the second part is dependent on the first, 2) \\"consciences observe the law, not as if constrained by the necessity of law, but that freed from the law's yoke willingly obey God's will.\\" This is to say that Christian freedom is a real freedom in that it is bound by God's will for humanity. The Christian freedom is true humanism in that it frees the human to be who he or she is created to be. This type of freedom moves beyond a freedom from but to a freedom to - a freedom to God and His law. 3) In Christian freedom \\"we are bound before God by no religious obligation to outward things of themselves \`indifferent,' but are permitted to use them, sometimes to leave them, indifferently.\\" In this, Calvin lays the boundaries of Christian freedom. As a true freedom Christian freedom is more than unbridled libertinism, but is bound by duty toward God and within that freedom to keep in mind the conscience of the weaker brother or sister in Christ.Part two, \\"Ecclesial Power\\" is intriguing in that it is only here that Calvin truly laws down and early form of a doctrine of revelation. Specifically, knowledge of God comes from knowledge of the Son. \\"God has so fulfilled all functions of teaching in his Son that we must regard this as the final and eternal testimony from him.\\" Thus in matters of ecclesial disputes our authority comes primarily through Jesus Christ as he is attested in Scripture. This stands in contrast to appeals only to either the inward illumination of the Holy Spirit or Church councils. This is not to say Calvin did not find value in either. It is to say that they are secondary sources of authority to knowledge of God through the Son in the Spirit as witnessed in Scripture. One might argue that this is primarily a call to the final authority of Scripture in faith and practice.Political theorists will probably most enjoy the final subsection: \\"civil government\\". For Calvin the Christians first source of authority is of course God. However, the Christian also submits to the civil government \\"which pertains only to the establishment of civil justice and outward morality.\\""},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":"The definitive critical edition in English.

I have been a Christian for close to 25 years and this book has helped me grow in my faith. In my opinion it should be required reading for all Christians because it covers a lot of basic doctrinal stances. The book is a little hard to get started in because of the older language type, but if you have a handy pocket dictionary nearby you can look some of the words up. It is taking me a while to go through it because Calvin cites multiple scripture verses to look up on each of his points, which I have been looking each one up because it both helps me understand where he is coming from and it also reinforces my faith.I love this book! It is awesome and I recommend it to anyone who, like me, wants to sturdy their foundation in Christianity and for those seeking to be an apologist."},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":"A classic of a classic!

Calvin's innate ability to exegete is spotlighted in this well built, logically arranged, aesthetically pleasing edition of Battles' translation. The genius of McNeill's editing shouldn't be neglected, either. This text is the classical arrangement of Reformed systematic theology by which all others are evaluated. Calvin's acclaimed approach of connecting with the layperson comes through this version of the text. The phrase I wouldn't use to describe this translation, to my delight, is excessively verbose. For English speakers with a high-school vocabulary (or higher), there shouldn't be any difficulty in comprehending the intricate beauty of Calvin's exposition of key biblical texts to support his arguments. However, comprehending the significance of Calvin's theological viewpoints and how they relate to your life is another thing. This is not a book you will read cover to cover, I guarantee it. It is best approached piece by piece with careful prayer and reflection, in the same way one would be expected to read the Bible. Invite the Westminster John Knox Press edition of Calvin's Institutes into your home and it is bound to be the foundation for personal (and external) evangelism."},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":"John Calvin's &#34;Institutes of the Christian Religion&#34; is a monumental work in Protestant theology. Paul L. Lehmann, Th.D., late theology professor at Union Theological Seminary, based his introductory course in systematic theology on Calvin's work back in 1973 when I took it. Calvin divides his effort into four books, &#34;The Knowledge of God the Creator,&#34; &#34;The Knowledge God the Redeemer in Jesus Christ,&#34; &#34;The Way in Which We Receive the Grace of Christ&#34; and &#34;The External Means or Aids by Which God Invites Us Into the Society of Christ and Holds Us Therein.&#34; I recommend this book to the theological student and pastor as well as to the layperson who wishes to do serious reading in the academic field of theology.In my 36 years in the ministry, I have been helped time and time again by this great work.Mercury Man from White Plains, Westchester County, New York"},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":"What can I tell you? John Calvin helped me get my spiritual compass pointing north again! He got the flab and plaque out of my man-centered doctrine and whipped it into God and Christ-honoring shape! Reading his 'Institutes' was like getting a top-flight seminary-level education for fifty bucks. (except that unlike seminary, Calvin will strengthen your faith, not undermine it)There are those who pick up the 'Institutes' for the first time and read it in the same way they pick up a Bible for the first time and read it. With preconceived notions and without the right historical (and spiritual) context. \\"It's too hard to understand. Too many words. Not relevant enough! Doesn't help me with my immediate problem(s). Doesn't add to the discussion (or debate). What is he talking about here, and why? He sure sounds intolerant! Have you got anything else?\\"The Bible was not written in a vacuum and neither was Calvin's Institutes. When you realize the unbelievably adverse historical and personal circumstances Calvin did his pastoral and theological work under, you marvel that he even had strength or will to write letters to his friends and even to princes, let alone lengthy biblical commentaries and bulky catechetical tomes (which is what Institutes is). So it's only natural that his works have frequent references to some of those volatile situations and events and important, paradigm-shifting movements going on at the time, and the persons living (and dead) who were his most vociferous enemies. Read Paul's and Peter's epistles and the Gospels (and even the Psalms!). They are peppered with denunciatory remarks aimed at their enemies. Biblical faith and Christianity are not for pansies, cowards or the faint of heart. Straight talk and direct verbiage based on unchanging truth will defeat error, heresy and the wiles of the devil to encourage struggling believers and bring comfort and relief to sincere seekers.If you have eyes to see, ears to hear, and the patience to remember that Calvin's Institutes was written first in Latin, then in French, then translated into English (and several other languages later)--and written nearly 500 years ago in a world much different from ours--then you will find an endless supply of useful and supremely-relevant spiritual wisdom and supernaturally-profound insights that will strengthen your faith and deepen your understanding and appreciation of the Scriptures and the unfolding of God's revelation to man throughout history, much more than you thought possible, and probably more than with any other book on systematic theology, ancient or modern.Let it never be said that Calvin's Institutes should be placed on a par with the Bible or that it is free of error and infallible! I do, however feel totally confident in saying that, for a better understanding of the historical development of Christian doctrine, especially during that epochal and turbulent period called \\"The Great Reformation,\\" and for a more established perception of what is biblical and unbiblical in a world of proliferating opinions and conflicting positions on matters of religion and faith, Calvin's Institutes is invaluable. It belongs in every Christian's library, period!"},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":"Calvin, a classically educated Church Reformer of the sixteenth century, tackles the basic questions and concerns of Biblical Christianity in this set. Unfortunately, an anti-intellectual strain in the modern Church makes these issues seem anything but basic. If you want a deeper understanding of Scipture and God, a greater knowledge of the exact areas the Protestants protested to in the Catholic Church, or a respectable understanding of the tenets of Calvinism straight from the horse's mouth, buy these books. This set is especially helpful because of the editorial aids included, and the historical background given. A truly great book, both on a deeply theological level and on an intensely personal level."},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":"If one decides to study theology rigorously at an academic level, one should definitely read Calvin's &quot;Institutes&quot; to understand the various theological issues that were brought up during the Reformation period. Calvin's &quot;Institutes&quot; is one of the great classics that will never be written off as an old relic. Calvin's pastoral spirit comes out clearly in the pages of this book. In fact, Calvin wrote this not as some intellectual dogmatic text but as a pastoral theological treatise to encourage and comfort believers who were struggling with the faith - especially by those influenced by the unbiblical doctrines of the Medieval Church. Especially good are Calvin's treatment of God's providential control, justification by grace/faith alone, and unconditional election unto salvation. One may not agree with everything that Calvin says (I believe he got the Lord's Supper wrong) but one cannot ignore this work. For those who disagree with Calvin (and Calvinism), how about comparing Calvin's theology with Scripture? If one reads the Bible carefully and responsibly, it is clearly on the side of Calvin (rather than Rome or Arminius). Some passages people should check out are: Exodus 33:19; Proverbs 16:4; John 6:37; Romans 9:21; Ephesians 1:5; and 1 Peter 2:8. If salvation is based on our merits (fully or partially) then God's grace is really unnecessary. The Reformers were correct to proclaim sola gratia and solus Christus when they were combatting the deadly errors of the Medievalists. Salvation is either by God's grace alone or by our works-righteousness (the former being biblical; the latter being blasphemously heretical). One may not like the doctrine of unconditional election but that is what Scripture teaches and to do away with this great truth based on emotional discomforts is to show great irreverance to the Almighty God. God saves undeserving sinners because He is a gracious God. If God did not elect any sinner then ALL will be consigned to hell. The great thing about Calvinism is that it shows the sinner his or her place in God's redemptive design. It is to show sinners that they cannot even move one step closer to the gates of heaven by their own performance. Not only did Calvin teach this, but Scripture does too. If one wants to be Scriptural, one needs to accept Calvinism as the most biblical system that exists in Christian theology."},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":"The strength of that heretic (John Calvin) consisted in this, that money never had the slightest charm for him.

It is exegetical in substance, Christ-centered in focus, worshipful in tone, and polemical in style.Exegetical in substance - Calvin has been called the \\"father of modern exegesis\\" and rightly so. He pioneered the literal-historical-grammatical method of exegesis. This is especially true of his excellent commentaries, but also reflected in the Institutes. The final court of appeal for Calvin is Scripture. His arguments are laced with quotations from the Bible and one senses that Calvin was very hesitant to go further than Scripture in his surmizings.Christ-centered in focus - This has really struck me in my reading Calvin (I'm now in volume 2 of this edition). Calvin's Christology was robust and it pervades virtually every page of the Institutes. This is especially true in Book III, which is especially rich.Worshipful in tone - Despite what some people may think, Calvin is not a dry theologian. Some Calvinists could benefit from soaking in their fore-father - perhaps picking up some of his reverence and humility. Seriously, this book lifts my gaze to God. That's good enough reason to recommend it.Polemical in style - Along with everything above, Calvin was a polemicist, no doubt about it. This book is saucy! Calvin didn't hesitate to call his adversaries by name AND call them names. That may seem harsh to modern readers and leave a sour taste in some mouths. But even Jesus could call the Pharisees vipers and Calvin doesn't stray too far from his master in this regard. We should also remember the turbulent times in which Calvin wrote. He says in his preface that one of the reasons he wrote the Institutes was to make clear what young French pastors who were being martyred were dying for. Remember that his friends were being killed for their convictions before getting too critical of Calvin's language.This edition is probably the best available with helpful notes and an excellent team of scholars under J. T. McNeil behind the text. Calvin's quotations are documented and the text is keyed with symbols showing the development of the Institutes from its initial version in 1536 through its five reprints (the final in 1559).An excellent read for anyone interested in Reformed theology, historical theology, systematic theology or . . . just theology!"},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":"You either like him or hate him - and I am not yet sure. John Calvin has affected theologians for centuries - from whole denominations to great 20th century thinkers (e.g., Karl Barth). For the english reader, this 2 volume set is essential to grasp this quite readable theologian; and Calvin's passion for theology is not lost in this edition. The books are very well footnoted, despite the somewhat dated referenced to theologians in the 40s and 50s.As someone who grew up in the Calvinist tradition, I felt it important to actually read the Institutes for myself and was surprised to discover things that many Reformed church do not emphasize - not to imply that its a good thing. For example, did you know that Calvin said that evil is also God's will? That, although carried out by Satan, evil is still directed by God? While many may accept the sovereignty of God, such extrapolations may be unsettling. And I think being unsettled is a good thing when doing theology. It makes you think about what you think.Again, you may love him or hate him, but you must read him!"},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":"Of course with any theologan comes much criticism. But I will say that no other book has brought me to a closer understanding of the Bible than Calvin's Institutes. I have no doubt whatsoever that Calvin was empowered by the Holy Spirit to present an essentially pure doctrine of Christianity. Of course there are many that will have &quot;issues&quot; with some of Calvin's teachings (heck, people have &quot;issues&quot; with Jesus' teachings), but I am more than willing to trust someone who will use hundreds and hundreds if not thousands of Biblical references in his work to support his teachings. Let's face it: Calvin knew the Bible inside out. One little section of Calvin's Institutes will make references to dozens of verses from many books to support one little point. His passion overflows in his teachings. He truly loved the Lord. Don't let any negative reviews of Calvin's Institutes dissuade you from reading this monumental work. My best Bible studies have been with John Calvin. I am twenty-year-old student and am majoring in Religous Studies. My deepest learning of Bible has come from this book. It's sad that not one of my classes requires this book as part of its curriculum."},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":"This tall stack of sheets houses the most comforting words a man can read outside of the Holy Bible. Calvin writes of the one true God in all of His goodness, sovereingty, and majesty, of mankind created for His glory, of mankind's wllfull rebellion against Him, of His just punishment of mankind in this life and the next, and of His Incarnation to bring mankind back to Him by faith alone in Christ's blood alone. Calvin also writes of the Christian's proper use and enjoyment of this life and the Christian's real hope, the resurrection of the dead at the end of the world when Jesus Christ will come again to complete His deliverance of His people from their own sin, death, hell, the devil, and the wicked. Happily ,Calvin does not neglect to expose heresy and condemn it at the same time he feeds us with the good word of our Lord and our forgiveness and righteousness in His incarnation, death, resurrection and ascension. These volumes are a delight, a cellar of the best gospel wine."},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":"The following comments pertain to Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion (2 Volume, hard cover version) edited by J. McNeill and translated by F. Battles. The Institutes are Calvin's Magnum Opus, a text that he revised and expanded significantly from its initial publication in 1536 to, this, its final version released in 1559. The Institutes is a true classic, widely recognized as the seminal work in Reformed/Protestant systematic theology - essential reading for Christians in the Reformed tradition and all serious students of theology.I confess at the outset, that although I have been familiar with Calvin and Calvinism for some time, this was my first dedicated reading of the Institutes (1500+ pages). Approaching the text in a detailed and diligent manner challenged some of my preconceptions regarding Calvin and increased my appreciation for the man and his work. Calvin is a powerful thinker and a capable writer who handles biblical, extra-biblical and classical sources with ease and insight. Though the Institutes has much strength, Calvin's handling of issues such as: providence, accommodation (i.e. God conveys truth in a manner suitable to limited human reason), and the noetic, or intellectual, effects of sin are especially worthwhile. I read this text in conjunction with Prof. David Calhoun's Covenant Theological Seminary course on the Institutes. Calhoun's course lectures are available on-line at no cost thru I tunes U under Covenant Theological Seminary.Throughout the Institutes Calvin makes many important observations - often chastising his predecessors and contemporaries for be overly speculative. These criticisms were probably a valuable corrective to ecclesiastical abuses and worship practices that had developed in medieval Church. And, while I agree with Calvin on many points, some of his interpretations are themselves speculative and subject to similar criticism. His assertions with regard to election and depravity are classic examples - while many Calvinists would likely disagree - the majority of Christians view his claims in these areas as unbiblical, and, if not heretical, at least overstated. Such interpretive issues have been a perennial challenge for Protestantism. That is, divorced from the interpretative tradition of the Church why should the opinion of one man, writing 1500 years after the fact, hold any particular sway? How can it override and revise the cumulative interpretative history and teaching of the Church established by Christ? Difficult questions, once tradition is removed there is no acknowledged public authority for resolving interpretative issues. One can just invoke the \\"It seems to me ...\\" clause and effectively become a church onto themselves.Regardless, of the ultimate truth, or falsity, of Calvin's teaching, his discussion of issues such as justification, salvation, freedom and predestination have played an important role in shaping subsequent Christian thought. I highly recommended the Institutes for students of Christian history and theology."},{"Title":"Calvin: Institutes of Christian Religion in 2 Volumes","review":"Most people today who consider themselves 'up' on theology may think they know all about Calvinism, but if they have not read Calvin's Institutes they could be far off the mark.

In spite of the above shortcomings, I still give this book a five star."},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"This is an excellent book to get good scores in the exam.

It provided a great introduction for me (a cprogrammer with a little java knowledge) to understand the required concepts andtheory for web app development. but you will not pass the exam only reading this book"},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"This is the cheapest and best investment you could make for the scwcd exam. The book covers the exam objectives very thoroughly. As others have noted, the examples are simple and to the point. This was extremely helpful for a beginner like me. The CD contains 3 jwebplus tests which are as tough/easy as the actual exam. I owe my 88% to this book and I am giving it 5 stars without hesitation."},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"Like David from NY I too bought the electronic version of the book. I was buying the SCJP software from enthuware.com for my wife and there was a deal for SCWCD software + the electronic book, I bought it hoping to give SCWCD test sometime. This the third straight book I bought from Manning which was a hit with me, the others being JSP Tag Libraries &amp; Bitter Java. The authors of SCWCD Exam Study Kit did a neat job of explaning many concepts which are not covered in many server side Java books. The chapters are well organized. Filters are covered to some depth. Take the SCWCD test or not this book is worth buying just by itself."},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"This is my only book for the exam. I have just passed the exam this week and scored 93. The content in this book is very well organised and easy to follow, but of course it is for 310-080 exam and not enough for the newly SCWCD 1.4 exam. It is necessary to refer to the JSP/Servlet spec and J2EE API spec only when I encounter a few unclear concepts and want to know more in details. I also recommend to write and test some codes in Tomcat to make you have more confident in taking the exam."},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"Java is a drag sometimes. Done well, it can be elegant and so efficient. Done poorly it can be a nightmare. It seems to be getting larger everyday. New API's are added all of the time, some standard, some de facto standard waiting for a next release, some way out there, never going to be a standard. What's most difficult is cutting through all of the junk and hype and getting to just what you need.That's what SCWCD Exam Study Kit does. If you develop server-side applications for the web, or want to, even if you never take the exam, this is the one book for you. It is so straight forward and reasonable that everything just unfolds with a logical clarity and focus I rarely see in technical books these days. Brilliance is exposed in simplicity and the experience of the authors is evident in the usefulness and organization of the book. I haven't got time for books that add content just to make their spine fatter than the others on the shelf.In 13 Sections the authors unfold not just the development of Servlets and JSP's, but design patterns and filters, configuration of the server files, session management, exception handling, security, and other architectural design considerations to make your project a success. The examples are short but not limited or summary because there are many of them. The brevity of the sample code makes them much more readable as part of the text without disrupting the flow.The CD-Rom supplied with the text contains the Tomcat Servlet engine so you can work through the examples in the book. It also contains a sample exam engine with 180 questions. The exam engine is world-class. I have Manning Publications Java programmers exam reference and expected this to be as good. It's far better. This one reviews your answers and explains why some answers are wrong or not the best choice, reviews key concepts and allows you to save your results to track your progress as to what topics you need more work on and which you have mastered."},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"I just finished using this book to review for the SCWCD. The book is easy to read, the examples are clear, and the book is always focused on the exam. It does not take tangents to &quot;broaden your general knowledge&quot;. The exercises in the book and the practice exams on the CD are very good also. After using the book, I was able to ace the exam.After reading the book and doing the examples, you will be ready for the exam and you will ALSO have a strong understanding of the Servlet/JSP engine in general.I also purchased the book by Sybex for the SCWCD. After reading two chapters in that book, I switched to this book and never looked back."},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"While tinkering with the idea of going for the certification, I got this book. My day job required work on declarative error handling and I found the answer easily with exactly the detail I needed to integrate it into my application. I thought I knew a lot about J2EE web applications until I tried my hand at the quiz at the end - needless to say, I have some homework to do!"},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"I read the whole book word by word first time, then skim through second time as review, did some practice using jboss/tomcat, then I passed the SCWCD yesterday after about 4 weeks of study. Also, I did some mock exams from http://www.javaranch.com/scwcdlinks.jsp. I do have a few months of prior working experience in servlets and JSP.I really like this book for the reasons listed below:1. The topics are well explained and easy to understand, but succinct enough that core material is under 300 pages.2. Plenty of pop quiz and chapter end exercise throughout the book.3. My favorite is this exam tip based on SUN published objective at the end of the book. It's like a cheat sheet, lists quick info that you need to know about all the objectives. Perfect for exam eve cram.I really like this book and will keep it as a reference."},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"Excellent book for an easy test. I found SCWCD a lot easier than SCJP and this book just beats it to death. If you already know good deal of JSP/Servlets, you don't need the book. Either just buy their full set of mock exam from enthuware.com or better still try out all their mock exams on jdiscuss.comWhy pay??"},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"This book covers all exam objectives. One can have this book not only for the certification but also for the future references. I read this book for about 2 weeks, cover to cover, memorized the methods,its class, interfaces etc. Gone through the practice exam couple of times. I scored 91% in the real exam. Introduction to servlets and JSP also useful. Altogether an EXCELLENT BOOK."},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"I just got home from taking the exam (yes, I passed), and I was very pleased that the questions on the exam mirrored the topics in the book. Also, the caliber of questions in the example tests matched closely to the questions that were on the actual exam. I do have experience doing web development, but it was about 3 years ago. My preparation: Read Tony Buzan's &quot;Use both sides of your brain&quot;, mind mapped the SCWCD book I'm reviewing a chapter at a time, put away book and study mind maps, pass exam. Total time: 26 days."},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"This is the definitive book for preparing for the SCWCD. I scored 94% after reading this book end-to-end. Although a single individual is not a sufficient or representative sample for a thorough statistical analysis of whether this book is helpful, nevertheless my personal experience has been positive. Studying this book is sufficient preparation; there are three realistic mock exams in the accompanying CD, and supplementing the book with participation in an online forum dedicated to SCWCD preparation should do. Also, I would dissuade people from going to take the exam without reading this book first, even if they have very good JSP/servlets experience under their belt, as there are areas that are covered by the exam that they may have not delved into to the degree required for success in the exam.The book's organization is closely modeled after the SCWCD objectives as set out by SunEd. They also have a chapter on Filters, which at the time I took the exam was not a topic included in the objectives, but I guess eventually will be, as soon as the J2EE 1.3 version comes out. I found the writing style of the authors to be just right. Not condescending, fluid, explanatory, and always sticking to the spirit of the exam. There are three chapters in the beginning of the book, providing a general, broad introduction to JSPs, Servlets, and Web apps in general. I presume this is targeted to people with little or no experience in Web programming to help them get the foundation necessary for the discussion of the objectives that follows.There are around 10 questions at the end of each chapter, which help reinforce concepts (they are different questions than the ones in the mock exams in the CD, which is a good thing). Also, a feature of the book that I found to be quite neat and helpful is Appendix E, the so-called &quot;Exam Quick Prep&quot;. This is intended for a last-day &quot;cram session&quot;. I followed the authors' advice to &quot;go through this appendix a day before you take the exam&quot;, and it helped quite a bit.To cut a long story short, let me reiterate: this is the definitive book for SCWCD preparation. You need exactly one book to prepare for the SCWCD and that is the &quot;Exam Study Kit&quot; by Deshmukh and Malavia."},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"Meant for the sole purpose of clearing the exam and it does just that!

I don't consider this book a &quot;must have&quot;. If you want to learn JSP and Servlets seriously, and have a book to consult when you have a doubt, consider buying &quot;More Servlets and JSP&quot; instead. Moreover, &quot;More Servlets ...&quot; book and the specifications are good enough for the exam."},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"This book rule as far as SCWCD is concerned, I missed 4 qs in the real exam.The text is easy to follow and not bored to read and it covered all the essentials part of the exam very well that are good enought for passing the exam.

No JSP/Servlets developer should fail this exam if you follow this gem throughtly."},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"I'm somewhat of a certification junkie (MCP, MCSD, SCP, and now SCWCD) so I've had my fair share of good and bad certification books.With a basic understanding of JSP and this book, I took the exam and broke the record for the highest mark at the testing centre.This is one of the few books that will likely get you certified without prior J2EE reading or experience.

The book is organized around Sun's 310-080 exam objectives, and the authors tackle each objective in turn - clearly and succinctly.If you don't have experience using J2EE, you can't expect to pick up the book and understand everything you read. Nor should you want to - what would be the point of certification if that were all that it took? If you have hands-on experience already, this guide will serve up bite-sized chunks of refresher information that will prepare you incredibly well for the exam (98 here).The index was also refreshingly useful. Although this is a study guide, I still like to keep it handy when I need answers fast. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"You might already be sold on buying this book from the rave reviews that other people wrote, and that's a good thing :) I just wanted to let the authors know that they're doing a great job and THEY SHOULD GO WRITE MORE BOOKS LIKE THIS! GO! WRITE ANOTHER ONE! NOW! =DThis is, of course, the second exam in the Java certification series. The good things about it include:1) They get straight to the point. You want to know what you need to know for the exam, they tell you, point by point (ie. for Objective 1.2 you need to know xyz and good to know abc).2) The section in the back of the book help you study/cram the day before the exam. It contains the jist of everything in the book. I'm known to take great condensed notes for my courses/books, and I did for this book, but I abandoned my own notes and studied with these because they are so much more precise. You can't go wrong with these notes. If you know all of it (about 30 pages of notes) by heart, you can be confident that you'll ace the exam.3) the Practice Exams (PEs) are exactly like the ones you encounter at Prometric. And at the end, they show your results and how you did in each section. I like that a lot because after each PE I'd find out which section I'm doing bad on, read up on it some more and try again. The format helps you feel more comfortable in the real exam (to be honest, I didn't know what &quot;Mark&quot; meant in my first exam and was afraid to click it in case it means marking my exam :P)4)Retention value. Do you sometimes go through a book and wonder if the refund/return date on the receipt has passed? The first Java Cert book is sitting on my bookshelf collecting cat hair and dust. This book had it margins written on, stuff highlighted, bookmarked... and I'll continue to go back to it for reference purposes. That and I'll have to read Chapter 18!5)Less errors than any other book in the market. Okay I've only read a few of these computer books, cover to cover, but this book I'm confident to say has very few errors (and often you can catch them so no big deal)Again, I just wish that there was a book like this for my first exam. It would've helped me feel more confident about Prometric exams and learn how to study more efficiently. Good luck to your exams! =D"},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"Quick Update: A second edition of this book is now available.

Especially useful are the questions at the end of the each chapter, the electronic practice exams on the CD, and the quizlets. The book lacks hands on programming projects, or programming assignments, which would have been really useful for solidifying the material. Yes, you can make stuff like this up for yourself, but then why are you buying a book?Also note that this book is not for the current version of the exam, and after december 14th 2004, the version of the exam that the book was made for will no longer be relevant.My favorite chapter was the one on enterpise design patterns.

Who needs this type of headache?If you are going to publish books with this many errors why don't you publish your home phone number with the book so you can correct the mistakes for each of us when we find them?This is not an acceptable level of professionalism to me.

My favorite Chapter was the one on Servlet Threading, because I think this book explains this topic better then any other book that I have read.I work as a Servlet/JSP Developer and I will continue to use this book as a reference and dispose of a lot of other books that I have around that don't cover nearly the detail that this book does.My thanks to the Authors for creating such a great book with a lot of detail on a lot of subject matter."},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"This is a best book i have read for a long time.

I think it would not be wrong to say, anybody learning Servlets and JSP must read this book before refering to any other resource.

I had previously worked with Servlets and CGI in C before Java. I wanted to get up to date on JSP and get the SCWCD cert to prove that I know something about JSP and Servlets. I printed the two specs and purchased this book. That is all I needed to get up too date and pass the cert with 84%. There are a few typos. I suggest that you visit the author's website ... to print out the errata to mark the typos in your book. This is especially important if you are clueless about Servlets/JSP. Just one badly placed typo can send a newbie into a tailspin. The ... JWebPlus test simulator is good. If you feel insecure you may want to purchase the version with all 5 tests from the website. The version included in the book only includes 3 tests. The included PDF of the book is a nice touch.

The authors re-iterate that this is a study guide so it will not cover all the topics that advanced JSP/ Servlet developers require. Ok, say for example you have passed the Java Programmer exam (SCJP) and now ready for another challenge. Even in the preface, the authors are giving useful information about resource you will require to pass this exam.Chapter 1 presents the servlet container and a simple Hello World servlet. The authors make good use of diagrams and source code snippets. Chapter 2 covers the basics of JSP with a Hello User JSP example. Page 19 contains a good reference table that shows the JSP syntax elements, with the the exam objects next to each element and the book section number. Chapter 3 concludes the first section of the book with an introduction to HTTP. Developers getting ready to take the exam may think that this is all very basic stuff and not enough to pass the exam. Well they will be pleased because the next section adds the necessary acceleration. From chapter 4 to 10, the topics presented include the servlet model (and lifecycle), deployment (web.xml and war files), Servlet Context,Server-side exceptions, Session Management, security and thread-safety. Each chapter starts with the exam objectives and ends with a set of review questions in a similar style as the exam.The third section is about JSP (chapters 11-16). They cover JSP directives, scriplets, comments and all the other fundametals. After the fundamentals, Javabeans and Tag libraries are discussed.In the last section, the authors introduce design patterns (MVC, DAO, Front controller and business delegate) and filters (not in the exam).In the Appendix, the end of chapter review questions are answered and explained.The authors have done a great job at covering all the topics without dwelling too much on any one topic. Even if you are not going to take the exam, this book will help you understand many intermediate topics in a concise manner. This is another excellent Manning book."},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"This is an excellent book for the SCWCD exam; not only it covers every aspect of the exam, but it also explains each concept in a very precise and concise manner. You can definitely pass the exam without any prior knowledge of servlets or JSP, but of course you have to know the basics of the java language.To give you an example, I am a C/C++ developer, I don't usually do Java programming at work and I definitely have no prior exposure to Servlets and JSP; however after studying this book for 3-4 months, I wrote the exam and passed with a 86%.The key to those of you who have little of no Servlet or JSP experience is to write develop your own Servlets and JSP pages while studying so you actually have some &quot;hands-on&quot; experience. I find that once you have written some Servlets and JSP, it makes memorizing the APIs much easier because you had actually had interactions with the APIs, so you are not strictly memorizing a bunch of text.Also, the naming convention are very consistent throughout the API, for example: if you want to add an attribute in a request, session and application scope, the addAttribute(...) is available for all three scopes, so you only have to memorize one method instead of three; therefore to minimize the amount of stuff to memorize, try to look for similarities or common interfaces that each class implement; it would definitely saves you lots of time.Good Luck to all of you on the exam!"},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"The book is divided into 4 parts: Technology Overview, Servlets, JSPs, and Patterns and Filters. Each section s a detailed, in-depth examination of the technology, guided by the certification exam objectives. Also, a CD comes with the book that has everything you need in one place: all of the sample code presented in the book, the JSP 1.2 specification, the Servlet 2.3 specification, javadoc for all the JSP 1.2/Servlet 2.3 APIs, Tomcat 4.0.1, and a test engine with sample questions. Based on my experiences with my two previous java certifications, this test engine and the questions are very good approximations to the real test-taking experience.Part 1 (28 pages) covers HTTP, JSPs, Servlets and the Servlet container from the 10,000 foot view in a scant 26 pages. You learn the basic architecture/patterns of web applications, the role of the web container according to servlets/JSPs and the lifecycle of a request. This the most concise, on-target explanation of Java web application development I've seen. You should tear out these pages (after having read them yourself) and give them to your manager to read. When authors don't have a strong grasp of what they're writing about, it gets very wordy. The fact that the authors can succintly capture the full picture of Java Web Applications in less than 30 pages is proof of their deep understanding of not just the APIs, but the underlying technologies and methodologies -- not just the how, but the why.Part 2 (143 pages) covers the fundamental Java web applcation technology; the servlet. Since JSPs get translated and compiled into Java Servlets when they are exectued, a solid understanding of Servlet development and deployment issues are crucial. This section leads off with an examination of the request/response lifecycle, the servlet lifecycle (creation and destruction), and configuration. An entire chapter is spent on packaging and deploying servlets, focusing on the directory structure that must be present in the archive, and the accompanying deployment descriptor. From here, the book moves on to cover development activities including exception handling patterns, session management, application security and threading issues. The security chapters covers all of the built in HTTP authentication methods (Basic, Digest, HTTPS, and Form-based) and will save you from rolling your own authentication mechanism in your applications. The session management and threading chapters are required reading before moving on to JSPs. JSPs expose this functionality with a simplified interface, but it's very important to understand how your tools work to wield them properly.Part 3 (170 pages) starts off with a chapter covering JSP syntax, lifecycle and features. Subsequent chapters move on to using/building web components. Java Beans are used heavily in JSP to allow the JSP to access member variables through reflection, so a crash course (3 pages) is offered to get you up to speed. Using Java Beans in all layers of the architecture, from servlets out to JSPs is discussed. In the latter chapters in this section, implmenting your own tag libraries is discussed and the major interfaces and classes are discussed. In the code samples in this chapter you start to make the connection between JSPs and servlets, and the problem that each technology is geared to solve.Part 4 (53 pages) covers the one remaining topic on the certification exam, application patterns, and a new feature with the Servlet 2.3 API, filters. Filters aren't currently included in the exam objectives (the book notes this), but they are given the same treatment as the material that the exam covers. The patterns that are included in the exam, Value Object, Model View Controller, Data Access Object, Busienss Delegate and Front Controller.To sum up, this book and it's CDROM are indispensable if you are studying to earn this certification or just getting your feet wet in the web tier of Java technology. This book is the perfect reference for the experienced developer that needs to learn the salient features of JSP/servlet technology quickly and without a lot of introductory \\"this is web programming\\" fluff."},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"This is a great book. The chapters are very well organized and the bulletted information of key concepts in every chapter is really really helpful for last minute reference.One thing that I want to mention is the style of writing of the authors. This is one book where after each chapter you feel you've really gained something...and you quickly want to move the next chapter to learn more...and long after the exam is over you still feel confident of the knowledge that you've acquired.The treatment of various servlets and JSP concepts is precise and consistent with the requirements of the exam. However don't get the impression that it does not cover the key concepts in detail.. In fact it does a wonderful job. For example..I had no prior experience with tag libraries before , yet I managed to get a score of 96% on the exam and that too after studying for just two weeks. And my only primary resource was this book and the provided CD.The three practice tests on the CD are essential for getting a good score on the actual exam.All in all a great book..well worth your money!!Best of luck!Tanay"},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"This book was good during it's time, but now it is outdated. The book is designed for SCWCD 1.3, and did a great job covering all the topics. However, Sun Microsystem discontinued SCWCD 1.3 on December 2004. So, if you are like me, disappointed with head first books and looking to be certified as fast as possible, do yourself a favor and buy the second edition of this book. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"I had been doing commercial JSP and Servlets programming for over a year when I got hold of this book. I have read it from cover to cover and attempted all of the questions and I am very impressed. Certification exams have a reputation for covering obscure details of the target technology but I found myself learning things that would have significantly improved my existing code and will definitely go into future systems.Although it is aimed at the Web Component Developer exam it would make a good general JSP book. An example of this came up recently when I was trying to include one file inside another in order to make my pages more modular. The jsp system has two ways of including other files, one described as static and the other described as dynamic. I knew my understanding of the difference was a little shaky an this book gave an easily understandable and concise explanation of the difference, including a good diagram of what happens in terms of code translation and output to the browser.With only two authors the book has a consistency of voice which I would call dry and factual. There are no jokes or distractions in this book, just the facts maa'm, just the facts. The code samples are short and easy to understand, there is no attempt to give examples that would build into real applications, just enough code to illustrate the point under discussion. Many posters at the JavaRanch discussion forum have reported finding this book extremely useful for taking and passing the Web Component Developer exam.It keeps closely to the objectives and the questions are well structured and relevant. If a topic is central to JSP technology but not covered by the Web component developer exam it makes it clear that the information is only included for completeness. An example of this is Chapter 18, filters which is an important new JSP technology but not on the exam. The people who wrote it are behind a commercial exam simulator (JWebPlus) and I suspect that the feedback they received from that has helped create such good quality questions and associated text. The proof reading, layout and accuracy is very good. The entire text of the book is included in pdf format with the included CD. Although it is horrible to read a book from the screen, it is very useful to be able to do a complete search of the text. The CD also contains a copy of tomcat4 and the JwebPlus exam simulator with 3 entire sample exams.If you are less experienced with JSP/Servlets you will find the book starts gently and builds up, without assuming an in-depth knowledge. You will of course need to know about Java before you start. My copy of this book is now well thumbed and &quot;dog eared&quot; and am confident it will get even more grubby and well handled in the future. That's the sign of a good book."},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"The book is laid out in a logical straightforward fashion -- matching up exam objectives with Servlet/JSP topics and even covers a couple things that aren't (yet) on the exam, like Filters. It's written in a very easy-to-read, conversational tone and is an excellent resource for someone who's familiar with Java but not with Servlets and JSPs or even for someone familiar with them, but needs to brush up on some of the details for the exam. The bundled CD that comes with the book is chock full of excellent resources (3 JwebPlus mock exams, Tomcat 4, the relevant JSP and Servlet specs, and an electronic copy of the book). The quizlets and notes intermixed within each chapter help you to confirm that you understood what you just read -- and also explain a couple \\"gotchas\\". The author's website contains an excellent little forum where you can get hold of the author's to ask questions or report errors in the book. I'll definitely use this book as a resource even after the exam."},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"I got an electronic version of this book with the purchase of the jwebplus software from enthuware.com for free. I was actually more interested in the s/w than the book but I must admit that this book is very thoughtfully written. Authors have really taken pains to collect and organize the material for the exam. Smartly enough, all the chapters follow the exam objectives sequencially. If you are studying for the exam, you need not go anywhere else. Examples are to the point and simple to run. I got to learn a lot of new stuff that I don't find in any JSP/Servlet books. Except some errors here and there, the book rocks. It also has a fairly detailed coverage of filters."},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"The Java Web Component Developer Certification is a great study guide and intro into Java Web Components. The chapters are well laid out and provide a ton of information in an easy to read format. The examples and code snippets are easy to understand and complement the sections well. In addition to preparing for the exam, this book can be used by novice Web developers (with Java experience) as a tutorial in developing using servlets and JSP.Each chapter comes equipped with learning objectives and review questions at the end. Additionally, there are quizzlets embedded in the chapter, although these were a bit simple. There were a few errors in the examples and the accompanying CD did not match all the examples in the text.Overall, I would recommend this for any developer getting started with Web development using Java or for anyone preparing fo the Java Web Component Certification."},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"This book covers pretty much all areas in JSP and Servlets for Web developers exam preparation. It covers J2EE and even Tomcat in details. Worth buying not only for exam preparedness, but, also as a reference guide for all your answers to the Web development using Java."},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"I would have given it 5 stars but for some annoying typos. I gave 4 stars because the content is top quality. At least I didn't see any conceptual mistakes as in the sybex book. Authors know what they are talking about.Exam coverage: Excellent. Explains the concepts thru simple examples. Chapters contain 'Quizlets', which are short questions and answers. They make an interesting reading. Quick prep is quite valuable."},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"I passed the SCWCD exam with 96%.1. This book is aimed at jdk1.3, for the purposes of the exam that is servlet spec 2.3 and JSP spec 1.2. I have not been able to locate a jdk 1.4 version of this book.2. This book WILL help you pass the exam, but if your after a high mark (i.e. &gt;90%) you need to do a lot more. You definitely need to download Tomcat and write servlets sand JSP pages. I also did the 3 practice exams on the accompanying cd, and scored an average of 85%. I did other online practice exams and my score was much lower. I wanted to get above 90%, and decided to splurge and purchase a commercial product, $35, (the one recommended on the cd). If you truly want to kill the exam, you should consider purchasing a commercial exam simulator.3. Shocking level of mistakes &amp; spelling errors. The book averages an error every 10 pages or so. Still gets 5 stars because of the succinct writing and the 3 practice exams included, which you really do need. Contrary to other reviews, the extensive errata does not make it a bad book. Simply download the errata from www.manning.com/deshmukh and go through your copy with a pencil and fix all the mistakes yourself. (Or you can do what I initially did; and work through the book, every example, and try to spot them yourself).4. Other reviews mention that to get a great score you really need to read the specs. Well, the servlet and JSP specs are about 130 pages each of facts and statements, with another 100 pages tacked on the end for all the syntax and package/class hierarchy. It's very difficult to read specs, but if that is ok with you, it WILL help a lot.5. In the back of the book, there is, more or less, a complete example of a Deployment Descriptor (web.xml) file. This is IMPORTANT to study because the elements of a Deployment Descriptor must occur in the right order. This example will reveal that order to you. The book mentions the order, but since the book is broken up into chapters, you easily forget it. Or you can try to memorize the DTD for a Deployment Descriptor at Sun's website; which is a dry way of learning, indeed.You can attain your goal.Jeff Walker"},{"Title":"SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification","review":"No doubt this book helped me a lot to pass the SCWCD exam with 91%.

GO! WRITE ANOTHER ONE! NOW! =DThis is, of course, the second exam in the Java certification series. The good things about it include:1) They get straight to the point. You want to know what you need to know for the exam, they tell you, point by point (ie. for Objective 1.2 you need to know xyz and good to know abc).2) The section in the back of the book help you study/cram the day before the exam. It contains the jist of everything in the book. I'm known to take great condensed notes for my courses/books, and I did for this book, but I abandoned my own notes and studied with these because they are so much more precise. You can't go wrong with these notes. If you know all of it (about 30 pages of notes) by heart, you can be confident that you'll ace the exam.3) the Practice Exams (PEs) are exactly like the ones you encounter at Prometric. And at the end, they show your results and how you did in each section. I like that a lot because after each PE I'd find out which section I'm doing bad on, read up on it some more and try again. The format helps you feel more comfortable in the real exam (to be honest, I didn't know what &quot;Mark&quot; meant in my first exam and was afraid to click it in case it means marking my exam :P)4)Retention value. Do you sometimes go through a book and wonder if the refund/return date on the receipt has passed? The first Java Cert book is sitting on my bookshelf collecting cat hair and dust.

These are minor and do not detract from the actual lesson being imparted.The book tries to, but doesnt quite obtain, the lucidity the authors try to reach in the involved parts of the book. For example the part where you they tell you that you can force the creation of only one servlet by mapping the servlet and a JSP page to the same URL in the web.xml file ... doesnt work out in reality on Tomcat.Then the last few pages that explain the usage of beans in JSP pages is vague. Maybe the authors were tired by this time. Who knows.Aside from the above two there are a few minor problems here and there.

I was fortunate as, at the time, I was suffering from chronic fatigue and barely scraping through each day at work then collapsing into sleep and waking ready for the next days work. The first page which I opened the book to mentioned a chemical which I came into contact with at work every day. It described it as being one of the 10 worst chemicals for human health. No such warnings were posted at work. I protected myself from that point on and recovered some of my health. Following advice in other chapters I was then able, over a number of years and using the internet as a reference guide to symptoms, to recognise coeliac disease and its associated problems (keeping in mind that doctors who I have consulted assure me that coeliac does not really exist; diet does not affect health, or so I have been told by them). For the first time in my life, at 48 years of age, I am finally experiencing near perfect health. There are other good books out there but, in my opinion, this is the one to start with, not just for chronic fatigue but any health issues. I once (when I was about 19) had a doctor who was determined to prove that I had leukemia, my health was in general so poor (though good enough to get me in the army).

It was published in the mid 1990s and hence contains \\"state of the art\\" information that was only that back then. Many significant advances have been made since then in many of the areas the book covers (i.e., sleep apnea, depression, chronic fatigue, etc.). Nevertheless the book still provides a good introduction. It covers what, even today, are considered the main causes of chronic fatigue such as sleep disorders, mental conditions such as depression, allergies and dietary problems. Each of these is covered in separate chapters. In addition, chapters are provided on exercise and sleep but, unfortunately, none is provided on stress.In short, the book provides a good but dated introduction to its subject."},{"Title":"CBS Marketwatch Stories Behind the Numbers: How America Made a Fortune and Lost Its Shirt","review":"There will be another market bubble some day. But Enron, Tyco, Worldcom, and the rest of Wall Street's fallen giants have built a dark legacy for historians and investors who believed that stocks would never fall from their inflated levels of the 1990s.It is here, in the midst of that dark legacy that Gelsi and Calandra have provided a ray of light. These two gifted journalists have taken the easy flowing 'Net style of writing enjoyed by millions of readers of the seminal investment Web Site, CBS Marketwatch, into book form and have provided investors with an excellent account of the travails of the &quot;person on the street&quot; during that historic period in the stock market.The book is full of anecdotes and outside the box thinking that are written in a nice easy flowing style that won't bore and will provide plenty of humor and insight into how mass hysteria and hype can be shaped into a phenomenon, as well as its consequences when the house of cards crumbles.This is a very pleasant, short read, that is highly recommended for all who want to see the non Wall Street view of what took place in the greatest market bubble of all time, as well as to learn to avoid many pitfalls along the way.Joe Duarte author of &quot;Successful Biotech Investing.&quot;"},{"Title":"CBS Marketwatch Stories Behind the Numbers: How America Made a Fortune and Lost Its Shirt","review":"I found this to be an extremely useful book that takes a non Wall Street approach to the market and offers common-sense strategies for the individual investor.

Well, time after time, America has always come back and has been stronger for it. It may certainly be tempting to get rid of all your stocks and go into bonds or something else that is \\"safe.\\" Yet, history has a way of repeating itself and I'm sure the markets will yet again come back.The bubble of the late 1990s was a good thing, a reality check. Capital will now flow to the right places and there will be many reforms to make the financial system stronger and more transparent.Although the title of Steve Gelsi's and Thom Calandra's book may indicate they are only talking about the bubble, this is far from true. On a deeper level, the book focuses on America's core strengths -- especially the heartland. Ultimately, this is an optimistic book.In a way, the book feels like \\"On the Road\\" with Charles Kuralt. The language is simple but almost poetic.

That is to say, Americans invested more capital in the US stock markets, and more often than they had ever done so in the past. People dreamed of cashing in big time on the likes of technology companies that marketed products that the common man clearly did not understand; or telecommunications companies whose stock prices defied the physical laws of gravity; or energy companies, where more than half of the accounting (and auditing) was \\"off the books\\".Fast forward to the year 2001, and market participants find themselves caught in the raging downdraft of a severe bear market. Gone are stock prices that are justified by some arcane measurement of productivity or valuation. Many of the highly touted companies of the 1990s find themselves at the doorstep of the bankruptcy court. Disgraced are the corporate leaders at those companies that knowingly chose to deceive their shareholders and the investing public by including sham numbers in their audited filings.Yes, Americans made lots of money in the 1990s only to lose most of it in the 2000s. Authors Steve Gelsi and Thom Calandra have created this book to document just a few of the personal stories that happened in the backdrop of the collapse of the US stock markets. Some stories are quite humorous, while other stories are not so funny. All are entertaining and well worth reading.We can learn from the good judgment exercised by other folks. We can learn from their failures as well.

If you do not have a strong background in this area, I would suggest reading one of Skinner's later books first."},{"Title":"Science and human behavior (Classics of medicine library)","review":"1/3 of this book covers basic conditioning as seen in all animals, including humans. Much of this was established experimentally with rats and pigeons but the discussion here is in terms of humans. There are no diagrams or pictures in this section, which can get rather dry.The remaining 2/3 of the book covers topics associated more with humans such as thinking, private events, the self, institutions and culture. Skinner refers to institutions such as the government, religions, psychotherapy, economic groups and education as &quot;controlling agencies&quot;. His scientific approach of these agencies overlaps the artistic rendering of addictive systems by the very different William Burroughs in &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;, but between the two of them one can get a good sense of how one's actions are conditioned.For millenia, for lack of scientific application, speculative systems have been dominate. The Greeks were masters of such systemization, which culminated in &quot;The Enneads&quot; by Plotinus, an amazingly unified and satisfying work consisting almost exclusively of explanatory fictions. Such comfort systems seem to have a strong hold on people. Much of modern psychology is not an advance on &quot;The Enneads&quot;. Look at how much of cognitive psychology is speculative, lacking in any experimental confirmation.There is a great opportunity here for you. At this time, half a century after this book's publication, behaviorism is not well supported. To be sure, there are practicing behaviorists and some excellent progress in the application of behavioral analysis. But behaviorism seems to be heavily resisted, as Skinner himself recognized. This book has excited me. Read it and if it indeed excites you, even as a layperson, see what you can do to apply it and to educate others about it. The opportunity is that there is still a lot to learn about how to apply it in our everyday life.

I started applying behaviorism to my superstitious teachers and I got them under my control. My grades went up and my school workload went down. It's been over 40 years since I became a behavioral scientist and it's been such a good life. The knowledge I gained from this one book probably saved my life many times. I stayed out of the Vietnam War because of my controller status. I survived years of working with dangerous animals and people by putting them under control. I gained financial independence and a high standard of living by applying behaviorism. The benefits I have received from Skinner and his science of behaviorism are endless.Once you read and understand behaviorism you too will become a scientific controller rather than a superstitious controllee. You will begin to practice the art of behaviorism on yourself and others. You will see amazing results in being able to control the behavior of yourself and others. Skinner was honest enough to admit that we're all about control and proceeds to explain how control is accomplished; it's that simple and powerful. I use behaviorism to control animals as well as people and it's so effective. Being in control is the most fun I've ever had. I've controlled teachers, Freudian psychologists, girlfriends, supervisors, police, kids and just about everybody I come into contact with for any amount of time to behave the way I want them to behave. I don't care who they are I can put them under my control. The longer I train them the better control I have over them and the most amazing thing is that they love my control. It's legal power over people and animals and way more powerful than drugs or guns. I'm amazed that the government controllers haven't banned this book, but the superstition and lies about Skinner seem to help keep most \\"educated\\" (controlled) people from gaining this awesome power. It's too bad that more people are not aware of this power for the world could be a much better place if we all were behavioral scientists, but the world is mostly full of superstitious controllees. Somebody's going to control these controllees; it might as well be me.

As more people get comfortable with the idea of a true science of human behavior, we will make strides in predicting and controlling human behavior. In the future, the controllers or nurturers (parents, teachers, coaches, military leaders, politicians, bosses, etc.) will have an evidenced-based science of human behavior to change people in positive ways. Effective checks can also be developed to control the new science of human behavior as B.F. Skinner recommends. This science and knowledge sure beats the haphazard techniques politicians, bosses, etc. use to influence people to do the right behaviors in order to achieve a common goal.Perhaps some day the nurtured (controlled) and nurturers (controllers) will work together to make the world a better place.

He was a Professor of Psychology at Harvard University from 1958 until his retirement in 1974, and perhaps the most influential behaviorist of the 20th century. His most famous books areVerbal Behavior,Beyond Freedom & DignityandWalden Two.Here are some representative quotations from the book:\\"To what extent is it helpful to be told, 'He drinks because he is thirsty'? If to be thirsty means nothing more than to have a tendency to drink, this is mere redundancy. If it means that he drinks because of a state of thirst, an inner causal event is invoked. If this state is purely inferential ... it cannot serve as an explanation.\\" (Pg. 33)\\"Trait-names begin as adjectives--'intelligent,' 'aggressive,' 'disorganized,'... and so on... But at no point in such a series do we make contact with any event outside the behavior itself which justifies the claim of a causal connection.\\" (Pg. 202)\\"We cannot account for suicide as a simple response... No one jumps into a brook to bring his life to an end because the same behavior had a similar consequence in the past... Fortunately we need not decide this issue to make the present point.\\" (Pg. 223)(Assumption of mind and consciousness) \\"obviously stands in the way of a unified account of nature. The contribution which a science of behavior can make in suggesting an alternative point of view is perhaps one of its most important achievements.\\" (Pg. 258)\\"A world of experience which is by definition available only to the individual, wholly without public accompaniment, could never become the discriminative occasion for self-description.\\" (Pg. 280)\\"One proposed solution is to insist that man is a free agent and forever beyond the reach of controlling techniques. It is apparently no longer possible to seek refuge in that belief.\\" (Pg. 438)"},{"Title":"Science and human behavior (Classics of medicine library)","review":"BF's Skinner's early work in operant conditioning through laboratory research on animals is generally regarded as a lasting and significant contribution to science and psychology. However, Skinner's works on human behavior, including this one, attempt to generalize to all human behavior the model he developed and used to predict and control animal behavior under highly controlled conditions.In Science and Human Behavior, Skinner repeatedly offers, as the reason for a given behavior's occurrence, the explanation that it is \\"reinforced,\\" and advocates that we abandon the traditional discourse used to explain human behavior through reference to intention, desire, will, thoughts, and feelings. Instead, Skinner argues that a science of behavior can improve upon such explanations by using the jargon of operant conditioning theory.In operant conditioning theory, \\"reinforcement\\" is the process whereby a behavior is strengthened by the process of associating it with a consequence, and Skinner shows little regard for the precise technical meaning of this word when he makes many uses of this term and its derivations (reinforce, reinforcer, reinforcing). For example, he writes the following: \\"Education is a profession, the members of which engage in education primarily because of economic reinforcement.\\" It is hard to see what this assertion means, as the behavioral antecedents to \\"economic reinforcement\\" that constitute the \\"profession\\" of \\"education\\" remain undefined. Furthermore, such an assertion is comically out of touch with the reality that many teachers, who could make much more money in other professions, might object to having their primary motive for teaching characterized this way. Perhaps what is meant here is that \\"economic reinforcement\\" (money) strengthens the \\"behavior\\" of teaching more efficiently than any other reinforcer, in which case it seems that Skinner is applying a truism-that people work when they get paid for it, and stop working when they don't. Whatever the case, such statements as this one, which litter this book, seem remarkably short of any scientific authority or interest.One might argue that since virtually all of the haphazardly placed illustrative applications of his jargon to actual human behavior are as brief and platitudinous as the one mentioned, they shouldn't be taken literally, but seen as rhetorical devices in service of explaining his conceptual model. But some might wish that Skinner took seriously the burden of demonstrating that what he asserts is both verified by the scientific method, and a non-trivial improvement on what is already known. In absence of either, this book is mostly an amusing glimpse at an outdated approach to psychology that simply has not delivered on its promise to find mechanisms for the effective control of human behavior, unless you count its contribution to the management of prisons, mental hospitals, and other highly controlled environments that approximate the inhumane conditions under which Skinner's lab rats lived.Therefore, if you are interested, like me, in understanding the roots of Skinner's influence and an introduction to how he applies his basic concepts to human behavior, this book is a very profitable read. If you are looking for a work of actual scientific merit, this book has little to recommend."},{"Title":"The History of Saudi Arabia","review":"P.A. Seslavin and Jana Gough did a superb job of translation.The English syntax is impeccable But the pricipal value of the book is its completeness: A masterly review of the literature, in my opinion more thorough than any previously compiled, supplemented by a bibliography and keyed reference notes is followed by an excellent summation of early Saudi history and the governance of the restorer of Saudi hegemony, Abdul Aziz ibn Abdur Rahman ibn Faisal al Saud,(the main object of my own study) and his sons. The great changes in the mores of the tribes in the decades following the discovery and development of the oil resources of Saudi Arabia is covered only piecemeal by other authors, but summarized very well here and the threats to the existence of the current regime are discussed in some detail. The reasons for Saudi dependence on US support are given, but there could not be a discussion the post 1998 revelations concerning radical clerics and their support of terrorism.Only one minor error regarding the number and leadership of the two forces sent to Asir in 1921-22 came to light in my first reading of this monumental book."},{"Title":"The History of Saudi Arabia","review":"America is now engaged in the 10th year of war in Islamic countries, and there is no end in sight. A realistic understanding of the very heartland of the Islamic world is essential for the political leadership in our country - the decision makers - and it is equally important for the academics and \\"think tank\\" specialists who provide the advise and \\"policy papers.\\" This book is not for the casual readership of the general public, but it would be inspiring if a few \\"enlightened citizens,\\" in the best Jeffersonian ideal, would tackle it, simply to be better informed on one of the central issues of our times.The perception of Saudi Arabia by almost all Americans is universally negative. In part this is the result of a relentless effort to present the Arabs in general, and the Kingdom in particular, by Hollywood, the news media, and in books, in ways that are now unacceptable if the same characterizations were made of Blacks, Jews, or Women. There are the political \\"hatchet jobs,\\" performed by former Rand employee Laurent Murawiec, who leans heavily on the Hitler analogies to make the case that the Kingdom is the root of all evil. There are several books by women, purportedly concerned about the \\"plight of Saudi women\\" that portray a world that is unrecognizable to any real Saudi women. But there is also a growing body of literature that attempts to depict the Kingdom in a realistic light, written by Lacey, Weston, Sanders, Coll, Lippman and others. There is the sweet irony that the best of these comes from our one time friends during the Second World War, our long-time adversary during the \\"Cold War,\\" and now uneasy ally on some issues, Russia. Alexei Vassiliev has written the most authoritative, and comprehensive history of the Kingdom. Period. The prose is dispassionate, at times it borders on the ponderous, but most importantly it is virtually error free, and there are extensive references in a thorough bibliography. On first glance it might be surprising that a Russian would write the best book on the Kingdom. After all, what is the basis for their interest? On second glance however, it is important to recall that Russia has had a long-term interest, even obsession, with the countries on its southern borders, and its famous quest for a warm-water port. So, Vassiliev not only uses the traditional sources of early British, French, Danish, American and German sources, but also references voluminous diplomatic Russian sources, previously unknown to me, in order to describe events in the Arabian peninsula.Vassiliev \\"drew me in early\\" by denouncing one of the earliest promoters of the \\"fantasy\\" view of the Kingdom, T.E. Lawrence, more commonly known as \\"Lawrence of Arabia.\\" In the Notes on Sources, at the very beginning of the book, Vassiliev says, of Lawrence: \\"...describing events through the prism of his own false pride. His works are of scant scientific significance.\\" The first 200 pages of this 500 page tomb are devoted to events prior to the re-taking of Riyadh, in 1902, by the founder of today's Kingdom, Abdul Aziz ibn Saud. Many traditional accounts of the Kingdom literally start at this point, but educated Saudis are well-aware of the prior two Kingdoms, one even more extensive in terms of geography, than the present country, and dating from the period of the American revolution. Vassiliev covers this period, as well as the subsequent one, in balanced and measured tones, with factually based, and sourced analysis. And sometimes the reader is rewarded with anecdotes that are so relevant today. The following concerns the eponymous founder of the Wahabbi movement (more properly known as Salafis), which Vassiliev attributes to the Hijazi historian Ibn Zaini Dahlan:\\"Sulaiman once asked his brother Muhammad, \`How many are the pillars of Islam, O Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab?' \`Five,' he answered. Sulaiman replied, \`No, you have added a sixth one. It reads that one who does not follow you is not a Muslim. To you, it is the sixth pillar of Islam.'The latter three-fifths of the book covers the creation of today's Kingdom, with the consolidation of political control occurring in the late 20's, the discovery of oil, and its eventual economic transformation of one of the poorer countries in the world into one of the more influential and wealthy ones. It remains an astonishing transformation, and overall, done well, as Vassiliev confirms. In his measured way, Vassiliev takes on the many Cassandras of doom who made \\"...speculative forecasts about the impending collapse of all the monarchies in the Arabian peninsula....\\" by saying: \\"It has now become clear, however, that Saudi Arabia lacked any major social groups that opposed the regime itself rather than its individual measures\\" (p 464).There are a few quibbles about the author's work. He will use terms like \`henchmen', apparently derived from Philby, which jar in this normally dispassionate account. The last hundred pages or so read like so many economic tables and graphs placed into leaden prose, and they are a slog.A fellow reviewer, and friend, sometimes questions what he perceives as my unwarranted higher ratings on books, and I think his point is: If it is not an enjoyable, informative read, does it deserve 5-stars? For me, the answer is a definite Yes, if the information obtained has been worth the effort, and may be analogous to the extra effort required to read a book that is not in one's native language. Vassiliev's book is not for the \\"fun read\\" crowd, but it is immensely informative about a country that is central to many of the dominant issues of our times. Definitely a solid 5-stars plus, and I await the corrections on my reasoning."},{"Title":"The History of Saudi Arabia","review":"If you want one authoritative work about Saudi Arabia and its history, this is the book that you should buy and read.Vasiliev not only thoroughly documents the history of the kingdom since ancient times and through the rise of preaching radical Wahhabi Islam in 1745, he couples this puritan movement with the socioeconomic trends of the Arabian peninsula resultant of its unfriendly desert weather.Even for readers familiar with the history of the region, the author makes striking remarks saying that people should understand the Saudi modern history as the function of a unique event in history. Saudis had the most archaic society on the face of earth at the time they received the biggest fortune ever.Readers might be also surprised to learn that the ruling Saudi family is almost exclusively composed of the sons of the founder and their sons. Another surprising remark the author makes is that, even with the huge budget this kingdom manages, it still has no treasury department.Not very surprising, however, is the typical third world behavior of Saudi rulers who squandered their suddenly generated fortunes either to buy political loyalties or for self luxury.The reader might be amazed at how many chances the Saudis have missed to modernize their country and make use of their once unparalleled wealth. Instead, they protected anti-modernization fundamental groups on which the stay of the regime itself depended."},{"Title":"The History of Saudi Arabia","review":"This is an interesting book. The author brings together a great many sources to present a historical analysis of Saudi Arabia. But it is very flawed in fudemental ways. Far too often, the author substitutes his opinions and analysis for a factual/historical presentation.The economic and social analysis is full of broad conclusions made to fit a narrative. That material, no matter what window-dressing it is given, ends up being nothing more than opinion.The analysis of Wahhabism and the Saudis is overly simplistic. Presented is the familiar narrative of the \\"partnership\\" that conquered arabia. Neglected are the losers and alternatives that were in competition with the Saudis in Arabia. This is very much as the title suggests a history of \\"Saudi\\" Arabia rather than Arabia itself.The book could have been better. It needed to focus more attention on the non-aaudi narratives within arabia: Turkish, British, the western gulf states and the Hashemites. The tendancy to allow the Saudi narrative to dominate the history of Arabia needs to be challenged and re-thought."},{"Title":"The History of Saudi Arabia","review":"The bookshelves reveals a surprise: no one (with the only slight exception of Harry St. John Philby) has until now attempted a comprehensive overview of Saudi history going back to the eighteenth century. Vassiliev, a Russian scholar and ranking foreign policy official, has updated his original Russian-language edition, and the result is enormously impressive. Relying on Arabic manuscripts (yes, Arabia was so backward that well into the twentieth century, scholars hand-wrote medieval-style chronicles) and Russian sources as well as the more usual Western authors (and even here, he uncovers forgotten but essential sources, such as the French historian F&eacute;lix Mengin), he paints a picture of Saudi Arabia from its founder Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab to the aftermath of the Kuwait war. The author has a solid grasp of everything from eighteenth-century theology to the international oil market; need to brush up on the conquest of Mecca or the murder of King Faysal? Here's the place. More broadly, his great accomplishment is to make a hitherto fractured history whole. If you read or own just one book on Saudi Arabia, make sure it is this one. For a flavor, here are noteworthy points concerning the early period: Vassiliev establishes that the Saudi state &quot;attained a might and a size that had been unknown [in Arabia] since the birth of Islam,&quot; then shows the radicalism and near-totalitarianism of the Wahhabi doctrine (&quot;it advised people how they should laugh, sneeze, yawn, joke, embrace and shake hands when meeting a friend and so on&quot;). He explains the political and material advantages for tribal leaders in adopting Wahhabism and, more controversially, how it became &quot;the banner of the Arab national movement against the Turkish influence in Arabia.&quot; Despite its radicalism, he argues, &quot;Wahhabism did not change the social structure of Arabia,&quot; except in such fairly limited areas as taxation and the organizing of power.Middle East Quarterly, March 1999"},{"Title":"The History of Saudi Arabia","review":"This is an excellent book on the history of Saudi Arabia, but not a staring place for the casual reader.

Anyone who has not had any prior exposure to Islam or Saudi Arabia had better start elsewhere, but if you are looking for details on Wahhabi Islam, the Bedouin, or the Saudis, Vassiliev will have many answers for you.

But if you want to gain some idea of how Saudi Arabia came to be, what tremendous obstacles were overcome (or what great opportunities were lost, depending on your point of view) this is the book to own."},{"Title":"The History of Saudi Arabia","review":"I've never come across a text on the History of Saudi Arabia as comprehensive as this one. the author starts in the middle of the 18th century with an analysis of the forces that heleped to unite the house of Saud with the Wahhabi movement of Mouhammad abd-al-Wahhab. Vassiliev - who uses a wide variety of Arab, Russian and Western sources - skillfully analyszes economic and social developments. He shows that there are many divisions in Saudi Arabia and that dissent is widespread in many fractions of society. There is an excellent account of the impact of the Iranian Revolution on the Shia of the oil rich Najd and the wahhabi purists who emerged violently on the world scene in an uprising in Mecca in 1979. Saudi Arabia will become a primary focus of world attention as the conflict in Afghanistan ends and exposes the hitherto little revealed dissent and support for radical islamists that exists at many societal levels in Saudi Arabia.

I love them! I am in forth grade they are really good books for third or forth graders!"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Priority: John Macarthur, Jr. on Worship","review":"Although he seems to have penned countless other books, to me, this is MacArthur at this best - pure Bible study. The book is not directed against any particular person or school of thought, nor is it adovcating any particular praise or worship style in church. Rather, its purpose is to bring us to the realization that worship is more about the way we live our daily lives and less about what we do on Sunday mornings.We cannot truly worship what does not exist, so MacArthur provides us with a very quick overview of the reasons men believe God to exist. And since we cannot effectively worship who we do not know, he also teaches us about the attributes of God. And since we want to worship God the way He would like to be worshipped, we are also instructed in the right and wrong ways that God has been worshipped in the Bible, showing us the consequences of improper worship, and the blessing that comes from proper worship.There is no fluff here; you will not read about the author's personal warm and fuzzies, but you will get solid biblical scholarship. If you're the kind of person who finds satisfaction and joy in simply studying the word, and learning more about our wonderful God, then you will be very satisfied indeed."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Priority: John Macarthur, Jr. on Worship","review":"John McArthur Jr. does a fantastic job of keeping the reader engaged in this, well put together book. The writing is easy to read and follow. MacArthur keeps the chapters short and to the point which is perfect when reading a book for a college class. He writes about how, when, and how not to worship God plus he discusses different styles of worship in different cultures."},{"Title":"The Ultimate Priority: John Macarthur, Jr. on Worship","review":"John Macarthur is correct when he writes that worship is the ultimate, biggest priority, and this book is fairly brief but full of Biblical proof of this truth. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Ultimate Priority: John Macarthur, Jr. on Worship","review":"In trying to reach out to our modern culture, we've become so concerned with tailoring worship services to attract the worshiper and suit his schedule and tastes that we've neglected to focus on Almighty God - the proper object of our worship. John MacArthur reminds us that the reason for worship is NOT that we should RECEIVE a blessing, but that we should GIVE honor, glory, blessing and devotion to our Lord.

Laurie Cabot seems a bit strict, and she has some different ingredients for spells and such that the average person won't be able to obtain. A bit to rigid for my taste, and may scare off many beginners who read any of her work early in their studies"},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"When I first read this book about 9 years ago, it was one of the first books I'd read concerning withcraft from a witch's perspective. At the time, I thought it was great. However, over time, I've come to realize that this isn't really the book for those who are searching for information on Wicca as a religion and way of life. Treat this more as an elementary introduction to plain old, every day magick."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"There is some good information in this book(like the crystal countdown).

I'm Air/Fire, what do you expect?"},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"I enjoyed this book, despite the fact that i think Cabot is into it for the fame and fortune, mostly b/c i'm tired of the Wiccan monopoly on the pagan/witch movement.

It's defiantly worth the read."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"While the book have the basic stuff just fine, and contains some other not original but very good basic technices, I find it too basic, even for beginners.

I never really was interested in reading her books due to other involvements in my life, until recently when I decided to reinvestigate WICCA as something I wanted to learn more about. This book helped me learn about the origins and history of witchcraft and found it very informative."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"This book is one of the best books I ever read on the subject of Witchcraft,in the fact that instead of giving the reader spell after spell, it gives the reader the why's and how's of magic.

In order to do something you have to know about it, and that includes knowing how it works and how you have control over it. I'd suggest having a basic understanding of Witchcraft before picking this book up, but I also suggest picking it up"},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"This review has been a long time coming. I will preface this by saying that I am one who does not like to speak ill of others within the Craft. We have had to tolerate others tearing us down for so long, it pains me to see us doing it to our own kind. It is for this reason that you will not see me write a \\"negative\\" review, not that I do not have any bad opinions about some of the books that are out there, because I do. It is my personal choice to only write a review about the books that have had a positive impact on me, & books I would recommend to others. That being said, I now come to Laurie Cabot's Power of The Witch. I read this book when it was 1st released many years ago & I find myself re-reading it at least once a year. I absolutely love this book. It remains at the top of my list for books on the Craft. It is actually the 1st book I recomend to any & all newcomers to Witchcraft that I meet. Ms. Cabot gives a great deal of information in a concise, easy to understand way on \\"Traditional Witchcraft\\" from her perspective and many years of study & practice. She shows how Witchcraft, from her point of view, is an ancient Art, Science & Religion that has been much misunderstood by the masses for many years. She teaches aspects of The Art to the reader, not readably found in other books on the subject. Her section on Alpha alone makes this book a must have for any Witch not familiar with the technique. She gives an excellent overview of various Craft practices, and instructs the reader in how to apply what they are reading, to their everyday life. Power of The Witch is not just a book to be read (a great read though it is), this is very much a book of practical application to obtain desired results. It will teach the student practices that they will use throughout their life, to great benefit. I personally use (and teach), these same methods that I learned from this book,with excellent results. I highly recommend this book, as well as all of Ms. Cabot's books,to anyone interested in exploring the depths of Witchcraft. Laurie Cabot is a long standing Craft Elder who knows her Craft well. She is an excellent Teacher as her books will attest. She has founded her own Tradition of Witchcraft and for many years she has educated the public at large about the misconceptions many have about Witches. This Lady deserves the utmost respect from all of us. She has dedicated her life to The Craft & to the service of The Goddess. She is a Witch that has put herself on the line time & time again, long before Witchcraft went \\"mainstream\\". She has been (and remains), a vocal advocate for our civil rights & freedoms when no one else would speak out for us. She has worked tirelessly to gain Witchcraft the recognition & respect it deserves. Laurie Cabot should be honoured by all within the various Traditions of The Craft for the great Elder,High Priestess,Teacher & Witch that she is, and for all the wonderful work she has done. She truly is a Daughter of The Goddess, and I for one, hope to see more of her wonderful teachings released in print. Five stars simply isn't enough for this great book, if you have not read it yet, I encourage you to do so."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"This book started me on my hunt to learning the science of witchcraft. If &quot;surrounding yourself with white light&quot; doesn't seem like a good protection spell or you want to know HOW magick works and why.. BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"I bought this book while going on a kick of learning about Wicca. It was the most informative and easy read of all the books that I got a hold of. Although I am not a practicing Wiccan, I kept this book for furture reference.This book goes into some history, the basis of witchcraft, and how to cast spells. Cabot explains how to use Wicca in every day life, which some I use: placing crystals to enhance energy, etc. She also touches upon enhancing your own psychic energy. It was truly a good read, even for those just wanting to learn more about the religion but not to practice. Would work well as a simple reference too."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"Laurie Cabot has some very good technical info in this book - but forget anything she says about science or history. She has a tendency to present theories as fact, and some of what she says is just plain wrong regarding history. I was getting so annoyed by the incorrect or incomplete info, that I ended up having to just skip all the initial chapters and go straight to the magical info to reduce my stress levels.One of the main things to keep in mind is that most ancient history - particularly pre-history - has little to no records, so everything we think about these cultures is conjecture based on the little solid evidence we have found and the way modern cultures behave. In fact, some of the theories that she presented as fact have direct evidence against them. So basically I recomend you either skip all of the history chapters altogether, or read the history and science bits with a very large grain of salt.Also, I would like to clarify one thing. While this is a common misconception - what Cabot is describing in her book (until the magic working bits anyway) is Wicca. In current usage, a witch tends to be a generic term referring to anyone using earth based magic. There can be christian witches, Jewish witches, Wiccan witches, and even Atheist witches. Witch is not really a religion - it merely describes the way some of us work."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"This book has great basic information that can be used for years. Alpha state, protection, basics of spells are all included, as well as personal experience."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"This book was written by one of the greatest beings of our time. She lives totally in the light, helping people and the planet.

I give this a big thumbs-up!"},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"In my Wiccan library of nearly 100 titles, this is definitely one of my favorites. Ms. Cabot is knowledgeable, traditional and sometimes downright humorous. I can see why so many still come to her for training.As a forty-something practicing Witch, I have read many of the Wiccan authors out there today. Laurie Cabot is certainly not one to be missed, and this is my favorite title by her."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"I loved this book.

I even email Laurie and told her how much I loved it."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"This book is excellent for novice and advanced studies. It covers a wide range of topics, and many of the basics. The book not only helps you with excercises, rituals and spells, it also tells you why and why not you do certain things. Laurie has a captivating style of writing and includes many of her personal experiences, allowing the reader to relate more to the book's content. Wonderful for the scientific aspects to it, it broadens the mind and makes you want to learn more. Laurie provides us with some simple spells, rituals and psychic practices to go through, with a variety of topics. One downside is that many of the spells and potions require ingredients which are not readily available to most. All in all, an enjoyable read, and a must for anyone's library...."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"I have only been a Witch for a little over a year, so I still consider myself a begininner.I really liked her section about the science of Witchcraft. It intrigued me so much that I am planning to find out more about it!I don't know if it's the first book people who have just become Witches should read, I think it might be a little too complex for absolute begininners, but it's a great book for someone who already has some basic knowledge about The Craft of the Wise."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"I Have met here and know her and as she strives to be accurate in all things, so also with this book.

A friend let me borrow hers, beacause I wanted something basic to explain magic, witches, etc, and she assured me this was the one. The authors don't write so far over my head to lose me, and their terminology is modern and succinct. An excellent introduction book."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"I read the reviews on this book and decided to purchase it and couldn't be happier that I did. I love the way the chapters are set up so I could jump around if necessary and I love that it included aspects of Wiccan history and the science behind some practices, which many books don't include. Although it may not include absolutely everything it includes enough of a background on everything to help a beginner start their studies. I would definitely recommend this book it is one of my favorites and up there with Scott Cunningham's work."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"I got my copy from the local library. I am a bardonist/hermetic who actually studies and practices most of the stuff written and described in this book. After reading many books on mentalism, the mind's eye and spells this book is superb in describing how to get in the zone. The simple alpha meditation and countdown is an easy and powerful way of getting used to meditation. I for one never been big on sitting and meditating. I have used quabbalistic chants, spells and other ways to induce self hypnosis but Cabot's technique is very effective and very useful for the novice and experienced like me. Overall, I like her clear and concise writing style and the book would be a 5-star of she used a little less feminism in her revisionist historical part of witchcraft. This part reminded me the blacks saying that Egyptians were black, along with Jesus of Nazareth. Shamans were guys going back about 100,000 years. Perhaps with an occasional exception. Kahuna's in Hawaii were guys, so Cabot's Goddess theory is coming from a large dose of creative imagination. I understand her point - women got the shaft and many women were persecuted (burnt alive) by a male dominant church/society. I have read the one-star reviews and frankly cannot understand how some people rate books...."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"This is not a book for the flighty or the fanciful. It is a thoughtful, well researched and intelligent book, by one who understands the physics behind the magick.Laurie is an excellent author and the genuine article. Since reading her book, over 15 yrs ago, I've met her several times; on my first meeting I was struck by her insight, kindness and authenicity.Laurie's book clarifies the history/herstory, rhetoric, myths and misinterpretations and gives clear guidelines on witchcraft, including the science of it. She also includes a list of suggested readings and authors to augment one's pagan education.A MUST for beginners and a definitive addition to any witch's library. I HIGHLY recommend it, and her other books as well."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"While I do not agree with all of the author's claims about Witchcraft being a science on par with physics (see Chapter 5), I must admit that I admire Cabot for a least giving a DETAILED account for her beliefs and practices (I enjoyed reading her account and definitions of the Hermetic Laws).Most entry-level Craft books just give the reader a quickie lesson in Circle-casting, a brief list of popular Deity Names, and a few Moon spells. Cabot actually tries to give evidence in support of her claims. It's up to the reader to decide whether or not he/she agrees with Cabot.I also have to credit the author with being honest and saying that there is no &quot;quick fix&quot; spell that is going to solve a person's problem. Chapter 6, which deals with reaching a state of consciousness termed &quot;Alpha&quot; is actually quite fascinating. Cabot writes that this mental state can also be attained by people of other religions whenever they pray or meditate; AND that it takes more than a couple of attempts to acheive this level of consciousness. Cabot stresses that &quot;going into Alpha&quot; is vital to being successful in practicing the Craft. While others practioners may certainly debate the semantics, visualization of some kind is emphasized in most books on the Craft.Chapter 9, &quot;Witchcraft Tomorrow&quot; is a nice wrap-up to the text. She gives good suggestions for Witches, and others of the Pagan community, to establish a positive public image (i.e. participating in community services; presenting lectures on the Craft and the various branches of Paganism; and inviting theologians of other religions to actually study and talk with members of alternative faiths, etc...)A good book that tries to dig a little deeper into a particular Path."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"I have read many, many books on Beginner's Wicca and WitchCraft and this is one of the best and is the first beginner's book I give five stars. This is a very spiritual book and includes an abundance of information as well as many of Laurie's own personal experiences which I enjoyed. This book contains in-depth historical information. Some people have questioned its' accuracy. I found most of the history to accurate, but no, like one book reviewer said, she doesn't really give a bibliography. After the history, Laurie gets into the Craft of the Wise. This book contains good information on Covens and Solitaries, and also good information on the Pentacle and the Magic Circle. This book contains a section on the Wheel of the Year. I was a bit disappointed on the area where she describes each sabbat, but she includes enough, she wrote a whole book on the Sabbats, that's why I was suprised she didn't write more. There is also good information about altars, crystals, stone circles/sacred sites, herbs, and Divination. The next chapter is excellent. It speaks about the Science of WitchCraft. She explains how magick and items (such as herbs and stones) work (finally, someone does, she also mentions light, and the seven hermetic laws. Her chapter on Alpha is excellent and very accurate. It is also very fascinating. Very well worth your time to give her practices a try. I'm not sure why other Wiccan authors don't get into this area more deeply. Her chapter on everyday magic is good, but she should have mentioned that not all Witches fix their altar like that. I'm afraid mine looks little like hers. Her information on Protection, Prosperity, and Healing magick is good, but her area on love magick (another area she wrote her own book on) was less than appealing, and she forgot to mention you shouldn't target a specific individual although she does speak about that area. There are some great spells in here, just have good luck finding some of those ingredients like wolf's hair, off a live shedding wolf for protection potion. The next chapter is also excellent, it's entitled &quot;A Witch's Life: Milestones&quot;. It speaks about such things as marriage, handfasting, a large section on Witch Children, and an interesting section on Death. The final chapter, Witchcraft Tommorow is good, but in a sense, unrealistic. Laurie speaks about her plan to educate others on WitchCraft. Yeah, I liked this book, Yeah, I was very impressed with this book, and if you are a beginner, this is what WitchCraft is all about. Thank you."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"Laurie Cabot has written a very informed albeit highly condensed book on the topic of modern Witchcraft. Not the best--DRAWING DOWN THE MOON by Margot Adler is the best--but this is almost as good, and in many ways the two books complement each other. Like Adler, Cabot frequently appears on television and radio shows so her voice is attuned to the ear--clear, concise, informative, and articulate. And, she knows her subject.Cabot's history of witchcraft is reasonably accurate, and unlike some, not hysterical, just factual. As a result, she gets the story straight, and considering she wrote her history in the late 1980s, and tons of recent historical research was done in recent years (much of it refutes and/or recasts works which would have been available to her when she wrote the book), she is quite good. Of course Ms. Cabot has other means of &quot;knowing&quot; about the past than by digging through musty tomes.I particularly enjoyed her section on the science of witchcraft. As it happens, my husband has a physics background so I could turn to him and say is this so, and is this so, and is this so...to which he replied yes, yes, and yes. I gained a great deal more insight into the workings of crystals and gems from Ms. Cabot and my husband. Take the clear quartz crystal. She says it emits energy. So I said to my husband, is this true to which he replied, sure, I once built a crystal radio. Quartz is a great conductor of energy (he works at the Patent and Trade Office today and patents computer related thingys, he used to work for AT&amp;T and before that he was with the Army Signal Corps).For years my husband has been reading about the wholistic universe and I figured it was some old scientific fiction junk, and lo and behold, here's Ms. Cabot saying witches knew this stuff all along and it seems science is corroborating it. And, she's on the record as saying so before science &quot;discovered&quot; it. I especially liked the part about the witches and the National Geographic spread. &quot;Witches say Jupiter emits a blue light!&quot;I found a few mistakes--not all individuals have &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; chromosomes. At least that's not what I learned in biology. Ms. Cabot may be ahead of the times however, who knows. She is correct in saying all individuals have both estrogen and testosterone, however. I remember Dr. Estelle Ramey saying it was too bad men didn't have more estrogen in their systems.Ms Cabot is quite funny in places. And, it is rather awesome how one can conceive and believe and achieve. The really neat thing about witchcraft is that it is open to all. It is our oldest form of religious expression. Why just the other day, they found another 10,000 year old cave painting in Italy. Of course it was a &quot;horned&quot; man. I thought of Laurie Cabot when I read the news."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"If you don't read another book on the Craft, read this one! &quot;Power of the Witch&quot; gives an excellent overview of this positive spiritual path, going into plenty of depth on the history, practices, and scientific basis for the Craft and dispelling the disinformation that has been spread about its followers. Laurie Cabot's explanations are clear for those with no background in Witchcraft, but are still fluff-free and chock-full of information for those sincerely seeking the roots behind this belief system. I recommend it highly as a &quot;first read&quot; to anyone interested in the Craft, whether for the spiritual seeker or the merely curious. It will give an excellent foundation for all-around understanding, and open the door for further study to become a serious &quot;Witch.&quot;I can't describe how much it has opened my understanding, and helped me along my spiritual path! This is the best $13.00 I've spent at the bookstore in a long time!"},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"If you read only one book on witchcraft, this should be the one!One of the reasons &quot;Power of the Witch&quot; is such a great book, is that it gives a logical and calm presentation. This book does not preach, but deals with certain truths. It is also well documented. It is downright scientific. It is insightful, analytical, intelligent, and historically accurate.&quot;Power of the Witch&quot; opened up an entirely new world of understanding, and revealed FACTS. I thought I knew a lot about this topic, until I read this book!Reading &quot;Power of the Witch&quot; was an enriching and enlightening experience. Higly recommended!"},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"This is a perfect first read for any aspiring witch or anyone with a curiousity. It is beautifully simple and straightforward, and Cabot is always honest about who witches are and what they do. She goes into a little background of the craft, as well as the basis for the recent resurgence of positive religions in general. The book is full of personal experiences and general truths. It not only explains Wicca to the observer, but also gives basic &quot;getting started&quot; advice to anyone interested in taking up the craft in earnest. This is wonderfully informative, and leaves one with a feeling of self-empowerment and confidence. Excellent for anyone. When I decided to practice as a solitary, I gave this book to my friends and family to explain what I was doing, and to expel any negative preconceptions that they may have had. It worked like a charm."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"I honestly believe that RhiannonBTaylor is far too harsh on Laurie Cabot and her life-transforming book &quot;Power Of The Witch&quot;.Point 1: She did not appoint herself as the &quot;Official Witch of Salem&quot; but was so-appointed by the, then, Gov. of Mass. for her work with dislexic kids.Point 2: Regarding the novel, &quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot;, it was based on research regarding the myths of author, and some of the feminist theories of the time (none of which have, according to scholars, been disproven; they are merely unfavourable). It was also Starhawk, author od the acclaimed work, &quot;The Spiral Dance&quot;, who had a heavy hand in aiding Miriam Zimmer Bradley in her research. Also, Cabot did not, exactly, turn to it as a source. And, she certainly did NOT, as you seem to infer, &quot;quote&quot; any portion of this title. Having read all the books meantioned, thus far, I can claim this with absolute certainty.Point 3: Frankly, poking fun at the way one dresses or their appearence is unbelievably shallow, and shows merely grammer school mentality. One must also understand that this book is based upon her Tradition, of which she is the Founder (obviously). And, this should have been abundantly clear. So, when she sais it is &quot;traditional Witch clothing,&quot; she is speaking about her own Tradition. I feel that this is far more clear in the British subtitle of this book, which is, &quot;A Witch's Guide to Her Craft&quot;.Point 4: I feel that you have utterly misread the section wheere she discusses &quot;whitelighters&quot;. She does NOT refer to Pagans who doi not practice magick as such, but uses this term to connote those who are all New Agey and &quot;think happy thoughts&quot; and object to using magick for protection (such as bindings), etc...Point 5: She also NEVER stated &quot;that witches invented 'language, writing, metallurgy, law, agriculture and the arts'.&quot; I, personally, suggest that you re-read this book with an open mind.Point 6: Regarding the Gimbutas' theories... These are unproven, but they are NOT disproven. And, for the record, they are largely due to schastic misreadings. Gimbutas' NEVER proported a Matriarchal theory. Rather, she proported an equalitarian society. One would be aware of this had one actually bothered to read her books. Also, Gimbutas' theory for a millenium of peace has recently been archaeologically proven by R. Brian Ferguson.Point 7: Granted, Cabot could have researched the Burning Times myth, because it *was* available. However, it was widely inaccessible to most people, until the mid-to-late 90s. One cannot hold a grudge based on a dated book. However, Cabot's feminist stance stems from Starhawk's writings, certainly. But, there is nothing so objectionable in this. One cannot lambaste an author for believing what another author proports, whilst the latter author is supported (ie. Starhawrk) and Cabot is reprimanded. This makes no rational sense!Point 8: The Salem Trials... Actually, she never said what you rather crudely paraphrase. I suggest, again, that you re-read her book. It was fair AND compassionate and showed those who died NO dishonour.Point 9: Actually, this book is most certainly NOT as full of &quot;psuedo-science&quot;, &quot;'crap' research&quot; and &quot;disinformation&quot; as you'd like it to be... In fact, her proported science is well supported by the latest physics (called the New Physics) and various acclaimed physicists. I *HIGHLY* suggest that you, and anyone else interested in this, read the works by the following physictcs and science writers: Fritjoff Capra, Michael Talbot, Itzhak Bentov, F. David Peat, John Gribbin, and DEFINATELY Brian Greene!Very few books and authors, these daysm teach one how spells work; Cabot is one of the few authors who does! Because of this, alone, ot remains one of my most highly recommended books..."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"I read this when i was very new in wicca and just researching. I thought it was majorly helpful and very interesting. She doesn't just put down facts about wicca/witchcraft, she also adds a personal and spiritual side. Using this book, i learneed how to enter Alpha. I think if you are just starting out, this book is THE BOOK to read!"},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"...and one of my favorites. I've been in the Craft over 21 years now and Power of the Witch is still at the top of my &quot;recommended&quot; list. Laurie Cabot was partially responsible for my realization that magick and Witchcraft were far more than rote words spoken in a ritual aimed at 'changing perceptions'. I couldn't find many books about magick when I first entered the Craft and as a solitary practitioner, I latched onto those few that really *clicked* for me. Now, years later, with a number of books under my own belt, I still haul out Power of the Witch and read through it, and I still recommend it highly as a guide to the Craft. Grounded, non-fluffy, intelligently written, this book is a good reference for anyone who is out to buck the trendiness of modern Wicca, without leaning on the stuffiness that can accompany traditionalist views of the Craft. Yasmine Galenorn--author of Embracing The Moon."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"This is a great author. Just as you shouldn't fall into the trap of being influenced by people who look like the stereotype, you should also be wary of the mind-set that everyone who does not look plain and un-threatening is fake. Many Female practitioners of magic love exotic eye makeup, black velvet and beautiful jewelry. They are proud of the magical tradition and do not care what others think of their dress style or demeanor. I don't care if people think witches are scary. That's their problem, i'm not trying to win them over. The bright light bambi wiccan movement is saddening."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"Laurie Cabot is an entertaining person. She has been the Official Witch of Salem for ages, she operates one of the largest Witchcraft stores in the area, and she has been featured on several television shows. She also heads her own coven. So please understand that I'm not suggesting the woman isn't experienced in her own way.My issue with Ms. Cabot's book(s) is that they feature a heavy dose of her own version of \\"history\\" -- of which she credits the bulk to past-life regression. She sets this version of history as the foundation of her own witchcraft tradition* even when it contradicts anthropological evidence. Also, she is a proponent of the Great Goddess theory, which basically states that the first religion was a goddess-centered matriarchy. Some of the reasons she gives for this are a little bizarre, such as suggesting that the ancient people believed women were magical vessels for new life (because they didn't understand that sex=baby, despite being agriculturally based societies). This disjoined theme of presenting information runs the course of this book and, although lighter in some areas than others, remains too thick for my liking.Attempts are made to validate the practice of witchcraft through personal stories and anecdotes from Ms. Cabot's own past. She recounts one story in which she did not have enough money to pay for lunch, so she and her daughter (than a child) did some positive thinking and a $10 bill blew on to their table. I have no problem with cute stories like this, but there are way too many -- almost to the point of being filler.Possibly the most useful section of this book is the chapter on meditation, however it is only a chapter and much better books exist that are devoted to the subject.** A bulk of the book is devoted to a description of \`witchcraft' that is distinctly Wicca-inspired with some esoteric practices tossed in. There is also the obligatory section about the Wheel of the Year, holidays, the always popular \`burning times', etc.If you have no problems with other religions and/or you come from a pantheistic view on the topic, Ms. Cabot's abrasive tone when discussing other faiths (especially Christianity) may be a turn-off. It was to me.All in all, this isn't a book I'd recommend to people seeking to learn about witchcraft as a vocational practice or in part of a religious setting. Remember that Ms. Cabot blazed her own tradition and this book is a description of that, first and foremost. If you are going to buy it anyway, take it with a truckload of salt and don't forget to seek out other source material for your comparison. I'd recommend Marian Green's \\"A Witch Alone.\\"* The Cabot Tradition, which is both a religion and a practice.** \\"8 Minute Meditation,\\" Victor Davich -- great for beginners!"},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"This book is a MUST. It grounds Witchcraft in both Science AND Image-ination, a balance absolutely necessary for anyone practicing the Magickal Arts. From there on it's up to you, but this book is one of the best ways to start."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"Although I read this book quite some time ago, I do remember the impact it left on me! As a beginner, this book gave me very important information about the Craft. It was empowering and magical! I consider Laurie Cabot to be my metor and, quite frankly, the Queen of Witches of our time. I highly reccomend this book to beginners and all who are interested in learning Wiccan ways! Blessed Be!"},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"I didn't think much of this book, but it did have it's high points.

A must have for all those who are interested in pagan based religions."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"This was one of the first books I picked up when I first started studying the Craft, right along with Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practioner. I found it as alot of jibberish, granted there was some decent parts, most of it seemed like it was written for her and only her and those she teaches. I found most of it difficult to understand, and her version of the Craft seemed so organized; for instance, your altar MUST look like this. Needless to say, Cunninghams book I finished, Ms Cabot's, I did not."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"i read it and it was neat it is about this witch who lives in salam and she has been a witch for over 40 years and says how to be a witch and what a witch is and it has spells in the back i have been a witch since i was born as a baby but i did not know till i was 8 and its been 2 years later and im only ten that is very young people think.i have a coven and i can fly and i can be invisable and move things with my powers."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"Because of good marketing, Lauurie Cabot is probably one of the best known witches in North America, but this book,which seems to exist solely for Cabot to toot her own horn, is proof that fame does not equate with wisdom.Now I will say that the section on how to slip into an 'alpha' state for meditation is excellent, and has never failed me. And it may be that my view is somewhat colored by her self promotion and the environmentally unfriendly marketing of her shop in Salem Mass, a wiccan should know better than to wrap purchases in non-biodegradable green plastic, that just looks pretty. But the book is full of massive generalities that still manage to be wrong.For example: She harkens back to a mythical, and never existed, time in europe when men and women lived in harmoney and equality until invading bands of more war like men, apparenlty created solely to invade idylic peoples, destroyed it.Cabot is an angry feminist and this colors her views and puts a bias on her writing so strong as to make her guilty of the same sexist myopia that she accuses, rightly, of sexist men having.Also her view of Wicca, a faith that thrives on freedom of expression and devine interaction, is that her way is the *only* way. All others are wrong because her way is perfect. The idea that it might not be right for someone else, does not enter her world view.In short Cabot is angry about lots of things, sexism, religous prejudice and she has battled against it. That is worthy but her fights have made her scared and bitter and this falls apart because she fails to recognize it."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"I expected great things from Cabot's books. I was let down. I did not care for her writing style, nor did I find her information moving or educational. I am genuinely surprised that so many people find Cabot to be a literary value. I just don't see it. I would not recommend Cabot's works to anyone interested in paganism or witchcraft."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"This is quite possibly up there in the top 10 of all time rubbish books on Witchcraft.Laurie Cabot claims to be the Official Witch of Salem and an ordained High Priestess descending fro Celtic ancestry. Dave Lee Roth in gothic drag is closer to the truth.My hackles were first raised by the quoting of the fictional work \\"Mists of Avalon\\" as a source - I thought maybe Cabot had borrowed some of the poetry from within the book but as I found no evidence of this I can only presume she considers it a valid reference book.Further on the author refers to her style of dress as \\"traditional witch clothing\\", by which she means a black cape and a pentacle - and I thought she just wore it to make money out of visiting tourists!. Cabot then goes on to insult those people who follow a pagan path without practicing magic as \\"whitelighters\\", a term she uses for those who \\"only\\" do spiritual and devotional work. She also states that witches invented \\"language, writing, metallurgy, law, agriculture and the arts\\" - arrghh!Cabot perpetuates the Gimbutas myth of a matriarchal society and then says that there is no evidence of this as the patriarchal society coincided with the start of writing. Convenient for her theory but with no basis in any of the evidence. She also confuses matrifocal, matrilineal and matriarchal societies, seeming to think that a matrifocal or matrilineal society automatically means a matriarchal one. Cabot also comments that the original priesthood (I presume she means of the witches?) were all female. Cabot also mentions something that she'd read in a Book of Shadows from the 12th Century!! If she really has access to such a book then surely she should share it with those academics who are researching the history of witchcraft as it would completely change current academic thinking.On to the Burning Times - that dark period of history much beloved by those who seek to portray themselves as a persecuted minority. Cabot gives one of the highest figures I have seen in print - the usual 9 million gets quoted, but Cabot also says the figure may be as high as 13 million. That's more than half the population of Europe at that time. Cabot also can't seem to get away from the witch equals goddess worshipper either, something that gets more and more irritating throughout the book. The facts were out there in the public domain at the time of her writing the book if Cabot had bothered to research outside of pagan books.Despite living in Salem as their resident witch, Cabot then displays great insensitivity to her forebears. She asks whether those killed at Salem were witches, and surmises that perhaps a couple of them may have been, but witches should claim them for their own as they died for our freedom! The dishonour she shows towards the dead by making this claim leaves me speechless.The book is full of pseudo science, crap \\"research\\", and disinformation. I sincerely wish the author took her own advice \\"It takes more than wishful thinking to become a competent practicing witch\\"."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"This book is just awful. Written at a fourth grade reading level but I would not recommend it for children. It is just disappointing. It seems it was written in a rush and not researched at all. If you want a beginners book or something on the basics or informative, don't read this."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"Indeed, Power of The Witch is a bedtable reading for everyone who delves in the magick of the real world. It is instrumental in making people understand what we are about. I am extremely delighted with it, and I hope people can read it and feel that the whole world is really Magick, and that anyone can grasp its essence. It is a matter of trying and opening yourself. Ms. Cabot did a tremendous job by explaining just that."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"Laurie Cabbot is a well known and well respected Witch, and for good reason...She has taken her lumps and then some. She was/is a pioneer in the field of Witchcraft, and the instruction of same. And for that my hat is off to her, for all her hard work and sacrifice....BUT. If I wanted to read a book on Lourie Cabbots 'issues' I would most certainly have bought a book by that title! Thanks but no thanks I've got my own issues, I don't need to spend hours reading about hers...There is some VERY good information in this book...but it is sandwiched in between LARGE sections of venting and angry recountings of history....I get why you are angry Lourie, but I'm looking to make today and tommorrow better...not DWELL in yesterday. Don't misunderstand me..we must learn from yesterday, or tommorrow will look just like it. But I don't need any help living there, thank you. I have avoided books by Lourie Cabbot sinse reading this book. I have picked one up on occation but it seems she is consistant in using her books not only to instruct but to work out her personal issues.. sounds more like a job for a diary, really. Personally I recomend \\"Green Witchcraft\\" as well as works by Scott Cunningham and Raymond Buckland. Understanding there are pricipals in Witchcraft that should be strictly followed, there is no reason why they should be impossible ideals. And for goodness sake don't throw your brain in the bin while reading any instructional text in this genre, FEEL while you read, you will know when you have found what you have been looking for!! Blessed Be"},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"Wisdom, wit, and elegance is three words that could easily describe Laurie Cabots beautifully crafted guidebook &quot;The Power Of The Witch.&quot; Full of step by step guides to performing incantations, putting together an alter, or even enchanting charms, this book is an absolute leader in it's field. Also, it does an excellent job of laying those old nasty stereotypes to rest by detailing the history of wiccan practices, and gods. Laurie herself offers quick testimonials, in moments where she become slightly autobigraphical, in telling how she, herself, came into her practice, and discovered who she truly was. This book is utterly fascinating, and an excellent tool for anyone interested in practicing, expanding their abilities, or simply easing their curiosity. Truly an enlightening, beautiful experience that anyone can enjoy."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"Laurie Cabot is one of the best Authors in the modern Craft.

This all sounds like hype, but believe me, I've never seen this religion so well-defined and easy to understand."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"The Power of The Witch is a great read, but little else. Ms. Cabot seems to be a bit formal and strict. I wouldn't recommend this as a first read to anyone new to Witchcraft. Though I understand that she is the Grand Dame of Salem, her style is to uptight and rigid. She also tends to focus on the religious aspect of Withcraft solely, and not everyone is comfortable with that"},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"ok... live and let live, that's my motto. so if you believe (or want to believe) in faeries and such, you may enjoy this book. personally i found it indigestible, and i lifted the cover with an open mind, genuinely hoping to learn. not my path, i guess. i look askance at any religion as a vessel and a tool to focus self and hopefully tap into something bigger, which is how i look at Magick; this \\"guide\\" read more like a disney movie. that's just my .02. i wish i could get my ten bucks back."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"I love the way Laurie provides scientific back-up for her teaching.

It subtly builds up a wonderful feeling of mysticism in the reader, while divulging information that is well informed and abundant. It is impossible not to continually refer to this book throughout your wiccan career - I have had it for 3 years and am still astounded by the volume of facts it contains - barely a paragraph goes by without a well written argument or interesting anecdote. It explains Lauries beliefs about the science of withcraft(something no witch should go without reading), it gives many spells for different situations - describes the many techniques used in conjuring, discusses different traditions within wicca etc.etc. A wonderfull expose that should be bought by accomplished witch and interested by-stander alike."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"I believe that more people, witches or not, should read this book. I just got it the other day (finally!) and haven't been able to put it down. It is extremely informative and historically accurate, and the facts are still being shown as true, even though it came out in the late 80s (which is pretty awesome). This is a great book to give to someone in your family who doesn't \\"agree\\" with your religious choice so that they can see, like the Christian did in the first page of the book, what witchcraft really is all about (nothing sinister).I think the only thing I disagreed with Ms Cabot about was her statement of wearing her \\"traditional\\" black Witch robes.

Cabot is highly respected in her community and is not 'new' to the growing religion of Witchcraft. In this book, she helps explain without pomp and complexity how to add magic and witchcraft into \\"EVERYDAY\\" life without it costing you a fortune in unnecessary items. This was the first book I had read on Witchcraft well over 10 years ago and it still stands above the rest. Cabot is the only female writer of Witchcraft that deserves praise above and beyond her male contemporaries. She doesn't just put pen to paper to make a few $$$, she very much lives the lifestyle, works extensively to dispel the myths surrounding the practice of Witchcraft, works tirelessly for better understanding and rights for those that do practice Witchcraft, Paganism & Wicca. She also explains well how one can be Christian AND practice this noble and ancient religion, it will certainly surprise you!

All the books one finds out now are books generally based on this book. She is an innovator in getting the correct knowledge out about Wicca.

Wonderful for the scientific aspects to it, it broadens the mind and makes you want to learn more. Laurie provides us with some simple spells, rituals and psychic practices to go through, with a variety of topics.

Ms. Cabot is an engaging writer, and though she can be somewhat overbearing (i.e. Altar setup), this is an excellent introductory work.

I see the world through different eyes now. Laurie Cabot does a wonderful job of dispelling the myths about Wicca as she unveils the beauty of it. Power of the Witch is a must for anyone seeking the truth about Witchcraft. This book is easy to read and follow. I have read literally hundreds of books on Wicca and Witchcraft....Power of the Witch is still my favorite, and I recommend it to all. Just reading this book is a magical and transforming experience in itself. I have never read any book that has had such a profound effect on my life. Absolutely the best!!!"},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"I picked this book up as almost a joke, because a rather foolish and ignorant &quot;witch&quot; I'd encountered on a message board swore by this book. My thought in buying it was curiosity in why he was so obsessed with the book and Laurie Cabot. Upon first opening it, what caught my eye? Her picture on the inside of the dustcover (I have the hardback edition). Now that really got me thinking, &quot;Oh my...she's just another one of those 'look at me, I'm a spooky witch' types. This is probably going to be a waste of money&quot;.Despite my initial reaction, I started reading....and was wonderfully surprised! I could not put this book down. Despite a few occasional snatches of narcissism (of which she is certainly no more guilty of than many other Pagan authors like Starhawk and $RW), I found Laurie's style to be quite refreshing and informed. Of course, one must keep in mind that this book was written in the 80's...before the &quot;millions of witches burned&quot; and the Great Universal Mother Goddess Society theories were refuted, so some historical information is going to be inaccurate. I think she can be forgiven this since she was going by what was known at the time and is not making up stories to support some sort of agenda like some Pagan authors tend to do (Edain McCoy, D.J. Conway, $RW, etc).The usual altar setup, basic circle-casting, and spellcasting information is provided...however, the one difference that makes this book such a treasure is the fact that Laurie not only explains how to do these things, but why they work...complete with actual scientific explanations. I found this a wonderful change from the usual &quot;You do this because that's just the way it's done...and I said so&quot; style that most Pagan authors use. This may seem daunting to the wanna-be witch who just wants to be handed the usual lists of deities and correspondences and lists of tools, but it is a real godsend to those who want the meat of how this all works and ties in together. It was invaluable to me as someone whose left side of the brain is constantly telling me that magic is merely fantasy, that lighting candles and casting circles is useless nonsense. This is the first book on magic (and I own quite a few!) that I have read and come away from actually really believing in the power of magic.An incredible must-read for anyone interested in magic."},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"this book was very good laurie really hit home for us witches.This book may be confusing to the begining witch but i strongely reccommend the more advanced witch to read this.

I was skeptical about it; I was at a point where I had read so much that much of it seemed repetative and bland, but I picked up the book and was almost immediately drawn in by Cabot's powerful writing style! She took information that I had read numerous time before and presented it in such a way that it seemed like the first time I had ever seen it.She's very matter of fact, keeps things simple, and it's all practile. I've learned so much from this book and use so many of the techniques she offers. It's a definate must for any Witch, or anyone who is curious about what WitchCraft is about!"},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"An excellent book for the begginer or the long time practicing witch. Everyone will find something interesting in here..... Laurie gives insight into history and her life as a witch..She also gives some wonderful exersizes that will be helful to all..A truly great book!"},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"I am convinced, more and more, that this important work found its way to me as the answer to a prayer. Simply because, when I first embarked upon this Path, many of the books spoke of spells in a rather dodgy manner. One \\"popular\\" author simply adressed this by staiting, \\"You have to believe in spells for them to work\\" and left it at that, without giving the reader any reason \\"to believe\\"! How aggrivating! I was almost ready to drop what we call \\"spells\\"...at least before this book found its way into my heart. Laurie Cabot uses science and the latest developements in theoretical physics, and physics in general, (which are all proported by such illuminaries as Einstein, Niel Bhor and Stephen Hawking, etc...) to discuss how spells work. Her book describes a Universe which makes sense to the Witch! For this, alone, it is worth the purchase of the book! Her description of The Science Tradition of Witchcraft is fully grounded in fact, as revealed by her bibliography and such authors as Michael Talbot, Fritja Capra, F. David Peat, Itzhak Bentov, PhD. Fred Alan Wolfe and John Gribbin, etc...While her non-\\"Wiccan\\" history is certainly very well grounded in fact, her Wiccan history stummbles on the very odd occasion (only once, or maybe twice, as I can currently recall). But, we must take into account the date in which it was printed- in fact, the date in which it was written, as the 2 are usually off by a number of years. She may, very well, have been told something by a Gardnerian Witch, from the Gardnerian Book of Shadows, and neither of them were the wiser. However, 10 years has elapsed since then. She is always very well researched.Interestingly enough, the British version of \\"Power Of The Witch\\" is apparently being sold commercially throughout the US as its current printing! Although, I must say, I am a little baffled by the current cover-art. Call me a critic, but...I just don't \\"get it\\"! Also, the sub-title is different than the original US publication, which was \\"The Earth, The Moon, and the Magickal Path to Enlightenment.\\" However, I must admit, I am more partial to \\"A Witch's Guide to Her Craft\\".To sum it up, if you have ever wondered how/why spells work- I can't recommend this book highly enough! Also, if you've wished to explain how spells work to a student, using a logical, rational, left-brained approach, the same applies! Because, to briefly quote the author, \\"The Science Tradition draws on both ancient wisdom and the latest in theoretical physics. Using science as an approach to Witchcraft gives my students a solid grounding on which to stand. Some teachers in The Craft present our practices & beliefs in terms of art or religion or psychology or mythology, and these have their merits, but at some point the student wants to know 'how magick works'. Science is our country, it is where we feel at home. ...Science describes a world that makes sense.\\"Actually, what's most fascinating is that one of the authors whom her Tradition draws upon is F. David Peat, who is reknowned for \\"Synchronicity\\", which at its most basic level states, \\"coincidences that are so unusual and so psychologically meaningful they don't seem to be the result of chance alone.\\" Thus, what I have seen at the tail end of last year, and at the beginning of this year (indeed from various Craft Elders within recent months, whom also happen to teach similarly) is that a variety of Pagan books being published also use quantum physics/mechanics to teach what we refer to as \\"spells\\". I haven't seen this since the publication of \\"Power Of The Witch\\"! How extraordinary!This book deserves 5-stars, and more!"},{"Title":"Power of the Witch: The Earth, the Moon, and the Magical Path to Enlightenment","review":"I came across this book in a very weird way, A friend of mine was moving and donating books to the library, this one caught my eye, then I put in my book shelf and forgot about for over a year.

So many of the Wiccan books get so wraped up in telling you how to do everything that they don't take time out to share personal enlightenment to inspire you along the way!

It contained invaluable information about the Burning Times, the difference between witchcraft and satanism, and Science and Majick that have become a permanent part of my BOS. This was the first book I've ever read about Wicca and it completely changed my life! I couldn't thank Laurie enough for writing this book.

The descriptions about the burning times tore at my heart and soul. The insights she shares make you angry and understanding no matter who you are.

It's bad enough the amount of fluff out there supporting Wicca as the only way for modren witches, but this book has too many harmful ideas to be believed or even to be recommended. Is it a new thing to quote long passages and base a tremendous portion of ones ideas on certain passages and books and not to even give the original authors etc. credit? Many times, Cabot quotes things or references an idea from somewhere, without ever stating were that somewhere is. And with as many unfounded claims and ideas that this woman has, one would really like to know where they're coming from. To not cite, makes me think that she's just creating half this stuff.The ideas, especially at the front half of the book are harmful to many would-be's. Don't read this book! I got it used and it was still a waste of money. It's not going to help you with anything, and may even cloud your mind with unfounded ideas, such as women where the sole inventors of language. Give me a break.Stay away from this book! Even McCoy is better then this dribble. But what can one expect from a woman who runs around in goth, calling it traditinal witch wear. I really feel for her family, espcecially her kids."},{"Title":"Guiding Your Family in a Misguided World","review":"Very good reference for this chaotic world. Teachers, parents, and caregivers can learn a lot from this insightful book. It would give you an idea why being permissive to children is not advisable. Each adult should be responsible in raising children. You can just imagine yourself like a shepherd and guiding your flock of sheep towards the right path. If one sheep strays away, you pull it back again to follow the flock once again.Excellent reference even for teachers. It provides a deeper insight on families. It will help teachers on how to relate with their students and their families more effectively. Advice, suggestions, comments, and biblical teachings included. Truly, it shows the many support groups, institutions, and organizations in the community that you can collaborate with."},{"Title":"The Best of U2 - 1980-1990","review":"As with the companion tab book, 'The Best of 1990-2000' (ISBN: 0634086391) this book contains some of the very best U2 songs for Guitar players to feast upon. The 80's was arguably when U2 really broke ground in terms of defining their sound with War and the Joshua Tree, and again in 1991 with Achtung Baby (songs from which are not in this volume, but the companion).One must be careful, however, to purchase the right version of the book as Amazon does not really make a clear distinction between the Piano/Vocal/Guitar version (ISBN: 0634086375 - only has VERY limited guitar tab, essentially chords really, therefore is of not much use to the serious player) and the Guitar-only version (ISBN: 0711973091), which has comprehensive tab to nail these songs.You'll find all of the notable classics like 'With or Without You', 'Where the streets have no name', 'I will follow', 'Pride', 'The unforgettable fire', 'All I want is you' and so on all accurately tabbed in this volume, and before you know it you will be rattling off the riff for Pride and think you will be a guest on tour with the boys from Dublin.Grab this and the Best of 1990-2000 book (ISBN: 0634086391, Guitar-only version) and you will have a collection of some of the most seminal songs of the mid eighties and nineties. Trust me, they work a treat if you have a gig/party at a mate's place...the crowd will love them, and they are a pleasure to play.Do yourself a favor, and don't bother with half of the tabs on the Internet for U2 songs. Most are wrong or incomplete, and since this tab book is $15 (a little more for me since I'm an Aussie, but still very cheap) you will have all you need and no need to bother with renditions by 14 year olds that think they are Eddie Van Halen or The Edge.One last thing: there is no indication of what effects you need to use to get the 'sound' of the Edge. I can tell you that it is primarily a Delay effect, but some excellent Internet 'Edge-wannabe' resources (try Google) will tell you the specifics for each song. U2 Purists looking for 'An Cat Dubh', 'The Electric Co.' (which is great) and some of their other REALLY early stuff ought to look elsewhere too, as this is simply a collection of their (many) hits of the 80's and nothing too left-of-field."},{"Title":"The Best of U2 - 1980-1990","review":"This really has the best of U2 but it's not the best when it comes to the tablature.

This book is good for the amateur -- songs both easy and difficult. As someone who usually rips TAB from various internet sources, this book was not beyond my musical reading ability. Clear chord changes and tabbed notes that didn't require a magnifying glass to read. Sometimes there are cheat chord diagrams before each song, and sometimes there are not. You can figure out fingerings from the tabbed music tough.I don't expect I'll ever nail these songs in a note-for-note fashion; but for basic strumming I've got \\"All I Want Is You\\" and \\"Desire\\" already down.Better musicians will get more out of this book.

God bless in a special way all parents of autistic children."},{"Title":"Snapshots of Autism: A Family Album","review":"Jennifer Overton, calling on her extraordinary resources as a wife, mother, educator, actor and author, has produced a work of compelling intimacy and irresistible charm.The story of Nic--- a bright and beautiful boy who is diagnosed austistic--- is told with unflinching honesty and palpable love. Jennifer and her husband David move mountains to try to provide the best for their son, while making sure his unique perspective isn't crushed by well-meaning mainstreamers.The devices of poetry, art, screenplay, journal, and stage play are enlisted to make Nic's world accessible even to those who have never had an autistic child in his or her life--- and the ride is exhilarating!This book is luminous and painful and funny and profound--- and yet you feel as if you are sitting in Jennifer's kitchen, listening to it all as Nicholas walks in and out of the room. Go ahead--- fall in love with him!"},{"Title":"Snapshots of Autism: A Family Album","review":"I was taken into a new family last week: The Overtons of Nova Scotia. That is how familiar and real this book about living with an autistic child is--- Jennifer Overton draws you in with the story of her very human reaction to a superhuman challenge.She and her husband David have one child, and they eventually learn that Nic is autistic. Any expectations they have had for their son now have to be re-drawn in the colours of the austistic spectrum, and it is not an easy task.Nic's mind is unrelentingly detailed, literal, specific. Shapes and numbers are easy--- feelings and approximations send him spiraling into panic. But there is great humour here as well, and absolutely fascinating looks into an autistic mind and how it works.Jennifer uses a lattice of holidays and famiy celebrations to catch and contain the wild tendrils of Nic's energy and observations, and the device is perfect for the construction of this &quot;family album.&quot; The letters to her son that begin and end the book are so full of pride and love that you cannot help the tears that come with reading them.In the end you realize you have become part of the famliy, and that Nic Overton is just an extraordinary young boy with equally extraordinary parents."},{"Title":"Snapshots of Autism: A Family Album","review":"I didn't expect to laugh so much. I know autism is a serious subject and that there is grief and pain involved for the parents. Those are included here, touched on, lightly. The trip to Peggy's Cove, for example, showed the heartache of this mother of an only child. But Jennifer Overton's book &quot;Snapshots of Autism&quot; is really a song for her beautiful son, and parts of it are amazingly funny. I think that's what makes this book so real and so touching.Jennifer does discuss Lovaas and ABA and various other kinds of teaching and dietary theories in her search for just the right things to make Nic's life easier. But mostly this book is about the *inside* of their family--- the real deal, the gut-level day-to-day life with an autistic child. Shattered dreams replaced slowly with new hopes. The celebration of small triumphs. Laughter. And a lot of love.This is an amazing book!"},{"Title":"Snapshots of Autism: A Family Album","review":"Jennifer Overton's &quot;Snapshots of Autism&quot; shines with honesty, humour, pain, and love. This extraordinarily intimate and accessible book draws you into the Overton's life with their son, Nicholas, and spins you through the cycles of holidays and birthdays and special occasions experienced through the filter of autism. I promise you'll never look at Hallowe'en the same way again!You'll cheer Jennifer and David's amazing energy and commitment in the face of an indifferent and political medical system as they fight for the best learning environment for their only child. But mostly you'll fall in love with Nic, with his razor-sharp mind and his terrible fears, with the absolute purity of his life.This book is not only a source of information and support for those parents who will recognize the grief, the rage, the despair, the courage and the pride that Jennifer and David experience, it is also a love letter to Nic.

The idea of America losing technology, and magic returning to earth is brilliant. This is no generic hack and slash novel, and it isn't some boring philosophical treatise, either. The characters are real, and have both strengths and flaws. They get in fights, yet have to rely on each other for survival.

This book comprises eleven chapters by ten different authors. Overviews of medical genetics and the ethical ramifications are given by Patrick Guinan and Agenta Sutton. The implications of genetic screening are discussed next by Edwardo Rodriguez and Pat Marmion. Healthcare and cultural aspects are reviewed by Edwardo Rodriguez, Peter Riga, Robert Maloney and M. J. Iozzio. A broad overview of Nazi eugenics is presented by Ken and Bettylee Garver. Finally, the Genome Project and cloning are discussed by Edwardo Rodriguez and Stanley Jaki. This series of articles was previously published in the Linacre Quarterly, the Journal of the Catholic Medical Association. While genetics is an established medical discipline which has, and will, contribute greatly to health there is the potential for iatrogenic problems. Genetic defects can be corrected but what are the ethical implications of human cloning and eugenics? The Catholic church supports therapeutic genetics but has reservations about more problematic genetic efforts. The book is relatively brief and not overly technical. All in all, this book is a good review for medical personnel and lay people."},{"Title":"Megatrends 2000: Ten New Directions for the 1990's","review":"This book is the 1990 update to the blockbluster, Megatrends, by John Naisbitt from 1982. The date in the title of this book is a reference to the end point of the forecast period.I had first read the book near the time when it came out. I decided to reread it now because I was interested in examining how accurate the forecasts turned out, and then to study how the correct forecasts had been developed. Content analysis has long been a Naisbitt forte, and I wanted to see another test of its strengths and potential weaknesses.I was pleasantly surprised at how well the themes had held up. These include:(1) a global economic boom prompted by the information economy, freer trade, and a government bias towards economic expansion over political ideology.(2) a rapid growth in participation in the fine and finer arts.(3) the emergence of free markets in socialist economies. Here the progress has even been more rapid than most would have expected.(4) increasing similarities in global lifestyles with increased cultural nationalism.(5) privatization of the welfare state in the western democracies.(6) economic and cultural influence of Pacific Rim countries and California greatly expand.(7) women become much more important in leadership roles.(8) biotechnology makes great progress and raises major ethical issues, while biology becomes a more common metaphor.(9) religious revival led by fundamentalism and the desire for deep, personal experience.(10) triumph of the individual in becoming free of institutional constraints to become more in charge of one's own destiny. &quot;The new responsibility of society is to reward the initiatives of the individual.&quot;The conclusion talks about the importance of overcoming the scourges of disease (such as AIDS) and global poverty.As a result, I would have to give this book five stars for forecasting . . . realizing how chancy that business is by nature.On the other hand, I found the book to be long and tedious to read. I gave it three stars for the quality and clarity of explanation of the key points. In many cases, examples drone on and on, but relatively few points were made or supported directly. Perhaps it is just my perspective, but the chapter on women in leadership seemed particularly weak from this point of view.Equally of interest were the things that were not forecast: that communism would fall except in a revised form in China and Cuba; that the United States would become a more dominant economic and political power; that Japan would have a terrible decade; and that government power in the world would be curtailed at such a rapid rate. But few got these factors right, and they used different methods from Naisbitt and Aburdene. I suspect that is because content analysis should be slow to pick up on these kinds of changes, but power analysis works well as demonstrated by James Dale Davidson and Lord Rees-Moog in their excellent books using this method.Where will we be in 2010? A continuation of these trends is likely, but what will be the new ones? You'll have to think about that for yourself.After you have finished enjoying this book and thinking about what it means for your future, I suggest that you consider how you can expand your own individual potential. As the Army likes to say, &quot;Be all that you can be.&quot;Use the irresistible trends to your advantage for breakthrough gains!"},{"Title":"Megatrends 2000: Ten New Directions for the 1990's","review":"In contrast to the first Megatrends book that came out in 1984, this book is way off the mark. His economic analysis is always interesting, but this time, for the most part, his trends have not panned out. I found this book to be a much slower read than the first Megatrends. Even so, I still plan to look for Megatrends 2010 when it comes out."},{"Title":"Megatrends 2000: Ten New Directions for the 1990's","review":"Having been so impressed with the original &quot;Megatrends,&quot; I was very much looking forward to this edition. Unfortunately,the authors' crystal ball failed too often this time around to inspire much confidence. One major flaw, I think, is that there is much less content analysis used in tracking these trends and far too much fluff in the way of interviews and anecdotes. Too, in &quot;Megatrends,&quot; statistics were used to back up forecasts derived from content analysis. Here statistics and surveys seem to be the sole basis for the forecasts. Perhaps the authors' thought the original work was too dry, or perhaps they were just trying to capitalize on a winner with a quick and dirty follow-up. In any case, this book was not nearly as insightful, or useful"},{"Title":"Megatrends 2000: Ten New Directions for the 1990's","review":"Sounds up to date, and I bought it thinking it new, but tired forecasts from 1990 can easily be beaten by anyone of average thinking from the vantagepoint of 2000.

When I first read this book in 1996, I was quite impressed by it, and believed that all the trends would come true. Hindisight ten years later shows that the book was actually quite prescient on many points. For example, the book correctly predicts the resurgence of nationalism in various parts of the world as the Cold War ended and the USSR broke up. Another predicted trend is the privatization of many social services in the US and other countries.Other predictions, like the Asian takeover of the world economy, has not occurred. Specifically, the financial crises of the last half of the 1990s essentially eliminated fifteen years of profit, property price increases, and economic growth in Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. But all in all, still a good book, and a good reference source for economic data for the late 1980s and early 1990s. As futurist books come, this is one of the better ones to come out in the past several decades as the author uses a wealth of statistical information from numerous fields and sources to justify his claims."},{"Title":"Megatrends 2000: Ten New Directions for the 1990's","review":"I'm afraid I'm going to have to disagree with a good many of the reviews written on here about this book. I first read this book in the mid 90's and am in the process of re-reading it today, and to a great degree many of the chapters are indeed still relevant. The strongest chapter in the book has to do with the rise of women in leadership positions. This was very forward looking in 1990 when it was written. At that particular time, there was only one female U.S. senator (Nancy Kassebaum), today there are 13 (including two each in California and Maine).Admittedly, there are some areas where the authors got it somewhat wrong. For example, the renaissence in the arts has not occurred at the expense of sports to the degree that the authors had thought it would. And the age of Nanotechnology has not been as progressive as they predicted. However, these are trivial points in an otherwise fine collection."},{"Title":"Megatrends 2000: Ten New Directions for the 1990's","review":"The authors missed the point of the book, which should have been to forecast the future socio-economic trends, and not their personal desire. They barely mentioned the way technology started to shape the new century, and they were so focused on Europe being at peace for almost 50 years that totally forgot there were other countries with enough forces to create worldwire conflict (terrorism, oil interests, territorial struggle, ethnical issues, etc).My most honest advice is: don't bother, and don't waste your time, unless you simply want to see how much they failed at what they intended to do. The writing is too simplistic and barely factual, and there's no serious authoring or editing effort behind this &quot;book&quot;."},{"Title":"Megatrends 2000: Ten New Directions for the 1990's","review":"Guess what word does not appear in this book?

The reprise of fundamentalism was noted in the book, and the turn to the political right, and the concurrent diminution of the &quot;welfare state.&quot; Naisbitt et al. wrote about &quot;no more wars.&quot; They should have read Lorenz, &quot;On Aggression,&quot; before saying all that.

Lindsey examines several vital issues heretofore untouched, charting a course for the future of child welfare with remarkable clarity of vision.In this most comprehensive and thoroughly annotated volume, Lindsey traces the transformation of child welfare into child protective services.Lindsey explodes the many myths which have served for so long to perpetuate this transformed system. Chief among them are those most commonly held misperceptions that child welfare programs based on the &quot;residual model&quot; have reduced child fatalities by any measure, and that they have served to increase the welfare of children overall.Lindsey explores in depth the critical decision-making processes involved in making the determination of whether or not to remove a child from his home. He clearly demonstrates that the field of child welfare lacks a scientific knowledge base from which to draw, and that the critical decisions involving the welfare of children and families are inherently unreliable.Rather than offer another book replete with anecdotal &quot;horror stories,&quot; Lindsey offers instead a scholarly work which will serve to greatly enhance the reader's understanding of the history and dynamics of child welfare, and the forces driving its transformation from child welfare into child protective services.Lindsey offers a blueprint for a future which will better serve children. He offers a compelling argument for the criminal justice system to assume responsibility for dealing with the problem of child abuse, such that the child welfare system can return to its role of addressing the overall well-being of a greater number of children.He makes extensive use of charts and graphs, while managing to do so in such a way as not to distract the more casual reader. His use of advanced statistical analysis is explained clearly, for the benefit of all readers. Few books can so magnificently reach out to touch such a potentially diverse audience of readers, reaching the intellect as effectively as it does the heart.This is one of those rare volumes that no student of the child welfare system should be without. Put this book at the top of your list."},{"Title":"The Welfare of Children","review":"Have you ever read a book on a subject with which you have some expertise and wonder if the writer is just making things up as he goes along? This was nearly the experience in reading this book by Duncan Lindsey a UCLA professor.The first problem is that Lindsey takes the shotgun approach to arguing his points against the existing child protective services system. Instead of centering his arguments on a few specific issues and developing his thesis, he tries to address every conceivable aspect of the child welfare system and liberally scatters his thoughts and comments without a strong basis of analysis. The result is a loose confederation of ideas none of which with a firm foundation for acceptance.The second problem is that Lindsey attempts to address issues for which he does not seem to have actual knowledge. His attack on the legal basis of the child protective system, for being a civil model rather than a criminal model, is amateurish (at best). His understanding of the social workers management of the case lacks first hand understanding of the field. I wanted to give some examples to explain my points, but it would result in a much longer review than what I prefer. It must suffice to say that I believe the professor's expertise is apparently more academic and esoteric than real life.A third problem is Lindsey's contradicting himself in various parts of his book. For example, he spends time discussing how children's deaths is increasing, but in another chapter argues that death is but a small area of concern for protecting children. He titles this later chapter as \\"Child abuse, the red herring of child welfare.\\" Therefore, he argues that the current system is not doing enough to protect children from destructive parents, but argues that too much of the same system focuses on a problem that is a small issue in child welfare. So which is it?It is unfortunate that the author did not sacrifice a couple of hundred pages and written a monograph on one of his points. Then he could have provided a document worth quoting and considering. Instead, we have a lengthy diatribe absent developed charges worth remembering."},{"Title":"Country Lawyer","review":"Another good book by Bellamy Partridge.

I read it and basically it doesn't have too much to offer. It doesn't give straight foward help, it kinda beats around the bush. I have learned some new things in this book, such as how to start conversations with women and ask openended questions with them (expect the phrase \\"Whats your story\\" about 1000 times). But basically, the information in this book is vague. It does not give instant results like we guys all planned to, but it gives you a starting point and hangs you out to dry on your road to being a PUA instead of a chump.Being a 20 year old college student and living in a city full of females who are stuck up, I figured this book would help out. Unfortunately, it did not do me too much justice. If you guys found success in this book with the opposite sex, give yourself a pat on the back. Funny that female reviewers (like the one below me), might get a joke out of this book because they go around making others feel like crap. I for one really don't recommend this book because of it's vague subject matter. If you want to read a good book, I recommendHow to Succeed with Women, because that book gives more info into detail.

It does teach the basics, but there are other books out there that do it a lot better. I'm a good looking guy, and I'm pretty decent at picking up women. I have read books like this in the past, because I feel it is important to always try to better yourself in all areas of life. I also think it is important to recognize seduction techniques and utitilize them to your advantage for not only picking up women but in your career and other aspects of life. The Lay Guide is for people that have absolutely no clue or experience. I just don't like the way the book is written and some of the lines he tells his readers to use on women are so cheesey and corney that I would never consider using them. The best lines are the ones that come off the top of your head and are witty. As you build confidence, you will become more witty. Its a step by step process. The book does have some good points but there are other books that are written so much better! If you need help in this category look up The Game and Rules of the game by Neil Strauss.

But for some reason it just never worked in real life - women flaked out, ran away, wanted to &quot;be just friends&quot; (aargh! I bet you know the pain of that one).Well this book has opened my eyes. And reading this book has been both a painful and a pleasurable experience. Painful because now I realize what it is that I've been doing wrong all the time and all those mistakes that could have been avoided and all the girls I could have gotten had I known the stuff in this book before. Yet pleasurable because now I'm finally starting to realize what's going on with women, what it is that they're REALLY thinking (not what they're just saying they're thinking), what they really want in a man, what turns them on and what turns them off, and how to be the man women really want.All I can say is how come we guys didn't have this book 10 or more years ago?

The ideas of eliciting values, neg hits, social proof, and (most especially) not paying for a woman's attention are very powerful and real. They do help you build a connection and gain status, they are also applicable in situations outside of dating if you know how to handle yourself. It is for this reason that the book receives four stars.This book also has an element that makes it very controversial for some. It was written by a guy who hopes to help other guys get laid, period. The author's goal is to teach you how to get into a woman's pants. That does NOT have to be YOUR goal in order for you to benefit from it. Those who say that the book is chauvanist are right, and those who say it teaches men to pick up on women in all the wrong ways are focusing on some of the more controversial, and in my opinion crazy, theories presented (such as \\"GM style\\" ignore it).One reviewer mentioned, and with some disgust, that the book advocates a man not buying a drink for a woman unless she \\"pays\\" for it with a kiss on the spot, among others. Again, this goes back to social proof, status, and whether or not you're paying for people's time. It also goes back to self-respect, you just met a woman and you're buying her a drink? You better owe her.One does not have to demand sex from women, or be as chauvanistic as this author, in order to benefit from the technology involved. Trust me, I know. I was an AFC, I then went on to dating six girls at once and found it to be an emotional, psychological, and physical drain not worth the time the emptiness gave me. I did, however, use the techniques in this book to land the love of my life and have since been in a relationship for 1.5years. This book is social dynamics 110: how to handle a dating scenario from the man's perspective. Great book, shady perspective, buy it anyway and apply the techniques in the manner that is most congruent with your personality and demeanor."},{"Title":"The Layguide: How to Seduce Women More Beautiful Than You Ever Dreamed Possible No Matter What You Look Like or How Much You Make","review":"The pickup artist has come of age. No longer relying on a hairy chest and a medallion to seduce the opposite sex, a thriving community has appeared on the net, exchanging the latest psychological tips and tricks that lead to a woman's bed. But these people aren't geeks. When it comes to seducing women, they are the real deal, only granting grandmaster pick up status to acolytes after the 1,000th babe has been laid.And here lies the depressing fact about this book and the inevitable controversy that it has aroused (Germaine Greer having claimed that such men are rapists - seems like some feminists don't want to abandon notions of 'sexual ownership', 'faithfulness', 'duties'.etc at least not when it comes to men). The book is a thoroughly exhaustive anaylsis of what it takes for a man to get a woman into bed, compiled by men who have certainly 'been there and done it' many, many times. They know what works and what doesn't. And for all the complex psychology of 'neg hits', 'NLP patterning' etc, basically the recipe for success is that you have to show the lady you are a dominant caveman. When it comes to seduction, nice guys finish last, something to be avoided when you apparently have an average of 30 seconds to demonstrate to a potential pick-up that you can swing the club harder than any rival Fred Flintstone in sight. It appears deep down, women still want the hairy chest after all.Feminist critics of the pick-up culture, incapable of any self-criticism as they are, tend to miss this point. Instead of focusing on why such macho men want to have sex with every good looking woman they see (and why shouldn't they?), perhaps they should ask why nearly every good looking woman would rather have sex with men who heed well tested advice such as 'Always be in Control (rule no.1)' and 'Never be Mr Nice Guy (rule no.7)' than men who read Germaine Greer or buy flowers. Feminists (and women in general), constantly make misandryst generalisations about men being inherently aggressive, dominant etc, forgetting that whatever essential nature men might have, if we have it at all, it is because women have spent our evolutionary history choosing it as an attractive sexual trait. And judging from this book, there is little prospect of hope for our evolutionary future. In fact, as women become increasingly financially independent of men, they are correspondingly free to choose sexual partners on solely primitive criteria (whereas before at least a man with lots of money was likely to have reached his position as Alpha male through, to some extent, a high IQ and not simply agressiveness or having the biggest sexual organ).'Love between the sexes is a war', declared the gloomy Swedish playwright Strindberg. If you want to sharpen your armoury in order to have sex with lots of beautiful woman, this book is essential reading. For those who wish to understand the degradation of contemporary feminism into little more than a sexual trade union for embittered middle-aged women, then also read this book and the controversy that has surrounded it."},{"Title":"The Layguide: How to Seduce Women More Beautiful Than You Ever Dreamed Possible No Matter What You Look Like or How Much You Make","review":"Although I believe 100 percent that Mr. Clinke is himself an exceptional PUA, he lacks proportional talent in writing.The book lacks structure and at times is very inconsistent. One minute it's \\"get her phone number\\" and then it's \\"never ask for the number, let her give it to you\\" and then it's \\"never give her yours\\" and so on. The book is full of little rules for behavior, that A. often contradict a previous rule, and B. are painfully vague and generalized. In the end, the book is just a messy pile scattered ideas that places no focus on the fundamental issues, leaving out all of subconscious things and subtleties that truly determine how women feel about you. Needless to say, it does not live up to its silly and excessive title, which promises the world but more than likely will just set the reader back even farther in the game. After reading it, he will most likely say to himself \\"wow, if i can't get laid after reading this book, then there's really no hope for me at all\\". Let's keep in mind, this book is the thoughts and experiences of one man (and not much of a literary man) whose personal successes are the culmination of his unique qualities... not that of the general population.

I just got to it today and am quite impressed. I first heard of the author last year as I was reading Neil Strauss's The Game. This is not a typical dating book as there is very little fluff in these pages. Just about everything he addresses is valuable, and, I believe, accurate. He shows readers the route in which they too can go from being Average Frustrated Chumps to Pickup Artists. His methods are sound and proven and I honestly believe they work. If you ask me, guys like Clink know more about women than most psychologists because they interpret them as they are and do not allow political correctness to contaminate their analysis. That this clashes with the Woman as Superior Being role society has cast them into all the more illustrates his insightfulness. The only problem with the Pickup Artist and his choices is that the sacrifices one has to make are far too great to be considered. When you're 19, obtaining women is more important than everything else in life combined. Luckily, as we get older, our needs become more textured and we can properly see that women are just one element in the good life. Sex and romance are exquisite, but we should be grateful that there's so much more in the world apart from them."},{"Title":"The Layguide: How to Seduce Women More Beautiful Than You Ever Dreamed Possible No Matter What You Look Like or How Much You Make","review":"I bought this book and I wanted to say that its great.

I'm not out to be a player but I want a girl friend like every other guy out there. If you dont know how to approach, meet and talk to women you dont know, how is that ever going to happen? It wont and you're going to be lonely for the rest of your life. Knowing how to talk to women, get phone numbers and get a girl friend for someone who has no experience seems like the hardest thing in the world. This book can help over come a low selfesteem. The fact is 99% of the time its the man who has to approach a woman to meet her to eventually start a relationship with her.

And, that while women also notice men's looks, it's actually how a man makes her feel that matters most. And, given that the attractive woman has been approached again and again by guys that want just one thing, they've consequently heard every line in the book; their internal defense mechanism is on high alert. This book explains how to understand their mind set, engage the conversation in an interesting manner, and treat them like a human being.It explains why don't like jerks, but fall for them. It explains why nice guys don't get anywhere.

That's why I think, if you read attentively this one, you don't need other books on seduction.2 It is comprehensive of different strategies.

I own all the rest, and I can say doc loves book is only for after you get a girl. the rest focus on how to get her. Those are the only solid books I can honestly reccomend to get tight game. Robert greene's art of seduction is supposed to be good, but that is the only one that I have yet to read, that I even heard was worth while. Buy a book, read it... try the stuff out at least 10 times... then you will know if the book sucks. I could list way more that were not worth reading then books that were solid."},{"Title":"The Layguide: How to Seduce Women More Beautiful Than You Ever Dreamed Possible No Matter What You Look Like or How Much You Make","review":"Great book, every man should read this!Follow up book should go into more detail as some statements are contradictory but overall worth every penny"},{"Title":"The Layguide: How to Seduce Women More Beautiful Than You Ever Dreamed Possible No Matter What You Look Like or How Much You Make","review":"Actually everything in the book IS helpful, and a OK read... but most of the material is FREE on the net already.The stuff from &quot;The Layguide&quot; was mirrored on all kinds of websites all over the place before it ever became print.

Anyway, this book has changed my way of viewing women forever for the better. I have a deeper appreciation for them now that I understand more what's going on in their head and it gives you more confidence not feeling like you're going into approaching women blindly doing the same things wrong. And the best thing of all about this book IT DOES NOT RECOMMEND DATING! At least not until AFTER you've seen some action. Lastly, I recommend purchasing \\"How to Attract Anyone, Anytime, Anyplace: the smart guide to flirting\\" by Susan Rabin to go along with this book because it goes deeper into techniques The Layguide recommends but didn't have the time to explain fully.

The truth is, that it's not going to happen like that. These books on picking up women have some interesting concepts, and they do offer some good advice, but the reader needs to be aware that these books written by PUAs are simply a sales pitch to a $1250 seminar, that is a sales pitch to a $4500 seminar, and that leads to personal tutoring, and Thousands of more dollars. I have know two people who have gotten duped by this. And these two guys are getting laid less than when they first getting into this and just trying and failing.I would highly recommend three books that will give you all the information you need to speak to a woman and carry yourself in a way that might attract her.1) Art of Seduction by Robert Greene: A historical account of some of the great seducers, and what made them effective.2) Irresistible Attraction: by Kevin Hogan and Mary Lee Labay: This book scientifically evaluates what Charisma is and how to develop it.3) God is a woman: by Ian Coburn: (My Favorite) This book is very well written by a man who evaluates the train-wrecks he had dating, then dissects what went wrong and how he improved on the next woman. He actually walks the reader through every step and teaches as he entertains.*** And by the way: None of the above three books is a sales pitch for a useless seminar."},{"Title":"The Layguide: How to Seduce Women More Beautiful Than You Ever Dreamed Possible No Matter What You Look Like or How Much You Make","review":"I just finished reading this book after reading The Game by Neil Strauss. Whereas the Game reads like a personal memoir, this is more of an instructional guide so the two complement each other very nicely.I get the point. The Layguide is a very finely tuned technique of mind-control, neuro-linguistic programming, and behavioral science to seduce women. I agree with another reviewer's observation that PUAs including Clink are better at reading women's psychology than most psychologist. Modern women are far more educated and financially independent compared to women in the past, but their psychology remains pretty much the same.The tone of this book may offend some male readers and many female readers, but I think Clink has the right mindset about this. The point is for males to be in control ALL THE TIME. To most women, you are just one of so many people that passes by in their life and not that important. Men have to treat them the same way. To us, they are just one of so many people that passes by in our lives. There is absolutely no reason for us to spend so much time, money, and energy and cling on to someone that doesn't give a damn about us. So take care of yourselves and your needs before they show some kind of respect. Unless women (especially beautiful ones and in general) are far more empowered and are willing to take equal responsibilities for themselves, they are likely to remain selfish and picky for what they perceive as alpha males. That may be a while from now as many researchers suggest that it may take as long as a century.Many of the reviewers dismiss the advice and techniques as basic, but I have to disagree. They are definitely not super-advanced, but at least intermediate. There are some good stuff in every chapter so don't forget to try them out. But be selective in what you apply because some techniques don't work for majority of women.Overall, I enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"The Layguide: How to Seduce Women More Beautiful Than You Ever Dreamed Possible No Matter What You Look Like or How Much You Make","review":"I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the book. The title claims a lot, but I must say I started noticing positive results almost immediately. What I learned is that it all really depends on your attitude (not your looks or money etc). It is very hard though for the average guy to pull the right kind of attitude out of thin air (or try to emulate the cool guys we see getting all the chicks on TV or in a club etc). Fortunately, there's lots of helpful advice on how to attract and seduce women in various situations and ultimately, how to develop the right kind of attitude so that you'll become a natural success with women all the time.Some of the ideas in this book may seem radical at first, but once you start trying them out, they will all start making perfect sense. All in all, this is heaps and mounds better advice than in any other dating book I've happened to come across (and I've read quite a few)."},{"Title":"The Layguide: How to Seduce Women More Beautiful Than You Ever Dreamed Possible No Matter What You Look Like or How Much You Make","review":"Let me start by saying I have read THE GAME, The Mack Within, Ross Jeffries, as well as Mystery Method.

Read The Art of Seduction, and you will be well on your way to having women desire you to a degree that is truly shocking. I am a true believer, and I owe the author Robert Greene a debt that cannot be repaid. It is mind-boggling how much women really want to be carried away by their desire.

And I owe it all to LayGuide, which now, thankfully, is also available on paper, so I can actually give this book to my friends and improve their success as well. The thing I like most about it, is that is does not try to force one &quot;magic&quot; system down your throat but presents you with a wide selection of some of the most successful seduction systems currently out there, so just choose the one you feel most natural with and then go with the flow.

Getting over your \\"approach anxiety\\" is the first step and should be taken care of before you try to become an expert!

You can't just sit by and wait for something to happen. This book goes into great detail on the subject of picking up women and in my opinion it jumps around a lot. On the other hand there is a plethora of valid real world things you can use that will help you. I've seen some people's reviews that criticize Clink's advice to go up and talk to every woman you find attractive. I don't see why... how else are you going to desensitize yourself to talking to beautiful women? So in other words saying something is ALWAYS better than nothing. Take that if nothing else.

Standard Disney quality, vibrant colors and even a slightly delicate touch to some of the images. The story, though... I love the Pocahontas story and I admire Disney for trying. I don't think they did it very well here, and I can't blame adapter Justine Korman, who had a lot to pack into very few pages.Pocahontas is expected to marry Kocoum, a man chosen by her father, but she feels that this isn't the right path for her. Grandmother Willow, a tree spirit, encourages her to follow her heart and her dreams. These lead her to meet John Smith, a man who has just arrived from England on a ship that is looking for gold. When it begins to look like their people plan to go to war, Pocahontas and Smith attempt to put a stop to it and risk death to keep peace.The jump from Pocahontas and John Smith speaking different languages to them conversing freely is rather abrupt. Overall, the book tries so hard to cover so much material that it really doesn't do the story justice. Fans of the Disney movie will enjoy the book and they're the important audience. If it gets them reading, it's a good thing; for a better thing, buy ISBN 0307128865, another edition of the same tale.ISBN 0307128865 - FIVE STARS! This Disney edition of Pocahontas, adapted by Margo Lundell, is a lot better than 0307302008. Lundell's version feels slower paced but still packs in most of the important details of the story. For simplicity, I'm re-using the recap from the other edition.The illustrator of this edition is Jose Cardona and his work lives up to Disney's reputation. It's interesting to compare certain of his works with the ones in the other edition, by Don Williams, because they chose some of the same images. Cardona misses some of the delicate beauty that Williams captures, but his images are equally appealing. Lundell is still forced to deal with the sudden ability of Smith and Pocahontas to speak to one another, but she handles it slightly better.

I finished the book and was left asking myself, \\"But what was the point?\\" With each chapter, I would feel renewed faith that surely something big was about to happen, but that moment never came. It seemed to me like there weren't many moments that made you surprised, or shocked, or sad or anything.There are large gaps of time missing between some of the chapters, which makes you wonder what exactly happened. This is particularly true when something happens between Jordana and Pieter (I won't say what).

It kept my attention, sometimes, though, wondering if the writing would be as good as it was a few chapters ago. By the third part I found myself cringing a little at Noel's it's-this-but-it's-also-the-opposite descriptions. The story is rather anticlimactic. I think Angie's low-point was the climax, but I'm not sure - and the characters seem, in the end, rather passive, unmotivated, and morally unconcerned. This made the story a little less enthralling than it could have been, even though I was pulling for Angie - given the context, I'm not even that sure exactly for what, to be stable? to get better? for her family to get better? is there a better? - the whole time.It does, however, allow the reader to vividly delve into the life of someone with bipolarity, and has led me to wonder if I don't have a disorder of my own."},{"Title":"Halfway House","review":"I enjoy reading books about mental health issues, as I am a long-time sufferer of depression. This was very believable, but I did have trouble keeping track of the characters. Also, at times it the story did seem to drag a bit."},{"Title":"Halfway House","review":"Katherine Noel's debut novel reads like she wanted to write a book about a girl with bipolar disorder and built the story out from there, making sure the family was sufficiently screwed up and that each plot point served the greater theme. The end result feels forced, mechanical; above all, inauthentic.It's a shame, really, given that in the hands of a more capable writer, Angela Voorster might be an effective protagonist. She's headed to an Ivy League college, a star athelete and suddenly stricken with mental illness in the middle of a swim meet. What's most interesting about her is that she never quite comes to terms with her bipolar disorder. It's as much a part of her as her hair color or height, another stage of her life that will surely pass. Though at times the descriptions of other halfway house residents or Angela's post-breakdown interactions with friends and family can be tiresome, Angela is, at her core, an inspired character. What proves that is that she doesn't always think or do what you'd expect.When Noel writes in Angela's point of view, the narrative becomes wrought with conflict. Perhaps switching perspectives is the author's major mistake here. As they tell their sides of the story, the reader can't help but want to skip forward and follow Angela again. The supporting Voorsters are too thinly drawn to carry such huge chunks of the novel. Anyone could predict marital trouble for Angela's parents and the standoffish reactions of her brother; they don't need extra time and their actions feel like padding that just distracts from the main story."},{"Title":"Halfway House","review":"I'm not quite sure how to feel about this book. On the one hand I thought the author did a great job in describing Angie and her illness. I got real sense of what mental illness is like for many people in the way that Angie was portrayed. I found her to be a totally believable and sympathetic character and would have loved to have more written about her.On the other hand, I could find very little, if anything, interesting about Pieter, Jordana and Luke. I found these characters to be written quite flatly. In fact I thought Pieter seemed very much like a periphery character at times. From the beginning of the story, it appeared to me as if there were serious issues going on in this family before Angie's illness was diagnosed, yet the author never gives any indication as to why, other than Angie's problems exacerbated them. Yes, we're told about the history of Pieter and Jordana's relationship, but there's really nothing to indicate just how and why their problems began. And, while I liked the character of Wendy, I'm not sure I really needed to know so much about her. We catch a small glance at her own family life when she and Luke go to Iowa for her sister's wedding and then nothing.There's a couple of other things that somewhat bothered me as well. First, I found some of the sex as written was really unnecessary. Others may disagree, but for me, it added nothing. Also, there are a lot of drug references in the book, both legal and illegal. And again, while others may disagree, I found the part in which Pieter snorts cocaine to be eye-rolling laughable. I thought it was an unnecessary attempt by the author to be \\"cool.\\"It's obvious that this author has talent, and I would be willing to read any other works she has. This is a good book, but somewhat lacking."},{"Title":"Halfway House","review":"I found this to be one of the most depressing novels I've read in a long time. Not because of Angie's mental illness which was really the only interesting aspect but because of the other characters. Ugh. I could not find one positive thing to react to in either of her parents....both struck me as self-obsessed depressives. Luke and Angie seemed to have some spunk at least but even his girlfriend, Wendy, seemed flat to me. Reading about Jordana and the baby bunny rabbit at the end did me in. Was it supposed to be some clever metaphor for her (failed) relationships? To me the book ended with not much hope or resolve and by the end I wish I hadn't wasted my time."},{"Title":"Halfway House","review":"First of all, I loved the novel. However, I wish that Ms. Noel either had conceived a different ending or (if she did) had possessed the courage to allow it to play out. The only love demonstrated anywhere in the novel was between Angie and Luke -- brother and sister. As i neared the end of this wonderful book, I hoped that the author would overcome her own personal temerity and/or prejudices and allow the love between Angie and Luke to play out into the taboo of incest. I visualized the two of them in the rental truck heading back to California to begin a life together based on their intense love for each other. In Middlesex, Jeffrey Eugenides certainly had the literary courage to tackle a non-mainstream topic and did so quite successfully. Perhaps Ms. Noel is simply a traditional thinker and a trip into a taboo topic never occurred to her. If the thought did occur to her and she chose to ignore it she violated a basic rule of a great novelist -- create characters and then get out of their way."},{"Title":"Halfway House","review":"In Katharine Noel's stunning debut novel Halfway House, The Voorster family is slowly fracturing, the scourge of mental illness gradually unraveling their lives. Angie Voorster is just seventeen when the novel opens, a gifted swimmer and a star athlete, the young girl is determined to make the regional swimming team. She has a bright future, she does well at school - even writing papers for extra credit - and she has lots of friends - college is an absolute surety.But one afternoon at a local swim meet, Angie begins to act strangely, exhibiting the first furtive signs of an irrevocable emotional imbalance. Suddenly, she dives headlong into the pool at the start of the boys race, \\" a high, arching dive that made an almost imperceptible splash,\\" swimming right to the bottom, convinced that she doesn't have to breath underwater. Her father, Pieter desperately tries to save her, but the damage is already done; Angie surfaces a broken girl, inhabiting an out of order life.The rest of her family - - Jordana, her mother, and Luke, her baby brother - are driven to the darkest depths, left to pick up the pieces, and to battle the unending trauma of mental illness. Angie's admitted to the hospital, where they diagnose her as schizophrenic, but the first anti-psychotic they put her on makes her even more psychotic, with her neck and jaw muscles stiffening so tight that she can barely talk. She tries to convince herself she will be okay as long as she is careful, as long as she keeps her hands out of site, as long as she keeps her thoughts on track, \\"as long as she focused in the small details. \\"After sending time on a rehabilitative farm, \\" where you aren't allowed to say words like psycho or crazy,\\" she returns home, somewhat stabilized, but a shell of her former self. Her face puffy from drugs, and constantly battling tiredness and lethargy, she's become a needy, dependent girl. Her parents, never clear whether they are actually doing the right thing, attend to the rigors of her everyday life - checking that she's taking her meds on time, and driving her to the clinic for blood work.Angie tries to hold it together, but on a weekend trip to Harvard to visit her boyfriend, she goes off the rails. She ends up back in hospital, and then at home, and then a group house for the mentally ill, where she drifts amongst her roommates, forming fractured loosely knit friendships. She gets odd jobs, goes off her medications and loses them. Off the meds, she picks up men she doesn't know, gives all her money to pan handlers, buys extravagant and useless presents, and destroys possessions.It's a splintered, insecure and sad life, and Noel's strength is her ability to portray Angie's inner turmoil spanning most of her young adult life. All Angie wants is a life of coherence and a little grace, where food can actually taste like something and where thinking about sex doesn't make her feel exhausted and sick. She's tired of feeling simultaneously exhausted and ramped up - depression connecting her, and time feeling like a spiral line to her.The descriptions of Angie's emotional life are bleak and uncompromising, especially the images of her hurting herself. Her brain chemistry can manufacture obsessions without her consent, \\"her thoughts like water bugs, skating rapidly over the surface of water - a sink trapped and blind and hitting the angles. \\" This grind of life equally affects her family: Pieter, a renowned cellist, finds solace in his music, beginning to draw away from his wife, \\"feeling literally as though he were being unhinged, the parts of him gently stealthily moved apart. \\"After Angie's first breakdown, Jordana embarks on an affair and then immerses herself into frenzied projects - boxing up donations for Goodwill, and then loosing heart. The fear she feels for Angie warns down to an anxiety so persistent \\"it almost feels like she'd always had it.\\" Whilst Luke seeks the comfort of his neighbour, Khamia, escaping the trials of his own house coming as such a relief. Later Luke comes to champion Angie; his love for his sister so protective, so fiercely loyal, yet also tinged a guilt that he should have done more for her.There's no doubt that Halfway House is a totally compelling account of the unmoored state of incapacitating psychosis, where life is transient and where mental illness unfortunately becomes just a fact of life. The drama comes from the author's ability to intuit the everyday, and it is the nature of the tragedy, one in which characters fail to find that much comfort with the other. It is impossible to imagine more upsetting circumstances than those the Voorster family must endure.Angie ends up as a drifter, not ill but not really functioning, and dependent in lithium for her mental health, most of the things she'd once valued in her life she'd lost, or left behind, or destroyed. At the novel's end she becomes a woman, contemplating a new life in California, homesick for the girl she once was, and with a longing so deep and unanswerable that it \\"takes her breath away.\\" Mike Leonard April 06."},{"Title":"Halfway House","review":"The Voorster family is an average American family at the start of Noel's \\"Halfway House.\\" But this typical family is thrown into upheaval when the eldest child, Angie, is diagnosed with bi-polar disorder.

It's just all overwhelming and I wondered throughout the whole book if the family was already damaged or if the daughter's illness damaged them.The end was too abrupt and just didn't make sense."},{"Title":"Halfway House","review":"Yes, this book was good in that it seemed to accurately portray the breakdown of a family when one of its members actually \\"breaks down\\".However, it is an extremely depressing book in that no one seems to get any better. Angie floats around, mostly in a paranoid state, in and out of hospitals, group homes and her own home. Luke leaves college, leaves his girlfriend, drifts around for a while, then gets back with his girlfriend and goes back home (doing what, I'm not sure - the book wasn't clear on that). Pieter keeps playing his cello and wallowing in self pity. And Jordana never fully copes or even comes to term with Angie's illness. She is also drifting.This may be reality, but it is an extremely depressing reality. I have read \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" and loved it.

The gift of Halfway House is the strength of its characters. They are true to themselves in their smallest actions and biggest moments of drama. They make mistakes, they love hard, they are real and unforgettable. On one level, this is a book about mental illness and its repercussions. But it's not the story you may have read before, in which a person is depicted as a victim of mental illness, that diagnosis (whatever it may be) taking the place of character. Rather, the writer shows how Angie's manic depression is one facet of who she is, and while its repercussions shake the whole household, the lives of her parents and brother are equally multi-faceted and well developed. Another thing I admire in its fresh treatment of mental illness is the way that the book shows the cyclical nature of Angie's disease as she goes on and off medication. This is the rare novel that manages to be both sprawling and focused. The chapters remind me of short stories in the sense that many of them hinge on quiet moments with large consequences. Yet tension builds from chapter to chapter, which is why I found the book so hard to put down. I simply loved it."},{"Title":"Halfway House","review":"I read an online review of this book in my Amazon recommends.I took a chance,and I just finished this incredibly gripping read in less than 2 days.I actually have a hand cramp from holding the book for so long without rest.I felt like it was my family,or so many families out there who have to deal with mental illness and family stress.I didn't want this book to end.I can't wait to read what Ms.Noel comes out with next.I highl recommend this book!You won't be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Halfway House","review":"It is not surprising to read that the author of HALFWAY HOUSE Katharine Noel, has spent time working with the mentally ill as this book is very believable as well as beautifully written. Noel describes the repeated roller coaster rides that define the life of manic/depressives realistically and without undue sentiment. Though we sympathize with Angie we never forget what a difficult, needy and often unattractive person her mental illness has made her. Yet through her experiences she retains insight into life and at times a sense of humor. The book tells much of the story from the viewpoint of Angie's mother, father, brother, and brother's girlfriend/wife. These characters are all well drawn - warts and all."},{"Title":"Halfway House","review":"Before I picked up this book I thought it to be a Memoir.

The father Pieter is a celloist. Her mother Jordana (not really sure what she does) but she seems a little unstable and she \\"cheats\\" on her husband and Angie's brother Luke just sort of turns away from her and acts as though she is not sick.Very Intriguing Story-If you've yearned for a deeper understanding of Bipolarism through the eyes of something beyond Doctor's text book theories. Please pick up and enjoy."},{"Title":"Halfway House","review":"Reminiscent of \\"Ordinary People,\\" this novel tells the story of an academically gifted teen, who is also a champion swimmer, who develops mental illness, in this case bipolar disorder.

We also hear from Luke's college girlfriend Wendy, a levelheaded young woman who can't help but feel that she sometimes takes second place in his life to Angie.The family naturally feels the strain, as Angie struggles to recover some semblance of her old life, even with debilitating medication side effects and repeated hospitalizations. Her condition is described so well, it's hard to believe the author doesn't have firsthand knowledge of mental illness (though I'm not saying she does or doesn't). But the characters all come across as real people, not stereotypes. The story arc is similiar to \\"Ordinary People,\\" only with the omission of the sympathetic, miracle working therapist. In fact, the only major flaw is the lack of attention to just how Angie manages to recover. We never see her discussing her condition with a therapist. Usually, insight into one's condition is necessary for recovery, as well as medication and supportive family/friends. All of a sudden, she's markedly better, and though we root for her, not a lot of clues are provided as to why.

A good student and champion swimmer, she is bound for college. That she is a bit manic is chalked up to normal teenage anxiety and pressure. She is high-spirited after all! But when during a swim meet Angie dives into the pool and stays at the bottom, the Voorster family finally realizes that all is not well with Angie.Katharine Noel's first novel, HALFWAY HOUSE, follows the Voorster family in the years after Angie's breakdown and subsequent bipolar disorder diagnoses.With the incident in the pool, Angie and her family --- her younger brother Luke and parents Pieter and Jordana --- set out on the long road of trying to understand Angie's disorder, stabilize it and cope with it. Of course, it is toughest for Angie. She misses a year of school and graduates late. She is heavily medicated and still swings between mania and suicidal depressions. She lives in a series of hospitals and facilities apart from her family.But each family member is challenged by her illness. Angie's condition begins to pull apart her parents' relationship. Pieter, a professional cellist, becomes withdrawn and introspective. Jordana, who had been having an affair, feels exposed, guilty and needy. They struggle to keep their marriage intact.Luke, less ambitious and successful than his sister in their adolescence, flies under his parents' radar, practically living with his high school girlfriend before eventually going away to college and falling in love with a mild-mannered student who is the opposite of his sister in many ways. This college girlfriend, Wendy, feels that Luke is more committed to his sister than to her --- and in many ways she is right. After years of dealing with Angie's unpredictability and emotional and physical needs, Luke is centered on his sister.And as Angie grows into adulthood she feels it necessary to assert her independence from the family that, of late, has defined themselves by her illness.Noel's prose is lovely; poetic yet realistic and very readable. She portrays her characters with honesty and intelligence, allowing them flaws and a gritty humanity while keeping them likable.Angie's manic and depressive episodes are stunningly written. Both extremes feel claustrophobic and intense for the reader. Noel's descriptions of Angie's thoughts and actions are unflinching and often uncomfortable. But this is also what makes the novel unique and stunning.HALFWAY HOUSE is about a family once ideal but now surviving the best way it can in a difficult and highly charged situation. Noel lets the Voorsters each respond to the crises in their own way, never allowing the reader to forget that this is Angie's story.In Angie Voorster, Noel has created a memorable character, one who is warm and amazing, strong and sometimes frightening. While it is mostly Angie's story, Noel's novel is also about the dynamics between Luke and Angie, and how they depend on each other.HALFWAY HOUSE is a very intense and enjoyable debut from a young novelist with promise and talent.--- Reviewed by Sarah Rachel Egelman"},{"Title":"Halfway House","review":"Katherine Noel's exhilarating novel, Halfway House kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end.

My local newspaper, the Omaha World Herald, once carried her editorials on a regular basis. They also reprinted at one time the conservative opinions of Thomas Sowell and Michelle Malkin. Alas, no more. Now I get an eyeful of Bill O'Reilly and George Will balanced by a bunch of leftist hacks I'd just as soon ignore. Although her biting wit has been missing from my paper for some time, I fondly remember spending many a day perusing Charen's observations about the latest left-wing lunacy. Reading her articles and her two books, I soon came to the conclusion that dear Mona is sort of an old guard conservative, meaning Ronald Reagan era conservatism. It's not surprising, really. Charen once worked as a speechwriter for Nancy Reagan as well as served time in the White House's Public Affairs Office. She also helped spread the word about the White House's policies in Central America. For a comprehensive examination of 1980s conservative/liberal battles as seen through the eyes of Charen, read her book \\"Useful Idiots.\\" If you want a book that addresses specific liberal social policies that have led to domestic disaster, read this book.\\"Do-Gooders: How Liberals Hurt Those They Claim to Help\\" feels like an echo of conservative treatments released in the 1980s. There is nothing original here in terms of subject matter--Charen writes about the destructive influence of left-wing thought and action concerning homelessness, schools, crime, racial sensitivity, and the welfare state. Nearly every author in the conservative camp covers most of these issues at some point, but Charen's book is slightly better than most thanks to her reliance on massive statistical evidence to back up her horrific assertions. And they are horrific in the sense that decent Americans have let this nonsense go on for far too long, now going on forty years too long. Ever since the counterculture blighted the American landscape, we've had nothing but problems that seem to go on and on without end. Problems including but not limited to sky-high divorce rates, massive explosions in the numbers of both violent and nonviolent crimes, a tidal wave of costly entitlement programs that bring dependency to thousands upon thousands more citizens every year, an increase in drug use, and an embarrassing number of single mothers.Charen begins her book by casting us back into time, back to the days of the mid to late 1960s when the Supreme Court expanded the rights of criminals through the Miranda and Mapp cases. Sure, these rulings certainly helped some innocent people charged with a crime escape wrongful convictions, but they led to far more thugs getting off on technicalities. These rulings also opened the door to a leniency towards criminals that continues to shock the public. Charen shows us how Judge \\"Turn 'Em Loose Bruce\\" Wright operates in the courtroom, and how Justice Harold Baer let a gang of narcotics dealing thugs go because their efforts to flee from the police constituted \\"a normal response for residents of Washington Heights\\" since it is widely known in that neighborhood that cops are \\"corrupt, abusive, and violent.\\" Leniency on crime not only insults the intelligence of most Americans, it also breeds more crime and fosters distrust of authority in poor neighborhoods where most of these offenses take place. Throw in at roughly the same time LBJ and his \\"Great Society\\" programs, which threw billions of bucks at insolvable problems while normalizing riots and other objectionable behaviors, and you've got a foundation for endless heartache.According to Charen, it was only a hop, skip, and a jump from legitimizing criminal behavior to endorsing the idea that the mentally ill deserved to walk the streets just like the rest of us. After all, if criminals are only practicing an alternative lifestyle surely the residents of the local asylum should have an equal opportunity to live life to the fullest. Thus began the emptying out of state hospitals and the concomitant rise in homelessness. Someone suffering from a long-term illness, like a man named Larry Hogue who terrorized a neighborhood in New York City for years because the authorities couldn't put him away, did not deserve to spend his days locked up where he could receive long-term assistance. Nope, liberals argued that Ronald Reagan and a lack of affordable housing led directly to the plight of the homeless. Remember the days of Comic Relief in the 1980s, the heavily hyped Hollywood gala that ran for nearly the entire span of Reagan's presidency? Homelessness, these people told us, was a big problem exacerbated by having a heartless republican in the White House. Amazingly, homelessness disappeared the day Clinton assumed the presidency. Wow! Slick Willie cured a problem plaguing millions by merely taking the oath of office! Actually, according to the author, studies conducted by numerous groups found the number of homeless in America was at most 250,000 people, hardly the numbers regularly cited by liberals.Charen relentlessly repudiates further liberal policies and actions. School vouchers, a touchy political hot potato, comes under fire. Liberals hate vouchers because they suspect, and rightfully so, that allowing students to attend private schools will undercut the education establishment. They won't come out and say that, of course, because to do so would amount to admitting that most of their campaign contributions come from the teachers' union. In other words, it's far better to let the nation's kids languish in mediocre public schools than give up those reelection dollars. Nice. I could go on and on, but why bother? There is plenty of relevant information in the book that explodes many of the political left's most cherished beliefs. Readers sick of watching the country take a downward spiral will want to check this one out. Then read \\"Useful Idiots.\\""},{"Title":"Do-Gooders: How Liberals Hurt Those They Claim to Help (and the Rest of Us) (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Let me start by saying that I am a right wing conservative.

A book that exposes the supposed compassion that liberals have for their fellow citizens. The very people that they hurt with their policies and ideas.The book is well presented and very helpful esepecially if you like to debate liberals, but...Mona Charen gets a little scary when she implies that making police have proper search warrants and giving the Miranda warning are bad ideas. WHAT??? I guess I have a strong libertarian streak in me, but then again so did the Founding Fathers so I am in good company.Charen sees everything in black and white with no shades of gray. Some of her statements will make your jaw drop. Her idea of Utopia is a United States where the police will have the power to do anything in order to stamp out crime. She definitely sees little use for civil liberties and constitutional protections.

It succeeds on many levels, but the most important point it makes (which those who dislike the book seem to dislike the most) is that the results of your actions are actually more important than your intent. The Do-Gooders of her book are those, primarily liberals, who want to do good things for many of the right reasons. Their problem, which makes it all our problem, is that they are unable or unwilling to use objective measures to determine if the results match the intent.If you enjoy this type of book, I would direct you to my favorite socio-political author Thomas Sowell. His book The Vision of the Anointed: Self-Congratulation As a Basis for Social Policy is another powerful indictment of those who do things because it makes them feel righteous - even though they leave disaster in their wake."},{"Title":"Do-Gooders: How Liberals Hurt Those They Claim to Help (and the Rest of Us) (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I disagree with one previous reviewer that said Do-Gooders was not intended to be read by the politically moderate reader.

(Ironically, there was much more tolerance of diverse views among true liberals and conservatives 40 years ago, as there was more civilized discourse in arriving at solutions that benefited society as a whole.) Unfortunately, the impact of \\"liberals\\" on the institutions of marriage and family, religion and education has been so devastating during the past 40 years that there are few today who recognize the contrast between the values that were upheld for a stable society prior to the \\"revolution(s)\\" of the 1960's and what has become commonplace instability and dysfunctionality. Having truly arrived at social anomie approaching anarchy, which probably even well-intentioned liberals never intended, many today view Mona Charen's on-target assessments as simplistic, when in fact, they outline the unintended destruction of the most basic values of decent human society. One comes away from this book only hoping that those of us who grew up with \\"golden rule\\" values can revive them through our children's upbringing, and refusing to succumb to erroneous political philosophies and policies which reward the worst in society. As many of us in management were taught in business school, you get what you reward; you don't give benefits to those who haven't earned them, or who demonstrate undesirable behaviors, and hope for what you want."},{"Title":"Do-Gooders: How Liberals Hurt Those They Claim to Help (and the Rest of Us) (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I've always enjoyed Mona Charen's columns and have read her regularly since 2000 or so. It was both her work as a columnist and the book's title that made me pick up \\"Do-Gooders.\\" First, I have to say that I was taken aback by the quality of her efforts here. Charen conducts an extensive amount of research and shares it all with her readers in these pages. This is true of the education chapter in particular which seems as if it's quotation after quotation. With crime, there's no better way to illustrate the failures of liberalism than to address the careers and words of Mayor John Lindsay and Ramsay Clark. Their therapeutic responses to crime exacerbated nearly every social evil in America. It seems as if everything that the utopian mind addresses or modifies turns into a complete nightmare. It's better to have a carpenter and a plumber design our laws than a few dreamers at a university.Charen's writing style is pleasant and informative. This is no easy to dismiss polemic because Mona Charen is no Ann Coulter. She does not call those she disagrees with names or insult them. The author lets the disasterous nature of their decision making speak for itself. My guess is that the left probably will not deal with this one directly and that they will be content to let it largely go unreviewed. It's too lethal a critique of the nanny state for them to even begin to mention."},{"Title":"Do-Gooders: How Liberals Hurt Those They Claim to Help (and the Rest of Us) (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Do-Gooder: An earnest, although often naive social reformer. In politics, Hollywood, Academia and in our left-leaning mainstream media, liberals want the American public to believe that THEY know what's best for the poor and the middle class. And they also want us to believe that anyone who disagrees with them is not only wrong, but morally inferior, cold-hearted--even evil. Liberals do not wish to be judged by the consequences of their actions or the outcomes of their policies--they think their intentions are good enough: If an idea for a policy or program is based on good intentions, that automatically makes it a good idea. Never mind the mess that they have made with the welfare state, public education, race relations, crime and just about any domestic issue one can think of. Four decades and trillions of our tax dollars in runaway spending, and look at the mess we have today. Syndicated columnist and best-selling author Mona Charen tackles these issues and shows the harm these liberal do-gooders (some more well-meaning than others) have brought upon those they claim they wish to help, as well as the harm brought upon the rest of America. As Charen herself writes, \\"This book is a chronicle of failure--the failure of liberals to help those they set out to help. But it is also a moral challenge. Liberals must be called to account for the havoc they have created in so many lives. They must be asked to offer something more than good intentions when their actions lead to disaster.\\" And Charen does hold them accountable for their bad ideas and does not let them hide from the real world facts which disprove their naive theories. \\"Do-Gooders\\" is just as good a read as \\"Useful Idiots\\" was, and I look forward to reading more of Mona Charen's wisdom in future books in addition to her brilliant column."},{"Title":"Do-Gooders: How Liberals Hurt Those They Claim to Help (and the Rest of Us) (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Mona does it again...like her or not just try to argue against the facts she presents.....it is true liberals are hurting all of us in America...good reading for everyone that needs to know the other side of Liberal thinking...it has destroyed most of Europe and now is coming to America.A must read...for the informed...."},{"Title":"Do-Gooders: How Liberals Hurt Those They Claim to Help (and the Rest of Us) (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I was a conservative but, because of the widening income gap between CEOs and working class, Enron, etc. I became a Liberal....until, my local library pulled these books from its shelves and put them on the FOR SALE rack for $.50.

That, in a nutshell, is the argument of Do-Gooders by conservative journalist Mona Charen. In six briskly written, heavily footnoted chapters, Charen demonstrates that liberal policies on crime, race, welfare, family, homelessness, and education-though well-intentioned-resulted in more crime, racial animosity, poverty, family disintegration, and homelessness, as well as a seriously flawed education system.The untended consequences of liberal social policy result from a failure of moral imagination. According to Charen, liberal thinking \\"looks at the world from the perspective of a person with troubles-whether self-imposed or not is irrelevant-and attempts to compensate him without regard for the way this special consideration will affect the majority and without recognizing that special favors are not always good even for their intended beneficiaries.\\" In my opinion, Charen's sentence states the matter exactly right.True liberalism-the idea that personal freedom is a high, if not the highest, political virtue-respects a person's right to do as he pleases. But it also refuses to insure the free person of the negative consequences of his bad choices. True liberalism works because it assumes that people will rationally consider the possible outcomes of their actions and choose what is in their best interest. A truly liberal society is thus a moderately conservative one precisely because most people will not make choices that carry large personal risks.The liberalism Charen criticizes, then, is not true liberalism, which is also known as classical liberalism or libertarianism. Rather, it is the deformed liberalism of the Great Society, which maximized individual choice and minimized personal risk. Not surprisingly, people began to make bad choices because they knew that the government had stretched a \\"safety net\\" beneath them to catch them when they fell. And fall they did. A direct line of cause and effect stretches from Lyndon Johnson to Jimmy Carter, from the Great Society to malaise, from the zenith of post-war American liberalism to its nadir.The weakness of Charen's book is one-sided criticism. Its subtitle is How Liberals Hurt Those They Claim to Help (and the Rest of Us). But is liberalism totally hurtful? Yes, Great Society liberalism was an abject failure. It produced ungovernable cities, like the New York City of the late 1960s and early 1970s. And yet, Charen concedes, liberals achieved at least one truly great moral victory-the Civil Rights Movement. Charen does not explain how the very same liberals could attain such heights and stoop to such depths. Consequently, her book opens itself to the criticism that she is not telling the whole truth.The answer to that critique is simple: The Civil Rights Movement was liberalism's great moral victory precisely because it was a truly liberal movement. Did not Martin Luther King Jr. dream that one day all Americans would be judged by the content of their character, rather than the color of their skin? This is a truly liberal sentiment, and the kind of liberalism America deserves."},{"Title":"Do-Gooders: How Liberals Hurt Those They Claim to Help (and the Rest of Us) (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I thought it would be a lightweight book, but it is really an enjoyable read.

I was a little put off by the introduction, which seemed to be heavy on emotion and light on true information (sort of the way I think a liberal would try to make a case for something). However, with Chapter 1, all the doubt vanished. Charen has done the research and she has the facts, which she recites bluntly to counter the arguments of the liberal left. I think she proves the case that African-Americans are no more than pawns in the liberal agenda. This book should be required reading for every African-American, so they can become more informed on the issues and the facts surrounding liberal myths. The truth will hurt, but if we think back and recognize the abysmal failures of the left-wing agenda, we will begin to realize that the only ones who benefit are criminals and socialists. Look at the education system; in its years under the liberal approach, the United States has gone from first place to third-world status in the quality of education. Take a look at crime; crime drops under conservative leadership and rises dramatically under liberal leadership. The ones who suffer are minorities and the poor who are victimized by the criminals. Yes, the left has distorted and omitted the truth to incite a mistrust of authority and engender racism against whites, but Charen reveals the facts to debunk the stories. Read it; think about it; question it. Everyone needs to become a more informed voter, and this book will help us all to get there."},{"Title":"Do-Gooders: How Liberals Hurt Those They Claim to Help (and the Rest of Us) (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"I'm a conservative and I normally like most of the conservative books I read. I wanted to like Mona Charen's _Do-Gooders_, but the book failed in so many ways that I got about a third through and just could not devote any more time to it. Skimming the last two-thirds proved that once you've read a few pages, you've read the whole book.Charen attempts to lay out how all the finagling by \\"Big 'L' Liberals\\" is responsible for about every social ill we have today. She does a decent job making her case that the road to hell is paved with good intentions and Liberals found every road to that particular destination.But therein lies the problem with _Do-Gooders_. Even a conservative who's been in a comatose state for the last decade will recognize all her talking points. Everything here is old news. Yes, we know how Rudy Giuliani cleaned up Dinkin's mayoral mess in NYC. We know the myth concerning black churches being systematically burned in the South by racist groups. We know that gun control advocates are wrong. And Robert Bork sure did get the shaft, didn't he? That's all common knowledge and old news, though. In fact, it seems like this book was written ten years ago.There are other issues. Charen is a capable writer, but she seems really forced in spots here, especially when she's trying to channel Ann Coulter. But Coulter she is not; her attempts at being arch fall flat and she repeatedly writes with trepidation, as if she knows she can't be as funny or quick with a knife to the belly like Coulter can. Instead, she goes more for facts. However, her points are belabored in some places and poorly supported in others. She could have tried for the academic approach or stayed within a screed-like style, but what she delivers here tries to be all things to all people and it just does not satisfy anyone, particularly a conservative audience that has higher expectations.Truly, this book has no audience. It's not scholarly enough to please conservatives looking for a Bloom-like approach, moderates will be turned off by her attempts at Coulter (I found her comment about Jesse Jackson \\"mau-mauing corporations\\" to be particularly ill-advised), and Liberals wouldn't read this if they were paid to do so.So who should read this book? I have no idea. I certainly can't recommend it. There is no doubt it is a worthy topic, but this book is simply too lightweight to be a solid reference. The talking points seem ancient in light of GWB's re-election, too.Normally, I like conservative books, but I can't recommend _Do-Gooders_ to anyone. Pick up something by P.J. O'Rourke instead.

In the name of compassion we have harmed the poor and stifled their incentive. In the name of civil rights, we have created lawlessness and violence. In the name of freedom of religion, we've eroded our values. In the name of equality and freedom of speech our educational system has crumbled, taking our graduates from first in the world to near last. In the name of justice we have destroyed businesses and increased unemployment, neglected the welfare of society at large, and put burdens on our nation that is breaking its back. The vision that our founding fathers had for this nation has been distorted into something they would not recognize.Mona Charen's book is and eye opener and a must read for everyone who cares about the future of America. Liberal judges, teachers and professors, politicians and media elites, have foisted distortions of our founding principles on society. In the process they have nearly destroyed the black family, instilled distrust and hate within the minority community, twisted America's true history, and stolen her soul.Ms. Charen is a genius at laying out the facts of how we got to where we are. She uses solid statistics and evidence to show how these liberals rip at the fabric of American society and jeopardize our children's future.The long fifty year experiment with liberalism is a proven failure. Its time we turned things around. Electing conservative leaders is only a beginning. We have much work to do.

She manages to do something in her writing that the left is ages away from. She presents well organized well thought out proven points about the negative effects of today's liberalism WITHOUT personally attacking prominent liberal figures. The left could really learn something from her. This is why it is deserving of a high number of stars. More mature voters are willing to listen to your case if you don't scream and shout or even publish a book titled \\"so and so is a big fat idiot\\". Whatever their motivation, it seems the left has to resort to desperate measures of name calling in order to get you to listen them.Charen backs up her claims with 20 pages of bibliography from credible sources. Whether you dislike her or not, you can't deny is a very intelligent intellectual conservative woman with strong cases which she is able to back-up. This book requires you to take time and read thoroughly in order to grasp the many facts and cause and effect instances presented.Don't we all wish the country's liberal leaders would read \\"Do-Gooders\\" and see the effects of their social policy for the past 15 years or so covered in this book.

On page 138 the author states, \\"Women and children both suffer when children are born out of wedlock. According to the Department of Justice's National Crime Victimization Survey, never-married mothers experience twice the rate of domestic abuse that married, divorced, or separated mothers do. They also suffer much higher rates of violent crime.\\"How is this a fallacy? Well, first of all domestic violence often begins prior to marriage. So, if you have 100 mothers being abused by their boyfriends, and only 20 of those marry the perp then when these victims are surveyed then it would show that 80 women who chose wisely not to marry their perps are 'never-married mothers.' Thus, the survey results would show that more non-married mothers were being abused than married mothers. Many of these non-married mothers have hopefully left the perp altogether.In the author's world, those women who married are morally superior to those women who refused to marry the perp who is using them as a punching bag.Most of the battered women I encountered in battered women's shelters are married to the abusers. Those who do not marry their abusers, and fit the young woman having premarital sex mold, are often living on their own or with friends/roommates/relatives, thus they often do not have to leave home in order to get away from their abusers. It is generally far easier to get away from your abuser if you are not married to him due to legalities when you have children with him.The author is ignorant of the dynamics of violence against battered women. She twisted one small statistic from a NCVS in order to attempt to prove to the reader that marriage is safer for women with children.The author continues on that page by writing that illegitimate children suffer more from depression, etc. Well, an example of a well known 'illegitimate' child would be that of Bristol Palin's baby. How does the Palin family talk about the situation? I have heard it mention quite often how it was a mistake and other such negative references. Children are quite intelligent and pick up on things. How is a child not to be depressed after hearing his/her family talk about his/her being a 'mistake'?

Liberals have nothing left to stand on but noise and deceit.All of liberalisms policy \\"triumphs\\" over the past 50+ years are shown for what they really are: abject failures. This book shows the RESULTS of liberal policies and explains not only why they failed but why they were doomed to fail from the start.

Everything they touch withers and dies, while they bask in the warm fuzzy glow of the self congratulatory echo chamber their media and Hollywood apologists have created for them.Read this book, and you'll see that liberals no longer have any excuse for continuing to stand for policies that have proven - time and again - to devastate the very people they claim to be helping.

However the title is misleading and the text is more thoughtful and the ideas presented are less volitle than the title would suggest. Most conservative \\"books\\" are nothing more than smear filled screeds intending to demonize, not only \\"liberals\\", but the word liberal itself as though a dictionary definition is superfluous - the worst offenders of course of meaningless right wing propaganda are Ann Coulter (the queen of neurotic \\"lib-phobia\\"), Hannity (who doen't feel his bizarre opinions need facts and logic to back them up because his \\"lib-phobia is incurable), and of course Rush Limbaugh (who pretends he is the dean and only professor of an imaginary course of study called \\"Advanced Conservative studies\\") a man who hasn't been right about anything of consequence yet.So here is at least a reasonable thinking \\"conservative\\" view that seems well thought out, even if off track occasionally. The flaws, and there are a few, begin with the supposition that the things conservatives find fault with are all the fault of \\"liberals\\", or \\"liberal thinking\\". It is an all too common thread in rightwing conservative screeds that the word \\"liberal\\" applies to any thought, idea, action, or political stance that they deem \\"wrong\\". Few if any define \\"liberal thought\\", or what liberalism is by definition according to every dictioary of the English language. Rightwing conservativism is so locked into a world view that demonizing opposing views is the way to convince people they are right and all other thoughts are not only wrong, but evil, dangerous and destructive. In short, right wing conservatives are so fearful of rational, reasonable debate and disagreements that they can only rant and rave, attempt to silence all opposition and smear anyone who dares to question their secret motto, which is, and I know I am breaking a sacred code mentioning this, but conservatives and their minions live by the creed: \\"Don't confuse me with facts, I've already been told what to think.\\"Mona Charen is a little above the worse offenders in the divisive fray that conservatives need to promote at every opportunity. She is a very adept author, is at least occasionally reasonable and defies the conservative mantra of \\"if you can't blind them with brilliance, baffle them with bull---t.\\" In fact this is the first book by a shameless conservative that I would urge flaming \\"liberals\\" to read, if only to be reassured that all conservatives are not as evil as Halliburton, Cheney (Nixon White House Stooge), Rove, Wolfowitz, Rumsfeld (also a Nixon White House Stooge),Delay and their unwitting dupe, Dubya.

It seems that she is only happy attacking others. It should be okay for people to have viewpoints, but to go out of the way to be venumous in her writings is very unprofessional. It seems more and more commonplace for people to make others wrong, than to work together to make things go right.The key is we need to find ways to make things better, even if you don't agree 100% with someone's viewpoint, it is important to respect other's views, figure out how to work together, and focus on the good things in people in stead of the one thing that's bad.

Or that Democrats have some kind of organized Master Plan to keep blacks voting for them by making them THINK they are discriminated against.She even blames liberals for homelessness, which is just too absurd to even comment on.

They know what's best for America's poor and middle class. I was called a 'liberal' by a man unknown at the local post office because I had a different opinion about a movie than his. I thought he was calling me a bad name! I hurriedly said, \\"No, I'm not conservative, either. I'm not political, not Democrat nor Republican.\\" It was funny in a way, but most disconcerting.According to Ms. Charen, liberals are \\"convinced that anyone who disagrees with them isn't just wrong, but morally inferior, cold-hearted\\" and possibly evil. I was treated by this self-righteous male as if I were all of the aforementioned.Apparently, all government officicals are liberals because they've messed up schools, crime, welfare (Phil Bredesen), homelessness (Ginny Weatherstone), and race relations (Arthur Friend). She attacks my favorite news anchor, Dan Rather; commentator, Bill Moyers, even Ted Kennedy, the only surviving brother of the clan. Her attack on Hillary Clinton is right on the money as she thinks she's something she's not.\\"Liberals must be called to account, for the havoc they have created in others' lives.\\" Good intentions just don't work if actions lead to disaster.

Lots of emphasis on black peoples's problems in the 1900's in the good USofA. The writer claims actor Danny Glover is sweet looking. Huh? Glover is one of the harshest looking peiople in cinema. Also, the author gives his ridiculous anger at not being able to hail a cab in NYC full credence. Sure since Glover made movies he owns the whole world (or at least all america right?). She also claims America increased the use of lawyers mostly to help black ameriacns in legal trouble. Clarence Gideon, who got everyone US-arrested to have a free attorney if so desired, was white.The author has a lot of facts to support her case of what a catch 22 racial situations in the USA are but biased statements like those above wreck her entire book. If blacks in america in the early 1900's had it so rough why didn't so many of them just move to Haiti?

Rather than a glib survey of the popular scene with sharp barbs tossed at the usual suspects, Mona Charen provides us with six powerful essays. She is a former White House speechwriter, and her gift for fashioning vibrant and passionate prose in the service of a well constructed argument shows in every page of this book.These essays take on liberal articles of faith and leftist bureaucratic groupthink. Mrs. Charen demonstrates how the culture of non-judgment and soft punishment is connected to the great increase in crime for the past several decades. She shows how blind the establishment has been to why Giuliani's policies in governing New York actually had an impact.She also illuminates how the race relations industry stifles progress and demagogues the issue of race in our country. Her discussion of the predictable (and predicted) debilitating influence the creation of \\"entitlements\\" has had on our country. To the point that one Supreme Court justice actually compared the entitlement of welfare to a medical license or a license to practice law. It is as if all jobs were sinecures and it was up to the government to allocate them according to their whim. You will just shake your head when see the foolishness of these policies laid out in this essay.Of course, more than one person predicted that these policies along with other changes in our culture would lead to fewer strong families and the cost this would have on children. Many bought into the notion that if the adults were happier divorced then the children would be happier. Those that said this was lunacy were shouted down. Nowadays, it is clear that government policies have made a powerful contribution to weakening families and harming children. Again, read what Mrs. Charen says and you will learn how this has been a decades long fiasco.The author also does a fabulous job in demonstrating how the homelessness crisis was a pure creation of the left on the one hand emptying the mental hospitals directly onto the streets and then misrepresenting both the mix of who was actually homeless and how many of them there were. Under Reagan and the first Bush there were gillions of them. Under Clinton, none. Under Bush II we are back to at least a kajillion. Ho, ho, ho.No one is taking lightly those truly in need and we all should help out local programs at our churches and homeless shelters and the Salvation Army to get food and shelter to all in need. The point here is the naked politics of the reporting on this issue.The last essay is on the tragic destruction of our public schools over the past several decades. The growth of the education bureaucracy has taken needed resources away from the classroom. The establishment cries for more money even when we spend hundreds of billions of dollars and keep increasing the amounts tossed into that sink hole. Yet what our students actually know shrinks - but they feel really proud of themselves and are experts on popular culture.If you are going to get just one book on important current issues I would recommend that you give this book serious consideration. Strongly Recommended."},{"Title":"Do-Gooders: How Liberals Hurt Those They Claim to Help (and the Rest of Us) (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Up until the Vietnam War. Democrats and Republicans quarreled incessantly over a wide range of issues, but one issue that they always agreed on was national security. That feeling of solidarity began to corrode as pro-Marxist thought began to infest America's colleges and mass media. Vietnam drew the battle lines. Iraq etched this line indelibly in the minds of the Left. Mona Charon sees this demarcation as an unbridgeable gulf that has led to a dissolution of much of the promise that used to be called, in pre-politically correct days, as the American Dream of true hope and sustained progress. In USEFUL IDIOTS, Charon takes the Left to task as she notes how liberals have ruined America in foreign affairs and now in DO-GOODERS, she does much the same as she focuses on how liberals have exacerbated a wide spectrum of domestic calamities ranging from urban crime to welfare abuse to homelessness and finally to the collapse of our educational system.Charon does not intend DO-GOODERS to be an even handed book. She intends it as a polemic against a mindset that places the rights and welfare of the unworthy individual against those of society at large. Charon notes how the Left has taken the traditional credo of America--the rights of the individual must be respected by the collective mass--and have transformed it into the rights of the individual must always supercede the rights of the many. She notes that the America of 2005 is one that would hardly be recognizable to the traditional Democrats of JFK, Hubert Humphrey, and Scoop Jackson. The police are hamstrung in their efforts to control crime. Welfare is seen as a socialist right rather than as what had once been viewed as a somewhat repugnant alternative to poverty by an earlier generation. Modern educational pedagogy stresses esteem and multiculturalism over what used to be called the ABC's. Charon notes that liberals are united in their efforts to remake America into what passes for culture in France and Germany. She wisely points out that both of those countries suffer from social ills that this country has avoided. The recent riots in France serve as a sobering harbinger as to what might lie ahead for the United States should the radical Left tilt of the Democratic Party continue unabated. DO-GOODERS is a timely book that proves once again that those who think that they know what is best for the rest of us do not even know what is best for themselves."},{"Title":"Do-Gooders: How Liberals Hurt Those They Claim to Help (and the Rest of Us) (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Original socialists (sic) wanted to emancipate the honest workman. Undereducated, he was not well equipped to improve this position or negotioate.At least in Europe, there was some success... between 1880 and 1920! They got -somewhat- liberated.Ever since, instead of freeing people, the socialist wanted to develop a nanny state, where Mother Knows Best(tm). And as the State grew, freedom deminished.It's pretty amazing so many people still fall for the trap of the Do-gooders, who lead people to believe they can get all kinds of freebies on OTHER man's wallet.Yet the only thing they achieve, is distributing money OUT of the wallet of average people, making them more dependent, and less able to lead their own lives, and make ends meet.Now everybody turns to the state for answers. Most money is however wasted to endless bureaycracy, not end-goals.Do-gooders very eloquently shows how this develops, the attitudes, reactions of people. Real world examples. I just hope many people read this. Once you do, not only do people immediately recognise them to be true, they might see the emerging trend.I don't remember who said this: \\"Knowledge is favourable to liberty. Educate the people and they will apply the remedy.\\"This is another startingpoint.. A good one, too."},{"Title":"Do-Gooders: How Liberals Hurt Those They Claim to Help (and the Rest of Us) (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Mona Charen is an accomplished author ,extremely knowledgeable and has put together a factual overview of the social changes that have taken place in America (and even to a greater extent in Canada) since 1960.By far and away,these changes have bee Liberal in concept and instituted and encouraged by Liberals.Whether you consider yourself a Conservative or a Liberal,you have to agree that the chances in Law &Order;,Racial Sensitivity,The Family,Welfare Reform,Homelessness,Education,and other aspects of Social Well Being have been Liberal in thinking.In none of these areas can one even attempt to argue that changes made have been to encourage Conservative ideals. The author examines the changes that have taken place ,shows what the results have been ,with back-up facts.You don't just have to take what she says without questioning;.You live with all these things going on around you every day.What Charen has so well laid out is how and why these changes were made.All you have to do is to ask yourself if these changes have tended to improve society or have they led to the problems we now face.Society faces continual struggles between Small Government-Big Government,Opportunity-Entitlements,Free Enterprise,Self Sufficiency-Dependency,Initiative-Victimization,Citizens-Hyphenated Citizens.What ever happened to the ideas of JFK who asked?\\"Ask not what your country can do for you.Ask what you can do for your country.\\"This book shows how much Liberal ideas have been entrenched into American Society,what great benefits were hoped for;and what has been the result.As Liberalism,Collectivism,Socialism and even Marxism continues to expand into every area of society;will it be for the better or not?It is worthwhile remembering that America was founded on well accepted beliefs,freedoms,self-reliance,small government and prospered and grew into the greatest country on earth where people of every stripe yearned to come. They came with only one desire ,to have an Opportunity .Opportunity has been replaced with the concept of Entitlement.This has succeeded nowhere it was ever instituted and the record is showing the same results in America.One can only assume that for Socialism to succeed;first Capitalism must be destroyed.As the newly elected guvernment ,under the Presidency of OBama takes over;there is bound to be further advances in Liberal ideas and solutions to society's problems. Will it become a better society or will it be more of the same--but with greater vigor?"},{"Title":"Do-Gooders: How Liberals Hurt Those They Claim to Help (and the Rest of Us) (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"If left-liberals really have such good intentions, then how come none of their proposed solutions ever work?Mona Charen says, in effect, that it's for two reasons:(1) Such liberals evaluate their efforts by intention rather than by results. They're more interested in their own moral opinion of themselves than they are in the actual well-being of the victims of their misguided 'beneficence'.(2) Their intentions aren't all that great anyway. Self-reliance and self-responsibility are a sound and reliable moral foundation for a stable social order; compassion and soft-heartedness are not.In order to substantiate these claims, Charen sorts through some thirty years' worth of 'social programs' drummed up by Sargent Shriver's Bleeding Hearts Club Band -- welfare, affirmative action, programs to deal with mental illness and homelessness, and so forth -- and points out just where and how they have failed. There isn't really any question that they _have_ failed, but if you require persuading on that point, Charen will oblige you.(She also clears up lots of mysteries in the left-liberal worldview. You may have wondered, for example, why people who have never had a good word to say about traditional families suddenly start slobbering about 'family preservation' when the subject of adoption comes up. It turns out that, in this context, by 'families' they mean 'crack-addicted single mothers and their boyfriends'.)I've got minor issues here and there. For example, I think there's some overkill in the blame-it-all-on-the-hippies department and some occasional silliness about the 'counterculture'. (Ken Kesey's _One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest_, though plausibly read as favoring some sort of reform of mental-health institutions, is hardly a manifesto for turning genuinely dangerous mental patients loose on the streets. In general, I think Charen resembles too many other current pop-conservative writers in failing to appreciate the real value of 'questioning' even if traditional 'answers' turn out to be right.) I also think she misunderstands or misrepresents Thomas Szasz a bit (and not just because she spells his name 'Szacz'). For that stuff, she loses a star. But her positive case is sound.Despite a mild lack of appreciation for the need to limit government behavior, she also doesn't claim (as a previous reviewer suggests) that the police should be able to do whatever they want. The problem is that criminals are _let go_ when they're not properly Mirandized, or when search warrants aren't properly executed, or . . . you get the idea. If there were a feasible way to punish the police for cutting corners _without_ freeing known criminals, Charen would presumably be all for it. (And at any rate, even fans of _Miranda_ should agree that some of her examples are pretty egregious.)A worthy follow-up to _Useful Idiots_ and a nice companion volume to Coulter's _Slander_ and _Treason_, Patterson's _Reckless Disregard_, and all your other current favorite liberals-have-it-all-wrong books."},{"Title":"Do-Gooders: How Liberals Hurt Those They Claim to Help (and the Rest of Us) (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"There are three books as of recent that I would suggest picking up. This being one, the others being 'Black Rednecks, White Liberals' by Thomas Sowell and 'Do As I Say (Not As I Do)' by Peter Schweizer.However just like Schweizer's work, Charen's 'Do Gooders' preaches to the choir. There is no doubt that both books are well-researched with pristine documentation. The critics found on this ratings board merely throw personal jabs at Charon, a trait of anyone who cannot debate facts and merit.Sowell's 'Black Rednecks...' cuts to the quick and takes you back to the origination of these phoney ideas and idealism that have had a tremendous negative impact on US society. You cannot deny the destruction of the Black family as it relates to one parent homes, more often than not they are saturated in poverty and chaos. This coupled with supposed civil rights leaders such as Jesse Jackson, who is more content in alligning his political tendencies and lining his pockets than actually accomplishing something, it is no surprise they are in the present conditions.Honestly I believe Charen tried to capitalize on the present wave of conservatism rippling through our political structure. Likewise this popularity has been, albeit accidentally, able to advance itself based on A. The failures of the left, B. The radical tone the left has taken (Soros, Michael Moore, Howard Dean, moveon.org, etc) and C. The deepening attachment the left has with the Democrat Party and vise versa.However what she truly fails to do in her text is show how conservatism has been bastardized by the Republicans for votes. As a conservative I believe in less governmental influence and I believe in only paying a minimal share, instead emphasizing self-reliance. There is no doubt that Reagan was more capable than Carter when it came to the role of the President. However a true conservative would have sliced the government down and not allowed it to grow. There is no doubt that Clinton was and is a morally irreprehensible individual, which one would think would influence his decision-making. There is no doubt that George W. placed a better equipped cabinet together than Clinton. However just as with Reagan, George W. (along with Clinton and his father George HW) failed to scale the size and depth of the federal government. Quite possibly the only shining achievement of conservatives in the past 20 years has been welfare reform, which only materialized because then President Clinton was dragged kicking and screaming to sign it into law.If you are just now switching your political leanings or need a refresher as to some truths about the left, then pick up all three of these books."},{"Title":"Do-Gooders: How Liberals Hurt Those They Claim to Help (and the Rest of Us) (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"In a fitting follow on to \\"Useful idiots,\\" Charen gives us more examples of liberal \`wisdom,' poor projections, data-free assertions, perverse psychology, and other well-intentioned (they are \`do-gooders' after all) but ill-conceived and ill-advised policies and practices from the left side.In 236 concise pages, with 21 pages of footnotes and a two-page partial bibliography, she makes her case. Sometimes the bad advice from the left is so bountiful that she appears to engage in overkill. Let's just say that there is plenty of evidence.Six chapters cover crime (the impact of Giuliani's zero tolerance policies on the murder rate in NYC saved thousands of lives; psychiatric hospitals have reduced their patent count by hundreds of thousands since the 1950s and guess where they end up), racism (heavy-handed, dishonest Democratic party pandering to African-Americans means that Dems get 85% of the African-American vote but not since LBJ the majority of the national vote, and LBJ's civil rights legislation passed because of Republicans and despite Democratic opposition), welfare (Charen quotes single one mother of six children from six different fathers who tells NYC mayor John Lindsay that it is her job to bear children and his job \\"to take care of them.\\"), families (traditional two-parent families are the best form of poverty prevention ever invented), homelessness (Charles Osgood projects 19 million homeless by the year 2000, using the conventional wisdom of Mitch Snyder's admitted made-up figure of 3 million homeless in the eighties; see psychiatric population, above), and education (public schools spend little of their budgets on students, books or even teachers who teach, and when they do teach the subjects increasingly have little to do with a useful education).Depressing and disturbing but detailed and devastating.Note: On p. 194 she identifies Blanche Lincoln as (D-AK).

This book, like any other that focuses on one political party, mixes heavy criticisms with fact to make a one-sided debate. While it doesn't necessarily slam the opposition, it takes aim at particularly well-known, visible liberals and whole periods in American history and debases them with some fact and some fiction. It's easy to research the facts she presents and see that there is truth to some of her statements. However, as with any book pushing one political agenda, she skips over the shortcomings of her own political party and their hand in the way America current stands. 6 of the last 10 US Presidents and 7 out of the 9 current Supreme Court Justices are Republican and were nominated by other Republicans, which makes for over 30 years of Republicans running the Presidency and Supreme Courts. While she does make some good points, trying to put the entire blame for problems in the US on periods of US history and people who don't agree with her is almost silly. As most of the other reviewers here mention, she is preaching to a choir of the already converted. I don't believe in this day and age that the problems we encounter here and abroad can be based solely on the actions of one group, nor can the problems be solved solely by one group. I also find it interesting that she would attack feminism and Civil Rights the way she did. As an earlier reviewer pointed out, without people taking new and different measures, sometimes extreme, to prove their points, racism and sexism would be more rampant and widespread than it is in our culture.The moral of the story is that if you define yourself as a Conversative, right leaning, or strict Republican, this will be a good book for you. If you are a strict Democrat, a liberal, in the middle, or any other affiliation, you may not find this as interesting as others."},{"Title":"Do-Gooders: How Liberals Hurt Those They Claim to Help (and the Rest of Us) (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"The first premise of the Mona's new book is that almost all progressives end up hurting the very same people they say they are trying to help. Mona says \\"the ideas that took root in the 1960s were uniformly self-indulgent, childish, anti-intellectual, irresponsible, and destructive. \\" One might ask, what is self-indulgent about trying to help blacks out of Jim Crow, or trying to stop the illegal Vietnam war that was a template on how to be hated, and more importantly feared, worldwide? What is childish about finding out that your \\"parents\\" are intentionally misleading you and then actively demanding truth? What is anti-intellectual about using our brains to realize that major intellectuals on both sides have always been for hire, and thus like all good debaters can expound on any view with the right \\"incentives\\"? What is irresponsible about seeing your beloved country becoming more hated in Vietnam, and rushing in to brake the war machine when you see your honorable neighbors getting killed? What is destructive about trying to stop unnecessary destruction and suffering? Well, Mona is not talking about the common man at all here. To her, the sixties were self-indulgent, childish, anti-intellectual, irresponsible, and destructive because the kids made it very hard for the PR firms, advertising guys, big aggressive companies and politicians to continue to manipulate them wholesale. If you lie to us enough, we stop trusting you and start trusting each other, and that's the real threat.-Then Mona gets totally into how progressives have been soft on crime (with some good points in the New York City story) in a way that ends up really hurting the average American. Now 9/11 took a horrible toll of 3,000+ innocent civilians. But, through retaliation we have killed 3,000+ innocent civilians (our pound of flesh) in Afghanistan and then 100,000 innocent civilians in Iraq (info: the British medical journal, the Lancet) so far this war. It's one thing to want to be tough on crime but we're not talking about an eye for an eye anymore in the far bigger global picture. We're now talking 34 eyes for one eye. Wow. Granted, the message is clear; no country would dream of successfully taking on the United States. Only a crazy person would take on someone far more powerful who thinks a vengeance ratio (involving solely innocent bystanders) of \\"thirty-four eyes\\" to \\"one eye\\" is fair. And a crazy one-eyed man and a crazy diabetic (Omar & Osama), who, as no one wants to discuss, are both still free, seem to fit the bill. Why not reframe Mona's crime dialog as: who is softer, the left or right, on stopping innocent civilians everywhere from being killed by American actions? Isn't that the bigger question? It's the bigger crime. If the question asked before the war was \\"Do you think the taking of innocent lives should be responded to by the taking of innocent lives?\\" What would you have said? We all saw that video of Donald Rumsfeld shaking hands with the murderous Saddam Hussein after the gassings took place. Explain that one. Mona focuses on the American person, wronged by his (liberal) government, but ignores the far bigger bodycount caused by our government's (liberal & conservative) constant double standards worldwide. Clinton's no apology bombing of the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical plant in the Sudan or Clinton's dragging his heels on the Rwanda genocide immediately come to mind. Now the Justice Department and the CIA endorse \\"waterboarding\\", but I assure you that if you were forced to watch someone held under running water repeatedly choking and being revived, you might call it torture just to watch. And if all of us do nothing about last week's continued waterboarding (let alone depleted uranium, or stalling on campaign finance reform) then we are all complicit.-Then Mona heavily promotes welfare reform while virtually ignoring the far bigger need for corporate welfare reform. I hope the most polluting corporations appreciate her.-Then Mona starts equating the left wing with divorce & homosexuality. I'm thinking, I'm fifty and I've never been divorced, homosexual, into bilingual education or even French wine. Who is she talking about? The French helped us win Independence in 1776 and French fries were invented in Belgium. But of course we don't care about these facts, because Mona also says here that Left history is but a \\"caricature of reality\\".-Mona is then on to school vouchers, which simply means putting religious institutions in charge of teaching our kids. Destroying the reputation of public schools is the goal; facts need not play a role.-Then Mona veers hard to the right with: The Left Only Blames America. I found my own history typical of the left. I was in shock as I read about the Nazi/Jewish Stalin/peasant, Turkish/Armenian, Spain in Latin America, King Leopold in the Congo, and Japan's Rape of Nanking (read Iris Chang) Genocides. I'm in shock today with the nearly four million dead in the eastern Congo. I believe that the destiny of the United States is to stand for something different. But Mona, the list of American errors is so much longer than you acknowledge. Judges have stated that if held to the Nuremberg Principles, every president (democrat and republican) since FDR would be guilty of criminal aggression. Continually making rules for others while historically exempting yourself is the bipartisan double standard scam Mona should be uncovering.-John Perkins's book \\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\\" (Amazon #14) is far out-selling Mona's book (Amazon #429) because what he says from a much stronger bi-partisan perspective will now put Mona's last two books (I read \\"Useful Idiots\\" too) in the cutout bins. Mona states that blacks are pawns of the liberal \\"agenda\\". Case closed apparently. I wonder if her family fought Jim Crow in 1948 or agreed with Martin Luther King Jr. when he stated at Riverside Church in 1967 that America was \\"the greatest purveyor of violence in the world\\". Blacks leaders know what our Native Americans know; that racism doesn't just disappear when you stop talking about it. And Mona, does anyone still believe Columbus discovered America (\\"Gavin Mendes, 1421: the Year China Discovered America\\", if not Leif Erickson, and even Irish monks and others)? Why not bash someone whose own seafaring diaries show him to be a racist warmonger?-Finally, \\"Do-Gooders\\" totally ignores the international sector. The Environment, the War on Drugs, Iraq, and war in general, are never mentioned; Charen chose only the battles she thought she could win.

She didn't miss one. She bashes liberal views of the Great Society of LBJ, the anti-war protests of the 60's, the welfare state, Clarence Thomas' and Robert Bork's nominations, and the crime wave that quieted in the 90's.Unfortunately, Charen forgets the similar pandering and hypocrisy that has occurred by social conservatives during that same period, an omission that greatly detracts from her thesis. Another failing is that she attaches exclusive causeology of NYC's decrease in crime in the 1990's to Guiliani's get-tough policies, and conveniently forgets the complexities of improved economics, changing demographics and the \\"abortion factor\\" (as expounded by Leavitt in Freakonomics) as potential contributors.She glibly assigns culpability to liberals for any number of social ills including unwed mothers, homelessness, violent crime, racial tension and conceiveably ring-around-the-collar. Her references are numerous, but her arguments are not careful enough for a scholarly work, so the book serves only as red meat for the angry masses screaming about the same old problems of government waste associated with liberal government bureaucracy.Charen conveniently avoids the huge government waste associated with the current so-called \\"conservative\\" government of GWB and the Republican House and Republican Senate. Charen forgets to cite the Medicare Part D program as the largest social spending program (inflation adjusted) in history. She forgets to mention that GWB signed into law a bill written by fellow \\"conservative\\" Republicans that represented the largest farm subsidies (inflation adjusted) in history. Charen neglects to mention that the current \\"conservative\\" government has rushed us into a war that will cost half a trillion dollars and has already lasted longer than WWI, WWII and the US Civil War; and Bush did this despite protests by previous Republican cabinet advisors and diplomats.At the end of the day, this conservative prefers a government that wastes billions of my tax money on unnecessary and counter-productive social programs over one that spends trillions on unnecessary war and mayhem."},{"Title":"Do-Gooders: How Liberals Hurt Those They Claim to Help (and the Rest of Us) (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Mr. W.P. Strange must have been looking in the mirror when he wrote his review of this book.Because as a 3-year \\"neo-con\\" myself, meaning that I have seen the Dark-Side of being a liberal, I know BS when I see it. When reading Strange's review, I couldn't help but laugh and think that he was actually talking about himself.The fact is that is is being a \\"Liberal\\" that facts have no substance in Liberal discussion and debate. Liberalism is when feelings take precedence over facts...shall I mention the CBS Memo-Gate? There's a simple saying that pretty much sums it up with trying to have discussions or debates with a liberal. \\"You can't have a logical conversation with a liberal.\\"Now I admit, that I haven't read this book, but I saw Mona on a news program, might have even been Dennis Miller's late night talk show, and she laid out several scenarios in which the intended do-gooder-ness of self-righteous liberals end up being contradictory and as the book-title says, hurtful, to those they intend to help. I can't quite remember what topic she was talking about, but it made total sense.Quite frankly, I just see this phenomenon in just the many examples of hypocrisy of the modern Left. When they accused Bush of not being able to stop 9/11, and then at the same time, vote down hikes in Intelligence funding. That's like blaming a Fire Department for not putting out a fire quick enough, but then voting to cut out funding for fire trucks.Or the most obvious...John Kerry voting against the $87 Billion for war spending including body armor and the like, and then at the same time campaigning on the fact that our troops don't have the body armor they need. Guess you shouldn't have voted against it then, huh, Mr. Kerry.It's this kind of hyprocrisy from today's liberals and Democrats that converted me to a proud conservative Repulican 3 years ago shortly after 9/11."},{"Title":"Do-Gooders: How Liberals Hurt Those They Claim to Help (and the Rest of Us) (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Examples of the hatred and fear in this book:p7 \\"Blacks have always committed a disproportionate number of violent crimes in America.\\"p22 \\"...there is nothing prejudiced about fear.

I believe parental fitness should play a larger role in custody, and that a state attorney should be assigned directly to children in divorce and criminal cases. The chapter on Adoption details an over-emphasis on parental rights which hurts children, but I can't tell if this is also over-sensationalized like other parts of the book, or represents a genuine problem. I also agree education in America is terrible, but I don't think privatizing with vouchers is the right answer. Private education not tied to the state was tried during the Middle Ages and failed miserably.Oddly the book blames liberals for inadequately caring for the mentally ill and releasing them into the general population. At the same time it bashes all welfare programs. I found this an attempt to 'have it both ways'. Either the government helps helpless people or it doesn't. The positions taken by this book contradict and make no sense.Overall, don't waste your time. This book does not offer solutions, it only offers revisionist history and hate.

I share a lot of conservative values. I don't share the distortion and mean spiritedness that this book offers.An example? The author states how nearly every school child can recognize Martin Luther King, Jr. but hardly any can recognize James Madison. Is this really so amazing? Kinda like saying that most school children can identify Lance Armstrong, but how many can identify Willie Mays?This merely shows the time in history and the overall fame of the person, not that race relations are so improved.Seems minor, but if you look at the premises the author uses to start her arguments, they are often false.Another example? Liberals say there is still a race issue. But race relations have improved, and therefore liberals are incorrect. Serious?or...Liberals have tried to end poverty. But there is still poverty. So liberals have bad ideas.The author puts forth one false dichotomy after another, and the hope is one is so sold already on conservativism that one will not take note.This book needs to be read alongside a book on logic and how to use reason."},{"Title":"Do-Gooders: How Liberals Hurt Those They Claim to Help (and the Rest of Us) (Brilliance Audio on Compact Disc)","review":"Mona tells us that statistics show that children with two married parents, one male the other female, do better than those without that benefit.

And marriages are damaged in many ways, most not deliberate. Ignoring what actually happens to people, many of whom would love to be in one of Mona's ideal marriages, doesn't help much. Ronald Reagan loved to tell the story about the welfare queen who drove cadillacs and cost society a fortune.

Both of these editions are out of print at the time I'm writing this, which is too bad since this is one of Colin Wilson's most interesting novels. This one's got some street thugs, cops, and seedy underworld types in it, so it may have, at one time, been marketed as your standard crime fiction; however, it's really a novel of ideas. Readers looking for the usual twists and turns of the conventional thriller may be disappointed; instead, the events of this book really only serve to aid Hugh Greene, the young narrator, in the formulation of his own philosophical ideas. That said, The World of Violence is not without suspense or a mysterious, sinister-things-beneath-the-surface atmosphere.I love this kind of book, and I found many of the philosophical discussions that take place and Greene's own existential musings to be especially memorable. Although the story takes place in middle-twentieth century London, many of his observations are still right on today. This story unfolds amidst an oppressive background of dissatisfaction and malaise filled with the agonizing trivialities and nuisances of modern urban life and several of the exchanges of ideas that take place in the book deal with the strategies that sensitive intellectual-types have adopted in order to come to terms with their world. Wilson offers some interesting insights into human sexuality and the criminal impulse to commit violent acts. One scene depicts the late-night livingroom confession of a sex killer, and the strange matter-of-fact way this conversation is rendered is absolutely chilling.A large part of the World of Violence centers around a clumsy act of violence involving Greene (an incident he could have avoided), which comes as no surprise since the tension in the plot had been building toward the incident for several chapters. What struck me as strange and fascinating was Greene's own processing of the event. There is no Raskolnikov-like frenzy of guilt and emotion, instead he suffers, for the most part - and this is hard to describe - on an intellectual level as result of his action. Greene seems to remain in a state of detached curiosity regarding his fate. The violence actually brings him into a vague state of existential despair about the potential of human beings in general! While reading this I was wondering to myself whether I should admire Greene for being so steadfast in his sense of the correctness of his actions, his cool head, and his disregard for the approval of his community - or, I wondered, is this character a sociopath who coldly uses the people around him for his own scientific insights and philosophical development? I'm still not sure what to think.I have another isolated remark concerning The World of Violence. It is this. The novel really illuminates the limitations some people have as opposed to others. Many of these limitations are engendered by society - these are the conventional expectations which dicate to us how we are to behave and what possibilities are open to us. People are also imprisoned by their emotions, passing moods, and hidden desires - seemingly unable to take control of themselves. Many of the peripheral characters, such as Hugh's co-workers, his family, and some of the underworld types, exemplify this type. They appear to lack the inclination to address any of the deeper questions; instead, I got the sense while reading this that these characters were being swept along by circumstances, wrapped up in their own urges and the trivial events of day-to-day life. Wilson contrasts these with other individuals who have attempted to articulate some world conception that represents their attempts to deal with the problem of existence. It's interesting to see the ways in which Hugh Greene learns from these world views and how he eventually comes to reject some of them. During the course of his journey, Greene appears to attain a deeper understanding of life, and yet something about this character seemed too cerebral and cold. But perhaps that's just me.These are just a few things about The World of Violence that make for interesting points of discussion. This book can also be enjoyed simply as a suspenseful mystery and battle of wits between policemen, criminals, and a young amateur psychologist. A good read, if you can find a copy."},{"Title":"Reason and Belief","review":"In this uniformly clear and incisive volume (the third in Brand Blanshard's landmark trilogy in defense of reason), the twentieth century's greatest philosophical rationalist carefully examines the claims of religion in the light of reason (including its claims that something other than reason may provide an ultimate standard of truth). Entering sympathetically but critically into the thought of great religious thinkers in the Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions, Blanshard concludes that whatever legitimate content religion may have, the claims of reason as ultimate arbiter of truth cannot be compromised.This conclusion does _not_, Blanshard insists, remove the whole of religion. He conceives religion as the response of the \\"whole man\\" to whatever he regards as ultimately true and important, and he finds much in Christian tradition that is worthy of a rationalist's praise. And in the volume's final, positive section, \\"A Rationalist's Outlook,\\" Blanshard sets out in detail what he thinks we may and may not accept from received religious tradition.The concept of \\"God\\" is one that he finds we must at least attenuate; he finds that while he can profess belief in an \\"Absolute\\" (roughly, all of reality regarded as a logically and causally coherent whole), this Absolute does not share enough features with the \\"God\\" of traditional theism that Blanshard feels able to retain that word as a description of his own quasitheistic belief. Nevertheless he also does not argue for scrapping the concept completely, and his disagreements with more traditional theists are always presented with the utmost generosity.Despite its fairly explicit focus on Christianity, this brilliant work also presents a model for budding nontheists in other traditions who seek to take a similarly sympathetic-yet-critical approach to, say, Judaism or Islam. For Blanshard, the primacy of reason does not involve wholesale rejection of religion as inherently \\"irrational.\\" Indeed, he concludes that reason, properly conceived, has been the unadmitted architect of religion all along, and that taking it seriously is precisely the way to transform our world for the better.Blanshard, in short, takes the service of reason as his own religion. His thorough account should be read by anyone who takes either reason or religion with the seriousness such topics deserve."},{"Title":"Nonprofit Nation: A New Look at the Third America","review":"This book does a great job of answering basic questions about nonprofits and the nonprofit sector. It also analyzes each segment of the nonprofit sector and brings out some key data and observations about each one. Finally, it seeks to look into the future of nonprofits. Anyone interested in the sector, and especially nonprofit executive directors, consultants, and others who should be involved in global nonprofit strategy will find this book to be a valuable resource.The first striking lesson I learned from Dr. O'Neill's book is that, while the nonprofit sector has been growing significantly in the past 30 years, in many ways it has just kept pace with the rest of the economy. Personal, corporate, and foundation giving are remarkably stable, and the percentage of charity dollars given by donors to segments such as education, health care, the arts, and international causes have remained constant since the 1970s. Even the growth in the number of new nonprofits seeking IRS recognition has been relatively constant (in percentage terms) since at least the early 1980s.The dollar totals change, but the percentages are constant. Knowing this prompts important questions about how charities plan, how and whether they solicit for funds, and where likely support is to be found for new initiatives.Dr. O'Neill doesn't shrink from acknowledging the vast amount we don't know about the nonprofit sector. Anyone analyzing the data recognize that policymakers and researchers alike are making best guesses rather than reaching definite conclusions in many areas of analysis. We're a long way from having \\"census\\" data on the nonprofit sector.There are almost 1 million charities recognized by the IRS, but we don't know for sure how many are active and how many are defunct. There are almost 2 million nonprofits of all types (charities plus churches, labor unions, chambers of commerce, private clubs, etc.) that the IRS lists. The Form 990 returns -- that only IRS-recognized charities with revenue greater than $25,000 are required to file -- are works of interpretation by filers as well as researchers.In fact, much nonprofit activity occurs outside record-keeping capabilities. Giving a friend's child the money to attend college, organizing a softball team, or countless other activities never reach the level of IRS recognition, much less scrutiny. We can study what we know, and guess about the rest based on other data sources.Dr. O'Neill has done an admirable job of interpreting these other sources, adding the IRS and other government data, and presenting a plausible picture of the nonprofit economy."},{"Title":"Nonprofit Nation: A New Look at the Third America","review":"This is a great introductory resource to the nonprofit sector, and specifically, the subsectors within the field.

I think this text would ring true to nonprofit professionals, and give some insight to folks considering a career in the field.

And is most timely when the only limitation for the 'bad guys' in the Arms Race is the lack of access to efficient long range delivery vehicles. The landscape is as vivid as 'Wilbur Smith' and Alain De Boton in the 'Art of Travel', the plot as tortuous as John Le Carre, and the technology and pace 'Tom Clancy'.The hero, Jim Strachan 'works' for Winston Sipho Nukisa in a Jo'burg newsagency. Somehow Strachan has ticked off a Muslim cleric and is now hiding out in Johannesburg from a worldwide 'Rushdie-style fatwah. Strachan's bad trip is elevated by a tennis-playing blonde shaped like Anna Kornukova half his age and twice as dangerous. One moment he's in the shower with her, the next shipwrecked off the coast of Namibia. From the start this epic adventure envelops with the filmic panorama of David Lean and high tension action of Richard Donner.As the cover notes say, there's \\"enough adventure here for three novels\\"."},{"Title":"The Race Against Junk Food (Adventures in Good Nutrition)","review":"How many ways are there to get our children to read, eat healthy, and be more active? Answer - NONE, until I found Race Against Junk Food. The story is wonderful, action packed but non-violent, and it gently moves a child's belief system into a mode that encourages a healthy lifestyle. What could be better? Read it with your child and see if you don't become more active and eat more fruits and vegetables (and leave that couch &amp; cheeseburger behind)."},{"Title":"The Race Against Junk Food (Adventures in Good Nutrition)","review":"Excellent, The Race Against Junk Food is a wonderful way to teach kids, parents and grandparents (like me) about healthy eating habits. My 5 year old grand girl loves this book. It's colorful characters and great story keep her interested from start to finish.

My grandson always looks for this book in my house.This is, I believe a must for all parents of young children (together with the children) as it will remind them of the importance of eating the proper foods.Grammar schools should also use this in their health classes.More books like this PLEASE.......

Having read KR's review (above) previously, I had second thoughts about buying this book for my son.I would agree that this book won't win any literary awards. However, for me the most important critic of this book is my son. And he loved it! He's asked that I read it over and over again. And most importantly, he's taken a keen interest in eating healthy.My understanding is that \\"The Race Against Junk Food\\" is supposed to be a MOTIVATIONAL book. There is plenty of \\"how to\\" books about what our children should eat. And still up to 1/3 of our kids are obese. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to know that we should all eat lots of fruits and vegetables. My issue is getting my son to want to eat healthy.I would respectively suggest that from my son's point of view this book is like the movie that the critic pans and everyone else loves.SNAK Posse, feed us more!"},{"Title":"The Race Against Junk Food (Adventures in Good Nutrition)","review":"I have a six year old son who loves this book, especially the pictures.

It helps kids get the big picture about the effects of healthy eating (or lack of!) which I think is just as important as more specific nutrition information, especially in these grade school years. It's funny, I liked it, my kids were immediately interested in it, and I would buy this book again for a gift."},{"Title":"The Race Against Junk Food (Adventures in Good Nutrition)","review":"Some points:1.) After doing a little research, I found the goal of this book is intended to be motivational. Why do kids love McDonalds? It's presented as fun and exciting. Kids don't want to eat at McDonalds because of the fact that sugars and fat are pleasing to the taste buds...2.) My kids enjoyed \\"The Race Against Junk Food\\" very much. After reading this book to them (I have a girl and boy aged 5 and 8, respectively) they chanted, \\"Give me a carrot.\\" Goal accomplished!3.) I discovered that, as ridiculously simple and circuitous as it sounds, research has proven that one gets children to learn to eat healthy by having them eat healthy (lots of fruits and vegetables) at the earliest possible age.4.) Reasoning: In order to survive over tens of thousands of years the foods of infants and toddlers were screened by Mother to prevent poisoning. Young children had to remember (instinctively) what those foods were in order to survive their earliest stages of independence when Mother was no longer around. These habits that are built into humans over tens of thousands of years are known as instincts. They never leave modern man.5.) I think of this book as one of the tools I use to educate my kids about healthy eating. One doesn't take a screw driver out of a tool box and throw it away because it doesn't drive nails, does one? I have several other books I use to teach my children the facts about healthy eating.6.) On an editorial level, I've got to agree with a reviewer that the story line and writing maybe get a C for the adult reader. On the other hand, what kind of Mother would return a $10 book, getting back maybe $3.33 after shipping and handling when there's any chance that the book would help her child to lead a more healthy life?7.)

I'm sure there are better resources for teaching kids about nutrition."},{"Title":"The Race Against Junk Food (Adventures in Good Nutrition)","review":"I can't believe that other reviewers gave this book 5 stars. I was completely disappointed. The book included very little useful information to help kids make good nutritional choices- \\"fruits and veggies are awesome\\" was about the extent of it.

Learned from the stories as well.Thank you for sharing it with us,Colby StuartI've read your book and enjoyed it immensely - Reminded me more of the James Herriott / Year in Provence style than a management textbook.John Couldstone, Capita learning and Development\\"Breaking the Mould is a personal and moving account of a management consultant on his experiences of empowerment, from the oil fields of Venezuela to Scotland. His anecdotal style is outstanding, and will help many of us enduring the problems of organizational life.....great read!\\"Professor Cary L. Cooper, CBE, Professor of Organizational Psychology and Health at Lancaster University Management School.Breaking the Mould is both innovative and quite unique - and is the story of Peter Hunter, a Management Consultant, and the remarkable changes he has managed to bring about within different operations as diverse as dog -sled teams in Canada, to the jungles of Venezuela, to oil rigs in the North Sea. Quite simply, it is the understanding of when individuals are allowed to take ownership in the workplace, and the achievement, when doing so of a significant performance improvement, which is then sustained through the workforce themselves having made changes to the way they operate, resulting in working conditions that allow individuals to spark themselves, and in doing so, also spark their colleagues. (Peter has a Masters from Cranfield and works with organisations such as Shell, BP, and Deutag, and is an ex Royal naval Officer).Lee Ford - Capita learning and Development.Love the book...it calmly, confidently unwraps the message a layer at a time without ever once making the reader feel preached toSteve Bownass. Ambit Video productions.Definitely enjoyed the book. I'll be honest and say that the way the book is structured and the way it draws you to a natural level of understanding around the point being made is fantastic. I'm really excited about the opportunities we can create.Jeff Hearn - IIR TrainingI've never openly recommended talking to anyone before, but I'm going to make an exception. I've just spent 30 minutes \\"chewing the fat\\" with Peter and I'd recommend you do -though don't clog up his phone line now. No matter where you sit within in an organisation, talk to Peter. His \\"Breaking the mould\\" methods make commercial sense - not just consultancy sense, but good commercial sense!Mark WilliamsPeter Drucker said that, from Pappin's invention of the steam engine in 1680 to modern era, organizations had been based on energy flows from the top downward. Leaders would get those under them to focus their energy on doing certain things. Now, Drucker says, they are based on information flows. What Breaking the Mould did was let information flow upward. Peter got the workers to teach the leaders.He changed organizations from hierarchies where the top people order, to the self-forming structure, where lower people form the organization build the organization upward.The style is alive: the narrative is vivid and simple. Boileau, the French writer, said that he who writes well must first think well. Peter has thought well and written well.Congratulations.John RomeI found the book and have now read it cover to cover. It was really good.You have a nice style and parts of it really moved me - so you are some writer.I found the sled story really good as a paradigm for team working.Once again very well done.Andrew BruceBravo Zulu Peter!Fantastic read Peter. I'm sure it's going to be a great success. Having worked in automotive manufacturing for a number of years, I suffered through many different schemes, projects etc. The only time any real, sustained success was achieved was when the focus and empowerment was on the people themselves. I have always believed that no matter what business, organization you're in - - it's always about the people.Paul Synnot - Cruise ControlI've just finished your book. Great stuff. I really think it's going to help, and I can imagine it becoming required text at management colleges.I wish I had had this book when I first started out in management and kept it next to me there after.

When he was not seen again for several years, and mysterious dreams of Russell's ghost came to Stephen's uncle, Stephen and his brother Jesse were arrested for his murder. After the discovery of vague evidence, confessions and a trail, the brothers were sentenced to hang (Jesse' sentence was later commuted to life in prison). Just when all was thought lost, Russell Colvin wandered back into town to free his brothers-in-laws and convicted murderers. But was it really Colvin? Why did the brothers confess? McFarland's account of the events in not only fascinatingly told, but also wonderfully thorough. McFarland brilliantly relates the psychological, sociological, and historical context of the true rural Vermont mystery. He paints a detailed portrait of Vermont in the early days of emerging civilization on the frontier, of a mystery that encompasses an evolving justice system, and the very human, very flawed, and very odd characters that played a role in one of the strangest mysteries.

Besides being a page turner as to who really committed the murder, it provided a lot of insight into life in early America and the different levels of society. There were the early settlers of Vermont and New Hampshire who were fairly rough types, with lots of drinking, etc. There were the educated, more elite types like the lawyers. There were the frontier preachers who helped to civilize the frontier.

I hope there will be supplemental volumes for later seasons. Ann E. Nichols"},{"Title":"The Nitpicker's Guide for X-Philes","review":"Great layout. I love the way he gives his own comments about each episode before starting to nitpick. It allows readers to realise that other people watch the same episode, and that at even the most dramatic times during the X-Files, some of the funniest nitpicking moments can be found out of it. An absolute joy to read. His style usually makes me giggle when I nitpick after every episode."},{"Title":"The Nitpicker's Guide for X-Philes","review":"As a new phile I went looking for books that had a summary of each episode, and nitpicks.

(Hey, I'm a completist -- or &quot;obsessive,&quot; as some would say!)I also bought this book by Phil Farrand as a sort of guidebook to help me pay even closer attention to the series as I made my way through each season.I agree with previous reviewers in that some of these nits are extremely picky, indeed. But some are downright hilarious.All of them, however, lead me to believe Mr. Farrand has way too much time on his hands.For the record, the Nitpickers Guide for X-Philes takes a very, very, VERY close look at each episode of The X Files for the first four seasons, pointing out continuity, character, geography or technology problems found therein. They could be as nitpicky as dates not lining up with &quot;reality&quot; -- all the way to noticing how props shift from one hand to the other when the camera angle changes, or windows being on a certain wall in one episode and on another wall in a subsequent episode, etc.I found this book to be a lot of fun to read after watching an episode. More often than not, it caused me to re-watch the episode to see for myself the &quot;nits&quot; discovered by the author.If you like The X Files, you'll enjoy this book. If you're not a die-hard X-Phile, this book won't mean much to you.I hope Mr. Farrand writes a second volume covering the next four seasons!"},{"Title":"The Nitpicker's Guide for X-Philes","review":"This is one of the best book I've read in a long time!

It doesn't take away from your viewing pleasure and is a lot of fun to read. And, being a true nitpicker, I found that Phil didn't mention Senator Matheson calling Mulder &quot;Fox&quot; in &quot;Little Green Men&quot; even though he said it at least twice! Reading this honed my nitpicking skills as well, a result being that I have found several nits in recent episodes, which is always fun. What a great book!"},{"Title":"The Nitpicker's Guide for X-Philes","review":"This book really has it all for the nitpicker who loves minutiae, seasons 1 through 4. My only issue with with this book is, occasionally, the author's &quot;annoyingness.&quot; To him, his book represents an chance not only for him to point out details and errors in the episodes of The X-Files, but also to evaluate them -- and share his perception (and often unfunny jokes) with his captive audience. This personal editorializing doesn't interest me, but I'm willing to bear it to learn of the fascinating inconsistencies, oddities of equipment and setting, and illogical leaps or related faux pas that the series commits -- and that I'd almost never notice without the pointing of his ever vigilant finger."},{"Title":"The Nitpicker's Guide for X-Philes","review":"Oh....My....Gosh.

Farrand has utilized X-Philes across the world (and their notoriously keen eyes) in compiling his episode-by-episode nitpick compendium. Sometimes a little too self-referential (we can forgive him), sometimes, well, a little *too* nitpicky, but always informative. You'll start nitpicking too, once you're acquainted with Farrand's technique. And parents of young X-Philes--this is the book to buy your children.

I have found that The Nitpicker's Guide for X-Philes balances an incredible amount of information with some wonderful tounge in cheek humor, and I LOVE it. Since I have been watching the season 1 reruns on FOX along with the new season 5 shows, I've found myself turning to my Nitpicker's Guide every Sunday night. Not only is it chock full of interesting tidbits, the author has captured the essence of the X-Files, going beyond the actual episodes to explore the motivations behind the entire series. After all, the X-Files is as much about psychology as it is about the paranormal. One of my favorite parts of the book is the &quot;Whose Truth is Out There Anyway&quot; section where Mr. Farrand explores the differences between the way Mulder and Scully view the truth. At that point, The Nitpicker's Guide for X-Philes goes from being a mere guide to the world of our favorite FBI agents to being an analytical exploration of character and motivation.While I do love the analytical stuff, the best part of The Nitpicker's Guide for X-Philes is the author's sense of humor. I was watching Eve the other night and had to once again utilize the mute button to tell my companion how Mr. Ferrar confessed to considering testing his daughter for the &quot;Exsanguinate you father gene.&quot; Like the X-Files, Mr. Ferrar also shows a great ability to laugh at the characters and himself. In this way, the self depricating humor, the self-mocking feel of the X-Files, comes through strongly. I look forward to reading his 'autopsy' of each episode because I am sure to be amused.Lastly, Mr. Ferrar also writes from the position of being a father, and often observes episodes that he believed to be too graphic for his daughter. Although I'm not a parent, I think this would be helpful for those X-Philes who have children as a tool to screen out some of the more gorey episodes.My conclusion, get the book.

I not only framed you, but I ate your leftover pizza too!&quot; --Farrand's take on Tooms), and I really liked the sidebar &quot;Whose Truth Is Out There?&quot; It gave me a better look into the characters, die-hard Phile that I am. I'd have to recommend this as one of the best X-Phile books written..."},{"Title":"The Nitpicker's Guide for X-Philes","review":"This is A MUST-HAVE for any x-phile!!!!

I was amazed at how little I knew. It will make even the expert x-philes feel unintelligent. (But don't let that keep you from getting the book!!)"},{"Title":"The Nitpicker's Guide for X-Philes","review":"I'm not sure where this Guide falls in line with the others chronologically but I want to say it's Phil's first one because it's not as 'clean' as the others; however this is the last one I purchased. I also don't recall how I came across the Nitpicker's Guides but I enjoy every one of them because they offer a deeper look into each episode, which causes you to notice things you didn't before, and this is coming from someone who considers himself quite observant. While all of the 'nits' mentioned may be just that, extremely nitpicky and easily rationalized, this book is in no way official and strictly for entertainment purposes by fans of the series. Unfortunately due to legal reasons there is only one volume of this Guide, so the whole show is not covered, but the website started by the author (nitcentral) is still up and running if you're curious. I rated this book four stars because I'm not as big a fan of the X-Files as I am of Star Trek; the topic(s) of the other Guides, and I've only seen probably a season-worth of episodes, so the many references to eps were wholly lost on me. I do greatly enjoy the show but I have a lot of catching up to do. I was also displeased with the fact that I ordered this book in \\"new\\" condition and it was most definately NOT."},{"Title":"The Nitpicker's Guide for X-Philes","review":"I love the X-files; it is one of my favorite all-time TV shows. As such, I was quite pleased to receive this book as a birthday gift from a friend of mine. Covering the first 4 episodes of the X-files, it devotes one section to each episode, explaining the plot, the setting, the characters, the morals (if any), the place of this episode within the overall story-arc of the series, any important facts revealed by this episode, and of course, any miscues, sidesteps, goofs, and other foul-ups in the show itself. And like any good book for fans, each section provides a little trivia on that episode, along with some background info on the actors involved. Overalll, a great book for any X-files fan, or for someone who has to live with an X-files fan..."},{"Title":"The Nitpicker's Guide for X-Philes","review":"as a bonafide x-phile, and fellow nitpicker, i couldnt resist grabbing this one. it's was an entertaining read. the author did add some comments, that he probably could have dont without adding, but i could see past that. this was a fun read. i only wish he'd put one out for seasons 5-9."},{"Title":"The Nitpicker's Guide for X-Philes","review":"This book is a really cool thing to have around when watching an episode because you can follow along as you go. One thing I don't like is that he so easily dismisses the fourh season episode Home as bad. That was a very controversial episode but he shouldn't let his opinion could his writing. Throughout the entire part for Home his opinion got in the way and he kept saying things like &quot;it doesn't really matter&quot; or &quot;I don't really care&quot; because it was Home. Other than that it is a good book that has quizzes and cool things like that. There are tote boards with cool facts about the series. I hope there is a guide for the rest of the seasons in the future."},{"Title":"The Nitpicker's Guide for X-Philes","review":"I became a fan of The X-Files after season three, and have been hooked since. I am also a fan of Star Trek, so I was familiar with the whole &quot;Nit Picking&quot; idea, and found it fun and hilarious. So of course I bought the companion to my favorite show - The X-Files. I read it as I watched the episodes I had on tape and kept saying to myself, &quot;I knew there was something wrong there!&quot; I truly enjoyed the book, and I nit pick the new episodes every Sunday night. I hope Mr. Farrand can finish seasons 5-8 and the movie!"},{"Title":"The Nitpicker's Guide for X-Philes","review":"As a former member of the Nitpicker's Guild (I was the worst one), I especially appreciate this book, reaching outside the realms of Star Trek, the paths he usually treads. In fact, this book is more extensive in its nitpicking than the ST books, covering whatever areas, roads, and towns don't exist, as well as the usual technical and continuity problems.To all the people here: Sadly, Mr. Farrand couldn't publish any more last time I heard. Apparently there was some sort of problem with Dell Publishers, and as a result there will be no more Nitpicker's Guides.And the SW one was just about to come out... (if you want more, I advise you to protest it)"},{"Title":"The Nitpicker's Guide for X-Philes","review":"Whether you are a die-hard X-Phile or just a once-in-awhile watcher, this book is the best. Ever since I started reading it, it's become habit for me to look for nit-picks (mistakes). That doesn't mean I don't love the show. For me, that's just another way for me to connect to the show. It makes me really pay attention to what's going on, and tests my knowledge from episodes from previous episodes. Here's an example: a while back during I believe Ascension, Mulder learned that Scully had received her golden cross necklace for her 15th birthday. However, in Emily, it shows both Dana and Melissa receiving them for Christmas. Nit-Pick!! If you get this book, please try to find some nit-picks and test you knowledge. Happy Hunting!!"},{"Title":"The Nitpicker's Guide for X-Philes","review":"Loved it so much that I have to get a new one. Mine is falling apart because I read it so often. Keep up the good work Phil! -Starbuck"},{"Title":"The Nitpicker's Guide for X-Philes","review":"This book definitely has its good points. The extra features (trivia, quotes, tote boards, etc.) are very enjoyable and should suit any X-phile's tastes. The overall purpose of the book, however, is really quite bothersome. I frankly don't want to know every single place where the creators or actors screwed up. I think it's kind of fun to see an oddity while watching the show and poke a little fun, but that's as far as I'm willing to go. The author also seems to a bit wacky and, as others have said, puts too much of his own opinion into the book. If you're a perfectionist or you're willing to buy the book just for the extras, go ahead and get it. Otherwise, it's not worth it."},{"Title":"The Nitpicker's Guide for X-Philes","review":"This is a fun book and it espacially helps you get more use out of your X-Files tapes and DVDs. I bought this along with a copy of the sessions on DVD.

I didn't realise it was an ethnography when I ordered it, but now that I have it I appreciate it for what it is. I enjoyed reading about the boats and the vanishing breed of men who built them. One of the things that makes this book so interesting is accounts of the use of archaic methods that result in very sound, beautiful, useful boats. The author does go into the building procedures and provide lines and offsets for a few boats."},{"Title":"Free Money: Plan for Prosperity","review":"Since 1971 the US is off the gold standard. This means that a growing economy cannot be thrown into depression just because there is not enough gold to back the growing stock of money required to sustain it. It is enough now to create the money out of nothing. And this is done, the quantity of money created is known as the \\"federal debt\\", and it is completely unlike a household or corporate debt, which is a real financial burden. Debt cannot be a burden to an entity that creates money.Unfortunately, 99% of economists, Nobel laureates including, of all persuasions: neoliberal, Keynesian, Austrian, have not caught up to the simple fact that the monetary system is nothing like the gold standard that ruled when the textbooks they learned about money from were written. The erroneous set of beliefs and dogmas (eg. \\"federal debt is like a household debt\\") is perpetuated. A small group of economists, known as chartalists or MMT-ers (after Modern Monetary Theory) have figured out the fiat (non gold-related) money. The author of the book is not among them, he discovered this by himself, a true genius. His book is definitely recommended, if you want to understand why some countries go bankrupt and others can run 200% debt-to-GDP ratio and manage to sell massive amounts of bonds despite offering near zero interest.If you read this book you will see how confused the most famous economists are, how their thinking is muddled by false analogies and unspoken, yet absurd, assumptions.Obviously, I think it is worth it."},{"Title":"Free Money: Plan for Prosperity","review":"Every once in a while, you find a book that changes your view of the world. FREE MONEY showed me why the common knowledge about the economy is completely wrong. It showed me how to predict the stock market, which I've done successfully for the past 5 years, using the simple method described.It showed me why we had the recession and the recovery. It showed me why Chairman Greenspan's mistakes were largely responsible for the recession, and how close we were to a depression.It showed me solutions to the Social Security and Medicare problems.In short, this is one of the most important books I ever have read, and it made a lot of money for me, too."},{"Title":"Free Money: Plan for Prosperity","review":"Fresh perspective on what money is all about.

Shows how to lower taxes and at the same time, support Social Security (as well as Medicare, the military, crime prevention.) Has dozens of ideas you never see in the media. No gobble-de-gook. Very easy reading. It's counter-intuitive but logical. If you want a fresh view of what has happened in our economy and what will happen, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Free Money: Plan for Prosperity","review":"All of the detractors of this book obviously haven't read it...or his website...or his blog. The essence of this book, which is MMT, is considered mainstream economics (post Keynesian as a matter of fact). So for all of you that say \\"this is contradicted by the textbooks...\\" or \\"this isn't mainstream...,\\" put a sock in it. This is the exact same stuff that's taught by L. Randall Wray, Bill Mitchell, and James Galbraith (and to some degree, Hyman Minsky), which are all well known, reputable economists. And for all of the \\"Zimbabwe\\" nonsense, everybody knows that that country and the United States have different economic conditions. You can't compare a corrupt third world country with a low economics education, and completely different economic conditions, to the United States. Pure ridiculousness.This book should be required reading in public schools (and the earlier, the better)."},{"Title":"Free Money: Plan for Prosperity","review":"This book cuts through all the myths and clarifies the US monetary system once and for all. No more will the reader view the federal monetary system as a constrained tax and borrow system straining under unsustainable federal spending. That pointless, muddled misinterpretation of the monetary system has been wrong since we went off the gold standard in 1971. Finally someone has laid out a simple explanation of how our monetary system is not in trouble and how it could be used to our best advantage now and in the future."},{"Title":"Free Money: Plan for Prosperity","review":"I understand why the product description says that the book is praised by economists - it has all of the flaws in thinking exhibited by mainstream economists. Answering questions about what to do about economic problems within the current framework will not solve anything when the framework itself (all money is backed by debt, with interest payable to private banks) is the issue. There is some clear thinking, and an ability to at least question a few tenets of conventional economic thinking, but the author's lack of understanding of the Federal Reserve system and where treasury bonds go (abroad, for the most part) shows a failure to grasp one of the most basic issues in monetary reform. This book is a pitch for infinite borrowing and elimination of taxes, written in sound bites. If you enjoy being lectured to by a (very good) propogandist, this book is for you.If, however, you have a genuine interest in monetary reform in a way that will benefit society in general (rather than a small sliver of the very wealthy), try Michael Rowbotham's 'The Grip of Death' or Ellen Hodgson Brown's 'The Web of Debt'. These will explain to you why we are in the economic mess we are in and what would really help to get us out of it. Questioning the framework itself is necessary. It was something that was possible throughout the 19th century but the American population went to sleep after the FED was created in 1913, assuming the status quo was then fixed."},{"Title":"Free Money: Plan for Prosperity","review":"In a nutshell, this book's basic premise is that the government can create money at will. Therefore, the government should create all the money it wants and make us all rich. It doesn't take a PhD in economics to realize the absurdity of such a hypothesis. Freely printing money at will was tried before in this and other countries amd the results are always disasterous."},{"Title":"Free Money: Plan for Prosperity","review":"Somehow, everyone wants to dabble in economics without training, even though few would try it in other professions. This book carries that idea to the extreme. The author has an MBA and an undergraduate marketing degree. He rejects and/or misstates virtually everything in macroeconomics in a way that a first-semester undergraduate economics student could shred. Among the many logical fallacies are his statement that because an economy requires money to grow, and because money is debt, and because a large economy requires more debt than anybody but the federal government could manage, this proves that the economy requires ever-growing federal debt. He frequently confuses correlation with causality when he compares various economic variables. He lists a number of statements that he claims are all false, even though they are not even controversial to anyone other than the author. One reviewer referred to him as a genius for understanding economics better than the mainstream economists. That certainly would be true. What are the odds that a guy with training in marketing and business administration would disprove all of the economic theory that evolved through centuries of economic research? It's certainly possible, but I wouldn't bet the farm on it, particularly in light of his logical fallacies and confusion over many of the institutional facts. Perhaps in his next book he will write a critique of modern medical research, with all of the answers that have eluded medical science over the centuries."},{"Title":"The Damon Runyon Omnibus: Guys and Dolls; Money From Home; Blue Plate Special","review":"The Omnibus is a collection of essential Runyon that, for some reason, doesn't seem to be in print.

The quitting of smoking was too late, as cancer ate his vocal chords and at the end he wrote notes to communicate. His was a more innocent time than ours. Read him for the entertaining escape.

This book is very unlike any other relationship book I have read thus far, (from the Christian perspective anyhow, some of Dr. Crabb's sentiments about gender differences are echoed by Dr. Laura, John Gray, and others). His approach to explaining differences is both humble and enticing. For women who struggle to overcome a very feminist background in which the term \\"submission\\" causes the hair on our neck to rise, his book is palpable and invites one to examine his or her motives.Dr. Crabb's explanations are such that your mind and heart remain open to receiving something profound. This book is beneficial not just for individuals struggling in relationships, but singles as well, the premise being one that reminds us that our main enemy in life is selfishness and the only freedom from a life lived in a self-centered prison is one which focuses on other-centered living: how true, and how simple. As the Word says, \\"the truth will set you free,\\" indeed, the truth as it is presented in this book, if humbly embraced, has the capacity to do just that."},{"Title":"Men & Women: Enjoying the Difference","review":"This book is a must read for everybody, whether you plan to get married or stay single all your life. It uncovers the true source of all conflict in human relationships and provides the remedy as well! Shock!.Have you been abused? Mistreated? This book is definitely for you. It is the answer that we all need to hear whether we want to or not. It's gentle and truthful. It will knock your socks off, and massage your feet!This is another one of the best books I've ever read.I can't put it down. I read it over and over and each time I find something else I didn't see before. At times you'll want to read ahead to see where the author is going. It is just that intriguing. I found myself getting frustrated the first time through it. I kept asking out loud, &quot;Will you please get to the point?&quot; But man... woman! was it ever worth it. I'm ready to get married again! *lol*"},{"Title":"Men & Women: Enjoying the Difference","review":"For the most part, Dr. Crabb has aimed his book at Christian couples. And several things I can wholeheartedly agree with:1. A lot of marital unhappiness can come from being too self-centered and not other-centered enough.2. A person's needs for security and significance are ultimately met in his or her personal relationship to God through Jesus Christ, and this is the most important part of life to nurture and build.Beyond that, though, I have a problem with a basic idea in Dr. Crabb's thinking. He asserts that a man's main need is \\"significance\\" and a woman's main need is \\"security.\\" And I think that he makes this into too much of a system. While he will say that men need security and women need significance, I think he arbitrarily names men's desires \\"significance\\" and a woman's desires \\"security\\" when they may not be. I've always been leery of stereotyping people.Now I must admit that as a woman I like security -- especially financial! And I like the \\"security\\" of being loved by my husband. But I still want to make some accomplishments in life apart from who I'm married to. I'm a writer, musician and teacher, and those make up as much of my life as my domestic side, and recognition in these areas will probably be more important to my SIGNIFICANCE desire than my SECURITY desire -- unless, of course, I receive a large cash award and that will make me feel more SECURE! (Hmmm -- maybe that will bolster Dr. Crabb's theory a bit more.)Take the good that you can out of this book -- and there's a lot of it. But I would say to both men and women: don't let anyone stereotype you because of your gender."},{"Title":"Men & Women: Enjoying the Difference","review":"This is an amazing book, using the term \\"amazing\\" without necessarily meaning anything either positive or negative.Crabb promotes a Biblical idea of the difference in gender roles. He supports his points by scriptural reference, by referring to his counseling, and to common sense.If you don't like his goal, if you have the modern view of such things, this book will make your teeth hurt. Not only will his goals set your hair on fire, he is, above all, plausible. He is not slick-plausible. He is a good writer and organizer of his material.For those who disagree, even vehemently disagree, with his views, it would be an educational experience to deal with his book using logic and reason. Ripping it to shreds and jumping up and down on the scraps while screaming obscenities--which passes for scholarship in some fields--is not what I'm talking about. Deal with this book, whatever your position, with reason, logic, and fact, and you will know more about, among other things, what you think and why you think it.I was particularly struck by his extensive investigation into how a wife's regard for her husband can build him up or ruin him. The same is mentioned in passing by other writers in the fiels, but Crabb goes into some detail.Crabb spends the bulk of his time exploring marital issues. It appears to me that, if men and women are to take gender-separate roles, the manifestations of such differences would be in the workplace, or in other groups. Crabb doesn't get into this. I expect that telling a woman to be a helpmate and to accept husband's decisions with a joyful and grateful heart is going to create some confusion when a woman is an equal colleague of a man at work, or a supervisor. Then what?As I say, worth reading if it doesn't change your mind in the slightest, or if it does."},{"Title":"Men & Women: Enjoying the Difference","review":"The book was written quite a while ago, and I don't believe it's been reprinted... so pick it up while you can.

He has set his heart on pilgrimage and has drawn those of us who feel him towards the same road.I first read his book \\"Inside Out\\" about 10 years ago and since then, I buy every book he writes or has ever written. For some of his books, one needs to \\"spiritually grow\\" into them before you can actually comprehend his line of thought.Anything less than a five star would be an injustice to a man who has poured out heart and soul into seeking God and being honest!"},{"Title":"Men & Women: Enjoying the Difference","review":"I was really ready for whatever this author had to say.

Any book that attempts to take a broad look at the peculiar world of comtemporary architects and architecture is asking for trouble.\\" (p.7)This is a direct quote from the introduction of the book written by the three authors. Ironically, I think they made a correct judgment about their book.My simple critique is: Who are the target readers of this book?If you are a casual architecture reader, a lay person, the content of this book will not catch your heart. The information about each architect and their works is too brief. Without knowing their works and their idiosyncratic aesthetics, the content in the book will not make much sense to you, not to mention the quality and fairness of the authors' opinions and critiques on those architects.I truly believe that sincere and true appreciation of architect is much much more important than acquainted you with Who's Who. There are tons of good books with great presentations of architectural works. If you are particularly interested in certain architects, go and find a volume solely dedicated to them, analyzing how they've matured and built their own style.On the other hand, if you are a professional and quite familiar with the architectural community, then what's the point of getting this book?So I don't really know what's the purpose of publishing this book? What kind of message do the authors want to convey to the reader? If they had a unique and thoughtful criteria of selecting the architects presented in this book, then they did not fulfill this goal by organizing the architects alphabetically. If they planned to have an overview of the influential living architects (that's actually what they said in the introduction), then their list is far from being complete and representative. If they wanted to highlight some promising young and upcoming talents, they still did not do their research adequately.The only value of this book, as far as I am concerned, is poping up some interesting architects in front of you (even if you are not familiar with their works). Then you can get more info from other resources.I thought about rating this book at 2 stars. But considering their hard work of compling all these stuff, a 3-star rating is fair."},{"Title":"History of the 1950s (20th Century USA)","review":"What makes the 20th Century USA series such an excellent supplemental series for teachers and students of American history is that it gets beyond what you usually find in a history textbook to the events and people that were making headlines. Your standard textbook will look at the &quot;History of the 1950s&quot; and talk the Korean War, the McCarthy Hearings, the Soviets launching Sputnik, and Dwight Eisenhower being elected president twice, but is probably going to neglect to mention the Piltdown hoax, Mount Everest being conquered for the first time, the television quiz show scandal, and the Piltdown hoax. However, those are exactly the sort of memorable stories that are given equal billing in this slender volume by Rennay Craats, and the vast majority of entries have accompanying photographs or illustrations.The decade of the Fifties is presented as a decade of progress and change that was both &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;crazy.&quot; Craats introduces the decade with a series of headlines (e.g., &quot;Warsaw Pact Signed,&quot; &quot;Elvis Causes Uproar,&quot; &quot;Anne Frank's Diary Found&quot;) and a Time Line that lays out the decade from Charles Schultz's first success with his &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip in 1950 to the plane crash that killed Buddy Holly and two other rock and roll legends in late 1959. All of these topics, along with dozens more, are covered in the body of the book, which is divided into topics from Disasters and Entertainment to Political Issues and Sports. This is a volume that pays as much attention to &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; and Mickey Mantle as it does to the desegregation of schools and the death of Stalin, which is why it makes for a nice supplemental volume.

After spending the last year and ? working with .NET and mastering C# and the technologies behind .NET, I bought this book to approach learning how to use .NET from the Visual C++ angle. What a disappointment and a serious problem that this book has. The whole idea of .NET is to eliminate the tangled mess of technologies and libraries that has baffled and fustrated Windows developers for years now and made interoperability between languages virtually impossible other than with COM but with serious restrictions. To that end, Microsoft has rationalized the model, providing a common runtime (CLR), with a common type system (CTS), and a rationalized, coherent programming framework, the Base Class Library (BCL), that is accessible from *any* language. That replaces the mess with incompatible libraries like MFC, WFC, VB?s library and the confusing mess of data types like LPSTR, LPCSTR, CString, etc. Every other book on .NET (I have them all) shows you how to leverage and use the BCL from their language, whether it be C# or VB.NET. Not in this book. The author most of the book using MFC and teaching MFC! MFC is depreciated in .NET and is kept for legacy reasons only. To not focus on the BCL from the C++ environment does the readers of this book a huge disservice. I frankly can?t figure out why this approach was taken other than this seems to be a cut and paste, and update from his previous editions that focused on MFC. He seems to have missed the whole .NET boat. So what do we have? We have 18 chapters that are essentially useless up to Day 18, one chapter Day 19 ?Working with Managed Code?, which is vital but much too short and misses most of the issues, and two more good chapters on ATL and working with VB and C# components. If someone wants to continue to program with MFC nevertheless, I guess you could find some use of this book. But I believe, that it misses the whole point of .NET, and thus steers people in a direction that is not only wrong but short-sided."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Visual C++.NET in 21 Days","review":"I am just a college student and have no experience on Windows program before, but I only know C++.

I didn't know he had published books until about half way through the year, but I was surprised when I found out (a bad surprise). The author's approach to software development projects is generally lazy and lacks any type of formal planning. He is so stuck in old fashion land (like he'd always refer to the DAL as \\"the data harness\\") and was happy to stay there. His innefficiencies wound up creating a lot of overtime work for co-workers. And, he has perhaps the worst trait of an author: If anyone corrected the author (even politely) the author could become quite physically animated in his own defense, yelling loud and long enough to make everyone else in the office leave the building out of discomfort.He is happy to say he was a starving artist after college, and that's when he struggled to learn to program. But it's obvious he missed formal training because he seems to enjoy bringing his very hippy attitude (long pony tail, rarely showers, walks like disgruntled teen with creepy evil eyes).I wouldn't depend on his words for cohesive sanity and forethoughtTry Balena or Lhotka!

As for .NET, it's covered only in a brief section tacked on at the end.If you want to learn MFC and Visual Studio, there are many better books. If you want to learn .NET, there are many better books.The book consists of a number of programming projects, one for each chapter, with subjects like \\"Working with Timers\\", \\"Mouse and Keyboard\\", etc. The book gives a brief introduction and then walks you through the project with detailed instructions, code to be typed in, and so forth. There are brief explanations of what you are doing, but not enough so that you can really understand it - not enough to design a similar project of your own, and not enough to fix anything if you type it in wrong the first time. Some of the coding is pretty lame even in these brief fragments - a good programmer would write better code.One the positive side, you do get a little hands-on experience with Visual Studio. But surely there are better books for that than this one.Finally, since this is an introductory book, there are several pages of \\"sidebars\\" on the C++ programming language. But hey, if you don't know C++ before you start, these sidebars aren't going to help you.Most of the SAMS books I've read were pretty good, but this was far below standard.

But whereas Rorty's consideration of the moral value of literature is limited to a contrast with deconstructive approaches to literature, Nussbaum takes a more detailed approach. Using concrete studies of both works of fiction (Richard Wright's &quot;Native Son&quot; and several works by Dickens are featured prominently) and legal cases to reveal how a sense of the particular is developed and maintained through the reading of fiction, and may be applied to moral and judicial reasoning. Being attuned to particulars, she argues, allows for sympathetic identification (with characters in novels, and with defendants in trials), and thus a sense of compassion and mercy. This short, easy to read book is, I think, a good introduction to her work on both law and literature (subjects she teaches on at Chicago) -- the relation between which is developed further, in greater detail, in both &quot;Love's Knowledge&quot; and &quot;Sex and Social Justice.&quot;"},{"Title":"Poetic Justice: The Literary Imagination and Public Life","review":"The book arrived on time.

The gut vomited gutteral trolling echo of the sin-lovers only reinforces the sagging antiprogress of the the government, and the droning of the dialogue shifts the book toward hopelessness at every juncture.Master aestheticist Robertson entrances with nihilistic pummeling words drawn together in an expertly-constructed synthesis of several styles, ranging from the primary construction of Shakespeare with an attention to the rhythmic shifts and cadences of Wordsworth, insightful lines linking the author to ancients such as Sophocles and Jesus Himself. So well fitting into known styles is this work that sometimes it suffers for familiarity and knowledge of derivation, but independently executed this is a well-written, studious representation of these genres with reasonable advancements in thought.The metaphor, the topic eclipses karmic interaction for broader statements of being. As an epic, emptiness engulfs humanity the ideals and raw will to commit such unbalanced and direct material to digits as expressed sensations. Pat exhibits the heroic ideals of prevalence of ideal against obstacles including the tedium of scientific knowledge and refinement, forming something as vital as the ignorance of evolution once was through generation of logic in the unthinkable and vitally alienated religion that this is.While some chapters wander into Wagnerian juxtaposition collage of emotional symbols, the strength of this book is in the heartpump of throbbing dissonance in framework boundaries within sentence structure through tone-centric progression establishment via relevance in rhythm, a knighthood of subconscious descent beneath the conscious and its discursive storm of dead static chaos flooding us with guilt, doubt, self-reflective ego paranoia and other traits of the Judeo-Christian thought empire.All in all, a great book that i thought was good."},{"Title":"Eyerobics","review":"If you're looking for a book with eye EXERCISES that was written by someone with curiosity who EXPERIMENTED and STUDIED at the same time to improve their vision, with advice that may help you, you've found it. I used to be in eye therapy at the Alderwood Vision Clinic in WA, I know these exercises work and I know that without daily exercises... your vision will tend towards what you mainly look at. I was nearsighted, then eventually didn't need glasses thanks to the vision therapy, then I played video games for 3 years as well as computer games and gradually got worse.The only exercise I miss from the book is \\"eccentric circles\\", I believe they have a version using squares. Looks kinda like[ []] [[] ] and you have to make them look like one square or 3 squares by focusing in, then focusing away. (using a window helps).I believe the internet lacks resources for vision therapy...One more tip: Take your most nearsighted eye, and with your finger, pull the skin on the outer side back. It will make your vision blurrier, but focus it right and you'll get 20/20 vision or better temporarily. Took me some time... the theory behind it is that I have a muscle there that got used to focusing in, so I focused it out. There's also the factor of making the eye round again because muscle strain made it oval-shaped. Either way, it deals with your muscles... (also, think about what squinting does... relate it to the above).Unfortunately you do have to work for better vision. Remember to rest your eyes every now and then.

As Ms. Roy points out in &quot;Eyerobics&quot;, the eyes contain muscles that need a good workout, too, in order to stay strong and limber. Many years ago, as a teenager, I struggled with the fact that I was nearsighted and had no choice but to wear the heavy &quot;nerdy-looking&quot; glasses that were available back in the 50's. I was intrigued when I found a paperback book that described a variety of exercises that one could perform in order to improve vision. The book seemed to be based on sound principles, but unfortunately, it treated eye exercises as if they were the &quot;calisthentics&quot; that were so popular in those days: something boring and uncomfortable that was &quot;good for you&quot;. The book sat on a shelf for years, filled with good ideas that never became a reality. I eventually learned of the newly-available contact lens, and was able to take advantage of this wonderful development to shed my glasses for a while. However, at some point the discomfort of contact with smoke and dust overcame my vanity, and I decided that a pair of lightweight, wire-rim glasses was really not so bad. Now, as I approach the big &quot;50&quot;, I have found that I have a new challenge, one that we all face eventually: the tendency to have difficulty with close work when wearing my regular glasses. I have tried using the latest version of &quot;bi-focals&quot;, and I find a lot of disadvantages. I believe that with a little work, I can improve my close vision so that the single-vision lenses will be sufficient. I may decide at some point to undergo laser vision correction for cosmetic reasons, but I know that the close-vision issue will remain unless I develop healthy, flexible eye muscles. I have found &quot;Eyerobics&quot; to be a source of inspiration and a kind of &quot;owner's manual for the eyes&quot;. The exercises are designed to fit into today's busy schedules, and seem to be more like an interesting little games than like &quot;calisthentics&quot;.

Mr. Viescas does not only describe all the functions in Access, but he also cares about the theories behind datamodeling . And that's a thing some authors forget. To me, building a database and make it work means three things: knowledge about the underlaying theories, knowledge about how the software works and a bit of experience. Mr. Viescas wrote a very fine book in which the first two are described in a very clear and readable way. With this book you should have one of the best books written to learn more about Microsoft Access. The only thing you have to do is to try things out and get some experience. My compliments to Mr. Viescas. He did a great job! Note: There is also a great part about Visual Basic for Applications in this book. If you want to learn more about Visual Basic, you could start here. For me it was a good introduction and I noticed that I learned Visual Basic quite fast."},{"Title":"The Very Daring Duchess (Sonnet Books)","review":"Setting: Naples 1798Francesca Robin makes a living running her art gallery, she adds works of art by famous artists by reproducing their paintings.

The story is fast paced as she moves readers from one sea port to the next.I was charmed by Edward and Francesca as they become friends before lovers during their heady sea adventure.Debbie GilbertReviewer for Romance Reviews Today"},{"Title":"The Very Daring Duchess (Sonnet Books)","review":"In 1798 Naples, English sea Captain Edward Winterworth meets Naples Signora Francesca Robin at her art gallery. They are immediately attracted to one another, but Edward acts nasty and somewhat aloof towards her believing she is just another local con artist scamming His Majesty's sailors.When Napoleon threatens Naples, the English fleet decides to evacuate the area. A half-English person like Francesca is in jeopardy if she remains behind when the French arrive. She knows she must leave Naples immediately, but Admiral Nelson refuses to take her with the Navy, ignoring even Lady Hamilton's plea. Edward volunteers to marry her so she can accompany him. Desperate, she accepts and once married they seem happy together until the Admiralty summons Edward back to London. There he learns that he now is a Duke and no longer part of the Navy because his aristocratic rank requires him kept safe. A frightened Francesca runs away feeling inadequate to be the wife on a noble, leaving it to Edward to prove he loves her and needs her by his side.Miranda Jarrett is known for her historical romances especially those set in the Colonial, Georgian, and Regency periods. Her latest tale THE VERY DARING DUCHESS centers on a typical Regency theme starring two likable lead characters. However, the descriptions of Naples right before Napoleon provides a rare freshness and depth that turns this into a strong Regency romance that any fan of a historical tale will fully cherish.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Very Daring Duchess (Sonnet Books)","review":"This was a decent but not engrossing read. The charecters were just not that compelling and while the storyline was original in that it did not recycle the same naive miss for the zillionth time it lacked a certain spark. It's a bad bookjust not engrossing. Still it's a decent read with likeable if somewhat shallow charecters and a fresh story line."},{"Title":"The Very Daring Duchess (Sonnet Books)","review":"This is the first of Miranda Jarrett books that I have read and will definitely read others. She with a wonderful flair. Her love scenes are stirring and the interaction of the characters is very nice. Franceseca and Edward are definitely meant for each other."},{"Title":"The Very Daring Duchess (Sonnet Books)","review":"Though the author could have given the characters a little more depth and dimension this was an overall good read."},{"Title":"The Very Daring Duchess (Sonnet Books)","review":"I read this book as a filler while I was waiting for another book in a series by another author. It turned out to be a really fun read. I enjoyed the interaction between Franscesca and Edward. They really seemed to be a case of opposites attracting!! They had good chemistry! The only downside was the angst Franscesca suffered regarding her \\"dishonest nature\\"after a while it seemed a bit contrived. As a reader, you felt like saying \\"get over it already\\". All in all though, it was a good read and the follow up book \\"The Very Comely Countess\\" was even better."},{"Title":"The Baphomet","review":"This follows \\"Roberte Ce Soir & The Evocation of the Edict of Nantes\\" and \\"Diana at Her Bath & The Women of Rome\\" (both reviewed by me) as intellectual exercises, couched less as fiction and more as essays in \\"Diana,\\" and as a more straightforward (relatively speaking) imaginary excursion in \\"The Baphomet.\\" The preface, included here, is an essay by Michel Foucault on the moment of Acteon's attempt to restrain the huntress. Well-written and easier to understand than perhaps Klossowski in his many recondite moments, Foucault's essay, however, seems oddly placed. It should have been introducing the other book--- the one on Diana!\\"The Baphomet\\" appears in a very handsome volume, with four illustrations by the author. This tale does open more dramatically than most of his imaginary stories, with the Templars' infamous rituals about to be exposed. This shifts into a visit from a sufflation, a breathed spirit, of St Teresa (spelled here in the French fashion) of Avila. The problem is that the characters in the action, such as it is, have been turned into emanations seeking vainly a re-entry into the flesh. Such is their fate, repeated endlessly, and they cannot hope for any exit from this existentialist cycle. So seems the case, according to the saint. As with Klossowski's earlier fictions, this predicament inspires extended theological and diabolical debate. Eventually, centered around the androgynous figure who incarnates as the Baphomet, the arc segues back to the Templars' earlier clash-- before another seismic jolt forward. Near the end, an enchanting meditation on Martha vs. Mary enters into a consideration for what we'd call \\"living in the moment\\"--yet this earns eloquent expression, a reminder of the difficulty we have in living in a time that does not seem our own. Klossowski by his narrative appears to instruct us to forget fitting in, and to embrace the suspended, brief, fleeting moments when we slip temporal bounds.The book stops with a jolt. The book's beautifully translated in parts, and in other parts falls into the same affliction that makes this author's work tendentious and dull. It forgets there's a reader who must be entertained as well as educated. Extreme edification and erudite elucidation can tire a reader not up to Klossowski's wry intellect and sophisticated pose. Klossowski's method often appears to me scattershot, with rare moments of insight couched in overly mannered prose stylized in the fashion of French philosophical speculation, scholastic terminology borrowed from Catholic medieval erudition, and sporadic episodes of brief erotic grappling. I cannot imagine that there are many readers sufficiently educated in the nuances of all three discourses. But Klossowski, ex-Dominican seminarian, student of Bataille, mentored by Gide, and explicator of Sade and Nietzsche, is the one writer who'd search for and reward perhaps this rarified audience."},{"Title":"The Baphomet","review":"Klossowski's combinatin of theological, metaphysical,eroticism and irony is well worked in this page turner of Templar myth. Klossowski's fanciful concept of the \\"breaths\\" of Templars long past gathering on the anniversary of the torment and execution of their Grand Master and revisiting the very iniquities and blasphemies that they were force to admit to by a corrupt church and government. The mystical journey Klossowski takes his readers on is pure thrill. You will meet the Grand Master as a hornet, Nietzsche in the body of an anteater, the author himself as the confessor and a cast worthy of a Fellini movie. Foucault said that: \\"The theory of the 'breaths' in Klossowski's Baphomet is related, for who knows how many aspects, to the entirety of Western philosophy\\". A good good read and should have a place in anyones library"},{"Title":"The Baphomet","review":"a classic. oui, chef d'oeuvre. every american christian should read this. will affect your faith if you are centrifugal-centric..........centripetal types, please avoid and pray for your mythic \\"rapture\\" to come (\\"o end of days.........\\"!!!!)"},{"Title":"The Baphomet","review":"SylverHawke, my eldest sister to whom I owe my life. -Claudia!"},{"Title":"This Is the End My Only Friend: Living and Dying With Jim Morrison","review":"I was looking for a book about Jim Morrison but what i got, in this book, far exceeded my expectations, and, in fact was much better than i had hoped. It is an account of a girl's first love and how it changed her, and how her obsession affected her life. it is a book about her rite of passage, which included not only her relationship with jim morrison, but also her use of drugs, her thoughts and concerns, her obsessions and uncertainties. In our modern world, which is so obsessed with image and celebrities, she might not have gotten the book published if she had had a relationship with an ordinary person. She had a relationship with a famous and charismatic rock star, but he really is not the center of the book - she is. And because of that, the book is more interesting. She speaks in a way that i can relate to and identify with. She described different states of mind very clearly and believably. And this book is undoubtedly a true story. Apparently, Miss Huddleston was the consultant for Oliver Stone's movie about Jim Morrison. The part of the book, near the end, about her breakdown and hospitalization,years after jim morrison's death, was not overly dramatic, but appropriately so, and fascinating and realistic. Because of the skill of her writing, she brings you into the mindset. I highly recommend this book to anyone, whether a &quot;child of that time&quot; or someone younger wanting to read something about jim morrison and his impact on one young woman."},{"Title":"This Is the End My Only Friend: Living and Dying With Jim Morrison","review":"I love reading Jim Morrison books but in my personal opinion, I haven't come across any written by his 'old girlfriends' that seem true or realistic; until this one. Judy writes an open an honest account on her times with Morrison and how she was a star-strucked young girl and had the dream of being his 'one and only'. She makes it clear through the entire book that he was very charming and smart, etc. but he was a human being who had his faults. She also made it clear on how she realizes she shouldn't have tolerated the way he treated her and how she could obviously never get him to love her (although she wished she could). In my eyes, I can definitely relate to a young teenage girl being 'starstruck' and wanting so badly to turn a once-in-a-while fling (which Jim viewed it as) to a lifelong romance. Truthful, honest, and open; this book is probably the ONLY believable book written by a former lover of Jim's."},{"Title":"This Is the End My Only Friend: Living and Dying With Jim Morrison","review":"This wonderful book, about a relationhsip with one of the most mysterious and charismatic rock stars, is blatant in its honesty. Often, through her perfectly timed and wickedly dry sense of humor, Ms. Huddleston simultantouesly shows us her naivete in direct conflict with her alter ego which knows better than to think for a moment that Jim Morrison will actually rise to her girlhood-like expectations. Revealing in every way, funny and touching, I read this one straight through!!"},{"Title":"This Is the End My Only Friend: Living and Dying With Jim Morrison","review":"Having grown up in the same time period myself,this was a book that brought back so many memories of just how young and foolish we were. This book was reminiscent of that crazy time period when just out of high school,the heady freedom of expermination and vulerabilty takes hold, and so many of us were impressionable and intriqued by the underground movement that swept through the late 60's ....love-ins,rock concerts, sex and drugs.....it's more like a coming of age book of a girl going down a wild road, out of control but mesmerized by the rock star. She knows it's not healthy but she can't stop. I thought the writing was great and told an interesting story of that era about young girls, the spell they fall under and what eventually happens to them. What makes the book more fascinating is that the rock and roll star is Jim Morrison! It's the most authentic book I've read about the Doors and hope we will see a sequel."},{"Title":"This Is the End My Only Friend: Living and Dying With Jim Morrison","review":"This is an \\"OK\\" book. It was short and was not as intimate of a look into Jim's life as what I had expected. I am an avid collector and reader of all things Jim Morrison and I have read many other books about him that I would read again, but, this book is not one of them. Val Kilmer said he used this book as his \\"bible\\" while filming the Oliver Stone movie \\"The Doors\\". I guess (to true fans and friends and people who were close to Jim) that is why this movie was not an accurate picture of The Doors and Jim Morrison. I would recommend this book only to a serious collector of all things Morrison, just to have it in their collection, but, not to someone who is looking to find out more about Jim's life, as a whole."},{"Title":"This Is the End My Only Friend: Living and Dying With Jim Morrison","review":"Oliver Stone is quoted on the cover for \\"an extremely important book that put Jim Morrison into perspective for the film\\". Really? Why? Of all he books I have om Jimbo and the Doors this one must be rated as the worst of them all. After putting it down, you don't know more about Morrison than before, so I wonder why Val Kilmer on the back of the book is quoted for \\" the book was my bible for the film\\". It's amazing that the author is able to recollect all the conversations she had with Morrison considering the hazed state she was in must of the time. Also, why isn't there any pictures of her and Morrison together. Where they really together more than a couple of times?Well, one good thing about my copy, I found it on sale for a few bucks, so that alone makes it worth the lone star."},{"Title":"This Is the End My Only Friend: Living and Dying With Jim Morrison","review":"This, after you have read all of the other books on The Doors and on Jim...you MUST read. This is a book written by a highly intelligent groupie which Jim returned to over and over so that she would administer to him the love he was seeking.All the other women he saw demanded a response from him which he surely could not or would not give. Judy Huddleston instinctively knew that and loved him in spite of his childish ways. In the end, she sees him in through sorrowful, lovesick eyes...as we all do.I cannot get over how smart she is. We are right there with her every moment. She is an expert at this! Fantastic!"},{"Title":"This Is the End My Only Friend: Living and Dying With Jim Morrison","review":"I read Judy Huddleston's &quot;This Is The End....My Only Friend- Living and Dying with Jim Morrison&quot;. Even though the book is fairly interesting, after reading it I came to the conclusion that she had a lot of problems, because when she wasn't following Jim around, she was in a hospital. Also, I was disappointed that the book focused more on the demonic side of the &quot;Lizard King&quot; than on any intellectual side that quite a few of the other Doors/Jim Morrison books provide. I don't know if her story is true or not, but it certainly had its ups and downs. Ms. Huddleston has written a very unusual but interesting book, to say the least."},{"Title":"YOU CAN'T LOSE WEIGHT ALONE: The Partner Power Weight Loss Program","review":"With so many weight loss books out there it's hard to choose wisely.

This online, create-your-own exam feature is what got me through the registry test. It allows you to select any number of questions (there are more than 1,400!), from any of the 5 main categories (and the myriad sub-categories), those you've already seen or not seen, or to use only the ones you've previously gotten wrong. And you can use the web site as many times as you need to during your allotted access time (details with the book.) The author was very responsive to my questions when I needed clarification, and there's a link right on the web site making it easy to ask.Unlike other test-prep resources I've seen, the questions are equal to or HARDER than those on the registry exam! The service tracks your averages in each of the five categories, and reports results for an individual exam upon completion as well as your cumulative average. You can interrupt taking an exam and resume it at another time. And, speaking of time, your test results also include how long it took you to complete your custom-made exam, as well as the average number of seconds per question.

It was a great resource and supplement to my radiography textbooks.As I went through it, the questions and explanations allowed me to determine what I needed to focus on in my studying, and what I already knew. The chapters are broken up into topics, and each question is categorized further into a subspecialty.The questions are pretty tough, and I would say they are moreso than the actual registry exam. This is, in fact, very helpful. The questions share a similar style, which definitely prepares you for what is asked of you on the registry exam. There are about 1000 questions available in this book between all the chapters and the two practice exams.What I found lacking, however, was in the explanations of the answer. Some were, in fact, wrong. Others were too vague or too short. I felt this was the one shortcoming, but I supposed it's why the book should be more of a supplement than a resource. Knowing this, though, forced me to go through my textbooks for the answers that I was not sure about.All in all, the book offers a fairly reliable study guide that leads you in the right direction to pass the registry.

He is the titular Lord of Douglas-dale since the fall of the \\"Black\\" Douglas. John is the thinker of the family and his older brother, Archibald, Earl of Angus is the action man. John starts from just fishing and composing ballads to being thrust onto the nation scene of 15th century Scotland by his infatuation with Princess Mary, daughter of King James the Second and older sister of James III. Mary who would have made the better monarch uses John as her arm of action taking John away from his duties as Archibald's deputy and counselor to errands such as looking after the newly appointed and quickly deposed, Patrick Graham, Archbishop of St. Andrew's. James III's is shown as a indecisive and petulant monarch with more interest in his low-born male favorites than ruling a kingdom. Under the influence of William Shreves, an astrologer and alchemist, James III succumbs and Scotland rebels. Shreves becomes Archbishop and rules all. John attempts to advise and temper his brother Archibald who has thrown in support with Alexander, Duke of Albany, brother of the King. Alexander becomes a competitor for the throne with support of most of the Lords and people of Scotland. Mary continually sends and tasks John again and again. This Tranter novel is a great book, rich in detail and character developement. I had to take my time with it. I felt I knew John well and saw life very vividly through him, from his travels through the Lowlands to visit some Abbots to help Archbishop Graham, we learn more of the Scottish church, old and new. His quest to bring to heel Angus Macdonald of the Isles in the Highlands takes us through the northern part of the land and his eventual friendship of the Duke of Rothesay, James, heir to the throne is his ultimate undoing. John spends much time torn between Mary, his life's love and his brother \\"Archie\\" and family duties. An honest man who is doing anything but waiting, except for maybe some peace and quiet. A very enjoyable read and a very worthy sequel to Price of a Princess, by Tranter. I would rate this Tranter novel with the Bruce Trilogy and the Wallace."},{"Title":"Tomorrow!","review":"This is an amazing book, when taken in the context of it's publication date.

I highly recommend this book written by one of the original pioneers of Science Fiction. It gives you an excellent glimpse into the mindset of post Word War II when everyone went to bed everynight wondering if the \\"Reds\\" would be dropping the atom bomb on them at any moment. I also found the idea, practice and implementation of Civil Defense interesting. Living in earthquake prone California, I beieve that Civil Defense is something that should be brought back with a vengence and taken seriously. Afterall, do you really want to sit around after a disaster and wait for the Government to show up and help you? Can anyone say \\"Katrina\\"? Great book that will provoke intelligent thinking. What more can you ask for?"},{"Title":"Tomorrow!","review":"Several characters are followed through this fascinating novel, setting great groundwork for their experiences when nuclear war suddenly comes to America... and their city.Wylie wrote this at the time when it was JUST becoming possible for nuclear warheads to be delivered by missiles, so bombers and missiles both come into play. So does germ warfare. And the result is a horrendously realistic account of nuclear war as only such a masterful author and researcher as Philip Wylie could portray it. The TV movie, &quot;The Day After,&quot; came along decades later, and scared the wits out of many of its viewers... but that was a Sunday walk in the park compared to THIS story. THIS is the real deal, and when you set this book down, you'll find that it's a story you'll never forget.By the way, if you enjoy this, then you MUST track down a copy of Wylie's LATER nuclear war novel, &quot;Triumph,&quot; and decide for yourself whether or not he topped this earlier work. It's a toss-up!"},{"Title":"Tomorrow!","review":"A moderately well written &quot;end of the world as we know it&quot; book. A great book gets me concerned about the well being of the characters but I just didn't get worked up about them. (Especially the kid who sometimes seemed more a device for exposition than a real child.) The action was good though and the underlying cold war &quot;duck and cover&quot; paranoia seeps through beautifully. Very good with minor flaws."},{"Title":"Tomorrow!","review":"&quot;Tomorrow&quot; is a good book. However, I thought &quot;Triumph&quot; was a better read, despite being considerably darker. Still, this is worth reading, especially for those of us too young to know about &quot;civil defense&quot; drills firsthand.&quot;When Worlds Collide&quot; and &quot;After Worlds Collide&quot; are Wylie's best, and I'd recommend them above &quot;Tomorrow.&quot; If you can find them."},{"Title":"Tomorrow!","review":"Some of the descriptions of destruction in &quot;Tomorrow&quot; read almost like the news reports of the World Trade Center tragedy in New York.Although we now know that the aftermath of a nuclear strike would be much worse than Wylie describes, one of the small points near the end of the book may have a greater significance than the author realized.After the destruction caused in the downtown area, one character comments about future workplaces. The premise was that since people would no longer want to work in the dense, high-rise buildings that were such an easy target, rebuilding would be done as numerous smaller, scattered buildings on the periphery of the city.Have we finally discovered what Wylie wrote 30 years ago: an impressive address - whether the WTC in New York or Peachtree Street in Atlanta - may have value only in its ability to attract unwanted attention and create a target?"},{"Title":"Tomorrow!","review":"I first read this book as a fourth grader and it mesmerized me and horrified me both. Now, thirty years later, it's still powerful reading -- the narration of the actual nuclear attack is spellbinding. We know a great deal more about the effects of a nuclear war now -- for example, the book mentions fallout but it is not depicted as a major problem, and sadly things would be much, much worse in what's left of River City and Green Prairie than the book depicts. But considering how little even experts knew at the time, the book is terrifyingly accurate. It's also just a great read, and ranks with Frank's Alas, Babylon and Wylie's own Triumph (which is confoundedly hard to find!) as a classic of the Age of Anxiety."},{"Title":"Tomorrow!","review":"I find Wylie a little variable in quality, but I liked this one. The characters were a little too stereotypical -- the valiant police lieutenant, the dedicated CD man, the fearless editor, the panicy population, etc., but it was still an entertaining read. There were some attitudes of the 50s here that didn't ring true today about african americans and communists, but it was tolerable.The dated part was that this was a &#34;survivable&#34; nuclear war due to the small number of bombs, the required delivery by aircraft, and the fact that the bombs were airbursts and so had less residual radioactivity. Presumably were we to have an actual nuclear war today (God forbid) it would be much worse. The implication in this book is that society can come back after such a conflict and even &#34;win&#34; the war. The interconnectedness of the markets and our industries today makes that suspect, as do missiles and ground bursts and higher yield weapons.When you compare this against &#34;Threads&#34; the British documentary, you can see that all the CD preparation in the world wouldn't really allow the CD officials in this book to survive the experience. Still it's interesting and very worth reading. I wish it were electronic and about $3.99 at most."},{"Title":"Tomorrow!","review":"If you are a fan of apocalyptic fiction, there are many better books to read than this. While I did finish it, i found it slow moving (very slow), Pretentious in language, and very out of date in the effects of war. I think the real message was about the value of civil defense. An interesting point, but the author, writing in the mid-50's was talking about efftects of atomic bombings that are much milder than true. Totally unrealistic."},{"Title":"The Time of Their Lives (The Tales from Grace Chapel Inn Series #30)","review":"Excellent Reading! A wonderful series of books.

This tends to happen when I reread Tasha Tudor's incredible, \\"A Time to Keep\\", or the little known, \\"Minnikin, Midgie, and Moppet\\" by Adelaide Holl. I haven't felt that way for a while. That is, until I picked up Charlotte Zolotow's unassuming \\"I Can Read Book\\" entitled, \\"Seasons: A Books of Poems\\". Containing forty poems that hinge around the changing seasons as well as the day to day goings on of children, the book's amazing. The poems rich and evocative. The illustrations magical. If you know any children at all, please buy them this book. Please.I don't know the history behind this collection of poems, so there's not much I can really tell you about it. As far as I can determine, it was first published in 2002. The illustrations initially strike you as old fashioned. Lots of country scenes mixed with the occasional cityscape. Then you notice that the kids are wearing contemporary clothing. A child and her mother sport trendy bike helmets as they observe birds flying in formation. Erik Blegvad is the illustrator of this book, and I'm ashamed to say that I don't know a thing about him. Certainly the pictures are particularly Tasha Tudoresque. But unlike Tudor they're pictures that contain very particular moods and emotions. There is a safe world in these illustrations where children are free to run around in fields of golden fallen leaves and have parents and grandparents to play and listen with them. When you read this book to your kids (or they read it to you) it'll create all kinds of wonderful feelings within the child. The watercolors used with these pen and ink pictures display lighting excellently. From the gray skied dawn of a winter morning to the pink summer setting of the sun along a boggy pond.Matching these illustrations word for word are Zolotow's poems. A premiere children's author in her own right (check out \\"William's Doll\\" if you get a chance), I think I'll copy down one of the book's forty poems to give you a sense of her style. This is entitled The Crickets: \\"The crickets fill the night with their voices - It is like a message in another language spoken to a part of me who hasn't happened yet\\". These are poems about the pains and the joys of being young. It's as if Zolotow hasn't forgotten what it was once like. For all her age and experience, she's tapped perfectly into the experience of seeing the world with fresh new eyes.Your child should own books that stay with them the rest of their lives. When you give a child specific stories to hold on to, you give them wonderful memories and fantastic new ways of seeing the world. Charlotte Zolotow's, \\"Seasons: A Book of Poems\\", will be the book I give to every small child that crosses my path from now on. It is infinitely beautiful and incredibly well written. Honor your kid with a copy."},{"Title":"Seasons: A Book of Poems (I Can Read Book 3)","review":"Charlotte Zolotow graces the pages of this gentle book of poetry with imagery and magic as she details the changing seasons from a child's point of view. From Winter Bits &quot;There is a special kind of quiet/every household knows/we hear it in our sleep/the first night it snows.&quot; and Spring Things &quot;There is a wind/light as a feather/against your skin/a soft wind/gentle as a dove.&quot; to Summer Thoughts &quot;One night I saw/flying low/a little flash of fire/like a star/fallen from the sky./&quot;Look,&quot; my mother said./&quot;a firefly!&quot; and finally The Feel of Fall &quot;There is a strong fresh wind/like an eagle flying by./It snatches someone's kite/and keeps it flying high.&quot;, Ms Zolotow's simple, easy to read verses are clever and joyous, sometimes playful and witty, often quiet and dreamy, but always captivating and engaging as they celebrate special moments in each passing season. Erik Blegvad's evocative pen and ink illustrations complement each poem with insight and wonder, and help bring it to life on the page.

I'll only add my encouragement that you buy this book if Russian history and/or Russian films interest you at all. As the author indicates, for better or worse, no other film genre captures the Russian spirit in the 20th century as aptly as do war films. For those who are new to an appreciation of Russian/Soviet cinema, Youngblood provides an excellent introduction to a generous selection of seminal works. For the already-avid fan, like me, her work has expanded my knowledge and appreciation of the great Russian films and filmmakers, and the sociocultural context in which they functioned. Scholarly, to be sure, but in the best sense, and the book is still entertaining and accessible to all. Recommended."},{"Title":"Russian War Films On the Cinema Front, 1914-2005","review":"If interventionism drew the battle lines between East and West for the 20th century, the new art of cinema became an important front in that ideological and cultural war. Indeed, inside the USSR, as Youngblood indicates in this fine new volume, the Soviet film industry was often referred to as the \\"cinema front.\\"The crippled Russian film industry was nationalized in 1919 (interestingly, Nicholas II had apparently considered the same move in 1915, to create a \\"moral state cinema\\" free of \\"the pernicious influence of the western democracies\\"). From that point forward, this \\"most important of the arts\\" (a la Lenin) served a political end: propagandizing on behalf of the Soviet state. And perhaps no films were more important in that effort than films about war, where themes of loyalty, suffering, heroism and sacrifice abound.Youngblood [Disclosure: Dr. Youngblood is on Russian Life's Advisory Board.] covers the eight decades of cinematic history in admirable detail, reviewing and recounting 160 films in all. The result is not merely a thorough history of Russian cinema, but a cultural history of 20th century Soviet and Russian life. After all, Soviet leaders used film to construct their interpretation of reality, to instruct their subjects how to live and how to perceive the wider world.In particular, Youngblood asserts, Russian leaders used war films to create images of the enemy, of the barbarians beyond the gates. \\"Throughout its short history,\\" she writes, \\"the USSR was arguably more concerned with barbarians than most states (save, perhaps, the United States), whether they were real or fabricated, internal or external.\\" Most often the enemy constructs were quite predictable, but in each era, and about each war, Youngblood shows, there were also films with ambiguous heroes, reflecting the often complex nature of the enemy (and also sometimes the artistic courage of the directors) and of war.The history of 20th century Russian film is as layered and deeply textured as the history of the country over this period. Youngblood's encyclopedic analysis offers no grand theory to explain all there is to know on this wide subject - that would be folly. Instead, she carefully explores the veins of artistic development, how they interacted with historical events and real-life politicians and actors. As a reference work for researching plots of some of the most important Russian movies of the last century, this book is without compare. As a tour of the Soviet cinematic landscape, it as valuable as sitting through 160 feature films - with all the useless parts chopped out. (Reviewed inRussian Life)"},{"Title":"The men in blue: Conversations with umpires","review":"Larry Gerlach has done all baseball fans a supreme favor by compiling oral history accounts from umpires who judged the game from every possible angle. &quot;Men In Blue&quot; will linger in your mind for weeks, as one rich anecdote after another comes to mind. Umpires never enter the game for glory; most feel they are doing a poor job if you notice them. And to a man, they say that umpiring can be taught, but never learned; you either have critical judging ability or you don't. After reading this book, your whole impression of baseball as a simple game will have no legs to stand on. Not only do umpires rule, they make or break a great American tradition."},{"Title":"The men in blue: Conversations with umpires","review":"This book is fascinating reading! Granted, because I have umpired some Little League games (and hope to umpire more), I may have more interest in this topic than the typical reader. However, I think even the &quot;typical reader&quot; would enjoy this book. I kept thinking that I did not want the book to end. A sequel would be more than welcome!The interviews are laid out well and the reading is easy and entertaining. It is tied together well so that it does not seem like a jumble of questions and answers (it is not a question-and-answer format, but more of a prose format).You get a feel for the game that you may never have gotten before. You get to hear a little about some of the great names of baseball (Williams, DiMaggio, Robinson, etc.) from a new perspective. It is amazing how similar all the different umpires feel about some players and managers. It certainly heightened my respect for the game, especially for the Men in Blue."},{"Title":"The men in blue: Conversations with umpires","review":"Every high school player should read this book. So should every college player or pedestrian professional baseball player. Men in Blue provides sound insight from the men who made the call on what makes them mad, makes them like a player, and how they make the rules fit the situation.Gerlach provides the fan a better understanding of umpires. It convinced me to think twice before beefing at the ump when I go to games. Although written a bit like a text book without the excitement of a novel, the messages are clear and well presented.Must reading for any true baseball enthusiast."},{"Title":"The men in blue: Conversations with umpires","review":"Author Larry Gerlach presents the views of a dozen of the top retired big-league umpires. Readers learn about calling pitches, working the bases, taking charge, dealing with angry managers and players, heckling fans, etc. These pages also teach us about the lengthy (and low-paid) years in the minors, working on two and three-man crews, constant travel, road lonliness, etc. This book can open your eyes to the life of baseball umpires - who unlike referees in other sports enjoy no halftime break to visit the bathroom or grab a cold soda. I particularly liked reading the words of Beans Reardon, Ed Stewart, Jim Honochick, Ed Sudol, and Emmet Ashford, but each man had many interesting things to say. Readers also learn about several players, like Ted Williams (hard for reporters, but an angel to umps), Joe DiMaggio, Willie Mays, Sandy Koufax, Bill Dickey, Bob Feller, Mickey Lolich, Hoyt Whilhelm, etc. Having both played and umpired local softball, I heartily agree that good umpires hustle into position to make the right call - this also earns respect from players and lessens arguments.This book is a bit dated (published 1980) and at this writing only Ed Sudol and Bill Kinnamon remain with us. Still, this is a very readable, revealing look at both baseball and the men in blue."},{"Title":"The men in blue: Conversations with umpires","review":"I have been interested in the umpire's world since I was a kid. I was never a good athlete but was hyper-fair in decision making on the ballfield and knew the rules, so I enjoyed being the arbiter from time to time. The book is quite interesting because it covers a long range of time, from the 1930's to the 1970's. The umps in the beginning of the book were ones I had heard about for the most part; but the last part of the book dealt with umpires I watched in my youth. There are funny anecdotes and I was surprised at the rigid honesty of some of the complaints about specific men in baseball, whether they be players, managers, owners, and sometimes even other umpires. A fun read. My only small complaint is that although you catch a glimpse of the varying personalities of those sharing their story, the writing style tends to be virtually the same and somewhat dry on occasion. But if you are a baseball fan, this set of a dozen umpires' storylines is enjoyable."},{"Title":"The men in blue: Conversations with umpires","review":"Gerlach delivers! This book details the professional lives of umpires who called the game in from the 1920s up through the early 1970s.

The story of the two STEVES is local legend and The Woz and Jobs are our heroic icons, people our kids aspire to emulate.I became an APPLE FREAK in 1984 when I purchased my first Macintosh to lay-out my Silicon Valley Union newspaper. That little machine (with the 10-inch screen) saved me $1500 monthly in lay-out fees (with the help of PageMaker) ... and that ain't \\"chicken feed.\\" Thanks, Apple!That's a long time ago and since then I've gone through the Liisa, the Classic, the Quadra, and am currently using an iMac. I've written eight books with the help of Mac, two in print, one due out in November, 2005. Thanks, Steves!But as great as I think the computers are, the men behind them are even greater. I don't know Jobs, but I've met The Woz on several occasions and he is not only the brains behind Apple, he's a \\"genuinely good, caring man.\\" Ask anyone in the Valley about him. As one little example, he unselfishly allowed me to use him as a character in my kids book, THE TOONIES INVADE SILICON VALLEY, and it's a riot to read about him romping around with cartoon characters and real kids trying to save the world from the \\"bad\\" Toonies. That's just one example of his generosity; he has contributed to many charitable and educational institutions in Silicon Valley and beyond. Thanks, Woz!One other thing I admire about Steve Wozniak is that he has always loved to tell jokes (and, YES, to pull practical jokes on people too). I've been trying to locate a joke book he wrote years ago. Go, Woz!To learn about this remarkable man, from age 11 when he built his first computer, read this book.

As time goes on, maybe one of the unforseen feats of Simenon, is that he has left a series of quite accurate images of French society as he experienced it. In this book we discover the world of Hotel Majestic in Paris, seen from the perspective of the employees. We are also a trip to Cannes and Cte d'Azur discovering the life of prostitutes there. The plot of the crime Maigret is unveiling in this book is quite sophisticated, perhaps a bit to sophisiticated?"},{"Title":"Maigret and the Hotel Majestic","review":"This is my first foray into the Inspector Maigret books, one of eighty-eight mysteries written over the course of 42 years by Georges Simenon. Written in his native tongue, these books have been translated by others from French to English, and there are minor jolts here and there when everybody is \\"speaking\\" in English in the translation, but one character can't understand what another is saying because he is speaking in another language, yet both appear to speak in English in the dialogue. Also, the author bombards us with information, names, and details that do little else but pad the number of pages. And there's a glaring error. In the beginning and end sections of the book, it is the cold of winter, which a number of characters complain about. But in the middle, chapter 6 and 7, it is suddenly the Fourteenth of July and everybody is sweltering in the heat. Yet, the entire story takes place in a matter of days. Maigret's investigative procedure seems to be to put himself adjacent to the suspects, and because of his reputation as a crack detective, they start blathering on and on and saying things they shouldn't as he remains quiet. And the clue that solves the case is so obscure, and so particular to an uncommon human experience, that I would dare say only a miniscule number of readers would have any knowledge at all of the circumstance. Still there were eighty-eight of these stories comprising a very popular series of books and yielding a TV series and several films. So, I will withhold judgment on the Maigret books until I read a few more. But if this one is any indication, I just don't understand it. (Note: After having read a number of these stories, I new believe that this particiular Maigret book can be explained away by the premise that even Babe Ruth struck out once in a while.)"},{"Title":"The Mason Jar Cookie Cookbook","review":"I'm not sure if these recipes were actually made by the author.

We carefully selected a cookie recipe (Death by Chocolate Cookies) tried it, gave some to our friends, everybody loved the recipe. I stocked up on sugar and cocoa, lined up my jars and started filling them. Luckily I ran out of flour at 7 jars (forgot to get more flour when I was stocking up); I say luckily because by the time I had 2/3 of the sugar in one of the jars (with the chocolate chips still to go) I was completely out of room! Now, mind you, I DID make the age old mistake of assuming (and we all know what happens when we assume) that the recipe would fit in the jar without adding up the measurements of the ingredients to discover that I had about 5 cups worth of ingredients to go in a 1 quart jar (and yes, that IS what the book calls for, we double checked!) so I now have 6 jars with a bunch of flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt and 1 jar with all that plus 1 cup of sugar and I am about to go dump all of it in the trash! While I have been writing this, I assigned my husband to check some of the other recipes and he has discovered 1 out of 5 recipes so far that will actually fit!

But because of this, all too often other aspects of good literature have been ignored or given short shrift by all too many authors. Zelazny does not fall into this trap.The driving idea behind this book is the ability, with the help of some fancy technology, of a trained neuroparticipant therapist to directly monitor and control his patient's dreams. There is a downside to this: the therapist had better be very emotionally stable himself, else he runs the risk of having the patient take control and impress his thoughts and emotional problems on the therapist. Zelazny takes this basic concept and wraps it first in truly excellent prose; much of this work reads almost like a prose poem. He adds two strong characters, Charles Render, the therapist, and Eileen Shallot, a blind-from-birth woman who wants to be a therapist herself, but must first get over the problem of how to deal with the sights and visions that her future patients will have. Render (and I believe the name is significant, though this is a literary device Zelazny did not normally use) is a tightly controlled person, carefully bulwarking his emotional walls from the pain of the death of his wife and driven to over-protect his brilliant son. Though repeatedly warned of the dangers, he finds the challenge of introducing Eileen to the world of sight irresistible. Thus the stage is set for a trip through the world of dreams, dreams that are perhaps both simpler and more comprehensible than the garden variety most people have, but described with such excellence that it is almost like seeing a sequence of pictures, watercolors and oils in vivid colors.The side characters also have important roles to play, from Eileen's talking seeing-eye dog to Render's nominal current love interest, Jill DeVille. Their actions precipitate the final action of the story, and indicate that the story is both carefully plotted and has a thematic depth that can only be seen when the play of irony surrounding these events and the careful allusions to certain legendary characters is carefully examined.This story was originally published in slightly shorter form as \\"He Who Shapes\\", which took the Nebula award for best novella in 1965. With this expanded form, I think the final irony is more sharply defined, his main characters better fleshed out, but perhaps there are places where some unnecessary verbiage has been added. I would be hard pressed to declare which version is better.The idea is only the kernel. Roger's layers of wrapping with all the elements of good storytelling is what makes this story a worthwhile read.--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"The Dream Master (Ace #F-403)","review":"First let me start off by saying that I am a huge Zelazny fan and that would most likely make me extremely biased. But I also like Shakespeare, Fitzgerald, and Lovecraft - so I think I can be fairly open-minded and am somewhat well-rounded. Contrary to most of the reviews on this book, I thought that 'The Dream Master' was very very good. True the characters could've been deeper, but Zelazny's writing style is captivating in and of itself. There is so much happening in this novel and is at the same time almost without purpose. This, I would say, is a novel for the Zelazny fan who has already read (and liked) his Amber Series and 'Lord of Light' (also check out 'Night in Lonesome October' for a new avenue of Zelazny thought) - because I think that this novel is more like 'basking in the sunlight' of the style of a truely ingenious writer. So in that respect it succeeds and if you appreciate a writer's style and ability to interest (even without a major plot!) then you would probably enjoy this one."},{"Title":"The Dream Master (Ace #F-403)","review":"Zelazny's prose is always polished nearly to a poetic lustre, and once you jump into it, it carries you along so swiftly that it seems almost unsafe to get out until it comes to an end. He doesn't insult the reader's intelligence by overwriting or overexplaining. The drawback of that last trait is that in any work of his you're liable to find yourself speeding along only to slam into a brick wall raised by some arcane reference of the author's, leaving you momentarily dazed and wondering what you just read. Having said that about his work in general, I'll say that it's mostly true in this work too. Others have said it reads like a padded short story, and that's exactly what it is. It was originally published as the so-called novella &quot;He Who Shapes,&quot; which won a Nebula award in 1965. It's better in that shorter form, but Zelazny did a passable job when he subsequently expanded it into this fuller version. Often short stories suffer when expanded like this (Hemingway's &quot;To Have and Have Not&quot; comes to mind), but in this case I think both versions are very good. If you haven't read the short story, you won't know what you're not missing when you read &quot;The Dream Master.&quot; Still, if you're new to Zelazny, you're probably better off picking up a compendium of his short works or of Nebula winners that includes &quot;He Who Shapes.&quot; His work is easier to digest at first in small servings."},{"Title":"The Dream Master (Ace #F-403)","review":"Zelazny's prose is in fine form here and he displays a myriad of interesting ideas quite well. In fact some of the background filling in of the world is more interesting than the plot. In particular the mutated dog and his relationship with normal dogs and human society.Prose aside, Zelazny manages to be at once all too clever and heavy handed. Calling the Dream Master \\"Render\\" and having his female patient be named \\"Eileen Shallot\\". Other references to classic myth abound as if Zelazny is telling the reader \\"Oh, aren't I/We so smart, catch the symbolism and foreshadowing here??\\"The plot is fairly simplistic, and the ending heavily foreshadowed. For all that it still managed to get me a little engaged even though it was obvious how it was going to happen. Unfortunately, virtually all the characters are unlikeable, from Render, to Shallot, to his girlfriend DeVille and in particular his son as well as Shallot's dog.Several interesting plot threads are developed and just left hanging. As this was an expansion of a short-story why not flesh out those plot threads. What's with Render's suicide obsession, and the suicides we see of people in the society? What's wrong with the mutated dog, why does he run off and torment normal dogs, is this normal or is the dog as broken as his Mistress?The quality of writing and the ideas though save this from being a poor novel and pull it into the firmly average bracket. Zelazny fans, or those into novels of dreaming such as Lathe of Heaven may wish to give this a look."},{"Title":"The Dream Master (Ace #F-403)","review":"Robert Zelazny wasn't quite in top form in &quot;Dream Master,&quot; a rather jumbled SF novel that delves into the human mind. Zelazny writes with his usual minimalist poetry, but the finale and characters are definitely lacking. It's a nice read, but far from Zelazny's best.Charles Render is a neuroparticipant therapist -- he taps into his patients' dreams and analyzes them to tell them what their undisclosed problems are. For example, he finds out that one man imagines enemies because the alternative is being ignored. His own problems go un-dealt with -- the death of his wife in a car crash, which has left him with some lingering guilt issues.Then he meets Eileen Shallot, who wants the same kind of job he has. The problem is: she's been blind all her life, and no therapist of that kind has ever been blind because they get overwhelmed by the dreams. But he agrees to help Eileen gradually -- by letting her see through his eyes.&quot;Dream Master&quot; was once a short story, and was expanded dramatically to make it into this novella. It's definitely a mixed blessing -- on one hand, Zelazny has plenty of room to paint strange dreamscapes and weird twists of the imagination. On the other, &quot;Master&quot; is definitely padded.So long as &quot;Master&quot; sticks close to the interactions between Charles and Eileen, the story stays solid and sleek. But there are also a lot of scenes that do nothing except distract, like anything involving Jill DeVille (Charles' bland girlfriend) or the talking doggie.Certainly Zelazny takes an unconventional and interesting idea -- psychotherapy using a &quot;dream machine&quot; -- and manages to wring a whole book out of that sole idea. His sparse prose really blossoms in the dream sequences, becoming lusher and stranger. They're not terribly strange as dreams usually are, but they're definitely interesting.Charles isn't a terribly likable protagonist; he's a bit of a know-it-all. Okay, he's a doctor, but his condescension towards his patients comes across as arrogance. Eileen seems a little more likable, with her obsession with overcoming her disabilities. The other characters -- Charles' son and Jill -- are pretty much nonentities.&quot;Dream Master&quot; makes up for lackluster characters with Zelazny's imagination and excellent prose. Just don't expect him to be in top form in this dreamy scifi exploration."},{"Title":"The Dream Master (Ace #F-403)","review":"Dr. Charles Render is a psychiatrist who uses advanced technology to manipulate the dreams of his patients in this confused and ultimately depressing novel by Roger Zelazny. The therapy Render practices is called neuroparticipation, and allows the doctor to enter the dreams of his patients and act out fantasies that ease the patients' problems. While this may seem a little far-fetched, Zelazny has posited a world where such marvels as programmable flying cars and intelligent talking dogs are cutting edge technology. Despite the difficulty of his work, Render himself seems a less than perfect psychological specimen. He harbors some lingering guilt over the death of his wife some years previously, and compensates for it by being very overprotective of his brilliant young son. This doesn't prevent him from undertaking the most challenging patient of his career, Eileen Shallot, a blind-from-birth Resident in Psychiatry who wants to be a neuroparticipant like Render. The dream-molding device enables Eileen to see with Render's eyes, and much of the action of the novel is Eileen's adventures in learning to see. Although not overlong, this book strike one as a marvelous short story that has been padded out to an all-too-predictable conclusion. Much of the book seems pointless and off the subject and is often merely confusing, especially when it shifts point of view. For example, the long digressions with Render's girlfriend Jill DeVille and the extended trip with the talking dog both contribute nothing to the story, and could have been cut without any loss whatsoever. But perhaps the biggest weakness of this book is that none of the characters are particularly likable. Render is over-confident, over-bearing, and self-centered. Miss DeVille's attraction to him seems almost unfathomable unless we assume she's after his money. And Eileen Shallot seems driven by a monomania that is more of a handicap than her blindness. As a result, the reader can be forgiven for not much caring about what happens to these people. Zelazny's skill with prose is never in doubt; his descriptions are almost poetic in their serene beauty, but he gives himself very little plot to work with here, and characters whose fate means nothing to us. The dream sequences are not nearly as imaginative as one would expect, and the few interesting ideas we are presented us with don't really seem that revolutionary anymore in the 21st century, making this book a victory of style over substance. If you're not really a fan of Zelazny's work, this one probably won't change your mind."},{"Title":"The Dream Master (Ace #F-403)","review":"Picked this at random from the local bookstore. First impressions are that the prose is wonderfully poetic, and if thats indicative of Zelaznys writing, I shall certainly endeavour to read more.Loved the concepts, with regards to the actual story I found it somewhat directionless, with the ending slightly predictable.Nonetheless, a worthwhile exercise."},{"Title":"The Dream Master (Ace #F-403)","review":"The plot was thin. We followed characters that had absolutely no bearing on the plot. Some of the prose, while stylish and full of images, seemed random and sometimes confusing. This story had a lot of potential, but it feels like a 3 page short story stretched to make a novel. Not Zelazny's best work."},{"Title":"The Dream Master (Ace #F-403)","review":"I like most of the writings of Roger Zelazny that I have read. He is a student of the Qabalah and the Grail and embeds real knowledge of some esoteric spiritual practices in his entertaining stories. This one started out as a short story and expanded into a full book. The style is very condensed. It seems that not a word is wasted. Some paragraphs say a lot. The story is about a therapist who uses a machine to enter into the dreams of others and even make dreams for them. A physically blind woman wants to know what seeing is like. The therapist memorizes his day time experiences and shares them in the sessions, visits museums and has her join him in the dream of what he did during the day. The theme of our ordinary world being a dream is touched upon indirectly through this medium, with the therapist almost becoming a god for the blind woman as she gradually learns how to see and to visualize in this shared space. There are multiple themes playing out through the pages with Qabalistic themes used in the background, for instance a master of the tree of life does not merely ascend the middle pillar, but must be able to go up and down the tree of life."},{"Title":"Sign of Chaos (Chronicles of Amber)","review":"This book, like many in series SF, can not be read independently of the rest in the series. Its main fault is that it is frequently chaotic and can be difficult to follow, especially if it has been awhile since you read the previous stories. The protagonist, Merlin, continues his sparring with Luke, Jasra,and the Mask, and his girlfriend, Julia is back in the story, unknown to Merlin at first. Merlin's brother, Jurt, also is involved, along with multiple other extended family members.Zelazny fans will like this, but the Amber premise is noticably tiring in this story."},{"Title":"Sign of Chaos (Chronicles of Amber)","review":"In the Sign of Chaos, Zelazny turns the magic of his sorcerous Logrus initiates loose in a big way, including a very entertaining sequence where Merlin, his very interesting half brother Mandor, and a surprising third ally make an assault on the Keep of the Four Winds. Spells and fur fly, and in the end Merlin finally gets a handle on who all the players may be in his troubles through these books, if possibly not a clear picture of all their motivations. We also see more interaction with the Ghostwheel.As with both five book Amber series, Sign of Chaos does not stand on its own. It is, fittingly, just the middle of this very intricate series of mysteries and adventures.Zelazny's writing continued to entertain in a way separate from the plot itself. For example, he gives Merlin very clever and amusing names for his spells. Merlin continues to be a fascinating combination of spunky and naive, taking great pains to follow his own agenda despite what those around him might prefer. Many of Zelazny's characters from the first Amber series play interesting roles, along with new, vibrant characters introduced here with Merlin's story.I'm having a terrific time reading these books again. As I write this review I'm halfway done with the final book, and I'll be a bit sad to be done with them."},{"Title":"Sign of Chaos (Chronicles of Amber)","review":"Merlin is trapped in a crazy version of Wonderland, which is actually, of course, just a Shadow. Some complex sorcerous shenanigans by various members of his family, ensue, as well as contact with Fiona, and stunts similar to Brand's, in the first series."},{"Title":"Sign of Chaos (Chronicles of Amber)","review":"Sign of Chaos is the critical moment when the story line (of which this is the eighth) blurs out for a while. It's not a bad book by any means, but Merlin's story is one of an ever-increasing number of people who want to either kill him or run his life for him. This book is that critical mass when there are so many characters to keep track of that small minds like this reviewer's tend to shut down.Fittingly enough, the book starts out with Merlin and Luke trapped in the Mad Hatter's Tea Party Bar, where the previous volume left them off. A psychedelic Mickey has turned Luke into a hallucination machine and it takes both ingenuity and chemistry for Merlin to take his leave. He makes it back to Amber only to discover that he has a new, and beautiful aunt. Who just as promptly disappears, leaving Merlin once again in the clutches of an old friend.Along the way Merlin picks up Mandor, his older brother on the Chaos side, and Jasra, who is now a 'friendly' enemy instead of a coat rack. This is about where characters and plot get so intricate that you may wish you had been keeping score from the beginning. Zelazny is merciless, captivating his readers at the same time he is confusing them.By way of personal history, I took a several year break from the series at this point, picking up the last two volumes when the appeared in paperback. You may feel like doing the same thing, but there are only two more quick volumes to go and you will be a member of the I Love Amber club, a very exclusive group of folks."},{"Title":"Sign of Chaos (Chronicles of Amber)","review":"This book held interesting turns!

The photos couldn't be more glossy and enjoyable to look at. If you are a Rat Terrier lover, you will surely find these photos, taken of all sizes and colors of Rats, in various stages of life, locations, and poses, great fun to compare to your own special pet.This book is 93 pages long, and the first 29 pertain to the history and standards of the breed. The vast majority of the remaining 64 pages might just as well apply to any breed of dog, as they contain general dog care information: feeding, grooming, housetraining, obedience training, and general health issues. I found the book somewhat disappointing in that respect, however, I still enjoyed it, even if just to learn a little more about the breed and to peruse the wonderfully shiny photos in the book. (Excluding the eight totally unnecessary photos of various recommended &quot;Nylabone&quot; products.)I am glad, however, that Linda Hibbard put together this book so that there is at least one easily obtainable publication dedicated exclusively to this wonderful little breed of dog. If you are a book lover as well as a Rat Terrier lover, get the book - it's fun!

I also have Ratter Chatter, which is a different type of book entirely. I have to recommend the Hibbard book as well as the Ratter Chatter (by Blair) book as they are both wonderful if you are into the breed.As a general rule, most dog breed books contain puppy information which could apply to basically any breed of dog. I would not discount this book's credibility because it contains information on raising a pup that applies to all breeds. I also have to agree with one reviewer in the fact that some of the information was duplicated in different parts of the book. I discovered that as well, however, I choose to believe that the author felt it may have been prudent to revisit that information maybe worded slightly differently in more than one section.I do recommend this book for all Rat Terrier enthusiasts. Don't limit yourself to reading just this one book though. There is limited information on this breed so read as many books as you can on the subject."},{"Title":"Rat Terrier: A Complete and Reliable Handbook (Complete & Reliable Handbook)","review":"I stopped reading this book part-way through the second chapter. The author's writing style in uninviting, and some of the material in one section is repeated in a later section. My wife read more of the book, and found that some sections of the book read like they were cut and pasted from earlier sections of the book. The author also repeats as fact the story that Theodore Roosevelt named the Rat Terrier. In other sources that I have consulted, this story is presented as legend. In one source, the breed of the dogs owned by Roosevelt was something other than Rat Terrier. I, too, disliked the many photographs of various dog chews and toys.

I felt the information wasn't breed specific enough, more like generalized canine information. The pictures did not represent what a good quality rat terrier SHOULD look like. Most dogs pictured had oversized ears, buggy eyes, and their confirmation was awful! Most of the rats pictured in this book are poor representations of the breed, and would motivate most purchasers to steer clear. - A breeder in Colorado."},{"Title":"Rat Terrier: A Complete and Reliable Handbook (Complete & Reliable Handbook)","review":"Such a great book - information on where they came from to how to handle this cute breed of dog."},{"Title":"Rat Terrier: A Complete and Reliable Handbook (Complete & Reliable Handbook)","review":"The book is well written.

Penned, obviously, by an author who loves her rat terrier and who enjoys telling stories, the book contains very little usable information. It has no guidelines for training that are specific to the breed, no cautions for health concerns that are prevalent in rat terriers and has only a brief history with no sourcing. Additionally, many sections read like product advertisements, touting the wonders of Nylabone.This is a fine book for general information and for \\"awww, how cute,\\" but turned out to be not at all what I needed."},{"Title":"Rat Terrier: A Complete and Reliable Handbook (Complete & Reliable Handbook)","review":"While this was admittedly a first attempt at defining a diverse breed, the effort expended doesn't warrant the price required, NOR does it do the breed ANY justice.The information is general at best, misleading or just plain wrong at worst - for better general info of canines check out The Art of Raising a Puppy by the Monks of New Skeete. The grammar and organization is non-existant and does more to confuse than clarify. The majority of the pictures do not represent the look of the breed and it will require a much more in depth investigation to dispell their misrepresentations - Anne Blair's Ratter Chatter would give potential Rat Terrier owners a much more accurate, specific overall view of the breed, even though it is aimed at people who are already owned by Rat Terriers.Save your money!!! Flip through Linda Hibbard's book in the bookstore an example of what Rat Terriers shouldn't look like, and then buy ANY other dog book for general dog info. OR contact a local breeder, rescue, dog club - you'll get a much better idea of the strengths and weaknesses of this wonderful breed, PLUS you will be able to see what a Rat Terrier SHOULD look like."},{"Title":"Rat Terrier: A Complete and Reliable Handbook (Complete & Reliable Handbook)","review":"The book is comprehensive and has many color photos of Rat Terriers....I have had mine for two years and until I got the book, knew very little about them.

This is very well done and the history section is wonderful. My only complaint is I would have liked to see more varied photos of the breed, since there are several different types and colors. The author is obviously very focused on her own dogs and features them prominently, but it would have been nice to see a greater representation of the breed.

Definitely worth getting if you love this breed as I do!"},{"Title":"Rat Terrier: A Complete and Reliable Handbook (Complete & Reliable Handbook)","review":"Being an English major, the authors depicted the book and pure bred excellently. Their English was great and the pictures were excellent. Apparently this was the authors first attempt at a book and their only intention was to put a book out on this rare breed.We did not need the ignorant Southerners remarks about a rescue shelter. This book gives facts and does not encourage anything about going to a breeder. You people should be ashamed of yourselves."},{"Title":"Rat Terrier: A Complete and Reliable Handbook (Complete & Reliable Handbook)","review":"As many have said, this book is just too generic. Beyond that, I must take issue with the comments by &quot;A reader from colorado&quot; above. Millions of dogs die in shelters each year because breeders massively overproduce puppies to conform to some artificial human standard of beauty. Who the #)(@*$*( cares?! It's personality that counts. If you want a Rat Terrier or any dog-- do not go to a breeder but visit your local shelter or an on-line resource such as Petfinder.org. Breeding dogs should be criminal until every single unwanted canine has been placed in a permanent loving home. I have a rescue RT, and she is a fantastic girl.

As a kindergarten teacher, she meets a widower with an adorable little girl, Phoebe (her mother was one of Eloises souls...). Although it is obvious that Eloise is going to end up with the lovable widower, the story has some very original ideas and lots of humor!

Suffering the loss of his wife, Nathan Baxter must concentrate now on his adorable child, Phoebe. Never counting on finding love again he's taken aback &amp; confused by Phoebe's teacher, Miss Starr. When you begin reading you will not put it down. What kind of creature is captivating the detective?

The second of her Angel Trilogy, I can say her books just keep getting better."},{"Title":"Heaven Sent","review":"I am an avid reader of Judi McCoy's work, and this book is great. It starts out on the sweet and funny side with an angel named Eloise who is sent to earth as a human so she can experience life and perhaps be more understanding of the souls she watches over, then moves to a sexy read when she meets the man of her earthly and angelic dreams and his adorable 5 year old daughter. A second love interest makes this book more interesting than the kind where there is only one action/ interaction between a hero and heroine, especially since the romance is between an older woman/younger man.I highly recommend this novel and can't wait for the final book in the trilogy to be released."},{"Title":"Heaven Sent","review":"Eloise is a guiding angel who is having a hard time connecting with her human charges. To learn some life lessons, she is sent to earth as a human kindergarten teacher, where she meets widower Nathan Baxter and his adorable daughter, Phoebe, who will teach her about love and what it really means to be human.I adored this book. It was not only romantic, but warm and happy. The scenes in the kindergarten classroom were sweet and funny and I especially liked the laugh-out-loud Christmas Pageant storyline. I really enjoyed the ancillary characters like Ms. Hewitt, Rita Mae, and Mr. Belgradian.Grammar Police, beware: this book wasn't edited very well and had loads of mistakes (lots of you're/your mixups). In my opinion, the story was good enough to make up for this!

I cannot wait for her third book in this series, and I hear her February book, Wanted: One Perfect Man, is unique and groundbreaking."},{"Title":"Long Way Home (Buffy the Vampire Slayer Angel Unseen)","review":"Halfway through &quot;Long Way Home,&quot; the final book in the Unseen Buffy/Angel Crossover Trilogy by Nancy Holder and Jeff Mariotte, the story gets as complex as a Tom Clancy novel. At one point, in terms of plot threads, (1) Buffy, (2) Angel, (3) Spike and (4) Salma are all in different alternities; back in Sunnydale (5) Riley is dealing with a shadow monster, (6) Giles, Xander and Anya are looking for Riley, while (7) Joyce is at Giles' apartment worrying about Buffy; in Los Angeles (8) Wesley, Willow and Cordelia are trying to get Alina to fix the Reality Tracer, as (9) the Latino gangs are fighting the Russian Mafiya, (10) Nicky is having a heart to heart with his grandmother; (11) Kate is investigating the disappearance of all the kids and (12) Faith is having fun in prison; meanwhile (13) Mischa is still planning on meeting Alina at the Grand Canyon. I think that covers everything, since there are no scenes of Gunn or the Flores family doing anything at this point and I assume Dennis was already finished with the dishes back at Cordy's apartment.What all these plot threads mean is that Buffy and Angel are competing for time with every other character in the story, so those who pick up the Unseen Trilogy hoping for the two main characters to spend significant time together, are going to be disappointed. All you have to do is look at the front and back covers of &quot;Long Way Home&quot; to know that Spike and Faith are supposed to have prominent roles in the story, but Spike gets caught in something of an alternity dead end while it takes a while for Faith to become involved, even when you know what the plan is regarding the reformed Rogue Slayer. The last part of the book basically has all those groups meeting and slowly reducing the number of plot threads until we are down to three locations where stuff is happening. There really is not a big climax here; it is more a case of things winding down.When reviewing the first book in the Unseen trilogy I commented on the inherent problems with characterization in writing Buffy/Angel books, so that most of the characters are pretty much treading water. This time around I want to point out one plus and one minus in this regard: on the plus side, Holder and Mariotte do a really nice job of fleshing out Riley's feelings for Buffy, their relationship, Angel, and a lot of other stuff going on. But on the minus side of the equation I think Faith regresses a bit too much to where she was before the big confrontation with Angel. Another nice touch was that the writers presented Buffy and Angel as having different conceptions of what the best of all possible worlds would be. The bottom line is that while the Unseen Trilogy is not the grand epic we saw with the Gatekeeper Trilogy, it is a worthy effort. But next time there is a Buffy/Angel crossover, the two starcrossed lovers better be together for a bigger chunk of the action."},{"Title":"Long Way Home (Buffy the Vampire Slayer Angel Unseen)","review":"Nancy Holder and Jeff Mariotte have brought their crossover trilogy to an end in grand style. Action packed this book brings each of the complex plots to an agreeable end. Everyone plays apart as the gang tries to defeat the monsters, find the missing children, and stop the gang warfare. It is the action rather than the relationships, which sparkle in this story. The battles are well written. Poodle size rats, disembodied armor, slavers, mad zoo keepers, shadows, giant worms and miscellaneous monsters threaten the gang.Because there are so many characters it is hard to give them equal time or explore their emotions as much as fully as the reader might like. Not only do we have Buffy, Angel and their gangs, but even Faith and the mayor make an appearance. The authors for the most part have done an excellent job of working in the series history and keeping the characters true to their TV personalities. There are some lovely inside jokes that true Buffy fans will love. There are, however, some inconsistencies. When Faith is added to the team she pitches in to help Angel but says she owes Buffy nothing. Yet the last we saw Faith on the TV series she was acknowledging that Buffy was the only one who gave her chance after chance and that she had not only rejected her friendship but had attacked her friends and messed with her life. So it was hard to understand her anger at Buffy.The back drop of the other realities was very intriguing. I loved the vampire zoo especially and the worm tunnels made my skin crawl. A nice touch was the temptations. Although I think that Angel's temptation would have been more realistic if it had not excluded Buffy.I enjoyed the trilogy and this book in particular. I recommend it highly to Buffy fans but I would not suggest reading it without reading the other two Unseen volumes first."},{"Title":"Long Way Home (Buffy the Vampire Slayer Angel Unseen)","review":"Volume Two if this series, &quot;Door to Alternity,&quot; left us hanging as Buffy and Angel prepared to leave this world to search through alternate universes for those missing from L.A. and Sunnydale. Entering through separate portals their plan was to meet on the other side, track down the missing, and return in one piece. Sound easy? It might have been in the planning stages, but Spike's last minute decision to jump through the portal in search of a more vampire friendly world destroys the link between Tara, Willow, Dona Pilar, Alina and Buffy. Suddenly Buffy, Angel, and Spike as well are stranded separately, in serious trouble, with no idea how to proceed.While those left behind struggle to reestablish the link, each of the adventurers finds themselves faced with unexpected opposition. Buffy materializes just in time to find herself in unarmed combat with a dragon. No sooner is that peril vanquished when she comes under attack by an overly aggressive suit of armor. She manages another escape and enters a castle where she is chased everywhere by giant guard rats down halls with lots (really lots) of doors. Angel appears and discovers that he must rescue a damsel in distress from several very bad guys. When said damsel takes Angel home to meet her witch grandmother Angel suddenly finds he is deep in combat with the rest of the very, very bad guys.And Spike? Spike finds himself in what first appears to be vampire heaven, complete with rivers running with blood. When he talks to several other vampire residents he discovers that rather than heaven, he has landed in the multiverse's only vampire zoo. Escape he does, but finds that he is running from of a world full of people who keep zapping him with ray guns. Meanwhile, back home, Tara, Willow, and Dona Pilar have figured out how to reestablish contact and an emergency jailbreak is engineered to send in the shock troops, Faith.At some point, the hysterical reader will realize that almost everyone who could appear in this Buffy story actually does, right down to a certain Sunnydale mayor. On top of this we have innumerable dimension hopping monsters, battling Russian and Hispanic gangs, and even the L.A. police. Wherever you read, something is coming to a boil. Somehow, Nancy Holder and Jeff Mariotte manage to keep things together and maintain pace throughout the entire novel. From a character viewpoint things have stabilized and the Riley/Buffy and Tara/Willow relationships work much more effortlessly than in previous volumes. I don't think you will be disappointed. This whole series is a must read for diehard Buffy fans, and bodes well for future volumes."},{"Title":"Long Way Home (Buffy the Vampire Slayer Angel Unseen)","review":"Long way home was a nice ending to Unseen overall, but I didn't like the ending to Long way home itself. What Nicky does for Selma really shows that he has grown up since the start of Unseen in The burning. Overall the book was really good. Faith had some really funny lines. You won't beleave what she says to Buffy at one point. The Angel and Buffy interaction was right on. If your fan of the show buy the book you won't be disappointed mostly. Bye for now."},{"Title":"Long Way Home (Buffy the Vampire Slayer Angel Unseen)","review":"WOW! That was a whirlwind of chaos and loose ends never tied up.I loved the first two books in this trilogy and couldn't wait to get my hands on the last book, the conclusion of what, until now, had been a great story.Things kinda fell apart in this book. Okay ... not kinda. They totally fell apart.The authors tried to pack so much into this one novel that it's almost impossible to keep up with without a map! It was rushed, and as a reader I felt it. It left me feeling winded and exhausted.As others have mentioned, the continuity in this novel leaves much to be desired. There were storylines left unfinished, big ones.Willow stops breathing and dies in one chapter, steps out of the room looking pale and ill and says to Cordy, \\"I feel dead,\\" in another chapter, and then is her usual self in the rest of the book. It ends with no conclusion or even acknowledgment that it even occured at all. I kept waiting for Willow to go evil and betray them, or take some kind of unexpected action as a result of apparently dying, but nada.Faith is thrown in the mix in a slick, almost after-thought manner that doesn't do her character justice. (And that says a LOT coming from me, because I'm not a Faith or Eliza fan.) She comes in and saves everyone, despite their obvious distrust, and then hugs Buffy and Angel before willingly going back to jail. She didn't even get a Thank You. It just didn't fly, it was never rang true or came to life for me.And then there's Spike. I love this guy. Love the wit, the naughty undertone to his character and the huge heart he tries to hide. (Figuratively speaking, of course.) He's a great character, and provides great comic relief. But what in the world happened to him? What was the ending supposed to mean? The story ended with him, in his pre-vamp body, running like a coward and hurling himself into a light, begging for help.Huh?When this book ends, it leaves the reader feeling like the story is unfinished. They crammed too much into it and it got sloppy. They could've easily fleshed it out and added another novel to the series.A disappointing ending to what had otherwise been a terrific story."},{"Title":"Long Way Home (Buffy the Vampire Slayer Angel Unseen)","review":"This book seemed pretty flat to me, compared to the characters on the TV show. Especially the sub-plot surrounding Spike. There was a lot \\"happening\\" in this book, but I couldn't be moved to care much. Unlike the show, where you can go from tears to laughing out loud in a heartbeat."},{"Title":"Long Way Home (Buffy the Vampire Slayer Angel Unseen)","review":"I don't read Buffy books because they are great lit, I read them to get just a bit more fun from the characters I love. Even with that caveat, this series is a major disappointment. For one thing there is nothing &quot;fun&quot; about this plot. It's all unrelenting gloom and boring dialogue (and what is Buffy if not snappy banter?). The writing is poor and there are silly errors, especially continuity errors - both from book to book (cotton pants turn to leather, even after we are told &quot;no clothing from animals&quot;) and from the series (Xander remembers Riley telling him Buffy doesn't love him -- even though that moment happened AFTER this book takes place). There are too many characters--way too many--so very little happens from moment to moment. It's like a music video flashing from one thing to another, never giving you much satisfaction. And calling it a crossover when there is so little interaction, plus advertising Spike (whom the authors seem to despise completely) and Faith, was very deceiving. On balance, a very disappointing read."},{"Title":"Long Way Home (Buffy the Vampire Slayer Angel Unseen)","review":"After reading the first two editions of the Unseen Trilogy I was thrilled to have my hands on the third and final installment. As a matter of fact, I was so excited I stopped reading my current book and started on Long Way Home (something I never do). I was very disappointed.The first two book took Buffy, Angel, and their respective gangs on extraordinary journies full of adventure; with exciting plot lines interweaved and created a complex, exciting, and though-provoking story that left my mouth watering for more. Unfortunately, the conclusion was a huge letdown.First of all there are a few inconsistancies. The third book does not pick up where the second book left off. In fact, it's as though the final few paragraphs of Doors To Alternity never even happened. Secondly, within the prologue there is a major continuity discrepency. The book takes place between seasons 4 and 5 of the series, however there was a direct reference to something that happened well into season 5! I was annoyed that the writers and the editors didn't catch it.My major complaint about the plot was not the lack of imagination, cause there was certainly plenty; it was the congested feeling. Too much was happening at once. I think Holder and Morriette should have slowed down a little. It felt as if they needed to get everyone's point of view into the book so that the story could move forward quickly. It had a very rushed feeling and it was exhausting to read. Many of the subplots (i.e. Kate) were pointless, anyway! they could have cut a good 50 pages just by leaving the jibberish stuff out!I enjoyed the Buffy and Angel subplot, but I thought Spike's part in the story was ludicrous. The back of the book made it seem like he would be a major contributing factor to the events and in reality he wasn't. Faith didn't appear until the story was nearly over and the writers did not do a good job with the characterization at all. More intriguing characters, like Anya, were not in the book nearly enough and I think if they did less with Spike they could have fit these characters into the story.The biggest thing I disliked about the book was the outcome of the rival gang. It was too quick. The series spent three books leading up to this event and the end was rushed, incomplete, and quite ridiculous. I don't want to give away too much, but why would Buffy and her friends risk gunfire and such? (..)There were good parts to the book. I enjoyed the Buffy/Angel interaction. Cordy was written in a way very true to her character. I like the bond Willow and the bruja have formed. I think the story had the feel and texture of the show. It just didn't compare to the first two stories. I do not recommend this book unless you really want to know what the outcome of the first two books are."},{"Title":"Long Way Home (Buffy the Vampire Slayer Angel Unseen)","review":"There seem to be some continuity problems with this novel, or maybe it's just too complicated. There are too many characters packed in, and a lot of times I'm left wondering &quot;why are they in there?&quot; The part about Faith in prison is interesting, but it seems to me she was added to the plot just so they could use those scenes. Willow dies on one page (relax, she's a major character, we know they'll bring her back, just after a lot of work) forget the lot of work: the next thing we know she's just up and now the phone is dead. (Looks like they cut something there and forgot to clean up).The back cover says that the door is closed when one of the people they are trying to rescue is klilled: doesn't happen. There's supposed to be some temptation about finding a pleasant alternity - tacked on in one paragraph, not really there.Spike get's in, but doesn't go anywhere. Other characters have cameos. Needs fewer cameos and more continuity.If you are a big time Buffy or Angel fan, or if you've already read the preceding parts and just need an ending, then read it. Otherwise, give this one a pass."},{"Title":"Long Way Home (Buffy the Vampire Slayer Angel Unseen)","review":"this was the best book it was the bomb!I also like the fact that Faith was in it i wuld recommend it its the best and the best trilogy buy it!"},{"Title":"Long Way Home (Buffy the Vampire Slayer Angel Unseen)","review":"I LOVE Buffy The Vampire Slayer, and Angel...but these 3 books were SO boring to me.

They said that when one of their people dies it closes the door and they must find an entiarly different way home. While that certainly did happen it didn't have that big of an effect,they fixed it in three pages. And the death wasn't all that big of a deal. I think they did not spend nearly enough time on the finding the way back through a portal.And the summary also made it sound like Faith and Spike had alot to do with the plot while they didn't really at all. Some parts and caracters(a.i Kate) could have been completely eliminated. So while it was good, because all Buffy books are in my opinion, it was definently a little dissapointing."},{"Title":"Long Way Home (Buffy the Vampire Slayer Angel Unseen)","review":"I heard these were coming out, and it was approaching my birthday of last June, I got thise and play tickets from my mom after serious begging. She bought me them as soon as each one came out, funny thing is my best friend who doestn live at all close to me, got me the first one. But this is on the third one, it was a very well written book. The scenes between Buffy and Angel were pricless and touch the b/a shippers heart. A problem was of how much Buffy acted as if she loved Riley more than anything of the world, and Angel was past, why he dreamed about her and their forgotten day. Otherwise it is a good read, as a fan of either show, or the B/A or even b/r(gag) relationship.

I got it for half-price through Amazon."},{"Title":"Maxfield Parrish: A Retrospective","review":"Maxfield Parrish (1870-1966) was best known for romantic images with an unmatched richness, captured by his uncanny use of color incorporating ultra-saturated hues and often times an intense cobalt blue. His paintings were created using alternating layers of color and transparent varnish over a monochromatic underpainting, sometimes totaling as many as 60 layers. This technique was superb for period reproductions using the four color printing process.As one critic stated, \`Everyone recognizes the magical world woven by Parrish, usually with the color lapiz lazuli in its purest form. His signature use of this color was so powerful that a certain cobalt blue became known as \`Parrish Blue'. His idealized images with figures of feminine pulchritude adorned in classical gowns with backgrounds of electric violets, radiant reds and rich glowing earth tone pigments, created an idyllic world indeed. Other images had scenes embellished with billowing clouds in a fairy tale ambience of maidens and knights lying under porticoes and these were equally harmonic, idealistic, and beloved. Books illustrated by Parrish no longer belonged to their authors, but rather they became \`Parrish' books, just as a generic color became \`Parrish Blue.' As a result of this ability to create such a sublime splendor, Maxfield Parrish became unquestionably the most successful and best-known American illustrator of the early part of the twentieth century.'Of the several book published on the life and works of Maxfield Parrish this volume is considered a catalogue raisonn&eacute; as constructed and commented upon by Judy and Lawrence Cutler who were also privileged to include many of the personal information about he artist as a courtesy from his family. While this book served as a catalogue accompanying a traveling exhibition, it sands alone as a well-documented tribute to a unique American artist.

The title (or sub-title) of the book states that this is the most comprehensive title available -- that's the problem. It's far TOO comprehensive. It includes lots and lots of information that has never been on the test, and that is very unlikely to appear on the test in the future. (If you learn EVERY word in the dictionary, you're sure to get a good verbal score on the SAT, but there are FAR more effective ways to INTELLIGENTLY improve your vocabulary!) To make matters worse, it seems to have been written BY math lovers FOR math lovers and is nearly incomprehensible to someone who's not a math lover. Hey, if you love math, then you don't need a prep book for the SAT II in the first place! The book has way too much information to absorb, the practice tests are unrealistically difficult, and there's no easy way to use only selected portions of the book (for an abbreviated prep based upon the most important concepts, for example). This book feels like a desk reference for mathematics, not a study guide.In my classes and tutoring, I've found that the books by the big test prep companies (Princeton Review and Kaplan) are concise, accurate, and logically arranged. If forced to choose, I give the Princeton Review title a slight edge above the Kaplan book, but both are excellent titles. I suggest getting both the Princeton Review and the Kaplan titles -- compared to a prep course or college tuition, they're an amazingly inexpensive investment.How much did I dislike this book? After reading the title, I bought a dozen of them to use with my students -- but after using it for one group of students, I ended up shipping all of the unused copies back. These criticisms apply to both the Math IC and IIC books -- I don't know about the rest of the books for the other subject tests."},{"Title":"SAT II: Math Level IC (REA) -- The Best Test Prep for the SAT II (SAT PSAT ACT (College Admission) Prep)","review":"I gave myself enough time to review with this book, but it didn't help me at all.

I got a 630 on the test, and while that isn't a terrible score, I bought the book in hopes of working up to somewhere near a 700.

This edition includes excerpts from _Economy and Society_, the brilliant essays \`\`Politics as a Vocation'' and \`\`Science as a Vocation,'' plus a brief critical biography and material from other sources.Weber had so much to say about so many subjects that any anthology would require a well-considered method of organization; this book has that. It is easy to navigate. When I want to know what Weber said about a particular subject, I look in _From Max Weber_."},{"Title":"From Max Weber: Essays in sociology","review":"What is most curious about the home page for this classic academic work is that Amazon does not explain that this text is the fruit of one the most singularly important academic translations in the 20th century, accomplished by the team of sociologists Hans Gerth and C. Wright Mills (who later became an immensely influential classic sociologist himself). First published after the Second World War, the text provided access at long last to a treasure trove of previously untranslated works by Weber for the American academic community, and thus transformed the nature of the way American social scientists understood modern social theory.It is no exaggeration to say that Weber's genius was his ability to successfully integrate the critical essence of the Marxian analysis of capitalist society with more functionally-oriented works such that even as stodgy and conservative a theorist as Talcott Parson soon found common analytical purpose with Weber's theoretical views! before long all the academic community was enthralled by the scope and verve of Weber's complex vision of a social theory informed with a comprehensive view of social action, such that all social actions can be meaningfully located within the welter of the purposes, motives, and values of the interacting individuals themselves. This was indeed an intelelctual revolution within social theory, and we can still find bibliophiles and academic devotees still poring over the nuances and variations in themes in Weber's considerable body of works.After the publication of these essays, much more of his corpus of works was successfully translated and used in American university settings. Yet Weber's prose was never an \\"easy read\\", nor was his message about the evolving nature of contemporary bureaucratic society necessarily a heartening one; he was convinced we were turning toward a dark and mechanistic age, what he himself frequently characterized as being the \\"iron cage\\" of rationalization. His was the dark vision later shared by intellectuals like Aldous Huxley of a brave new world of petty diversions and a systematic but innocuous autocratic manipulation of everyman. Still, Weber's works stand as a testament to the power of an individual intellect. I recommend this book for anyone interested in better understanding him and his theoretical views.

It is not worth your money.I am very disappointed to find out Amazon allows this item on shelf."},{"Title":"From Max Weber: Essays in sociology","review":"While Weber's Essays in Sociology has predominantly only been required reading within the field of sociology, this work equally informs other fields of intellectual study, such as political science, history, and social justice studies.Like Bordieu, Weber argues that sociology is most clearly understood through interpretations of social stratifications and divisions. Weber defines sociology as \\"a science which attempts the interpretive understanding of social action in order thereby to arrive at a causal explanation of its cause and effect.\\"Weber's interpretation of social action can be used as a framework to further analyze prestige and power. His analysis of power structures illustrates how the political understanding of social actions becomes meaningful not only for defining the role of the individual, but more importantly, for the effect an individual's action has in engaging and re-defining the political community.Weber's arguments draw on how power finds expression institutionally through state structures and the role social action has both on the individual and community in addressing power relations. Weber underscores that while various social actors relate to power structures differently, all power structures employ force to continue dependency as a means of control. This \\"dynamic of power\\" constructs a system of competition in which each political organization must to some degree let go of its isolationist and less dependent attitudes in order to gain more prestige and \\"further political expansion.\\" Weber explains that political structures that alienate themselves run the risk of curbing their power gain.Weber's conceptualization of \\"the iron cage\\" is the culmination of power structures that drain social actors of anything other than working to further capitalist production on behalf of the state. Weber states: \\"[i]n the field of its highest, in the United States, the pursuit of wealth, stripped of its religious and ethical meaning, tends to become associated with purely mundane passion, which often actually give it the character of the sport.\\" In other words, people become \\"specialists without spirit, sensualists with heart.\\" Weber elaborates on how the compulsive embodying force of class reproduction supersedes social actors from breaking free of this cage. Weber illustrates how over time, the effects of class-based differences manifest themselves not only through the economic structure of society, but also in the social and cultural realms, thus making it increasingly difficult for social actors to divest themselves of this structural force that they are a part of and become locked into.Weber's discussion of \\"the iron cage\\" also draws on analyzing the role of world religions, which is based on a particular type of economic ethics that seek to ground the effects of the economy in the historical cultural formations of concepts such as suffering, fortune, magical asceticism, community, sacrifice, ritual, and achievement. Weber underscores the ways in which the religious-determination is profoundly influenced by economic and political factors operating within given geographical, political, social, and national boundaries.\\" However, Weber's concept of \\"the community cult\\" posits the notion that religion is not the only determining factor of the economic ethic by addressing the intersectionality of how varying religious ideas are taken on by groups of people.In seeking to deconstruct the social embodiment of the iron cage, Weber places \\"legitimate domination\\" at the center of his analysis of social relationships. He underscores how social inequality relies on legitimate domination to provide a seemingly stable form of social order. Weber exposes how domination allows those in authority to treat groups of people with an illegitimate idea of equality--one which will inevitably result in unjust outcomes through further requiring obedience to the current social order. Weber explains how obedience is not only a materially defined interest to people, but also a habit that has become normalized across stratas and status groups.Weber's ideas can aptly be understood as calling for a thoroughly interactive conception of the permutations of power in the political realm, its influences and its effects on the individual and community."},{"Title":"From Max Weber: Essays in sociology","review":"Meticulously translated, this collection of essays is a great place to start for a person only familiar with Weber's seminal work \\"The Protestant Ethic\\". I found the essays to be very readable, and Weber's unique style makes it a joy to read.This is a great place to start for anyone interested in beginning to study sociology."},{"Title":"From Max Weber: Essays in sociology","review":"In spite of the real differences between them, Weber and Marx sometimes seem to have more in common than is often acknowledged. American social scientists' deification of Weber and limited interest in Marx has given short-shrift to the conflictual nature of social life as Weber understood it. In the process, they have also given short-shrift to the commonalities between these two classical theorists. This book helps to clarify the relationship between Weberian and Marxist social theory.As a practical matter, with regard to historically specific phenomena, it sometimes seems that Weber tacitly shared Marx's assessment of the antagonistic relationship between capital and labor. This is especially apparent when Weber is playing the inherently ironic role of a determinedly disinterested value-free social critic.For example, when Weber visited the United States in 1905, he was interested in studying the peculiarly intense form of American capitalism. Located at Washington University in St. Louis, Weber became interested in the large, privately owned transit system that provided transportation for people throughout the city.Weber learned that the system had fallen into a bad state of disrepair, and serious accidents were commonplace. The owners of the system had two choices: repair and update the horse-drawn trolleys that moved people from place to place. Or continue to pay damages to passengers who were badly injured and to the families of those who were killed. A cost-benefit analysis showed the latter choice to be less expensive, and so the decision was made. For Weber, this was an obvious outcome: capitalists minimizing costs and maximizing profits, just as their social roles specified.Weber's contemporary Werner Sombart who was favorably disposed to Marxist social theory, found much the same when he studied coal mining in relatively developed capitalist countries, including the U.S. Accidents resulting in injury or death occurred at a much higher rate in U.S. mines than in mines located in European countries. This led Sombart to conclude that American capitalism was, indeed, an especially intense sort, one in which rational calculability in pursuit of profit was practiced with a vengeance.For those of us who lived through the the 1970's and 1980's such stories may have a familiar ring. The Ford Pinto was an inexpensive and popular subcompact. It's design, however, was flawed in that the gas tank, located in the back of the car, was likely to explode if the car were rear-endedFord knew about this design flaw, but according to the company's cost-benefit calculations, it would cost less to pay off victims of exploding gas tanks (or their survivors) than to redesign the Pinto. So the design flaw stayed in place, and again, rational calculability in dollar terms took precedence over other condiderations.In spite of their commonalities, however, Weber spoke in terms of organized structures of domination, such as that which gave functional control over labor, rather than antagonistic social classes at war with each other for resources of all kinds. In addition, Weber emphasized that the rationally calculable control of labor by capital was essential for efficient production in a capitalist society. Moreover, Weber objected to Marx's assignment of priority to material and experiential phenomena rather than cultural prescriptions, proscriptions, and meanings.As we have seen, however, Weber's and Marx's treatments of concrete instances of social organization under capitalism sometimes have more in common than is often acknowledged. There is, in fact, a good deal of class conflict, as Marx understood that phenomenon in Weber's social thought. This is something that Gerth and Mills account enables the reader to discern, but which was long hidden in Parsons' early translations."},{"Title":"From Max Weber: Essays in sociology","review":"Excellent in speed to get the prodcut to me, Great Quality in the product.Thanks."},{"Title":"Besieger of Cities","review":"\\"I am the new man of Alexander's new empire. My world began 35 years ago when the conqueror died in Babylon. I am bound by nothing that happened earlier... There are no gods. There are no fatherlands. There are no laws of right and wrong. What distinguishes me from a wolf is that I can think as well as fight. I am the master of my own life, until some stronger sword strikes me down.\\"This brutal speech could summarize the philosophy of any one of the Successors, the poor provincial nobles of rocky Macedonia who suddenly found themselves in control of the vast territories and hoarded gold of the vanished Persian Empire. They spent that gold on huge warships, vast armies of mercenaries, ingenious war engines, and new cities named for themselves. They fought each other on a scale never seen before, for no better reason than their personal amusement.Demetrios Poliorketes belonged to the second generation of these Hellenistic warlords, and nobody had bigger ships, vaster armies, more ingenious siege engines, or a more bloated ego. He was the archetype of an age that is mostly forgotten by popular history, lost between Classical Greece and Imperial Rome.Alfred Duggan often created fictional characters who are deep in self-delusion and denial at the beginning of the book, but gradually wake up to reality. Here he found one ready-made in the pages of Plutarch. Demetrios is convinced that he is reuniting Alexander's empire while actually looting and wrecking it. He thinks he is restoring democratic freedoms to Athens while the Athenians supinely declare him a living god and billet him in the Parthenon. Driven off the land and forced to become a pirate? Just a temporary setback.This was the first of Duggan's novels that I read as a teenager and it left a powerful impression on me. It hasn't held up quite as well as some others -- one man's egomania can't really support a whole book. Still, it is much better than most of today's trashy historical novels and I hope it eventually gets included in the current Phoenix Press reprint series."},{"Title":"Besieger of Cities","review":"Orion books republished most of Alfred Duggan's novels but never got around to this one. (They also did not republish Founding Fathers and Leopards and Lilies) Duggan's novels are not for those unfamiliar with history as his subjects tend to be more obscure. Rather than write about, say, Atilla the Hun or Augustus, he wrote, for example, a novel of the Roman Emperor Elagabalus and a novel about Lepidus. Regarding Besieger of Cities, the reader will be lost without some familiarity wit the successor period.

At first more theoretical supporters of anti-colonial movements, the GDR became an enthusiastic (and as the authors imply, sometimes overly zealous) proponents of both armed and political solutions to the struggle against minority rule.

A warm, elegant, funny and action-packed debut novel - cinematic in scope, yet a deliciously literate read. HIGHLY recommended."},{"Title":"This Side Of The Sky","review":"Tackling dialect, period detail and the sweep of time, this new novelist is a fresh and fiesty addition to the literary scene. From their intellectually-impoverished girlhoods in the Deep South to their adventures during WWII, Lilian and Myraleen demonstrate the power of friendship and redefine the meaning of extended family. Singleton's characters are so real and funny, you almost want to ask them for coffee.I love this book. And I can't wait for the movie."},{"Title":"This Side Of The Sky","review":"While the above title may not sound interesting to some, ElyseSingleton's This Side of the Sky, is a glimpse into the complex lives of Black women during the 1930s and 1940s. Singleton creates an epic story of the lives of two women, capturing their tumultuous childhood and adolescence and their remarkable lives as adults.Throughout their childhood, Lillian and Myraleen believe that there is more to the world than what Nadir, Mississippi can offer. As Lillian says, &quot;...Mississippi was just the slow, painful way of spelling hell.&quot; Lillian's inquisitive spirit cannot soar to it's full potential with the limitedopportunities that life in rural Mississippi offers. The customs and expectations of life in Nadir continually stifle Myraleen's feisty and headstrong nature. What Nadir lacks in opportunity, it is enriched with characters who shape Lillian and Myraleen's lives - Mudear and Mercy, Lillian and Myraleen's well-intentioned mothers; the Taylors, the only Black family in Nadir to own their own farm, and Kellner, a mysterious German POW, who works on the Taylor's farm.At 26, Lillian and Myraleen act on the realization they have held since childhood, and head for Philadelphia. Here they find the hustle and bustle of city-living exciting, but still encounter the harsh realities of life in the North as Black women. When the opportunities in Philadelphia do not meet their expectations, they take another bold step, and join the Army, towards the end of World War II. Although they spent their time in the military away from the battlefield, the lessons learned in war leave an indelible impact in their lives. At the end of the War, Lillian stays in Europe, going to school and searching for a lost love, while Myraleen returns to Philadelphia, regretting the marriage proposal her willful nature would not let her accept.Singleton is truly a gifted writer. The structure of this book held my attention and kept me turning the pages to find out what happens next. Her descriptions were so vivid that the heat of Mississippi, the confines of tenement living, the exhilaration of doing the jitterbug for the first time, the fear and exhilaration of falling in love, and the war-torn streets of London came to life as I read this book. In fact, I strongly believe that this book would make a wonderful television movie or miniseries.TameshiaR.E.A.L. Reviewer"},{"Title":"This Side Of The Sky","review":"I just completed this novel and I must say that it was excellent. It was quite obvious that the author had done extensive research into her subject matter. It was a poignant look into history and how African American women had to struggle in a world where they were often looked upon as inferior. Everything from the descriptions to dialogue was well-written and I look forward to reading more of Ms. Singleton's work."},{"Title":"This Side Of The Sky","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. As other reviewers commented the characterization could have been stronger but put that aside and this book stands out. It's well written. The little known history of the Black WACs was fascinating. Ms Singleton was able to swiftly take the lives of two little girls all the way through to their 80s with little to no effort at all. The novel breezed along! Myraleen and Lilly's lives spanned decades but never once bogged down. Really, a great book!"},{"Title":"This Side Of The Sky","review":"This Side of the Sky is a beautiful story of two life long friends, Myraleen and Lilian, who grew up in Nadir, Mississippi and went on to see and experience the world. Sometimes tragic yet always poignant, Ms. Singleton's novel is an enthralling read. The time period of this novel spans over 70 years- from the 1930s when the girls lived with the constant reminder that the color of their skin precluded them from reaching the highest heights, to the year 2000 when color is a hue on one spectrum.It took a good 50 pages to draw me into the characters. Many times Myraleen and Lilian looked at the same situation from different perspectives. I found it amazing how captivating their friendship was. It endured a lifetime with hardly a disagreement or regret. Ms. Singleton's research made This Side of the Sky come to life. The historical accuracy of the plight of African American's during periods of social change in our country kept the characters fresh and my enthusiasm to read was intensified. The social aspects of their relationships with others made reading multidimensional. I even received an education, learning that there was a far greater contingent of African Women who served as part of the Women's Auxiliary Corps in World War II than I imagined. Rising from seemingly hopeless childhoods to become well-rounded, well-traveled, well-versed ladies who enjoyed their lives, This Side of the Sky drew me in and kept me until the end."},{"Title":"This Side Of The Sky","review":"This is a story of two young black southern women determined to leave the south and make life work for them.

Singleton is a wonderful storyteller. I'm waiting for more."},{"Title":"This Side Of The Sky","review":"What first time author Elyse Singleton has done within the pages of This Side of the Sky is truly remarkable. She has taken missing events from a history book detailing the impacts of poverty, puberty, and racism of two African American women and the events leading up to World War II and afterwards. Singleton has written a story that isn't easily labeled because it is so much more than simply a historical fiction novel.It touches on the love and friendship between two best friends, Lilian Mayfield and Myraleen Chadham, their joint and individual triumps, hardships, and romances in a small town in Mississippi. It also shares their contribution to history as WACs and their efforts in the war, stationed at a base in England. Additionally, we see the lengths they'd go to support each other, in spite of the economic times during the war.The story is written in a warm, poignant and enlightening literary tone while at the same time it entertains, educates, and portrays more about this time frame in history than the average history books. It also does a wonderful job of sharing the lesson of looking beyond a person's skin color to determine their value. The characters are well developed and will stay with you long after you've finished reading. I definitely recommend this book and would encourage anyone to pick it up regardless of your preference in genres.Reviewed by Tee C. Royal"},{"Title":"This Side Of The Sky","review":"Sometimes a first novel is a homerun; this is the case with This Side of the Sky by Elyse Singleton. Beautifully written and creatively crafted by a fresh new voice in fiction, Singleton's debut novel is vividly detailed and movingly awesome. This Side of the Sky is a unique story as Singleton shares with us a time in history that is seldom written about and often overlooked.Singleton introduces us to lifelong friends and two great African American heroines, Lillian Mayfield and Myraleen Chadham. Mayfield and Chadham's friendship is one that would begin in the early 1900s and span into the new millennium as they charter life through unknown territory. They would survive the harsh realities of segregation, racism, broken romances and economic hardships as they search for their rightful places in rural Mississippi, Philadelphia, PA, an army base in England, and postwar Paris.This Side of the Sky portrays life for African American women during a time where we are mostly forgotten and rarely (if ever) mentioned. It was engrossing and compelling to read about two African American women who were WACs during WWII and the problems they faced as a result of gender as well as race. Singleton writes with vivid imagery and fluid dialogue and makes the reader feel as though they are there in history experiencing events along with our heroines Lillian and Myraleen.Historical fiction fans (and those who are not), folks interested in reading about women of color during WWII and those who enjoy a good romance will enjoy This Side of the Sky. Elyse Singleton is an excellent storyteller and I highly recommend her novel to those who like literary reads with a universal appeal, timeless subject matter and stories that entertain as well as enlighten. I look forward to reading future works from this gifted and talented author.YasminAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"This Side Of The Sky","review":"Very good. I learned a bunch about Black History.

What are his qualifications for these research endeavors and the knowledge to properly assess all parameters involved in scientific research?"},{"Title":"Inquest on the Shroud of Turin: Latest Scientific Findings","review":"Let me resurrect an old cliche & say that \\"Inquest on the Shroud of Turin\\" is good news and bad news. The good new is that several of the chapters are very strong, providing compelling reasons to discount the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin as the burial cloth of Jesus. I think the most enlightening chapter was at the beginning of the book & dealt with the provenance of the shroud. It was clear from its origin in 1355 that the cloth was a fraud. The early provenance shows that the only medieval contemporaries who did not discount the shroud as a fake were those who were profiting from displaying it to pilgrims in return for alms. Bishop Pierre D'Arcis wrote an investigation report stating that the shroud is a painting, & this fact was attested to by the artist who painted it. Even the pope discounted its authenticity when he issued a bull directing it could only be displayed as a \\"representation\\" and not as an authentic relic. It is amusing to think that the medieval mind had clearer insight into the shroud's bona fides than many modern minds.Another strong chapter is the one that deals with the research of Walter McCrone. (...) In any event, McCrone concludes the shroud bears traces of paint pigment (as predicted by the provenance) & that proteins on the shroud are not blood but rather the paint medium tempra. What do you call a piece of cloth with paint pigment & paint medium on it? McCrone and Nickell conclude that it is a painting (as one might expect).Now for the bad news: \\"Inquest\\" suffers from several weaknesses. Many of the chapters become lost in technical detail which I think detract from the strength of the overall argument. Why make a subtle argument when there is an obvious argument to be made that is more compelling? Also, I noted one occasion where Nickell placed emphasis where he should not & the result was misleading. Nickell states that according to the New Testament, the body of Jesus was buried according to Jewish custom, & therefore the body must have been washed. The truth is that the New Testament does NOT say the body was washed. This whole line of reasoning should have been left out in my opinion since it is misleading & detracts from the overall argument.Another weakness is that the book has not been updated since the Carbon 14 tests were published showing that the shroud is only 700 years old. This makes the cloth about the same age as the provenance indicating it is a fake. A new chapter would tie all this together quite nicely.Other reviewers have criticized Nickell for his lack of credentials as a scientist. If they had read the book more carefully (or at all), they would have noted that this book is clearly presented as a collaborative effort with technical specialists. Not only did Nickell consult on research, some whole chapters are ghost written by his collaborators. Another criticism is that the shroud could not be a painting since there is no brush strokes & no directionality. In spite of what other reviewers have said, these matters are addressed in the book. There are no brush strokes because the artist didn't use a brush. Furthermore, Nickell does discuss how paint could be applied without an indication of directionality. Read the book for more details.Finally, there is one interesting argument Nickell touches on but does not develop. The image of the face on the shroud shows evidence of fresh bleeding from scalp wounds. Nickell points out that there should be no blood because the body was washed. An alternative observation is that when a person dies, the heart stops, blood pressure drops to zero, & lividity begins to set in. A dead body simply does not bleed (at least not like the fresh stream of blood seen on the face of the shroud). Hypothetically, if the shroud were indeed the burial cloth of Jesus, it means that he did not die on the cross, but that he was taken down while still alive. No death on the cross means no resurrection, & this conclusion would turn Christian theology on its head. It appears that this one observation would give the faithful plenty of reason to reject the authenticity of the shroud, rather than defend it."},{"Title":"Inquest on the Shroud of Turin: Latest Scientific Findings","review":"I expected Joe Nickell's case against the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin to be a snide and nasty affair. But it is surprisingly even-tempered, poking large holes in the cases of the defenders of Shroud authenticity. In this book, Nickell (and his panel of scientific experts) critically examine the claims of Shroud backers. Against those who feel the Shroud was formed in a burst of radiation (supposedly from the Resurrection) Nickell asserts the common sense conclusion that this radiation, if it was to make a clear image, would have to travel only in the direction of the cloth, and not out to the sides. Against those who claim that no medieval technique is known that could account for the image's formation, Nickell gives examples of rubbing techniques--during and prior to the medieval period--that were available to artists of the 14th century. Against those who claim that the image on the cloth is an anatomically perfect depiction of a crucified man, Nickell lays out the case for the image's imperfections: one arm is longer than the other, and the blood trickles are depicted as lying atop the hair, rather then seeping from it.On the negative side, Nickell's book is the \\"he said\\" against the \\"she said\\" of other book on the Shroud. Is Walter McCrone biased toward finding paint (as STURP - the Shroud Research group claims) or (as Nickell claims) are his findings of paint pigments and tempera binder the key to solving the Shroud mystery? Did McCrone return the sticky tape samples (Nickell) or did he violate scientific protocol by hogging them (STURP's Heller)? Going back in history, does a letter from the Bishop of Troyes (claiming he had obtained the confession of the Shroud's painter) support Nickell's case, or is it the carping of a man who is losing tourism dollars to a neat relic in a neighboring diocese?In any event, \\"Inquest\\" is a relatively easy read, and should be studied by Shroud advocates, if only to ensure that they are not seduced by the sillier arguments made in support of the Shroud. Any book that brings the conversation to a higher level should be welcomed."},{"Title":"Inquest on the Shroud of Turin: Latest Scientific Findings","review":"Nickell does a clear, thorough job of debunking all the contradictions and self-delusions of those folks who insist on believing that this long-acknowledged fraud actually contained the body of Christ(even the Catholic Church denies its authenticity). A good review of the actual &quot;shroud&quot; tradition (contradicted by the bible itself BTW) and the mountain of scientific data disproving the shroud's miraculous nature. Highly recommended for clear thinkers who prefer fact and data to fanciful speculation and special pleading."},{"Title":"Inquest on the Shroud of Turin: Latest Scientific Findings","review":"Inquest on the Shroud of Turin by Joe Nickell is a clear, concise, 155-page work explaining the evidence that refutes the authenticity of the 3 1/2' x 14' cloth that allegedly covered the body of Christ after crucifixion and bears his image. Nickell's work is one-sided. He believes the shroud was created by an artist near the time it was first publicly introduced around 1353. He picks apart (sometimes in a mocking manner) the evidence shroud believers use to prove authenticity. As Nickell states at the beginning of the book, his collaboration with a panel of scientific and technical experts accomplishes equal time for the skeptics. According to Nickell, many reports on the shroud are done by pro-authenticity investigators who lack objectivity (p. 8). Mentions made in this book about Roman anatomist Dr. Luigi Gedda who, detecting a slump in the right shoulder of the image, deduced that the image was of a right-handed carpenter (p. 109) and the story of how renown microanalyst Walter McCrone was \\"drummed out\\" of the Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP) for publicizing his findings of iron earth pigment on the blood stains and body image (p. 125) seem to back up his claims of bias accounts of the shroud's authenticity. I do not recommend reading only this one book on the shroud because it is too one-sided (any of the books by Ian Wilson would make a good companion) but I also do not think that, because Nickell has an agenda, this book should be discounted. Whether you believe, are skeptical, or are just curious, Nickell makes excellent cases for his side of the issue.Nickell includes chapters that cover a variety of topics: the history of the shroud, ways the shroud does not follow traditional Jewish burials at the time of Christ, the shroud versus Biblical accounts of Jesus' death and resurrection, ways that the image could be left on the cloth, and scientific consideration of the type of linen, blood stains, and the image itself. The chapters on blood and the yellow fibers on the image are a little dry and scientific (14 pages worth), but the rest of the work makes for fascinating reading. Nickell drives home his points with clarity and precision. He describes the shroud's past as one cloaked in controversy, politics, and profits which left more of an impression on me than the scientific evidence. The shroud was only first introduced to the public in 1353 and was denounced as a forgery almost immediately. Documents even show that the artist confessed.The book ends with a summary of the areas considered in the work and the evidence the shroud is a forgery as well as information of members leaving (or being \\"drummed out\\") of STURP. The additional chapter includes an update to 1987 (four years after this book was first released) about books published during this time and about the formation of the Association of Scientists and Scholars International for the Shroud of Turin (ASSIST). Obviously much has happened since then. I saw a television documentary showing a man who claims the image is an x-ray of Jesus. An expert on ancient cloth also claimed that the type of weave used in the shroud is inconsistent with Medieval times but is found much earlier (something Nickell refutes).The occasional tone of the book may turn off staunch believers. Nickell uses past mistakes of scientists to help discredit what they say about the shroud (p. 72). He refers to the idea that the image could be formed through resurrection as \\"nonsense\\" (p. 86). His arguments that, if the image was created supernaturally, why is it \\"not of better quality than it is\\" (p. 92) is a bit weak. Despite the author's arrogance, an objective reader will find that he makes many important points. Before the skeptics claim this book to be a slam dunk for their side, however, they should definitely check out John Heller's Report on the Shroud of Turin. Heller has a completely different take on the work of Walter McCrone. All these accounts show what an intriguing mystery the Shroud of Turin was, is, and probably will always be."},{"Title":"Inquest on the Shroud of Turin: Latest Scientific Findings","review":"Until photography was invented and a negative image of the shroud was first seen, (1898) nobody had any idea that such detail was present in the cloth. The positive image as had only been seen for so many centuries looked to be no more than a shadow of a man. So yes, the \\"medieval forger\\" was clever indeed. Apparently he didn't want his trick to be even played until 5 centuries after it was allegedly created. (He knew, no doubt that photography would inevitably be invented, clever fellow.) He was also very daring, putting the nail holes in the wrists, rather than the palm which had been the traditional location. And if it is, in fact, a fraud, then we should be able to crank out duplicates, hand over fist today, no? Then how come no one has remotely succeeded?"},{"Title":"Inquest on the Shroud of Turin: Latest Scientific Findings","review":"Joe Nickell does an outstanding job of research into the Shroud's providence and possible methods of creation. It is quite clearly the best book on the subject, as it dispences with gullible and wild speculation and sticks to the facts of its history and the science behind the image. The book was written orginally well before the carbon dating conclusively showed it to be exactly what had been predicted beforehand: a mid 14th century piece of linen. It is truly amazing that such books have to be written in the early 21st century to dispel what sensible adult minds should have done a long time ago. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Inquest on the Shroud of Turin: Latest Scientific Findings","review":"This is a 1987 updating of the 1983 effort by Joe Nickell, self-appointed investigator of 'pseudoscience', to debunk claims that the Shroud of Turin is the actual burial cloth of Jesus Christ.The shroud is a mysterious object which since the Middle Ages has been kept in the Turin Cathedral. It surfaced in the 14th century and was claimed to be the burial cloth of Jesus, brought to Italy during the Crusades. A Papal investigator declared it to be a fraud, but its authenticity has had passionate defenders from that day to this.In the 1970's a group of scientists examined the shroud and all but one declared it to be authentic! This astounding assertion drew heavy criticism from Athiests and eventually the Catholic church agreed to a carbon-14 dating examination. The examiners concluded that the cloth was no more than 700 years old - to the great relief of non-believers!This book is a self-congratulatory attempt by the Athiest/Scientific Materialist community to say &quot;I told you so.&quot; Joe Nickell, who unsuccessfully competed with James Randi for the mantle of grand inquisitor of the Athiest faith, provides a great deal of suggestive but ultimately insufficient evidence that the shroud could not be authentic.Since the updating of this book a number of new pro-shroud books have appeared, but more importantly carbon-14 dating itself has been shown to be unreliable. The book is still valuable, however perhaps mostly for the psychology of a belief system."},{"Title":"Inquest on the Shroud of Turin: Latest Scientific Findings","review":"Joe Nickell has done an outstanding job of research into the origins of the Shroud of Turin and has conclusively shown it to be a 14th century artistic rendering. And this book was originally written well before the carbon dating conducted by three reputable laboratories proved that the Shroud can be dated to approximately the mid 14th century. Gee, what coincidence that these figures all match the initial providence of this bogus relic. As for some of the other criticisms of this excellent book - ignore them, as they clearly have not read the book which is why the reviews never address the specific findings presented in the book."},{"Title":"Inquest on the Shroud of Turin: Latest Scientific Findings","review":"I do not know whether the Shroud of Turin is a fake or not, but the issue, contrary to the claims of this book, has not been solved. Before you decide that I am just another gullible, credulous &quot;believer&quot;, let me show you otherwise. I am actually a skeptic myself. I am a former member of the South Shore Skeptics in Cleveland, Ohio, a supporter of CSICOP, and I have even attented several lectures given by Mr. Nickell. First of all Mr. Nickell is no James Randi! Mr. Nickell's &quot;explanations&quot; for the unexplained always are strained and require so many leaps of faith, that one might just as well believe in the original claim. Mr. Nickell has almost zero credibility as a debunker of the strange and unexplained. Skeptics and debunkers are certainly needed, but people like Mr. Nickell give the rest a bad name, which is why some are skeptical of the skeptics! The most blatant example of this is Mr. Nickell's explanation of the Mystery of Oak Island. Oak Island is beyond the scope of this review, but it is a real legitimate mystery. Anyone who wants to learn how pathetic Mr. Nickell is can read about Oak Island on the Internet, and then read Mr. Nickell's explanation of it and the issue of Mr. Nickell's credibilty will be settled. Now on to the Shroud. Mr. Nickell has an axe to grind. He decided before even writing the book that the Shroud had to be a fake, because of his strong atheistic beliefs and decided that since he could &quot;duplicate&quot; the Shroud himself, it had to be a fake. The truth, however, is that he could not, and did not duplcate the Shroud image. Mr. Nickell's method of brushing the image leaves behind directional brush markings. There are none on the Shroud. The image on the Shroud is 3 dimensional, Mr. Nickell's image is not. Mr. Nickell's whole book is a red herring for those that are uncomfortable at the thought that maybe, just maybe, the Shroud is authentic. The Shroud is a real mystery and should be treated as such. This artifact has been seriously studied more so than any other ancient artifact in history. It is not something that can be dismissed in one book, especially by the likes of Mr. Nickell who by trade is only a mere magician with no scientific training at all. The other glaring problem with this book is that Mr. Nickell relies so heavily on the &quot;research &quot; of Dr. McCrone, who stated that before even examining the Shroud, that &quot;he knew it was a fake&quot; and was gonna prove it! What objectivity! Dr. McCrone's work has been proven to be corrupt and his conclusions wrong. He claimed that the Shroud does not contain any blood and that the image is made from paint. He has been shown to be wrong on both accounts, and Mr. Nickell is still standing by his corrupt research afraid to admit that he made a mistake. I do not know whether the Shroud is authentic or not, but I do know the following: The conclusions in this book are wrong. If the Shroud is fake, it was not faked by anything remotely similiar to the methods suggested by this book. Finally, the Shroud is a real mystery and should not be treated in the same contemptuous manner as non-mysteries such as the Bermuda Triangle. The Shroud is an item of genuine research and to this date, the creation of its image remains a mystery. Believers and non-believers alike should treat the Shroud with respect until a legitimate verdict is in, and not dismiss it with the likes of other bunk, such as the most recent bigfoot sighting or UFO abduction. The Shroud is in a whole different class."},{"Title":"Inquest on the Shroud of Turin: Latest Scientific Findings","review":"In his Shroud book Joe Nickell, alias James Randy, has cleverly managed to mask his strong antireligious bias, in order to give his \\"inquest\\" an air of scientific detachment, while applying at the same time consequently the classical recipe of evidence picking.From these tactics a book has resulted which, unfortunately, is bound to impress the uninformed and easily satisfied, who will not be aware of how selective Nr. Nickells evidence is.Yet, a REALLY sceptical reader should be able to detect here and there some of the clues which indicate that there is something inherently wrong with Mr. Nickells way of arguing.For instance, when the author puts forward the ridiculous claim that a technically and artistically very deficient pilgrims medallion PROVES \\"that the imagery (on the Shroud) was formerly much stronger than the faint sepia image of today\\". A simple glance at a picture of it would reveal to anybody how preposterous that claim is. Is it perhaps for just that reson we do not find any picture of the medallion in this book?The whole of the historical argumentation of Mr. Nickell is based on one single piece of evidence, the famous letter of Bishop d'Arcis from 1389, which he flatly states to be beyond any doubt, although the evidence of that document is not corroborated by any other source of that time. Where has gone all the scepticism of Mr. Nickell who, normally, does not believe one word of what a bishop says??Worse than Nickells feigned naivity is the obvious fact that he has systematically eliminated all the evidence present in his own sources (Ian Wilson, Thomas Humber) that went against the reliablity of the said document, evidence which has since been strengthened by additional discoveries, just as has been the disproval of Nickells claim of \\"thirteen centuries of silence\\" before the appearance of the Shroud in France in the mid 14th century. Quite a number of gaps of evidence have been filled, apparently unknown to Mr. Nickell. In his update chapter to the original book he has not seriously discussed any of the important new evidence, preferring instead to confine himself to topics for which he has an easy answer ready.On the very same line is situated the \\"refutation\\" by both Nickell and his main contributor, John F. Fischer, of the evidence put forward by the STURP experts Heller and Adler: Quite a number of important observations made by these two are simply not addressed. Since they have published their main paper under the auspices of the Canadian Forensic Society, wouldn'it have been logical for the FORENSIC SPECIALIST Fischer to submit his alleged thorough refutation of their work to te same institution, where it could have peen presented in a proper scientific context? Has HIS OWN WORK perhaps not been that perfect und comprehensive, after all?Needless to say that Nickells shroud imitations are as unconvincing as are those of all the other people, mostly situated in the same ideological corner as Mr. Nickell (and probably also Mr. Fischer), who have produced similar work, which they all claim to be entirely convincing. These alleged proofs of an artistic origin of the Turin Shroud are in reality miles away from the original and resemble far more the well known numerous bad Shroud copies made from the 16th century onwards which, sometimes, are still - quite dishonestly - presented as \\"competing medieval shrouds\\". At least from this particular fantasy argument Mr. Nickell seems have to refrained in the present book (though he has made use of it on other occasions). The said fake shrouds have also something else in common: for reasons which are quite easy to guess, their authors content themselves with showing only - if any at all - small sized pictures of them, never anything more detailed, let alone micro-photographs, such as STURP has made available in the context of their 1978 enquiry of the Turin Shroud, which alone would allow any proper insight. Nor have they allowed their imitation shrouds to be examined close at hands by their opponents.In the case of Mr. Nickell who is always so prompt in accusing others of wanting to deceive, such an attitude is particularly unsatisfactory indeed."},{"Title":"Building Valve Amplifiers","review":"I recently purchased this, the companion work to the author's definitive book on tube amp design, Valve Amplifiers. There are quite a few books on how to design a tube amp, but very few resources available on how to safely construct them. I say safely because vacuum tube amplifiers use voltages that are lethal, some extreme designs using voltages in excess of a kilovolt! Safety is essential when dealing with tube amps at all times.Originally, the author covered amplifier construction techniques in the first edition of Valve Amplifiers, but that volume is now in it's third edition and is over six hundred pages long WITHOUT the construction section. It's understandable that Mr. Jones decided to put out a separate tome on amp construction, since the construction information is as long as the entire first edition of Valve Amplifiers.This book goes into great detail on how to build a chassis, wiring techniques, PCB's, metalwork and assembly using only hand tools. Examples are given of tools to be used (often with more than one choice for a given job) and how to use them properly. The book then goes on to explain the use of oscilloscopes, distortion measurements and troubleshooting, completely illustrated with pictures and drawings needed to do these things. There are also useful tricks, such as using a discarded radio tuning capacitor to find the optimum capacitance for feedback compensation.This, along with Valve Amplifiers, are the definitive modern works for the amateur on how to design and build tube amplifiers. If you're interested in tube DIY audio, there just aren't any substitutes for these books, they're simply the best currently available, period."},{"Title":"Building Valve Amplifiers","review":"It is safe to assume that if you are considering this book, you feel you have ingested enough theory and are now ready for the nuts and bolts of assembling a vacuum tube amp of your own.(Not the least of which regards the critical importance of safety when dealing with lethal voltages)My rating of this book is a little low, inasmuch as the buyer might be disappointed to see so few words about assembly, and so many more chapters of theoretical/empirical esoterica. The author here is no slacker. He obviously has spent a lifetime in the field and has a vast body of expertise to share; and does so in that ever popular British circumlocutive amble. There is indeed a lot of subtle minutiae in the book that is informative, entertaining, and edifying. But aren't we interested in what to do and what not to do and why we do it this way and not that way regarding assembling the actual components? You can find all that info in this book; including what tools will help immensely and save a lot of starting over, and cursing inanimate objects on the way to starting over.(and be encouraged to discover that even this practised author, Morgan Jones, has a bit of dread when he first powers up-hoping not to see sparks & smoke!)But there are a couple more books that you might also consider:... On precisely what is taking place in a tube amp, one can do no better than to make sure to have on your electronics shelf, An all American classic by the late great USAF Colonel John Rider (of Rider Technical Publication fame)-a reprint of his superbly well written \\"Inside The Vacuum Tube\\". He takes you one step at a time; and at the beginning of a new chapter, reviews \\"what we learned, and explains what we will now learn and now build upon in the next chapter\\". In other words, it is a very well thought outand in depth treatise, with a beginning a middle and an end. You will emerge with a command of vacuum tube circuitry.Once that is digested, ...and perhaps you are precisely at that point now... you want to know exactly why you use this value of resistor, and that value of capacitor, and this arrangement of components, and not THAT kind of resistor, etc,.. and I do mean exactly how...you will find no better book than another fine reprint by the title of \\"Mullard Tube Circuits For Audio Amplifiers\\" If it comes down to choosing one over the other, with both time and budget concerns...I'd go for the Mullard book, hands down, nol contendre. It gives all the exact reasons for why we provide feedback, precisely how the phase splitter splits the signal for the push pull, and why we even want a push pull rather than a single ended amp; and diagrams for drilling out the chassis, and time honored, and tested methods of assembly. 'S alright? 'Salright!"},{"Title":"Building Valve Amplifiers","review":"...this book contains a lot of good, hard to find advice on the pratical issues that arise when building a tube amplier. This allows the novice to learn quickly without having to learn only by their own mistakes (which can be dangerous, frustating and costly). There are useful discussions on choosing basic equipment (although perhaps a little too much) such as Digital Volt Meters and Oscilloscopes. The author also usefully discusses sourcing components which is, in my experience, the big hidden work item you run into building your own electronics (especially tube electronics) these days.This book, sensibly, does not contain a lot of theory (the author moved that to his other book -- which I did not find useful) or circuits for re-use -- but for the practical issues of safely producing a safe, robust, low noise amplifier this book is very good.My interest is primarily guitar amplifiers and this book is equally applicable to that domain as it is to hi-fi amplifiers, albeit without any special consideration of guitar amplifier issues or circuits.The authors writing style is fine (it could, perhaps be more concise in some areas) but the pictures and layout of the book are dated and, given that, the price seems high (although this book represents better value than the author's theory book, in my opinion)."},{"Title":"Building Valve Amplifiers","review":"Building Valve Amplifiers is an indispensable book for an amateur learning to construct amplifiers on his/her own; it even includes examples of manufacturer design flaws and how they could have been avoided. The book presupposes no knowledge about electronic/electrical assembly at all and is an excellent introduction.Two cautions:(1) After reading many reviews it seems only a few people understand that this book is volume 2 of 2. Volume 1 of 2 is \\"Valve Amplifiers\\"Valve Amplifiers, Third Editionand it deals solely with amplifier design - this book does not contain any significant discussion of design principles.(2) Some reviews seem to be negative for the sake of being negative - one reviewer writes that they have 20 years of experience as an electrical engineer and that they are disappointed in the scope of the book. I would hope an engineer with 20 years experience would be capable of writing such books, not buying them to learn the basics. Take the negative reviews with a healthy dose of salt: as an engineer with 35 years of experience I think Mr. Jones' two books are pretty close to masterpieces for the non-professional."},{"Title":"Building Valve Amplifiers","review":"With appropriate respect for the points made by the various reviewers of this book who gave it an average or below rating, I believe the complaints of those individuals are addressed if one views this volume as the companion to Mr. Jones' \\"Valve Amplifiers\\" volume, ISBN 0-7506-5694-8Together, these two works provide a solid grounding in much of the necessary information necessary to grow one's ability to grasp what is happening inside a valve amplifier. In particular, his empirical work on valve performance and design features which aid or degrade such performance, and his firm grasp of what does and does not affect the tone of the amplifier, are both areas which the more traditional texts simply do not address. It seems to me that when one possesses a firm command of that knowledge one may then move forward, both with classic designs and (one would hope) new and original ideas in valve application.Of course, if valve amplifier beginners wish to begin with monkey-see, monkey-do designs, there is a wealth of free information on the internet to that end. Such practice is valuable experience...but this is not what Morgan Jones' two volumes are primarily designed to do.I post this review mostly to remind folks that it is the Morgan Joneses of the world who are both bold enough to publish, and who have the necessary technical acumen, and who have actually done the work of supporting research to validate their published material. Without folks like Jones, the modern valve amplifier landscape devolves into tube rolling, snobbery and myth...a death sentence to the valve art, IMO.I never cease to be amazed at the number of folks who will spend over five hundred dollars for an NOS GZ34 rectifier because it has the Mullard label on it. More often than not, those same folks cannot articulate even the most basic principles behind good power supply design and its effect on amplifier performance. Yet, those same individuals balk and spending forty dollars on a book which could easily clear that issue up for them, to the immense benefit of the performance of their designs.In conclusion, I find both of Jones' volumes mentioned herein to be valuable assets, even as I recognize they do not claim to be the end all and be all of valve amplifier design and construction. I applaud him for his work in this area. Rather than being overly critical or myopic about flaws in Jones's book, it might be more beneficial to skip this month's tube rolling expenditure for yet another pair of 12AU7 black plate NOS whatever. Instead, spend that money and help support Morgan Jones and others like him who are still publishing valve related material of sufficient robustness as to reasonably warrant ownership.As an aside, I would agree with Frank Elliot's point that the Mullard publication, along with Rider's \\"Inside the Vacuum Tube\\" are critical pieces to the equation as well, and I would commend them to the valve enthusiast. Good luck finding the Rider volume - the current price is hovering around a hundred bucks, and they are in very short supply. The Mullard publication is, however, available for a very reasonable price on Amazon."},{"Title":"Building Valve Amplifiers","review":"For your own good, don't take the advice of people saying that this book is \\"great for beginners\\" etc. A background in electronics will help you, but an understanding of general amplifier design, practices and layout is assumed by the author and this book may be over your head at parts otherwise. Also, the author is british, so he'll write something like HT and you may not know that that means high tension which is britspeak for high voltage.Also, I was hoping to get a solid guide on circuit design as well as amplifier construction and layout, but the circuit design is almost completely absent. Perhaps this is too much to ask for... after all it's \\"Building Valve Amplifiers\\" not \\"Designing Valve Amplifiers.\\" If you want to design and build an amp, this book is only the second half of the solution.With that said, it is probably one of the best resources once you reach the build phase of your project.

If you have never built electronics and aren't familiar with the basic tools and techniques, this is a suitable text. It discusses tools, very basic sheet metal working, electronic construction techniques, and common pitfalls.If however, you have some knowledge of electronics construction, then you can safely pass by this book. The author covers the basics of safety (important when working with voltages over about 70 volts) and construction but spends the entire volume on the very basic aspects of the topics covered. For example, there is a discussion of appropriate soldering iron tips and making good solder joints. Good information for the uninitiated, but hardly advanced topics. There is also a discussion of the differences between analog and digital volt meters. Again, the raw basics for getting started but not the higher level details for which you might be looking. I bought this book looking for some information on how various design flaws might manifest themselves in amplifier performance. I found nothing of the sort. There are some very basic discussion of potential sources of hum and crackle in the sound, but that's it. No discussion of component interactions, nonlinearities, field interactions, or appropriate shielding. The author also seems to have some serious misconceptions on grounding and ground currents. Be careful following his advice on this topic.Don't get me wrong, this book and the author's companion book \\"Valve Amplifiers\\" both contain some good information. However, it is beginner level information. I am a twenty year Electrical Engineer looking for specific information on certain topics. As such, I found both the author's books rather disappointing.If you're new to electronics construction and vacuum tubes, you'll probably find this book helpful.

Here we learn not only of the roots of Slavery in the Sudan where the Arab Muslim north has been enslaving the African south for more then a thousand years but we also learn of the role of race in the conflict as well as the more interesting role of the English in denying slavery. One chapter in particular shows how the English, sent to abolish slavery, actually upheld it by reclassifying household slaves as 'domestic servants'. Thus slavery was never legally abolished in the Sudan the way it was in Egypt and the Ottoman empire. Rather the average person today in the Sudan sees nothing morally wrong with owning slaves or raping slave girls.This book is an impassioned plea to the world to wake up to the reality of the Sudanese genocide, the racist fascist civil war that has gone on for 40 years. Yet one knows the track record of the world, of humanity, when it comes to stopping genocide. That record is 0-4(Rwanda, Cambodia, The Holocaust, the Sudan). In fact the Sudan was recently picked by the U.N to head the human rights commission. This is why books like this are so important, to perhaps help one ignorant person realize that horror, genocide, slavery and racism are not just what one reads in the history books, rather they are happening today and have a burden of history attached to them. An important book, the best book on the Sudanese civil war.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"War and Slavery in Sudan","review":"...Of the half-dozen books I've read on Sudan, this is my favorite. Although it is not a general work on the country, it does focus on two of its most well-known issues: the ongoing civil war and slavery.Jok Madut Jok is a South Sudanese historian based in the United States. His educational background and interviews with countless South Sudanese about their experiences with Arab slave raids makes this a scholarly book, while his perspective as a South Sudanese gives it an edge not usually associated with scholarship. He clearly is pained by what is happening in Sudan, and does not attempt to give a balanced account here. But whatever the book loses in objectivity, it more than makes up for in passion.\\"War and Slavery in Sudan\\" is well-written and its concepts clear -- with one major exception. I'm unsure what the author means when he talks about the role racism plays in the conflict and how racial ideology is the foundation of the slave trade in Sudan. He appears to mean that the cultural arrogance of the Arabs in the north -- many of whom are black -- allows them to enslave and make war against some of the non-Muslim tribes in the south, but I'm not entirely clear on this point. Despite this major lapse, however, this is still an excellent book for anyone interested in Sudan."},{"Title":"War and Slavery in Sudan","review":"Author Jok Madut Jok does a a fine job of revealing the historical roots of the slave trade in Sudan in his book, WAR AND SLAVERY IN SUDAN. He makes the exact same point that I do in my book, JIHAD: The Mahdi Rebellion in the Sudan (2003), that the modern Civil Wars between the North and the South can be traced back to the 19th century when Britain moved her forces into the region to establish commercial control of the Eastern Mediterranean via the Suez Canal. Slavery had been an institution in this area for hundreds of years, particularly in the provinces of Darfur and Kordofan; and especially in the region of the Bahr al-Ghazal, the old slave-trading station. For centuries, as Jok points, the Northern Arabs considered the Southern inhabitants as inferior and therefore, to be relegated to menial tasks and jobs. Their lands were called the \\"Bilad al-Sudan or \\"Land of the African.\\" This racial and tribal warfare has persisted until well into the 20th century. Even now, at the dawn of the 21st century, this sociological and historical phenomenon manifests itself openly before the world. The Genocide taking place in Sudan today is a reminder that \\"old attitudes\\" and prejudices die hard. Mr. Jok's book, WAR AND SLAVERY IN SUDAN is a much-needed volume in a world that needs vast humanitarian change. Highly-rated! Murray S. Fradin, Author of JIHAD: THE MAHDI REBELLION IN THE SUDAN"},{"Title":"War and Slavery in Sudan","review":"As the previous reviewer states, this book makes little attempt at objectivity, since it is written by a South Sudanese (Dinka) living in America. Unlike him/her, however, I feel that as a result of the subjectivity, I am still relatively uneducated about the civil war in Sudan. Concessions to SPLA brutality are fleeting and apologetic, and there is, I believe, no mention at all of the actual war between Khartoum and the SPLA-- a major drawback for me, considering the book's title. The vast majority of the text deals with slavery. Jok attributes quotes to various Northern politicians, then admits in the footnotes that he has &quot;no documentation as to when this statement was made,&quot; but rather attributes them to &quot;popular political discourse.&quot; The most interesting parts for me were discussions of the roots of the North/South conflict in the Turco-Egyptian, Mahdist and Anglo-Egyptian occupations (especially the latter), but again these were frustratingly brief. In response to the previous reviewer's confusion, I believe that the contention is that Arabic, Muslim northerners have historically looked down upon African (though they're all African), Christian/animist southerners, the roots of which sentiment seem to be age old. It is understandable, however, that one would be fuzzy on the exact argument. The causes all seem to blend together; indeed, the entire book struck me as being rather poorly organized. Many terms or events were redundantly recounted/defined three or fours times in different chapters, the same points are made repeatedly, and the conclusion chapter is really a digression on the redemption program. Lastly, the actual writing could have used a thorough editing. Many sentences came off as rather awkward, and it seemed as though footnotes were often missing where they should have been. I suggest that one seek out a more objective account, at least as an introduction to the Sudanese conflict."},{"Title":"The Case of the Pederast's Wife","review":"The Case of the Pederast's Wife, by Blossom Elfman, is an incredibly well researched and written book. the first thing one notices is the quality of the writing and of the scholarship and research. Oscar Wilde was a complex and intereting character and until I read this quite marvelous book, I had no idea that he had a wife! He was, after all, an avowed homosexual. As one reads the book one comes to understand the restraints of the time Wilde and his wife, Constance, lived. Many books, plays and films have been written about Wilde, but Constance, his wife and mother of his two sons, has been neglected, even avoided. Applause and kudos to Ms. Elfman who had the intelligence and wit to discover Constance Wilde and to bring her to life in a wonderfully written book."},{"Title":"The Case of the Pederast's Wife","review":"This painfully sincere novel fails on many levels. It is haphazardly imagined and arbitrarily constructed, and its characters are cardboard-thin. Its protagonist, physician Martin Frame, is the son of a brutish doctor who treats hysteria with adamantine harshness. Unlike his father, Frame does not believe that women should be treated like barnyard animals; he is interested in applying a version of good old Freud's talking cure to women in distress.A friend of a patient introduces him to the Wildes, and Frame is smitten with Constance's constancy. Plus, she smells good and appears to be halfway bright. He feels compelled to aid her in recovering from her attachment to Oscar.This is in some ways an interesting premise, but Elfman doesn't go far enough in imagining these people and what their relationships could have been. Writing historical fiction requires a certain amount of brashness, a willingness to presume to speak for the dead. That doesn't happen here... Elfman seems overwhelmed by the significance of what she is about.The structure of the novel also leaves something to be desired... chapter epigrams seem arbitrary in this short first-person account; they read like bits of preliminary character sketches and research notes, draft work that should have been edited out of the final product.What is it about Oscar Wilde that makes him so difficult to capture in print or on film? The recent awful biopic of Oscar was every bit as wooden as this well-meant but unsuccessful novel."},{"Title":"Professional Fly Tying, Spinning and Tackle Making Manual and Manufacturer's Guide Revised Twenty-Second Edition","review":"Geo.

Especially touching and true are Cookie Mueller's short essays, well worth the purchase."},{"Title":"Halos","review":"Such a strange and out of ordinary situation for Alessi to be in. But it turned out to be an awesome book and had such God fearing and wonderful people in it. I didn't want it to end!"},{"Title":"Halos","review":"I enjoyed this story however I kept thinking throughout the book why no one checked the DMV from her hometown for information on Alessi's car to verify that she was not dropped off by some boyfriend? It made no sense to me. And Steve and others who befriend her why did they not think of it? The Pastor of the Church not think of it? The story seems like a show from the Twilight Zone about 40 years ago before computers could verify the information on the car. I am concerned about the ending sending the wrong message. Relationships need more time and these two people have issues that need to be healed before they can embark on a lifetime commitment. Both have abandonment issues. The Sheriff Roehr is an idiot. Just a big fish in a small pond. You can't judge a town by it's name. Remember that when you read this book."},{"Title":"Halos","review":"This was my first book to read by this author and I fell in love with her writing. I cannot think of a person who would not benefit from reading this sweet story. The story of a person who has grown up with life staked up against her and yet her mother has given her the most precious gift of looking for the good and believing that God and His angels are always looking after her. I finished reading this book in one evening and re-read it the next day, wanting to savor over the story a little slower the 2nd time around."},{"Title":"Halos","review":"Kristen Heitzmann has written an amazing story! After I finished reading Halos - \\"wow\\" was what came to mind. I felt the emotions and experiences of the people in the story with great vividness (the word characters just doesn't do them justice). I wish I had the skill and artistry that Kristen Heitzmann obviously has to describe the richness and depth of this book. I would highly reccomend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Halos","review":"A little slow and too much needless filler. I do recommend it though. Good read keeps your attention all the way through"},{"Title":"Halos","review":"I have just found Kristen Heitzmann after all of my other favorite authors have been exhausted. HALOS was an excellent stopgap. There are some people out there that literally have a lemon for a life and somehow they make lemonade out of it. Thre are others who view these people with suspicion and think they are &quot;cons.&quot; This is a story of how a woman who's life was not that easy, took the view that life with God is a miracle in itself. She helps to make a believer out of a bitter, angry man by believing in halos and miracles. I intend to read it again."},{"Title":"Halos","review":"As someone who has read other books by Kristen Heitzmann, I would say this has more of a mystical quality to it. The world Heitzmann portrays in \\"Halos\\" is a bit fantasy-like, first with Alessi's unusual halo visions, and then with the other mysterious happenings in the town of Charity. My overall impression while I was reading was that it was a well-written story. The dialogue is captivating and the characters are interesting, although their reactions to events at times are highly unrealistic. To readers that find the town's secrets shocking, keep in mind this is a fictional world!"},{"Title":"Halos","review":"HalosBy Kristen HeitzmannReviewed by: Olga NovokreshchenovAlessi woke up shivering from what patchy sleep she'd managed. The dream images were all to fresh; that monsterish head leering at her through the window, the glass shattering as the car burst through on an icy wave that engulfed and stole her breath. She shivered again. Didn't Steve heat the store? She blew out her breath in a cloud.The major characters in this book are Alessi, Steve, Ben, Dave, Diana, Karen, Carl, and Carl's Father + Mother. In the beginning Alessi finds herself in a small town named charity. After being there for less that and hour someone took/stole her car. Steve (bookstore owner) gives her a job in till she finds her car. In the middle Alessi keeps thinking that she see's of hears her car. Than one night something terrible happens. Alessi wakes up from a dream that she hears her car. Then she looks out the window and their it was. It speeds away and she runs to Ben, Dave and Steve to show them that she was not lying and that the car is here in Charity. The sheriff comes and says there is nothing that they can do. Alessi breaks down and Steve takes her to the bookstore and kisses her. He can't be falling in love said Steve, I forbid it. At the end Alessi will have to stand up to the monster that took her car but will she be able to survive the horror of torture?This is definitely a book that you would want to read. If you love mystery with some romance then this book is definitely for you. It has good drama in it and is a Christian read. If you are not religious of believe in god than I don't think that you will really enjoy this book. This book could be a girl book more than a boy book. If you like a book that has lots of horror than this book is not for you either. This book is more of a mystery and love story so if you love this kind of read that make sure that you check it out!I really loved reading this book. If you are someone that loves to read than check this book out. It has some romance and lots of mystery. I think that this book is a great example of how quick people can judge before getting to know the person. This is a Christian read so this book might confuse those who are not. Check this book out. And if you go to Cocalico High School and want to read it than come talk to me! In Ms. Nuhfer's room."},{"Title":"Halos","review":"The lead character in the book is an interesting person who sees halos -- not really angelic ones but the halos in the reflected light and yet in that halo she sees hope and goodness. In some ways, this character seems rather Pollyanna-ish, but she is what we perhaps wish we could be -- seeing the good and the positive and hoping for the best.The town she finds herself in has a deep dark secret that they protect, even at her expense and in the end the people of the town have to face the reality of it.The book keeps your attention and the ending was inevitable."},{"Title":"Halos","review":"Alessi is orphaned and looking for a place to lay down roots but depends too much on halos to guide her. A quick stop for gas in a small town turns out to be the start of her life in Charity. Her car is stolen with all its' contents and she is forced to make friends with total strangers and work in a bookstore by getting advance pay. Steve is eccentric and untrusting since his mother died and his fiance dumped him, so he is the last person to want to help Alessi. However, the lot falls to him. His life is changed in the most unlikely of ways...perhaps this was my favorite part of the book.A small town contemporary Christian love story, this is very different for this author, and I will continue to read her other types, I was not too fond of the halo theory."},{"Title":"Halos","review":"I had mixed feelings about this book, based solely on the notes of other reviewers. How glad I am that I took the time to read it for myself! Kristen Heitzmann, again, took me to a place I was loathe to leave.21 year old Alessi is a truly unique character, & one cannot help but love her. Through all of her struggles, which include being orphaned by 12 & unwanted by any of her biological family, she maintains her wry humor, warm heart, & non-judgemental spirt, along with her belief in miracles. Quick to forgive & offer a second-chance, Alessi is not about to take a handout from anyone. And oh, how she longs to belong somewhere!Steve is scarred by women, having been abandoned as a boy by his mother & then again in adulthood by his fiancee. He's preparing to endure his first Christmas since his elderly father passed away. Gruff & bear-like, the reader knows the only way this boy's shell is going to crack is through the gentle, unassuming presence of Alessi.The characters are lovingly developed, continuing to grow throughout the book as they learn more about God, themselves, & those around them. I found myself rooting for each one as they faced minor to catastrophic challenges. Even Carl, who I was pre-disposed to dislike, had gained my empathy by the end.This is a beautiful story about God, love, forgiveness, faith, & miracles. The characters wormed their way into my heart & left me aching for their happiness. I personally could have used another chapter or two; perhaps merely an epilogue. I was not ready to let this story end. Instead I guess I'll just get a few more of Heitzmann's books."},{"Title":"Halos","review":"I found it very, very easy to loose myself in this book. Kristen Heitzmann does an excellent job of bringing the characters in this book to life. Alessi Moore is stranded in a town that makes it no secret her presence is not welcome. She's faced with horrible obstacles that would send most warm bodies running with their tail between their legs, but not Alessi. She stood firm and refused to leave, but she did it with a compassion that definitely put my spirit in check when I was reminded of all the times I could have loved instead of fought. I originally bought this book so I could have something to read during my lunch hour. Instead, I had it read the very weekend I bought it. The romance in this book was perfectly balanced which further affirms my love of Kristen Heitsmann's writing. She does not shy away from true human affection and emotion but she also doesn't cross the fine line of over or under doing it. I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone who loves a good romance/suspense novel without compromising their faith."},{"Title":"Halos","review":"This is by far one of the most fun I have ever had reading a book in a long time!!! The storyline is wonderful and enchanting, keeping you entertained through the entire book. The story revolves around Alessi Moore, a 21-year-old woman who believes in halos and angels and is basically an orphan, having no family that wants her. She arrives in Charity, after seeing a halo around the town, only to have her car stolen with all her worldly possesions in it right from under her. She is befriended by Ben and Dave, two convenient store owners, who give her a room for the night and friendship that will last a lifetime. Arriving on the scene Steve, a guy who instantly gives Alessi a cold shoulder and tells her that her car will never be found. As the story progresses, Steve realizes he has fallen in love with Alessi and everything that she believes in. The suspense surrounding this story is the town has made a \\"pact\\" that no one will speak of. Alessi becomes the victim of cruel jokes, and the belief that no one in Charity wants to help her, except maybe Ben and Dave. That's all I'm going to say as far as the storyline goes, but I will go on to say that if you want a story that will entertain, keep you in suspense, and make you believe in angels, than this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Halos","review":"Once I started on this book,I couldn't put it down. This is one of the best books I have ever read by Kristen Heitzmann. The story of a young woman in a tough situation with everything she has in the world stolen and a cynic yet lovable male character has his life and perspective changed because of her has moved me. Alessi Moore's kindness and optimistic outlook on life, changes the people around her and makes them see how the little good things in life go unnoticed and underappreciated. Steve Bennet is a cynical Christian with a not-so-very-glamourous life either. But his outlook is changed dramatically when Alessi comes into his life. The town of Charity also need to realize that their suppressed secret will still continue to harm innocent people. Will the miracle Alessi anticipated with the appearance of the halo around the sun will take place despite of the underlying attitude of the seemingly quaint town? Awesome story. Kristen Heitzmann is one of my favourite authors and I will read her next story &quot;Secrets&quot; which is coming out this fall and continues the story generations later of Quillan and Carina in the Diamond of the Rockies."},{"Title":"Halos","review":"I have just read my first Kristen Heitzmann book. It will not be the last! I started reading this book at nine o'clock last night, stayed up until Midnight and put off work for several hours to finish it this morning. It is truly a testament of how one woman's small kindnesses affected an entire town, one that had been caught up in its secret guilt for far too long. The testimonies said about her shows how a person's actions speak way louder than their words. It is a gentle reminder how we should all live."},{"Title":"Halos","review":"With no on to turn to and only a beautiful red Mustang to her name, Alessi Moore drifts from place to place. When she sees a halo around the sun near the town of Charity, she knows she is meant to go there and that something wonderful awaits. Unfortunately, it seems only trouble was waiting. She becomes stranded in Charity and must count on the good will of a town where most people seem to wish she would simply disappear. The first friends she find in Charity are Ben and Dave, who take her in. That good will is short lived when their roommate, Steve, objects. Steve feels Alessi is up to know good. As Alessi struggles to stand on her own two feet, it seems others are just waiting for her to stumble. Alessi begins to wonder why exactly God would put a halo over a town where she is obviously not wanted. She even reasons that maybe the halo was meant for somewhere else. But she is in Charity now. The town seems charming at times, but coarse at others, as do the people.Every step of her journey makes for a great story.Alessi is looking for a place to belong. She's not accustomed to trusting anyone, though she does try to see the best in everything and everyone. Steve is still trying to heal from his own lifetime of hurt. He can't decide if Alessi is a trouble maker, or if she really is as innocent as she seems.This is a sweet, touching book about overcoming old hurts and finding joy even in trials. Alessi's own journey to keep surviving is mirrored in the struggles of many of the characters she meets. From cover to cover, Halos races through inspriration, drama, and romance without stopping for a breath. It is not just a good read, it is a beautifully satisfying read. Kristen Heitzmann does a marvelous job weaving together this poignant tale about moving beyond the past and forgiving. The characters are believable. That was one thing that struck me from the very beginning. It is not a book full of saints, rather a book full of people that seem very real. The other great thing about the characters is how how developed they are. By the end of the book, you can really see to the hearts of the two main characters.This is truly a wonderful book. I wish I could better put into words just how good it really is. This is the first book I have read by Kristen Heitzmann, but I will definitely be reading more by her soon. I just wish the book could be longer. I was more than ready to keep reading.A single word to sum up Halos would have to be engaging. I recommend this book highly. It makes for a terrific read."},{"Title":"Halos","review":"Alessi Moore has been on her own since she was eighteen. While experiencing a snowfall for the first time in the town of Charity, she interprets the halo around the sun as a good sign. When her prized and only major possession, a red convertible Mustang is stolen, she begins to doubt whether Charity is a good place for her. With no money, clothes or place to go, she unfortunately must stay to find out if the town lives up to its name.Charity does live up to its name as the town folks embrace Alessi. While suspicious about Alessi's predicament, Steve, a bookstore owner gives her a job. Due to his past and recent experience with women, Steve's lack of trust creates tension between the two.Alessi is convinced that her stolen car is still in Charity. Her fears are confirmed as an unidentified individual plays prank after prank on her, each prank becoming more serious than the precedent one. While the town refuses to face the fact that evil DOES exist in Charity, Steve's heart begins to melt towards Alessi and her plight.Kristin Heitzmann has become a force in the Christian romance/suspense market. Her latest book Halos will definitely seal her as a favorite among Christian fiction book lovers. Alessi's presence is almost &quot;angelic&quot; and magical as the halos she believes in. Her presence creates turmoil in the town of Charity and at the same time serves as an inspriation to discouraged individuals ... one being a very bitter man who learns how to love again ... this time falling in love with the woman destined to be for him from God. This story is emotionaly satisfying! Plan to be hooked from page one!--- reviewed by Tyora Moody for Christian Bookshelf"},{"Title":"Halos","review":"A lovely story to enjoy on a rainy day! A few lessons to be learned about human nature, the gift of forgiveness , and that miracles can and do happen that defy any scientific explanation! Can't wait to read more of Kristen Heitzmann's books."},{"Title":"Halos","review":"I'm not familiar with inspirational fiction, but I had heard very good things about Kristin Heitzmann, so I thought I would give this a try, along with one other of her works (A Rush of Wings.) Heitzmann's prose style is good and fluid--a must for me to find any book I read enjoyable, and she does an adequate job of creating a suspenseful atmosphere, as Alessi starts to realize that the town may not be what seems, and the mystery behind Charity's facade is slowly revealed. However, there are a few things I didn't care for in the book. First, Steve's distrustful attitude toward Alessi grated on me, to the point that it interfered with my ability to warm up to him. Second, I felt that Alessi's supposed \\"spunkiness\\" became rather irritating after she starts realizing she's being stalked. Her refusal to leave the room in the shop where she sleeps to go stay with Steve and his family after her stalker has just assaulted her with a bucket of ice water *on her very doorstep* is a case in point. The stalker has demonstrated that he knows where she lives and that he is willing to harm her; I don't care how much she wants to have a place of her own, that's veering into \\"too stupid to live\\" territory.I also have a few problems surrounding the substance of \\"the pact.\\" Without giving away spoilers, I'll just say I found it very unlikely that things could have gotten as out of hand as they did without the police being involved, and Pastor Welsh's ability to create this pact and enforce it on the town carries some rather creepy \\"Jim Jonesish\\" overtones. Still, the way Heitzmann draws out the mystery of the pact is very well done and definitely kept me turning pages to find out what happened next. Overall, this was an engaging book, but probably not one that I'll feel any compulsion to reread."},{"Title":"Halos","review":"Once again this author has amazed me with her originality,and writing skill.This is my third book by her,after Edge of Recall and Freefall. Each one was a five-star read for me,and it's impossible for me to choose a favorite!This book was another page-turner,as were the other two.The main character Alessi More is a very sweet naive young woman with a heartbreaking past. Her sweet nature touches many hearts in the small town of Charity where she becomes stranded.There is a very misguided Pastor in this town and a horrible pact the residents have adhered to.The author does her usual fabulous job of developing the characters so that we readers develop strong feelings of camaraderie with some,and very strong distaste for others.Plus her descriptions of the surroundings,had me imagining the scent of the evergreens,and feeling the cold!Next I will move on to her Historical Romances and see if her originality still shows,LOL!"},{"Title":"Halos","review":"I REALLY loved this book, was pulled in by the author's great writing and story line. Many have already reviewed the excellence of the book... but I wanted to give a heads up to the Pro-life Christians out there. The author basically gives the typical \\"if you are brain dead you are dead and thus it's moral to remove life support\\". Such as air (yes, this can be morally acceptable); but she also says you can REMOVE the IV! and basically dehydrate a person to death! This was VERY disturbing to me... a person, even if they have no brain activity, cannot be dehydrated or starved to death, they deserve basic dignity as humans. As can be seen in many, many cases where the person \\"woke up\\" and had heard all the nasty comments from doctors, etc from when they were \\"brain dead\\"... doctors simply do not understand so called \\"brain death\\", and I don't believe it's simply a miracle that brings them back... yes, God has a hand in it, like all. But it's morally okay to remove a respirator if they don't have much hope, but it's never morally acceptable to starve a person, period. It basically ruined a very good book for me to have this happen, and I don't appreciate it from a Christian author.Other than that the book was top notch, and I will still be reading her other books... just wanted to point out what nobody else had."},{"Title":"Halos","review":"I was disappointed with this story, story line was stretching it and dragged. It was okay, but not one I would pick up again and read 2, 3, 4 times. I like Kristen Heintzmann and think she is a very talented author, but this one just didn't cut the mustard. I would and will still buy her books, she is one of the best authors I have ever read and has a definite way with words and details."},{"Title":"Halos","review":"I had discovered this author last spring and liked her books -- I had read 5 of them. Secret, Unforgotten, Echoes and also Twilight, A rush of Wings, The Still of Night. So I was eager to read more. This one was not what I expected -- a downer. I just could hardly finish it. I had also gotten Freefall, but am not planning to read it. Not sure why the change in the writing."},{"Title":"Halos","review":"A fast and light read but didn't have the depth I like to find in a story. It was an interesting plot on the surface and there was enough to it that I did finish it but I won't read it again. Once was more than enough for me. It is a good clean book and if you have nothing else to read it will do but if you have other selections I would try those first."},{"Title":"Halos","review":"I chose this book after reading the Michelli Family series. I must say that this book is different than any other Christian mystery/suspense I have ever read (and I have read MANY). It wasn't one of those &#34;can't put it down&#34; type of books, but it did have an element of surprise which I found refreshing. The characters were complex which made the book more intense. I have found a new favorite author."},{"Title":"Halos","review":"I love this writer. Christian message with a step into the afterlife and very well written...no compormises here by reading Christian fiction."},{"Title":"Halos","review":"Interesting read in Christian fiction. I did not figure out the mystery. Ms. Heitzman does not write \\"formula\\" Christian fiction.

I've now read it several times and recommend it to anyone who likes to read a good book with a good ending."},{"Title":"Halos","review":"I absolutely loved this book, so much so in fact that I have reread it at LEAST 10 times. It was unusual but at the same time believable and exciting."},{"Title":"Halos","review":"I truly enjoyed Halos as much as I have the many other books of Kristin Heitzmann. Halos entered a quiet place in my heart that allowed my imagination a pleasant visit in a somewhat surreal town. I liked it so well I have reread and will be doing so again just to have that unique feeling once again. I feel that this author is very gifted with an usual way to bring out the cluster of characters in all of her books that gives me a feeling of being right there in the midst of them. I also recommend the Michelli series. Thank You for allowing my comments here."},{"Title":"Halos","review":"Another excellent novel by Kristen Heitzmann. Product received on time and in condition as stated b y the seller."},{"Title":"Halos","review":"This is one of my favorite books because the story line is beautiful. When you start reading the book though, the middle chapter will be confusing just because there's a going back and forth there and the author doesn't really give you a hint of when there's going to be a back and forth, which looses you. But once you get past that and read the story, it's a beautiful story"},{"Title":"Halos","review":"From the first page, I was hooked. Kristen Heitzmann always does a great job of weaving a tale that includes mystery/suspense, wit, romance, and faith. I liked all the characters a lot, and felt they were all well-developed, including the supporting roles. I would absolutely recommend this book to others. I couldn't wait to find out what happened, yet I didn't want it to end. In a nutshell: well-written, good clean romance, very amusing writing at times, and perfect ending. Still wasn't quite as great as Heitzmann's Edge of Recall, but close. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Halos","review":"\\"Halos\\" is the perfect quick read. It practically reads itself. Kristen Heitzmann weaves an engaging tale full of memorable characters and beautiful scenery. I actually felt I was in Charity, Vermont. I could picture it clearly. It's the ideal book to curl up with during a snowstorm (which I did).There were some unrealistic situations (the women stalking Steve, the ridiculous pact) and that sort of thing usually bothers me a lot, however, this novel had such a dreamy, fairy-tale quality that I actually didn't mind. Anything could have been possible and it would have worked for me. Also, the underlying themes (forgiveness, second chances, loving without reservation) were much more important.Overall, a satisfying and powerful read although I have to say I would have been just as satisfied had Steve ended up with Karen! I know that's a weird thing to say, but Alessi seemed too good to be true sometimes. It was as if she was an angel who blew into town one day to spread love and impart wisdom and then drifted away just as quickly. Don't get me wrong. I loved the ending, but I would have been happy with an alternate one too. I wonder what that says about me? ;-) Maybe it simply says that Heitzmann is a gifted author who creates winning characters."},{"Title":"Halos","review":"Halos was such a fresh read!

(which I think some of the harsher reviewers were doing.) This book has a fairy tale/mystery quality to the book with a dark side that makes it altogether UNIQUE for Heitzmann. I am an avid follower of Heitzmann's work and usually read her books the day they are released. And after reading the 'The Still of Night'(a 5 star book) which was a very moving but a heavy and emotional book - this feels like an emotional shift in her writing that had a fairy tale/poetic influence woven into a modern day character who is in quite a fix. I enjoyed this book as a lighter refreshing read after all my tears with the Still of Night. The dark side of this book I found interesting and a little haunting. . . It's an interesting book worth reading for the unique plot, the haunting dark side and the light poetic feel combined. Good verses evil personified. Read but don't compare for this book stands alone in Heitzmann's works, not better, not worse - just unique.

I really loved the different perspectives and different challenges.Evil really exists and the consequences of sin, Carl's family's lifelong sin problems. God was in this book, but not in the yea right way, in the real believable way!I could imagine being Alessi, but I can imagine being Steve too. Who really knew if Alessi was serious about what happened, or it was truly as she was saying.Can you imagine being Alessi, thinking you saw the Halos and stopped in this quaint little town, Charity, loving seeing snow fall for the FIRST time, and someone STEALS your car.

It presents in a clear and strong way the religious Zionist interpretation of Jewish history. It begins by consider Moshiach and argues that he is not a mystical or supernatural figure. Following the Rambam , Rabbi Zimmerman argues that the Messiah will be an earthly ruler who will bring into being a state whose center will be in Torah. According to Rabbi Zimmerman there are five stages in Redemption. \\" First the Jews will not be subject to foreign rule. Second, because Klal Yisrael lacks the merit- for the generation has not done tshuva-its redemption must come about by a natural process rather than by obvious miracles. Third, the Jews will return to Eretz Yisrael and establish their own government. Fourth, gradually , more and more Jews will return to the Torah.Eventually the Moshiach will come and establish a Torah government as the Gemara says in Eruvin 43b. All the laws of the Torah will be observed, The Sanhedrin will be reinstituted, the wicked will be punished, the righteous shall be rewarded and the Temple will be rebuilt-all under the restored rulership of the House of David.\\"Zimmerman shows how the complaint made by the ultra-Orthodox regarding the violation of the Three Oaths is invalid. He argues that the coming- to- live- in the land is not the Mitzvah but rather only the preparation for the Mitzvah. The true Mitzvah is in living in the land."},{"Title":"Twilight of Innocence: The Disappearance of Beverly Potts","review":"\\"Twilight of Innocence: The Disappearance of Beverly Potts\\" by James Jessen Badal is the spellbinding account of a community's search for a 10-year-old girl who vanished without a trace less than a block from her Cleveland home.Born in 1941, Beverly Potts lived with her family in a quiet Cleveland suburb.

Her disappearance later that night led to what Badal calls \\"the largest manhunt in Cleveland history\\" and raised \\"the chilling possibility that she had been grabbed literally within sight of the family house.\\"Badal investigated the case by sifting through old newspapers and police files. He describes the dynamic interaction among the three vying newspapers in Cleveland -- an intriguing story in itself -- along with the city's political machinations. The author retraces the shy girl's activities just before she disappeared and provides an exacting timeline of events. He talks about the public's reaction to the crime: Many helped in the search while crowds gathered in front of the family home to get a glimpse of the \\"gloomy house where tragedy struck.\\"The authorities tracked down all known sex offenders, drained a pond, sent divers into Lake Erie, did flyovers in planes and led basement-to-attic searches. They followed up on cryptic messages and false leads and even took calls from psychics and extortionists. As Badal says, the hoaxes ranged \\"from the merely stupid to the heartlessly cruel.\\"Decades after the crime, police were still investigating, interviewing serial killers and molesters. Even today there are a lot more questions than answers. The ordeal was so horrendous for Beverly's mother that she \\"died, quite literally of grief, in 1956,\\" says Badal.We tend to think of the abduction of children as a modern phenomenon, forgetting that it's always been a terrifying fact of life.I started this book knowing that the case was never solved and I still couldn't put it down. The details are positively haunting and the complex character studies make it easy to realize that these were real people who actually went through this ordeal, who truly lost their little girl. What in the world happened to her?"},{"Title":"Twilight of Innocence: The Disappearance of Beverly Potts","review":"I just finished reading Mr. Badal's account of the disappearance of Beverly Potts and I whole-heartedly recommend this book to anyone interested in true-crime unsolved mysteries. The author does an excellent job of synthesizing the newspaper accounts of the time with the surving police files dating back to the time of Beverly Potts' disappearance in 1951. Additionally, the author interviews a few of the key surviving people from the time period of the disappearance, including Ms. Potts' sister, Anita.Because this is an unsolved disapperance, inevitably the reader is left somewhat frustrated because of the lack of closure...just like Beverly's family and the countless others who have been involved with this case in the last half-century.If there is one criticism I have about the book is that there is no real original research by the author. The author states in the introduction that his intention was not to try and solve this case or make any bold guesses as to whodunit, and he stays faithful to this philosophy. However, I believe the unresolved nature of the topic demands that at least some theories regarding the disapparance are put forward and explored in more detail.I would definitely have liked to see more interviews with former neighbors, \\"witnesses\\" and surviving officers who worked on the case (or even their families) to try and provide more \\"off-the-record\\" information.The author also reveals that a large section of the official Cleveland police files were removed by a police detective who worked the case because he apparently had planned to pen his own memoirs about this case. The memoirs were never written, the detective is presumably deceased, and there is no mention of what ever became of the missing files. Somewhat frustratingly, the author does not reveal what attempts, if any, he made to track down these presumably important files.After reading the book, my own humble opinion/theory is that Beverly was likely abducted by a neighbor on Linett east of W. 117th. Her abduction by someone in a car does not seem as plausible. Given Beverly's apparent shy nature, it is likely that she was approached by someone she new and trusted who asked her to come onto his/her property momentarily for some seemingly innocent reason, and then took her against her will before she could cry out for help. Chillingly, the author relates that Anita Potts was told by a detective at the time who was investigating Beverly's disappearance (and who subscribed to this theory) that it was possible that Beverly's remains may one day be discovered after the homes in that area are bulldozed.Anyway, The book tops out at about 185 pages and is a very fast read. Even if you are not a native Clevelander you will still enjoy reading this book immensely."},{"Title":"Twilight of Innocence: The Disappearance of Beverly Potts","review":"\\"Twilight of Innocence-The Disappearance of Beverly Potts\\" is a well written, haunting account of the disappearance 10 year old Beverly Potts, who vanished on her way home from a festival in her neighborhood park in Cleveland, OH the night of Aug 24, 1951. I am not from Ohio but still found this book very interesting,and I find myself reading it again and again. Recently while on vacation with my family, we passed through Cleveland, and I decided to make the detour to see the park and neighborhood this story took place. One cannot realize how close everything is until one goes there.It is hard to believe that no one saw anything. Beverly did not have far to walk at all, and I agree with the theory that she was most likely abducted by a neighbor, and may very well be buried somewhere on that same street. I got quite an eerie feeling walking around the park, and looking at the home Beverly never made it back to that night. The author does a very good job of taking you though the story detail by detail, day by day. One can feel the anguish of her parents and sister,Anita, who graciously shared pictures and did interviews for this book.A quote by Patsy Swing, Beverly's best friend and one of the last people to see Beverly alive, has stayed with me and it still shows the pain Patsy feels. She said Beverly \\"was my very very best friend..\\"Even though the book ends without us knowing what happened to Beverly, I think we can make a very good guess and maybe someday, when the area is searched again and /or bulldozed, we just may get our answer.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in old unsolved missing persons cases.

I was 3 at the time of her kidnapping, we lived next door (in the duplex) and I was the little girl Beverly babysat (mentioned in the book) My parents often told me about her kidnapping and my mom told me that Beverly asked if she could take me up to Halloran Park for the Showagon. Being a overactive and bratty 3 year old, my mom told her I'd be too much of a handful for her. My parents are both gone now and I wish I was able to ask them more questions about it, because we lived next door to her for 3 more years after the kidnapping. Then we moved to W118th St. for 2 years than moved to Parma Heights. My mom's picture was in the paper with several of the neighbors cooking food to take over to the Potts home. We also had a photo of Beverly (the one in the book with her hair in braids) I found them recently when we were moving and that's what started me thinking about her.My husband and I were in the area over the weekend, so we drove by the house. It brought back a feeling of de javu'. Both of the houses are in pretty rough shape, as are most of the homes in that area because they are so old.I was glad to have read the book. I believe that she is with God and her parents - so there really is a happy ending."},{"Title":"Twilight of Innocence: The Disappearance of Beverly Potts","review":"I was born in Cleveland, Ohio and was 7 years old when Beverly Potts disappeared. I remember all of the parents warning us about coming home before dark, not talking to strangers or going with any strangers, or \\"you will end up like Beverly Potts.\\"So, when I saw this book I had to read it because Beverly's disappearance was a very integral part of my childhood. It is a comprehensive, well researched, well written account of a tragic incident that impacted many lives. If you are like me and are familiar with the case, this is a must read. If you are interested in unsolved mysteries this is also a must read."},{"Title":"Twilight of Innocence: The Disappearance of Beverly Potts","review":"\\"Twilight of Innocence\\" by James Jessen Badal, tells the story of the disappearance of 10-year old Beverly Rose Potts from a park in Cleveland, Ohio in 1951.Using police reports, newspaper articles, and eyewitness testimonies, Badal does a good job of establishing, as near as can be determined, a timeline and possible scenario(s) of the baffling mystery of Beverly's apparent kidnapping. What makes this story so compelling is the fact that, with so many people around, logic tells the reader that someone must have seen something, and yet to this day, not a single shred of physical evidence has turned up to explain what happened that dark night in August, 1951.At around 9:30 (or so) on the evening of Friday August 24, 1951, Beverly Potts was watching a vaudeville-type show in Halloran Park in Cleveland. These shows, called Showagons, were put on by local entertainers, and featured music and dancing. Beverly, being the daughter of former Vaudeville performers, was entranced by the show, and told her best friend Patsy Swing she wanted to stay until the end of the show. Patsy had to be home early, so she left before 9:30, walking the short distance alone back to the street where she and Beverly lived.From here, the story gets confusing. Several people claim they saw Beverly walking across the park toward Linnet Avenue where she lived (a distance of only a quarter mile or so). Some said they saw her alone, others claim they saw her stop to talk to some men in a black coupe with a loud muffler and bad paint job (one woman told police that she saw a young girl tied up in the back of a car driven by a man in his forties leaving the park, but this was never confirmed by any other witness).What makes this mystery so compelling is that, whatever happened to Beverly, it happened when there were several hundred people also leaving the park after the Showagon ended, and within shouting distance of her home. There was no apparent struggle, no screams or shouts, and little that aroused suspicion. It was as if Beverly was there one second, and gone without a trace the next.Badal keeps the action moving. He tells about numerous theories and false leads the police investigated (as well as the idiotic cranks and publicity seekers who made their jobs more difficult). Unfortunately, they were all dead ends. In the end, Bedel concedes, no one knows exactly what happened to Beverly.By far, the saddest aspect of the book is the effect her disappearance had on her family. While Beverly's older sister was able to pick up the pieces and live a normal life, Beverly's mother never got over her disappearance, and died five years later. Beverly's father lived until 1970, but one of the most touching parts of the book tells about a neighbor who was born after the event, who described Mr. Potts as \\"the lonely man who lived alone in the house on Linnet Avenue.\\"Badal floats many interesting theories about the crime, but unless or until a body is discovered, what really happened to Beverly Rose Potts will remain a sad, tragic mystery."},{"Title":"Twilight of Innocence: The Disappearance of Beverly Potts","review":"There is a tendency to idealize the distant past. Adults were trustworthy and children safe, and the vast majority of honest people were at very little risk as they went about their daily lives. All of these proved to be fatal assumptions on a long ago August night in Cleveland. In this book, James Badal takes on another unsolved crime and does his customary excellent job of marshalling the facts and then stepping aside to let the reader draw his own conclusion.Badal very effectively evokes a time and a place and the fabric of a neighborhood and a way of life that have changed beyond all recognition. His protagonist walks past us, in to the middle distance, and then vanishes before our eyes.After the passage of sixty years , will it ever be possible to find out how, and why ? This book may be as close as we ever get -"},{"Title":"Twilight of Innocence: The Disappearance of Beverly Potts","review":"In 1951, 10-year-old Beverly Potts mysteriously disappeared as she walked a couple of blocks from the neighborhood playground to her suburban home on Cleveland's West Side. Despite a vaudeville performance having drawn 1000 people to the park, including a number of Beverly's friends and neighbors, and despite the houses in her \\"safe\\" family-oriented neighborhood being close together and close to the street, nobody saw or heard Beverly disappear. Despite a massive police search and investigation, many leads, numerous \\"confessions\\" and intensive press coverage that continued until the Sam Sheppard murder case knocked it off the local front pages, no trace of Beverly was ever found. No abductor was ever identified, and over 60 years later what happened to her remains a mystery.Through meticulous research, author Badal has preserved a chapter of Cleveland history that was fading into the past. I was born on the West Side of Cleveland in 1963, grew up in the suburb next to Beverly Potts' hometown, and yet never heard of her, although my mother, who had moved to the area shortly before I was born, remembers being told about the case by the neighbors. I found it interesting how the daily life of kids in the summer in the early 50s wasn't all that different from what I remember about growing up in the 60s in that area. Kids played with the neighbor kids in yards or in each others' homes, rode their bikes to the park and hung out all day in a group, ran errands to the store for their parents, and, barring special permission, were expected to return home by a set time, usually dinner hour or when the sun started to go down. Apparently, when Beverly's disappearance became big news, children all over Cleveland suddenly found themselves watched like hawks by their parents and not allowed to go out of the house and roam around as freely, but as memories fade, kids return to their old ways. So much for the folks who claim that their childhoods were so safe and they played outside all day without a care in the world. As the story of Beverly (and of two other little girls who were similarly abducted around the same time in Cleveland, recounted as background in the book) shows, it has always been dangerous to be a kid - we just didn't hear so much about it on the national news or Nancy Grace back before children started appearing on milk cartons. Even the author recounts a personal story of how he was nearly snatched by strange men in a car from his home neighborhood of Shaker Heights when he was a kid there in the 50s. Shaker Heights in those days was a well-to-do area that likely would have been considered even safer than Beverly's more blue-collar suburb of West Park.However, despite the obvious effort put into its research, the book works less well as a true crime read. Its biggest problem is that no answers are ever given as to what happened to Beverly (other than that she was probably killed), and no suspect emerges as being particularly likely, or even more likely than the plethora of other suspects. Various people confess to the crime over the years, most of them not very credibly. The handful that either gave a credible confession or seemed otherwise to be strong possibilities are either dropped from the investigation due to lack of evidence, or dropped for unclear reasons that the existing police files don't explain. The book also reports on a huge number of leads by well-meaning members of the public as well as psychics, crackpots, abused women trying to frame their ex-husbands, and kids making up stories to get attention. (One imagines a modern broadcast of \\"America's Most Wanted\\" or \\"Nancy Grace\\" bringing all of the same types out of the woodwork and the burden on the investigators to sort through hundreds of tales in hopes of finding the truth.) In the end, the Beverly story goes nowhere - not resolved at all - her parents die and her sister moves away. The story seems unfinished, and perhaps will always be that way. But without more, such as an arrest or even a strong suspect, you simply don't have a compelling true crime book. For that reason, I don't recommend it to readers who are looking for that. The book is still worth a read if you're interested in Cleveland history or in how the police and community handled a high-profile missing child investigation in the early 50s."},{"Title":"Twilight of Innocence: The Disappearance of Beverly Potts","review":"Here are the known facts outlined in the book: In 1951, a 10 year old girl disappears from a crowded city park less than 2 blocks from her home. There are no eye witnesses to any crime. There is no crime scene. The body of Beverly Potts is never located. There were never any viable leads or credible suspects.I had one, albeit important, reservation prior to purchasing this book. Do the known facts support a full length book? Sadly, they do not. While there are some positive comments I can make about the book and its author, problems exist.There is no doubt that James Jessen Badal completed extensive research. His sources are meticulously documented at the end of each chapter and these chapter notes are sometimes as interesting as the primary text of the book. In addition, there is the inclusion of a helpful map and many, many interesting photographs spread throughout the text, a refreshing departure from the typical \\"center photo section\\" of most True Crime books. Finally, the author successfully imparts real feeling and sorrow for the victim and her surviving family members.However, there are some legitimate problems with this sad story. The first half of the book soon becomes boring and rather tedious as initial sightings and reports ultimatley lead nowhere. The second half of the book is somewhat more interesting simply because of the number of creeps, crooks, and cranks who either falsely confess to the abduction and murder of Beverly Potts or whose names are given to police investigators - sometimes years later - by embittered ex-wives or frightened female partners who long suspected their husband or boyfriend was the killer. And, while these individual suspects may be mildly interesting in and of themselves, the fact remains that no viable leads ever came from any of this information. Nothing plus nothing equals nothing.There are some theories presented about what may have happened to a little girl on her way home from a summer park gathering but, unlike some other reviewers, I found no theory any more credible than another. There simply is not enough information to even support intelligent conjecture. In the end, the reader is left with a flat, \\"cold\\" feeling about this cold case."},{"Title":"Twilight of Innocence: The Disappearance of Beverly Potts","review":"this book is so well written it feels like you are listening to a story from your own past"},{"Title":"Three minutes a day;: Christopher thoughts for daily living","review":"I found this old book at the Catholic school where I teach.

It surpasses anything previously written about the American equivalent of British music hall and will stand as the major reference work on the subject for many years to come.Given its scope, there are entries about entertainers whose names will mean nothing to the average British reader. But that is more than offset by the comprehensiveness the authors bring to all they touch. It is fascinating, for instance, to get an American take on British artistes who became big stars in the U.S., the likes of Vesta Victoria and Alice Lloyd. We learn more about such top-liners as Al Jolson and Danny Kaye and find the answers to all manner of questions. What was so special about Fanny Brice? What brought Sid Caesar's career to a halt? And who knew that the distinguished commentator, Walter Winchell, started out in vaudeville?The books' essays about burlesque and music hall are as good as you'll likely to get and the fine writing evinces some deft and delicate touches: a description of Beatrice Lillie, for instance, is as \\"a treasured English tea-rose with thorns\\" is spot on. The \\"new\\" in the title is no false promise. The encyclopedia is bang up-to-date with entries on Britain's Chris Simmons, for example.The extensive knowledge and deep love of vaudeville by the author, Frank Cullen [working with Florence Hackman and Donald McNeilly], shine through in each of these tomes' 1,300 magnificent pages.Richard Anthony Baker"},{"Title":"Vaudeville, Old and New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America, 2 volumes","review":"Frank Cullen, longtime publisher and head writer of the Vaudeville Times magazine, has finally published his 2 volume biographical encyclopedia of vaudeville. For those who don't know, vaudeville was the main form of live entertainment in America from 1880 to 1930 and it continued even as late at the 1960s. This book carefully catalogues who was who in vaudeville, tells the major reason they became famous or were important, and offers biographies and descriptions of everything connected with the subject.Along with the work of Professor Anthony Slide, these tomes by Frank Cullen constitute the most important documentation of this major form of American popular culture. Vaudeville is rapidly being forgotten today as its participants die off and younger audiences cannot even recognize the term. Cullen's work honors the performers and offers invaluable insights into what the experience was like.The book is well written and, like vaudeville itself, immensely entertaining, whether you are reading about familiar stars such as Al Jolson or the completely forgotten ones such as the great Eddie Leonard. There is nothing to complain about in this effort-- if you want to know all about vaudeville, this is the magnum opus. It is lavishly illustrated and has about it that aura of love and care that comes when a writer is totally engrossed in his subject matter and approaches it with honesty, integrity and admiration.Of course I have to tell you that I am biased because I'm in the book. I once was in \\"the show business\\" in vaudeville and there are only a few of us still alive who made it into the Cullen opus. But those of us who are left can assure you, dear reader, that all those vaudevillians who are encapsulated within would be proud of this book. It costs a good bit but it's got everything you need to know about a subject that once was close to the hearts of so many Americans. What's really fun is watching old movies on Turner, admiring the work of stars such as Eddie Cantor, Ruth Etting, or Trixie Friganza, and then keeping these volumes by your bed to look up the bios! Of course at my age that passes for high adventure! So, thanks, Frank, and good night Mrs. Calabash, wherever you are. If you know the meaning of that last phrase you'll love this book. If you don't you should read it anyway."},{"Title":"Vaudeville, Old and New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America, 2 volumes","review":"This is from my review published in \\"In The Groove\\" Magazine - April 2007Frank Cullen LOVES Vaudeville in all it's forms, whether it's the baggy pants comics of burlesque, the \\"specialty acts\\" like strongman or eccentric dancers who graced the stages of New York and around the circuits in the 1920s, or the singers who went on to make some of the most popular records of their day. This passion is obvious in the recent publication of the huge two-volume 1300-page compilation Vaudeville Old & New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America (Routledge). Now in his 70s, Cullen saw his first Laurel & Hardy film at the age of nine and was hooked. (Yes, Laurel and Hardy both appeared on the vaudeville stage early in their careers and Cullen devotes six pages to them.). He started reading and watching and listening in his high school years and had a brief acting career as well. In the mid-1980s he formed the American Vaudeville Museum in CT and began publishing the quarterly Vaudeville Times (which I mentioned here last year). Now relocated to New Mexico, Cullen has put his energies into this fascinating book. The peak years for \\"Vaudeville\\" were 1905-1925, with over 2,000 theaters around the US. As many as 50,000 performers were in the business during that period. Obviously, not all are in the book but a good mix of the known and the \\"lesser known\\" are here. Record collectors will recognize many of them. There are the recording Bakers (Belle, Josephine and Phil) as well as the Smiths (Mamie, Bessie and Kate). Other recording artists covered in much detail include, Eddie Cantor, Sissle & Blake and Moran & Mack. The performers are listed alphabetical from A (Abbott a& Costello) to Z (Zetts Weekly, a rival to Variety, published in 1921). There are sections devoted to each of the \\"circuits\\" and the impresarios as well. Photos of the performers and sheet music covers are on many pages. In fact, you'll find a lot of performers who you've only known from sheet music covers. The very handy Bibliography and a 30-page Index, make the book even more useful. Whether you start from the beginning and read it straight through, or use to look up an artist you found on a recording, you'll find this book a great resource. It's a tribute to the hard work and passion of the author.

How could the far more prominent Judy Garland vehicle, Ziegfeld Girl (MGM, 1941) be overlooked, where Al Shean reprised the number with Charles Winninger standing in for Gallagher? Also, in the Eddie Cantor entry, it's said that Cantor's film debut was a 1913 experimental film for Edison. Is this being confused with the 1922 experimental sound film Cantor did for inventor Lee De Forest (which isn't mentioned)? No reference book is perfect, but I just had to point this out. Plus, with the current popularity of the Jazz Singer DVD with all the Vitaphone shorts, I'm surprised that a consummate vaudeville performer like Adele Rowland isn't listed.

It didn't touch too much on offering's to the Lwa though, or invocations.Overall, it was a good book, just not quite what i was looking for, but an excellent addition to my VouDou Library."},{"Title":"The Book of Vodou","review":"Leah Gordon's photographs are beautiful and her commentary, for such a small book, captures the essence of Vodou quite well. Not a spellbook, not a book of practical advice and usage of Vodou, not a book with exercises you can use to help you really understand the religion (for all of the latter I recommend VODOU SHAMAN by Ross Heaven), more an overview of what Vodou is about written for people who are unfamiliar with it - and illustrated very nicely.It occurs to me actually that both of these books (The Book of Vodou and Vodou Shaman) are really well written for a Western audience and probably a very good starting point if you want to know more about this fascinating spiritual practice."},{"Title":"The Book of Vodou","review":"This is an excellent resource for people just starting out in the religion.

The words that the author created ends the stereotype of a &quot;Black Man&quot; being unfeeling or compassionate. The writer put his emotions and thoughts together to create a cry with words.

When I read the poem &quot;Work of Art&quot;, the words came alive on the page. I see myself through the beauty of the author's words. A think all of his poems were rated above average. The writer helps the reader remember the meaning of home, love, friends, community, joy, and sorrow. I think he took his thoughts, feelings, emotions and twisted them together to produce his own &quot;Work of Art&quot;. One of my favorite poems in this book is &quot;Hope&quot;.

But even after five years, Tess knows she still loves him. So she allows herself one night in his arms. But that one night only makes her want Nick more. As a lover--and now as the father of their baby!\\"Dear Santa\\" by Margaret St. GeorgeAmy and Flash know that parents are supposed to live together. Theirs don't.

So the children decide to take matters to a higher court--they write a letter to Santa!\\"Three Waifs and a Daddy\\" by Margot DaltonDr. Sarah Burnard has seduced Jameson Kirkland Fleming IV. Now she's pregnant--according to plan. But she's not going to marry him. Then Sarah and Jim stumble upon three orphans, and Sarah discovers that Ellie, Billy and Arthur have plans of their own. The kids want a mother and a father. By Christmas!And my review:I was really excited to buy this book. While all of these stories are reissues, I had never read any of them before. This collection includes two of my favorite authors - Dallas Schulze and Margaret St. George aka Maggie Osborne. Also, this book is almost 650 pages long, which means that each story is much longer than the usual novella length you find in anthologies. But I was disappointed.\\"A Christmas Marriage\\" was just an average, if somewhat annoying read. I felt that the reasons that Tess left were weak. And the fact that she left him without any explanation was terribly childish. If you have fears, then you should discuss them with your husband, not just run out on them. And then, she refused to tell him about the baby - he had to find out himself. I could understand her wanting to know that he came back to her because he loved her, but still, the man had a right to hear that he was going to be a father from the mother of his child. I wouldn't bother re-reading this one. Three stars.\\"Dear Santa\\" had many of the elements you like to see in a story, but they just didn't feel very well pulled together. I found the heroine's negative attitude towards her pregnancy to be kind of a downer. Yes, I know some women feel fat and awkward, but did the author really have to dwell on that so much? The children were pretty much flat plot devices, not well-rounded characters. Though the reasons that they were getting divorced were valid, I felt that it took the heroine forever to get her head screwed on right. And I wanted to scream at the heroine to stop drinking alcohol during pregnancy! I know this story was written in 1989, but I still find that inexcusable. People knew the dangers, even back then. All in all, this story just dragged, and it was hard to push myself to finish it. Three stars.\\"Three Waifs and a Daddy\\" I skimmed and skipped. From reading the back cover description, I thought I would find it offensive, and I was right. I don't find relationships built on lies, manipulation, or trickery to be at all romantic. How on earth could I like a woman who tricks a man into fathering her baby? Disgusting! Funny, but if a man was the one tricking a woman into becoming pregnant with his child, women everywhere would be screaming for his blood! How is it okay when a woman is doing it? No stars for this piece of trash.I love Christmas romance anthologies, but this one was not worth my time or money. If you want a good anthology, I recommend \\"A Country Christmas\\" released by Signet, with authors Emily Bradshaw, Jodi Thomas and Karen Harper, amoung others, available used at Amazon.com"},{"Title":"Christmas Delivery","review":"***** A Christmas Marriage by Dallas Schulze.An excellent example of why I enjoy Dallas's books so much. She writes straightforward romance, takes the cliches and tilts them, just a bit, to make them fresh. A reunion story, one of my favorite types. A divorced couple reunites. She'd asked for the divorce because she was afraid of losing her identity, and has to learn to balance a relationship with being her own person.**** Dear Santa by Margaret St. George.Perfect example of \\"never say never\\". I still maintain that in general, kids do not belong in romance novels. But this one works. A separated couple with two kids and one on the way, with seemingly irreconcilable differences. He's a workaholic investment banker, and so was she, until they had children. Now they have plenty of money, and she wants to move back to her hometown to give the kids a more relaxed life. He wants things to stay the same in Los Angeles. He takes a long-overdue vacation and comes to stay with them in hopes of a reconciliation, while she's fallen into the workaholic trap in her new job. The role reversal causes both of them to reevaluate. The characters are very, very real.**** Three Waifs and a Daddy by Margot Dalton.This one gets docked a bit because I kept being concerned about the legality--I'm not sure how plausible the scenario was. Also, the title made me cringe. But aside from that, it's another excellent story. A scientist (I love brainy heroines!) wants a baby and has chosen the perfect father--an ex-football player. They have a one-night stand on a night when she's determined her chances for conception were greatest, and on the way back from the motel, they're mugged by a kid who's trying to take care of his younger siblings. She wants to avoid further involvement with him, fearing he &/or his family will try to claim her baby, but can't resist the kids who he's taken under his wing. Lots about family dynamics and loneliness."},{"Title":"Use This Book!: The Only Book You'll Ever Need","review":"Many non-fiction books contain practical information, but have you ever seen one that you can actually use?

All of the stories are good, but his and Arabella's is the best. Typical DP story - the heroine is a younger virginal type and the hero is 15 years older than her and only dates experienced women. He makes a big deal out of her being younger and being innocent because he had a bad experience with a virginal girlfriend accusing him of hurting her when he was younger. He is a big man (though only 6'4\\", I think), so he feels like he has to be in control when he is with a woman. Arabella scares him because she makes him feel like no other woman ever has. He is cruel to her to try to get her to back off, but when she gets engaged to a young doctor, he realizes he loves her and will do whatever it takes to get her back - even overcome his hangups!!Donovan's story is good, too. He moved off from the ranch he and his brothers own after losing his wife. He is working for the heroine, Pepi's father. He has a habit of getting drunk to erase his painful memories and Pepi always has to get him out of scrapes and take care of him. During one of these drunken episodes, he insists that they marry at a Mexican chapel. The next day he doesn't remember and Pepi is scared to tell him. When he finds out, he is madder than h@ll, but eventually forgives her and falls in love.Harden is a hardhearted soul - he can't forgive his mother because she left her husband for a while and had him with another man - so, he is the middle child but doesn't have the same father as Evan and Donovan. He treats all women bad because of this and treats his mother the worst of all. The heroine changes his opinion of women overall and helps him heal his relationship with his mother."},{"Title":"Men of the West: Harden/ Evan/ Donavan","review":"HardenThe story of Harden was an o.k. story, but I felt it started too abruptly and unrealistically. It never really fleshed out Harden or the romance between the two main characters. Miranda said she was normally a strong and independent person, but that was never shown in the book. I prefer my heroines with a little spine, they don't have to be the strongest, but it's nice for them not to be so weak. Like I said before she was too naive, especially being married before, even if it wasn't an ideal marriage. Also talking to his mother about their relationship and the attraction was a little unrealistic too.2.5/5EvanHaving only read about Evan in the previous book, Harden, I was looking forward to reading his story. In the beginning I was surprised at how cruel he was to Anna, I could understand it somewhat, but it was just a little too harsh to take sometimes. However it got better towards the middle of the story and I could get over that. I was a bit surprised that he was only 6'4, which I know isn't short, but I always imagined he was taller since he had such a hangup about his size, like around 6'7 or so. Some minor things bothered me some, like the way he woke her up from her coma, which was unbelievable, as well as her talking to her mother about sex so candidly. I never would have talken to my mother about those things so openly. =P Still the chemistry between the two was sizzling to say the least and I was left feeling that it was a good story with a good ending and I enjoyed it immensely even with the little flaws. It was nice to have a heroine with more spine in this story!4/5DonovanThis is a decent story and while I liked both of the characters well enough, it just wasn't great. It started off good, then lagged, but towards the end it picked up more. I can't say much bad about it and I can't say anything too good about, just an average read that some may like more than others. Still there's some cute stuff nearer the end and it's a fine lil read. :)3/5 starsWhile I usually like Diana Palmer, I was a little disappointed in these stories. They seemed in some ways too unbelievable, even for romantic fiction. The heroines were for the most part too naive to be believed, even if the stories were written 14 years ago. One of the things that bothered me probably the most is the phrase \\"little one\\", how many time can you use it? Sometimes it's fine and fits into the story, but way overused, as it is in all three of these stories. Still I find it refreshing that Diana Palmer writes stories with morals, like waiting until marriage to have sex, etc. It was still an enjoyable read, and I recommend it only for if you want a little light reading or if you're a die-hard Diana Palmer fan.Overall: 3.5 stars"},{"Title":"Men of the West: Harden/ Evan/ Donavan","review":"I read one of Diana Palmer books in the past and didn't particularly care for the hero in the story. I figured I would give her another shot. All 3 of these stories along with the previous one read makes me realize that I can't abide her heroes.

I did like these three stories though.This collection was one of several I had never read before and was glad to have discovered. It's an easy non-thinker that includes 3 different stories that were originally published as seperate books. Evan and Harden Tremayne are two of the three stories and Donovan Langley is the third story.I think that the Tremayne brothers' stories are all very entertaining (just like the Hart brothers) But if you want to read about C.C. Tremayne you will have to read a different collection (why the 3 were not together in this book) because Connal is not found in this book - it's in The Texan's at Heart Collection (or by itself as originally published) so if you read the two stories of the Tremayne brothers (Evan & Harden) in this book then make sure to read about Connal too."},{"Title":"Men of the West: Harden/ Evan/ Donavan","review":"This is a reissue anthology of three classic Diana Palmer Long Tall Texans stories.

This doesn't necessarily mean that his early novels aren't enjoyable (with the exception of The Wanton of Argus [1953]) but the don't have the special Brunner quality which is found in the late 60s and 70s with such classics asStand on ZanzibarandThe Sheep Look Up. With early Ace paperbacks like The World Swappers (1959), the story is condensed into a readable 153 pages and exhibits a hurried yet dense plot.Rear cover synopsis:\\"The galaxy was caught in the crushing vice of a struggle for power. The political titans of the planets of mankind were making their bids for supremacy. The contestants: Counce, a man of strange powers, authority in the spheres of the intellect; and Bassett, a man of money-power, financial and business wizard. As the association of human worlds drew near the teetering edge of internal revolutions, one of these men would be in a position to triumph. The only thing that neither side could foresee was that there were others hovering among the stars, looking for new worlds to conquer!\\"Counce is a man of many mysterious resources. The inventor of the transfax three hundred years earlier, the technology is only available to him and his band of intellectual cohorts who are too secretive for any proper title. Able to leap parsecs, infiltrate FTL spaceships, and transport stellar plasma, the teleportation device is also the key to his longevity. If he or one of his cohorts were to be killed, a new yet different body is prepared for them with the data sent from their previous transmission. Counce's influence reaches farther than the earthly domain.Earth has been cleared of \\"misfits and malcontents\\" and the banished persons were shipped off to the thirty-one habitable planets in the surrounding 200 parsecs of space. One planet of such named Ymir was the first to be settled but little did they realize that the planet was entering a glacial period. Stubborn and proud, the people of Ymir endure the three hundred years freeze with reluctant acceptance of aid. One Ymirian, Jaroslav Dubin, acted as ambassador to Earth and resided in the decadent city of Rio; now his earthly pleasures are known to all Ymirians and their ultra-conservative mentality abhor his being. Jaroslav also now acts as a Ymirian secret agent for Counce's transfax fealty.Counce's group realizes that humans aren't accepting enough to integrate other planetary colonial cultures, so they understand that contact with the Others must be avoided. The alien race, outside of the human sphere of colonization, are discovered to have once visited the human planet Regis and are now headed to the planet Ymir. With the aid of the transfax and a menagerie of magnificent minds, the group intercepts the spacecraft in-flight and transfaxes it to the surface of Regis. Their plans for peaceful contact are interrupted by the violent rebuttal of the Others' weapons. The lone alien survivor, Friend, is fostered by Counce so that a mutual between species understanding can be settled.Seeing that Ymir is unfit for human habitation yet ideal for an Others colony, Counce uses his age-wizened mind to manipulate Bassett's lust for control of all the colonies so that mankind can avoid contact with the Others and for both races to get what they want. Bassett is cautious of the manipulation but is unable to penetrate Counce's deeper plans for power and peace.On the surface, it looks like the plot is about the classic case of the good guys duping the bad guys. However, while Counce is indeed a classic \\"good guy\\" with cool technology and the brains to match, the seeming nemesis Bassett is more like Counce's unknowing pawn, an easily malleable commodity to benefit Counce's agenda. Even the aliens aren't seen as \\"bad guys\\" through the eyes of Counce, but the hostile actions of the Others is seen as a miscommunication. And since the eighteen deaths experienced by Counce's clique were all recoverable due to their transfax data, no deaths were permanent except for the deaths of the aliens themselves. (Could they have been recovered too since they were teleported to the planet by the telefax?)Counce sets lofty goals onto his organization's shoulders. He has set out to protect humankind from itself--to postpone their confrontation with aliens--because how could they get along with a race not even remotely similar to their own when they shun even the customs of other human planets. Counce acts on behalf of no Earth government or interplanetary government... the buck stops at Counce. He could be seen as a pretentious deductionist or a benevolent phantom dictator, but his treatment of the frozen and famished people of Ymir is a little shocking. Counce basically bullies the stubborn government through refusal of dire aid, where the society eventually give into their misplaced pride and hunger \\"when a half-eaten child's body was found on the street.\\" (130) That's pretty grim for a 1959 novel. With the downfall of a small planetary society, it is hard to invest sympathy into Counce's self-professed benevolent actions.The technology of the transfax is the major fulcrum to the plot. If you can believe (1) that one man invented the technology and withheld its existence from the public for three hundred years, (2) that each person who has come across the same mathematics for the transfax becomes subsumed into Counce's organization, and (3) that the transfax can perform amazing feats, then the fulcrum of the entire plot may be a bit more stomachable. It's not major flaw, but the lofty idealization of future technology is often the only fulcrum to earlier novels while serving up ample opportunity to gouge holes in the plot... too many \\"what-ifs\\" spring to mind.For my nineteenth Brunner book, this was a joy to experience some of his earlier non-Interstellar Empire work. With ten more unread Brunner books on my shelves, ranging from 1965 (The Day of the Star Cities) to 1980 (Players at the Game of People), I continue to look forward to experience the wealth of science fiction Brunner penned for nearly four decades!"},{"Title":"The world swappers","review":"Two powerful interstellar magnates vie for control of human-controlled space in this early (1959) John Brunner novel. This is the only novel of Brunner's that I've read, but I have to assume that he improved considerably later since he produced two very highly regarded novels, \\"The Sheep Look Up\\" and \\"Stand on Zanzibar.\\" This book is a bit of fluff that displays all of the worst traits of Golden Age science fiction--a nave faith in the ability of extraordinary individuals (invariably scientists) to engineer the optimum human destiny, and a maddening tendency toward endless exposition delivered through interminable conversations. The hero, Counce, subjects people to horrendous fates, including starvation and torture, all in the name of a greater good--and they love him for it later. I don't think this novel has ever been reprinted (I came across it in a used book store), and I can understand why."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Electronic Trading Futures: Everything You Need to Start Trading On Line","review":"I loved that book!

A chronic invalid, he also needed adventure. He decided to do some travel writing and one such trip is recounted in TRAVELS WITH A DONKEY. He headed off to the remote Cevennes mountain range of south central France and got himself kitted out nicely, so nicely, he needed assistance in carrying everything. Enter Modestine, a donkey. He might as well have attempted to harness and pack up a cat. Thus, to a deft narrative that works in powerful landscape description, sketches of country folk met along the way, and a revisiting of the region's dramatic history, he adds the self-deprecating wit that would become a model for his 20th century counterparts like Peter Fleming, Eric Newby, and Bill Bryson. Though his commentary moves along at a swift but casual gait, it builds a tension on the upside, beginning with the age-old legend of the murderous Beast of Gevaudan that haunts a neighborhood where he finds the peasantry by turns hostile and friendly and accommodations primitive. Near the summit, a visit to a monastery introduces the religious theme that will attend his descent into the beautiful land of the Camisards, the friction between Protestants and Catholics that erupted into a tragic civil war in the first decade of the 18th century. Stevenson does a fine job of sorting out the history and evoking the awe that comes with visiting the deceptively bucolic scene. No wonder this book has continued to inspire: it often appears on recommended lists and it prompted Romantic biographer Richard Holmes to retrace the journey early in his career, a century later, complete with a donkey of his own (see his book FOOTSTEPS). The critical introduction to this edition is worthwhile."},{"Title":"Travels with a donkey in the Cevennes, (The biographical edition of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson)","review":"R.L. Stevenson writes here the first account of a touristic journey in France. He is the first modern tourist. He penetrates and discovers the country and the people of what he calls the Loz&egrave;re, this mountain range in the south of The Central mountains in France, a range of mountains that was the locale of a protestant rebellion at the very beginning of the eighteenth century, severely repressed by Louis XIV. These protestant insurgers are known as the Camisards. Stevenson tries to discover the landscape, the natural setting of this insurrection and tries to show how the insurrection was connected to the very nature of these mountains. He also shows how no repression can change a person or a population. These old Camisards are still alive in the memory and the customs and ways of the protestant population of this region. It is the survival of this faith that interests and fascinates Stevenson. He also notices that the catholics and the protestants, at the time of his travels, lived in harmony but with an absolute divide between the two communities. A young catholic man who married a protestant girl and changed his faith in the process was unanimously condemned for this breach of loyalty. This book is also a perfect example of what tourism can and must be : the discovery of the visited people's mentality, culture, way of life, and the connection of these with the surrounding nature, and not only a quick look at monuments and other (un)perishable. One has to live with the people, no matter how little, to eat the people's food and to be in contact with the people in order to discuss general and particular subjects and to understand their way of thinking and behaving. Thus tourism becomes an adventure even in the heart of the most civilized country and only a couple of miles away from a railroad.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Travels with a donkey in the Cevennes, (The biographical edition of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson)","review":"Apparently, Amazon is selling a Kindle version of Penguin edition.

Stevenson's hilarious account of his laborious travails with his relentlessly stubborn and self-willed but completely lovable donkey, Modestine, is both laughable and utterly charming. His recounting of the preparation of his equipment, most notably his sleeping bag, in preparation for that 12 day 120 mile trek is absolutely fascinating, particularly for a fan of lightweight wilderness camping in all four seasons. His mellifluous and detailed description of the rugged and often barren local topography is clear and concise and his narratives of the history and the sociology of the region that he has chosen for his long distance walk are meshed absolutely seamlessly with the anecdotes of his interactions with the locals along the route. Highly recommended for readers that enjoy literature in the travel genre.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Travels with a donkey in the Cevennes, (The biographical edition of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson)","review":"Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes (1878) is among the earliest published works of Robert Louis Stevenson, and yet it is in no way inferior to his later writing that established his fame. In fact, this delightful account of Stevenson's solo trek in the Cevennes Range in south central France ranks among the best travel literature in the nineteenth century.Wishing not to advertise that he would be camping alone in remote areas, he chose not to travel with a tent. Instead, he designed a sleeping sack some six feet square, made of green water-proof cart cloth without and blue sheep's fur within. This commodious bed was too heavy to carry, and thus Stevenson acquired a donkey, one Modestine.Stevenson and Modestine for twelve days were close companions, traveling some 120 miles over several mountain ridges, along rocky roads, and even through boggy marshes. The stubborn Modestine was never quite convinced that the journey was entirely worth the effort, but nonetheless Stevenson and Modestine eventually became fast friends.Stevenson actually found lodging most nights, including a stint at a monastery, Our Lady of the Snows, allowing him not only to sleep more comfortably, but to share meals with strangers. Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes is as much about the people Stevenson encountered as about his adventuresome travels through this remote region of France. My only criticism of this short account, a little more than one hundred pages, is that it is not twice as long.Stevenson was familiar with the history of the Cevennes, especially the Protestant-Catholic strife under Louis XIV that eventually resulted in a Protestant rebellion in 1702. With the passage of nearly two hundred years, the Protestants and Catholics were now living peacefully together, although these two peoples seldom mixed socially and intermarriages were quite rare. Stevenson himself was Protestant, and while staying at the monastery his hosts made sincere efforts to convert him to the Catholic faith.The young Robert Louis Stevenson was a rare individual that truly enjoyed life, one that was continually fascinated with his chanced acquaintances. Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes is delightful and amusing, but at the same time it is equally successful as a thoughtful examination of the people of the Cevennes, isolated by both mountainous geography and a minority religion."},{"Title":"Travels with a donkey in the Cevennes, (The biographical edition of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson)","review":"In the fall of 1878, the then-twenty-seven-year-old Robert Louis Stevenson found himself alone in France, abandoned by the woman he loved, who had returned to America and her estranged husband. Lonely and depressed, RLS decided to take a walking tour through the highlands of the C&eacute;vennes. For twelve days he hiked 120 miles through a rugged, wooded, sparsely populated land. He then wrote a short account of that trek. Published in 1879, it was, excepting ephemera, Stevenson's second published book and it became a minor classic, among the first of the genre of literary travel-writing.Not confident that he would be able to find nightly accommodations for sleeping during his journey, RLS had a \\"sleeping-sack\\" custom-made for his trip. It proved too cumbersome for him to carry, so he bought a donkey to be his sherpa and traveling companion. Diminutive, unprepossessing, and mouse-brown, she was christened Modestine, and, charmingly, she made her way into the title of RLS's account of the trip: TRAVELS WITH A DONKEY. (A gilt portrait of Modestine adorns the front cover of my copy of the first American edition of the book, from 1879.)Initially, RLS thought he would simply let Modestine set her own pace: \\"What that pace was, there is no word mean enough to describe; it was something as much slower than a walk as a walk is slower than a run; it kept me hanging on each foot for an incredible length of time; in five minutes it exhausted the spirit and set up a fever in all the muscles of the leg.\\" And that proved to be just the beginning of RLS's vexations with Modestine. A good part of the book is devoted to the trials and tribulations of their partnership, yet at the end of the journey RLS confesses to shedding a tear over their parting.Much of the book, of course, is the usual fare of a travel book -- a description of the territory traversed (in this case forests, gorges, massifs, and vistas) and the towns and people encountered. RLS handles this much more engagingly than many from the succeeding generations of travel writers.Yet another topic has to do with religious factionalism. RLS himself was a \\"heretic\\", but he had been raised a Presbyterian, steeped in the traditions of the wars between the Scottish Covenanters and a Catholic monarchy. The C&eacute;vennes had been the mountain redoubt of the Camisards or Huguenots, and thus it had been the site of religious persecution and rebellion. RLS is sensitive to this setting of religious conflict and he gently mocks the very notion of one true faith: \\"Thus, to the high entertainment of the angels, do we pelt each other with evangelists, like schoolboys bickering in the snow.\\" Several times during his journey RLS becomes engaged in discussions of religious matters, and he steadfastly projects an ecumenical approach to life. When met by an old man who revealed himself to be a fundamentalistic Plymouth Brother, RLS writes: \\"Of what that involves in the way of doctrine I have no idea nor the time to inform myself; but I know right well that we are all embarked upon a troublesome world, the children of one Father, striving in many essential points to do and to become the same.\\"Overall, a century and a third later, TRAVELS WITH A DONKEY is on the quaint side, but nonetheless it is enchanting. Stevenson's prose is marvelous. But what is best and most memorable about the book is the good humor, magnanimity, and open-armed humanity of its author.TRAVELS WITH A DONKEY is perhaps most famous for Stevenson's expression of the credo of a certain breed of traveler. In response to the rhetorical question of why anyone would desire to visit certain small villages of the C&eacute;vennes, RLS writes: \\"I travel not to go anywhere, but to go. I travel for travel's sake. The great affair is to move; to feel the needs and hitches of our life more nearly; to come down off this feather-bed of civilisation, and find the globe granite underfoot and strewn with cutting flints.\\""},{"Title":"Travels with a donkey in the Cevennes, (The biographical edition of the works of Robert Louis Stevenson)","review":"RLS's covering note to Sidney Colvin contains one of the most profound philosophies with regard to our metaphorical travel through life - that of finding an honest friend.

The theory is that they were mostly written by a man named Edward de Vere, who was the contemporary Earl of Oxford. Like most such ideas, this theory is considered &quot;controversial&quot; by those who believe it, and &quot;a lot of hooey&quot; by those who don't. Eleanor Brewster's interesting book takes the position that the theory is in fact true, and she marshalls an endlessly tantalizing array of known facts, about the women who figured prominently in Edward de Vere's life, to support her contention. She argues that these known, historical, female figures provided the source material for many of the women in &quot;Shakespeare's&quot; plays. She is able to assemble a great deal of material to support her ideas, because most of these women lived some of the most thoroughly documented lives of their time. This is the case because they were considered to be at the very pinnacle of Elizabethan society -- indeed, Queen Elizabeth herself is accorded one of the most interesting chapters in the book. As this theory gains ground in our universities, as I personally believe that it is destined to do, Eleanor Brewster's innovative book can provide a fascinating window into the problem. After all, what greater source of inspiration does any creative person have, than the women in their life??? That would be... none.This book is laid out as follows. First, there is a helpful introduction, which lays out Brewster's essential claims. She provides useful, carefully compiled information here, to suitably prepare the minds of readers who may not be conversant with the basic de Vere theory. Don't skip the introduction, if you aren't a de Vere buff. It also provides information to help the reader visualize the setting of the Elizabethan period.After the introduction, Brewster walks us through careful descriptions of the lives, and personae, of the women in de Vere's life. We learn about his mother; his sister; his unhappy first wife; Queen Elizabeth; his mistress; his second wife; and his daughters. Each person is given a chapter, and we see over and over again the range of references in &quot;Shakespeare's&quot; plays which seem to refer to these women. It's usually pretty convincing, frankly. Now and then I feel like Brewster might be reaching a little, in her enthusiasm over the topic, but not often. She does a lot of very impressive detective work here.The book concludes with sections about Shakespeare's First Folio, and with some issues raised by the known portraits of Shakespeare and of de Vere. There is a very useful bibliography for further reading. Also, each chapter concludes with a subject-specific bibliography, which is often quite useful.People who are interested in this subject need to know about the original book that put forward the basic theory. This book was &quot;Shakespeare&quot; Identified as the Seventeenth Earl of Oxford,&quot; by J. Thomas Looney, published in 1920. Please don't be too put off by Looney's last name (ha ha) -- his ideas are sane, lucid, and compelling. This idea is sort of depressing to me in many ways -- one likes to think of Shakespeare as an untutor'd genius who simply made up all the plays based on trips to a local library of some kind. Well, for examples of that kind of genius, there are always scientific geniuses like Ben Franklin, Einstein, or Edison! Sadly, Eleanor Brewster has convinced me that Shakespeare can't be counted among their ranks. Oh well. This is still a great book, however, and I give it two thumbs up."},{"Title":"Just Grandma and Me (Look-Look)","review":"Having purchased several Little Critter books years ago, I was disappointed at how flimsy the book cover was.

Addressing the reader in personable Victorian fashion, his prose is clear and beautiful. Consider this sample:&quot;Within the verge of the wood there were columbines, looking more pale than red, because they were so modest, and had thought proper to seclude themselves too anxiously from the sun. There were wild geraniums, too, and a thousand white blossoms of the strawberry. The trailing arbutus was not yet quite out of bloom; but it hid its precious flowers under the last year's withered forest-leaves, as carefully as a mother-bird hides its little young ones.&quot;But Hawthorne is also equal to the task of less genteel, more vigorous images:&quot;At this sound the three heads reared themselves erect, and belched out great flashes of flame. Before Bellerophon had time to consider what to do next, the monster flung itself out of the cavern and sprung straight toward him, with its immense claws extended, and its snaky tail twisting itself venomously behind.&quot;Adding to the pleasure of these retold tales is the gorgeous art of Arthur Rackham, both in black-and-white drawings and full-color plates, which captures the unearthly beauty and the unexpectedly surprising humor of Hawthorne's work. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"A wonder-book for girls and boys (Riverside literature series)","review":"Once upon a time (I was about 8), a family friend handed down his Collier's Junior Classic series to me - each volume is a glorious hodgepodge of short stories from here, there, and everywhere. I got to be very fond of Greek mythology, especially \\"The Chimaera\\" and \\"The Miraculous Pitcher\\", since the Collier retellings of their respective legends were much more lively than the ordinary.Alas, I forgot the name of the author of \\"The Chimaera\\", and even that my favourite versions of the myths were all written by the same person. Some talented guy writing for the series, no doubt, I would have said, if I'd thought about it. A couple of years ago, I started browsing through an impressive-looking illustrated volume of mythology in a bookstore (which you now see before you). Whoa. \\"Scarlet Letter\\" Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote *THESE*?His retellings of Greek myths were originally spread over 2 volumes (the other being _Tanglewood Tales_), but they can be obtained in a single volume these days. I can personally do without the gang of Tanglewood kids providing the official audience for the stories-within-a-story, or the defense against critics put into the mouth of the storyteller Eustace Bright, but then I want more space for more myths. :) Each myth in _A Wonder Book_ has an Introductory and After the Story section where the storyteller leads up to the tale, then fends off any awkward questions from his young audience.\\"The Gorgon's Head\\" - The story of Perseus, from his infancy through the quest for Medusa's head. Hawthorne skates delicately past the question of who put Perseus and his mother, Danae, in a chest and abandoned them on the sea, let alone why (toned down for kids, and all that), and of course doesn't go into detail about what mischief Polydectes might intend if Perseus can be got out of the way.Hawthorne is otherwise thorough about details: he even includes the Three Gray Women, who share the use of a single eye, who had to be persuaded to reveal the location of the monsters whose gaze turns living creatures to stone.\\"The Golden Touch\\" - The Midas legend, of how a king, blinded by a love of gold, foolishly asked Apollo that he be given the gift of turning things into gold with a touch. Be careful what you ask for...\\"The Paradise of Children\\" - The story of Pandora's box. Hawthorne's version, much as I like his other mythological tales, has been prettified a little too much: everyone in the world was a child who never grew up, before the box arrived.\\"The Three Golden Apples\\" - The 11th labour of Hercules, wherein the king sent him to fetch the apples of the Hesperides. The tale begins with Hercules meeting a band of nymphs, who hear his account (only briefly summarized, alas) of his preceding labours before directing him to the one person who can direct him to the garden: the Old Man of the Sea...\\"The Miraculous Pitcher\\" - Philemon and his wife Bauchis have grown old together - the only kindly folk living for a good way around a prosperous village, whose inhabitants delight in tormenting vagabonds (although they'll fawn on wealthy-looking strangers). Then one day a ragged youth called Quicksilver and a taciturn man with an appearance of great wisdom are driven out of the village...\\"The Chimaera\\" - Bellerophon's pursuit of Pegasus, whom he seeks because only in the air does he have a chance of killing the monstrous chimaera. Bellerophon's long wait beside the fountain of Pirene, where Pegasus descends to drink, is enlivened by several characters living round about: an old man who can't even remember his glory days, an overly timid maiden who'd run from anything unusual, a yokel who only appreciates plowhorses, and a little boy (the only one who really believes in Pegasus)."},{"Title":"A wonder-book for girls and boys (Riverside literature series)","review":"In the spring of 1851 Hawthorne wrote to his publisher, James Fields (of the renowned Ticknor and Fields), proposing a children's book retelling six well-known stories from Greek mythology. He planned to adopt \\"a tone in some degree Gothic or romantic.\\" In addition, he wanted to make the fables suitable for young Christian children: \\"of course, I shall purge all the old heathen wickedness, and put in a moral wherever practicable.\\"I am usually not a fan of sanitized tales--even when written by someone the status of Nathaniel Hawthorne. But, in spite of their overt preachiness and their occasional preciousness, there's something charming and original about these adaptations. Even adults might enjoy these six tales: Perseus's slaughter of Medusa, Midas and his golden touch, Pandora's box (stripped of Prometheus's role), the apples of the Hesperides (or Hercules's Eleventh Labor), Baucis and Philemon and the magic pitcher (which, in my opinion, is the best of the lot), and Bellerophon and Pegasus's battle with the monster Chimaera.Threading these stories together is Eustace Bright, Hawthorne's college-age narrator, who relates his versions to a gaggle of local children (a couple of whom taunt him for his bumptiousness). Hawthorne uses this framing device to insert himself as his own critic. Overhearing one of the stories, the father of one of the children is not amused, finding Eustace's taste \\"altogether Gothic\\" and advising him \\"never more to meddle with a classical myth.\\" To this critique, Eustace petulantly responds that \\"an old Greek had no more right to them, than a modern Yankee has,\\" and he accuses classical writers of forming these tales \\"into shapes of indestructible beauty, indeed, but cold and heartless.\\" If anything, Hawthorne has certainly brought warmth to these old stories.Still, the reading level might be a tall order for many children under 8 (although an adult can adapt them for reading out loud). Hawthorne sprinkles his prose with salutatory references to his real-life neighbors in the Berkshires (there's even a line about Melville writing \\"Moby Dick\\") and with puns and quips that have lost their context. And he gets carried away with his descriptions of the countryside. Hawthorne's evocative passages will surely strike modern readers as hopelessly old-fashioned, although the author realized that he was trying the patience of children even from his own day. After three florid and nearly insufferable paragraphs describing a meadow, for example, Hawthorne apologetically interrupts himself that \\"we must not waste our valuable pages with any more talk about the spring-time and the wild flowers. There is something, we hope, more interesting to be talked about.\\"What's more interesting, of course, are the stories of Greek gods and monsters and flying horses. Fortunately for readers young and old, Hawthorne mostly stays away from the scenery and sticks to the legends."},{"Title":"A wonder-book for girls and boys (Riverside literature series)","review":"One day last week, I could not, even after hours of deliberation (the snow had made engagements scarce), decide what book to read next. I finally came upon this little volume on the end of my parent's bookshelf and decided to give it try. How could I have known what charms were in store? I felt like a little girl again, and as Eustace Bright, the ambitious college student who narrates these tales, held his little auditors in awe, my eyes, too, were wide with wonder. It truly is a &quot;wonder book,&quot; full of high fantasy, thrilling action, and the inimitable imagery of a master. Though geared towards &quot;boys and girls,&quot; Hawthorne explains in his introduction that &quot;children possess an unestimated sensibility to whatever is deep or high, in imagination or feeling, so long as it is simple . . . It is only the artificial and complex that bewilder them.&quot; Indeed; the book hardly condescends, and so will gently stretch the middle-grader's vocabulary. But readers -- or listeners -- of all ages will delight in this collection of tales, for I was equally, if not more, entertained by the introductories and postludes to each story, which relate the antics and dialogue of Eustace and the little children he entertains. These interludes also expand the stories by slipping in commentary and interpretation.Don't pass this one by; it will truly win your heart, whoever you may be!"},{"Title":"A wonder-book for girls and boys (Riverside literature series)","review":"I ordered this book as part of a third grade curriculum for my son. These Everyman titles are really wonderful-- beautiful binding, heavy pages, amazing illustrations. I was not disappointed with this book. It is the kind of book we will read again and again and hopefully pass on to the next generation. Hawthorne's rendition of the myths and fables is classic and engaging, and Rackham's illustrations are worth the price on their own."},{"Title":"A wonder-book for girls and boys (Riverside literature series)","review":"If you've read Hawthorne's longer works, you might be surprised by the storytelling fun and energy he puts into this shorter book aimed at boys and girls of all ages, 8 to 80, who love a good yarn. Imagine yourself on a whispery, wintery day, sledding on the hillsides with friends. Or imagine yourself gathered with the kids on the front porch on a golden, summery afternoon. Now add to these settings Hawthorne's inventive narrator, Eustace Bright, who gathers the children round on that hillside or porch and gives them the classic myths with his own unique spins.If you think you know the stories of King Midas and his golden touch, of Hercules' exploits, of Medusa, you have here the chance to rediscover them in child-friendly, yet fully adventurous form, through the skills of Mr. Nathaniel Hawthorne. He gives the old tales a lot of charm, makes them palatable for younger kids, and weaves in lessons of ethics and morality and courage. I have always appreciated Hawthorne's more thought-provoking writings, but here I find another side to the man and the writer that is magical and light. To add to the wonder, I not only have the paperback version but also read this in an e-book format, enjoying the beautiful drawings of Arthur Rackham.I've long been a fan of Hawthorne's short stories. While he plays out some amazing themes and characters in \\"A Scarlet Letter,\\" \\"House of the Seven Gables,\\" and even \\"The Blithedale Romance,\\" he excels in his shorter tales, where the prose has less room to run off track and the themes are better addressed. He seems serious in most of his writing, with only hints of his humor and playfulness, but in \\"A Wonder Book for Boys and Girls,\\" we find a side of Hawthorne that's hard not to adore."},{"Title":"A wonder-book for girls and boys (Riverside literature series)","review":"As good as this book may be, the print quality is so bad that I cannot read it.

I was a bit disappointed in getting this hardcover to see that I could read it in a couple of days. The pages go by fast as they cover Morgan's daring raids throughout Kentucky and the north. I was hoping to get more information than the quick coverage of the events that Morgan and his raiders went through. I would have liked to get some insight from his companions in the field and also from his enemy. This book seems to summarize Morgan and probably isn't the best when it comes to dates and details. It is important to suggest this book for anyone looking to read about a different Confederate cavalry commander instead of Mosby or Stuart that doesn't want to get into serious details.

The author masterfully melds these two genres, creating a novel that is riveting and highly entertaining.The year is 2048 A.D., and a young history student named Kivrin is preparing to do an on site study of the turbulent fourteenth century. Her mission has placed two of the University's professors at cross purposes, as the proponent for this study, Mr. Gilchrist, finds himself pitted against Mr. Dunworthy, Kivrin's mentor, who believes that this trip in time is far too dangerous. Mr. Gilchrist, however, is in the position to have the final say on the project.Kivrin is scheduled to land in the rural English countryside of the fourteenth century some twenty years before the Black Death savages England. Armed with the knowledge of fourteenth century customs, dress, languages, religious practices, and history, Kivrin is raring to go back in time. When she travels back, however, an unforeseen crisis in the present places Kivrin in a potentially deadly situation upon her arrival in the past.The book alternates between what is happening in the present and what is happening in the past, as those in the present work to unravel the mystery of what went wrong. Meanwhile, Kivrin struggles to overcome the anomalous situations she encounters that run contra to her expectations. Believing herself stranded in the past, Kivrin artfully maneuvers around the precarious situations in which she finds herself, never losing her humanity despite the horror of her situation, given what went wrong.Steeped in well-researched medieval life, it is the story of Kivrin's sojourn in the past that captures the imagination of the reader. This is a stunning book that is totally gripping. The spellbound reader will definitely keep turning the pages of this wonderful book, which is clearly written by a master storyteller.

And one of the rudest heroes I have ever come across in a romance written in this decade. Omigod. He didn't just leap at conclusions, he pole-vaulted into them.Maggie is a soap opera actress. Her character is having fertility problems. So somebody leaves a baby on her doorstep. I'm not into the &quot;baby&quot; books Harlequin thinks we all love. But this one had potential.Then, Jared, the so-called hero, came along. He made all sorts of assumptions about the heroine, based on the usual zilch evidence. She's an actress, so she must be vain, shallow, and in it for the publicity. He mocks her, makes baseless accusations, gets hits by feelings of jealousy he can't quite understand. Oh, brother.Jared's feelings about actresses are later explained -- sort of. I wasn't satisified with the explanation. Also, I was uncomfortable with the idea that this guy who hated show business was a pediatrician who treated the children of performing artists.

What a great surprise! His use of language is so clever and lateral-thinking. Usually I would read an average French novel without the use of a dictionary, but Jardin revels in using obscure vocabulary, turning nouns into verbs. Gradually you get into his mind set. I did not find his characters &quot;sympathiques&quot; but they are riveting and they take us beyond the prosaic world of the teacher-pupil relationship. How would a head teacher react to a beautiful 17 year old who comes to babysit and wears nothing under her red duffelcoat (not even shoes), and swears she will only eat food that has been touched by his lips. As I write, I make the story sound cheap. There is no way to provide a precis of a tale that takes us beyond the limits of our imagination. I don't know if this book has been translated from French.

First of all, this book is for children aged 2-5 years old. I would not do ANY of the activities in this book with anyone over five years of age. If you did, the children would horse laugh you and totally withdraw from the lesson, because the activities are not age appropriate for anyone older than five. Four and five may even be pushing it for some of the activities, which would be best for 2 and 3 year olds. That's the first bad signal about this book.The second is that the three authors are sisters, and that isn't going to offer a range of perspective.The first author listed is involved in drill, cheerleading, and beauty pageants. How you derive creative movement experience from these contexts is dubious..... I question the artistic integrity of the instruction delivered by people involved in these areas. Children who participate in the above areas do not create, they mimic.There are themes for each lesson...I thought that \\"Zany Day\\" and \\"Happy Day\\" were wearing pretty thin in the theme department. \\"Motion Day\\" and \\"Fun Day\\"??? Shouldn't all the lessons involve motion and fun? I was appalled by their choice to include \\"Indian Day.\\" This book was published in 2003. I understand that we are all attempting to become more multicultural in our classrooms, and that none of us is perfect. And I don't mean to bring up the author's religious affiliation. But I am from Utah and the authors are part of the Mormon Church, as they state in their introductory bios. I know the Mormon Church's historical view of Native Americans, and it is blatantly racist. To include \\"Indian Day,\\" in which a shabby \\"tee pee\\" is constructed and the children paint \\"war paint\\" on their faces and run around impersonating Native American tribal dances is way off the mark. I would not include elements of cultural dance, folk dance, or diversity in a program for children until they were capable of understanding the history of the cultural group being studied and appreciate their particular form of dance. This lesson in particular is absolutely a red flag.The lessons are on the whole not very creative. There are a couple of things I might use with a three year old class, and that's it.If you want a GOOD BOOK on children's creative movement, please see \\"First Steps in Teaching Creative Dance to Children\\" by Mary Joyce."},{"Title":"The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt","review":"i dont know if my last review came through, so i am just writing this one to see if this comes through it is just a test"},{"Title":"The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt","review":"after being introduced to camus, i have read all of his works from the fall to his notebooks. i am not a scolar and after reading this you will see a lot of words spelted wrong oh well. my review is simple it is a work of art, starting with his wise and elogent dismantling of the marquie de sade, who saw rebellion in its most nililistic form, however camus notices sade'w rejection of capital punishement. move's from sade to the revolution and on to the works by hegal, marx, and nietzsche; to name a few, there is a lot more. show's his respect for the organization for combat of the Socialist Revolutionary party. this book is and should be a manitory read for all people of all races. the principle of &quot;nessisary but inexcusible&quot; is the call of the rebel."},{"Title":"The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt","review":"The book highlights the refractories of thoughts ,that the european mind has gone through , over a period from the dawn of history to our times ,in it's process of development to its present form.The classroom language makes it a formal read though."},{"Title":"The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt","review":"I have never read a book by Camus I didn't like, and this series of essays on man's inclination if not inborne need to rebel is one more example how how Camus has cemented himself as one of the greatest authors of the twentieth century.I only wish I had read this book when I was younger, I would have gained a better navigator for my own rebellious nature.

Though it contains a wealth of factual data, Camus's examination of the paradoxes of revolt misfires on account of the faulty premise of its argument: that revolt is an act by which the individual rebel somehow invokes, in the intention behind his deed, the welfare of others. Any other form of revolt that licences the murder or enslavement of a fellow human being as a means to and end, violates, in Camus's view, this human bond implicit in the genuine act of rebellion. The rest of the book is an elaboration on this theme and the result is a splendidly written, frequently opaque and - (what is most regrettable) - barely coherent and sometimes pretentious treatise. Camus offers some valuable insights on how movements laying claim to liberal ideals degenerate, once they are established, into monolithic despotisms. It is interesting how this work, written in the aftermath of the Second World War, which witnessed the genocide of millions, marks a dramatic change of attitude in Camus, from being the out-and-out existential nihilist of &quot;The Outsider&quot; to becoming a humanist &quot;value-nihilist&quot;.

Moreover, he asks the all important question: why are rebellions mostly ending in (and justifying) murder, under the flag of freedom or reason (logical crimes) with philosophy as an alibi? For A. Camus, the will to power takes the place of the will to justice.Metaphysical rebellionThe metaphysical rebel protests against his condition in the world, against the whole of the creation, its injustice and its evil, and also against death.The father of all rebels is Prometheus (\`see the injustice I have to endure').The Marquis de Sade proclaims unbridled personal freedom, absolute negation and universal destruction. Stirner proclaims universal affirmation of the self, while Nietzsche proclaims active nihilism: every man has to make his own laws.The surrealists also proclaim absolute personal freedom with \`gratuitous acts' as satisfactions of one's instincts and one's unconscious.All those metaphysical rebels want to control totally their own world and construct for them a pure terrestrial kingdom.Historical rebellionThe history of man is the sum of his successive rebellions. Freedom and man's dignity are the motivating principles of all revolutions. But, when justice demands the suppression of freedom, terror consummates the revolution. Justice adopts violence and murder and the revolutionaries assume the responsibility of total guilt.J.J. Rousseau formulated the concepts of the Republican State with law and order based on the general consent.Saint-Just wanted the Republic to be totally cleansed of all alien elements.Hegel's dialectic of master and slave (the conqueror is always right) culminates into the absolute State, \`the reflection of the Spirit of the world in the mutual recognition of each by all.'But, in the absolute State, the will to power replaced the will to justice.Fascism dreamed of liberating a minority by subjugating the rest.Building on Marx' prophesy of the abolition of the State, Lenin's professional revolutionaries organized Russian Communism aiming at liberating all men, but, by provisionally enslaving them all.Trade-unionismOverall, man's dignity and living standard (freedom) have only been served, not by doctrine, dogmas or abstract concepts, but by concrete revolutionary trade-unionism. Only by organizing the labor force and by strikes have the working conditions been mightily improved from a 16 hour work day to a forty hour work week.Albert Camus expressed impressively his personal views on the history and the deadly dangerous human rebellious condition, which are still highly relevant today.Not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt","review":"This is largely the explanation behind all of Camus's works.

Camus explains in the beginning that while his previous work was about the question of suicide, this one is about the other aspect of taking human lives - other people's lives (murder). The book however is not so much about murder, as it is about the ethics of rebellion.At a deeper ideological level, Camus was reacting to the excesses of Soviet style communism with which he disagreed. He felt that rebellion is always at the risk of falling prey to the very tyranny it revolts against and destroys.Camus however does not believe that rebellion is therefore not desirable. His humanitarian ideals harmonize with the dream of rebellion. So he tries to answer the question of how rebellion can escape falling prey to tyranny, albiet unsuccessfully, by taking the examples of Russian nihilists who fought tyranny through murder, but nevertheless punished themsleves for that act (because the act of murder becomes tyrranny if routinized).In all his works, Camus is generally good with analysis but poor in his conclusions. This book is brilliant for its analysis of the ethics of rebellion and the dilemmas of a rebel. It raises important questions and leaves you free to find your own answers. That also harmonizes better with the spirit of existentialism."},{"Title":"The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt","review":"Camus' quasi-coherent point takes a back seat to his insightful historical analysis. It's worth reading for the historical info, rather than his elusive point."},{"Title":"The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt","review":"In The Rebel, Albert Camus, the master of existentialism, analyzed the spirit of rebellion from the French Revolution to the Russian Revolution. The Jacobans, rebelled against King and God and by making their principles divine, introduced the Reign of Terror.Nihilism went further and eliminated absolute principles and its rise during the second half of the nineteenth century created terrorists who renounced virtue and principles and who rebelled against reality and history by destroying them. From the killing of gods to the killing of kings, rebellions had ushered in the terrors of Hitler and then of Stalin. The Soviets, in the name of the classless society in the future, a new heaven and a new earth where the lamb and the lion coexist, justified violence to guide the path of civilization, to force the end of history, the Marxist utopia.Camus stated that absolute freedom leads to injustice and absolute justice stifles freedom and demonstrated it with examples from the French Revolution to the Russian Revolution. And he believed that only through moderation, by limiting freedom with justice and vice versa, could a possible solution emerge.Events in the past several decades have shown that his statement remains relevant in our time. From Timothy McVeigh to Anders Behring Breivik, we have seen terrorists kill in the name of their freedom, their absolute freedom, and of justice, their notion of absolute justice."},{"Title":"The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt","review":"This is a really fine work. The essays trace the development of rebellion in the twentieth century and show how the rejection of God, nihilism, and power lead us to terror. His readings of Sade, Nietzsche, and others are deft and insightful. His prescription for a careful solidarity, and for thinking through where and how we draw boundaries is timely. Camus asks us not to draw boundaries to exclude and create the &#34;other,&#34; but to mark spaces of value. Great stuff!"},{"Title":"The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt","review":"The product arrived on time safe and sound. The product was covered against any kind of damage. Thanks for the good work!"},{"Title":"The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt","review":"This can be both an easy and difficult read depending on how deeply you'd like to think about Camus' ideas. He is definitely passionate when thinking about the theory of rebellions and revolutions, but you can tell he is different than most philosophers. Instead of an A + B = C approach, Camus is more focused on arguing his points by presenting history. It's a great read and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt","review":"I first became interested in Albert Camus after reading a quote from The Rebel online. \\"I rebel, therefore we exist\\" was the quote, and I must admit that, after reading the book, there has never been anything truer written. When I was in a bookstore a few months ago I found a copy of The Rebel, which is apparently a rare sight these days, since The Rebel is often ignored. Camus is one of the most famous writers of the 20th century, so why would one of his masterpieces be ignored?It has been ignored, from what I can gather, because it is a philosophical work in which Camus pulls no punches and examines thoroughly why the excessive crime and violence of our era exist. Camus explains how, in both philosophy and politics, the reigning attitude has been one of nihilism for the past two centuries. This nihilism, being necessarily without an aim, leads to dictatorship and gross amounts of suffering for humans, no matter what principles it claims on the surface. Camus systematically destroys those who have used the philosophies of Hegel, Nietzsche, Marx, surrealism, u.s.w., to justify their murderous plots.Camus proposes that instead of nihilism and murder, we take to heart the ancient concepts of moderation and responsibility. Camus' destruction of modern governents and his proposals of these ancient ideas seem to have made this book unpopular. In this era of oppression, it is easy to ignore what offends us or makes us think. Camus gives the reader no choice. He must either raise a defiant fist to the giants of power, or he must give way to these minds that are utterly without scruples. I admire Camus deeply because of this--he has summed up the ideas I have been carrying around for years--but some will be deeply hurt by his comments. I leave you with a final thought: everyone is partly to blame for the state of the present and the future. You have the choice to make it either good or bad."},{"Title":"The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt","review":"I wrote my college entrance essay on this book (Let's not say how long ago, but I was accepted.) and just recently went back to reread it and compare my impressions now to my impressions then, when it was one of my favorite books. I found it still holds up as a fine piece of literature as well as an inspiring example of personal courage. As another reader has pointed out, Camus was ostracized, more or less, by the French literary establishment after the book's publication. I still find the chapter on metaphysical rebellion the best. Camus has a fine understanding of the English Romantic poets and what, for many, their rebellion consisted of: &quot;The Byronic hero, incapable of love, or capable only of an impossible love, suffers endlessly. He is solitary, languid, his condition exhausts him. If he wants to feel alive, it must be in the terrible exaltation of a brief and destructive action. To love someone whom one will never see again is to give a cry of exultation as one perishes in the flames of passion. One lives only in and for the moment, in order to achieve 'the brief and vivid union of a tempestuous heart united to the tempest'(Lermentov)&quot; This is as an acute a dissection of the raison d'etre of the &quot;Byronic hero&quot; as I've read in any English criticism (and believe me, I've read a lot!). The passages on Nietzsche are also exquisite. He gets to the root of many of the great thinker's ideas by quoting the lines that come from the heart: &quot;the most painful, the most heartbreaking question, that of the heart that asks itself: where can I feel at home?&quot;-The passages on Milton are exquisite as well.-The whole book is a well-rounded philosophical enterprise that touches both the heart and the mind. This is not sentimentality, as one reviewer contends (such criticisms usually come from those jaded souls who have had their hearts burnt out in grad school). It is decency...unshakable decency, according to the review by the Atlantic on the back cover of my edition. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the wherefores behind man's many different states of rebellion. It is the best and most readable I know of."},{"Title":"The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt","review":"In his novels -- short and to the point -- Camus strove to embody a philosophy. THE REBEL, probably his best, most sustained work, talks about that philosophy at length. He takes something of the same viewpoint as Robert Lindner -- who insisted that the rebellious and protestant in man is what is best in him, not the docile and quiescent -- and explores that viewpoint exhilaratingly and totally. He also does something no modern philosopher or critic has done well, to my mind, which is give de Sade a proper shakedown. (Most intellectuals who have a flirtation with de Sade's writings and pseudo-philosophy -- not all that far removed from Ayn Rand's, come to think of it -- wind up contriving some kind of argument for the man as a martyr of intellectual freedom. Nothing could be further than the truth, and Camus makes a good case for that.) The best thing about the book is its tone -- lofty without being snooty, intellectual without being distant, and passionate without being sentimental. It's not a hard read, and it has the flavor of a conversation with a man who makes you stop and say to yourself, &quot;Yes -- why didn't I think that before, in so many words...?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt","review":"Critics of Albert Camus consider L'Homme R&eacute;volt&eacute;, or The Rebel to one of Camus' most important non-fiction works. While Le Mythe de Sisyphe is far more polished, The Rebel is the most comprehensive exploration of Camus' beliefs. There are weaknesses in The Rebel, as in most rhetorical works, but the public found the work accessible and, as a result, made it a bestseller.The book begins as an essay &quot;Remarque sur la r&eacute;volt&eacute;,&quot; written in 1945. This &quot;Commentary on Revolt&quot; attempted to explain Camus' definition of the word, &quot;revolt.&quot; In the essay, Camus' explains that a revolt is not the same as a &quot;revolution.&quot; Camus' lexicon define &quot;revolt&quot; as a peaceful, evolutionary process. He had hoped that mankind would evolve toward improved societies. In his ideal, socialism is the result of a natural historical process that does require effort and leadership, but not violence.&quot;Remarque sur la r&eacute;volt&quot; begins with a civil servant refusing an order. For Camus, revolt begins with a single person refusing an immoral choice. Laws and rule are not defensible for Camus unless they are meant to help society at all levels. The civil servant in the opening parable is an existential hero, though Camus would have rejected such a label. The bureaucrat makes a decision based not upon what is easiest for him but what is best for him and society as a whole. This man's revolt is resistance, not violence.Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's works are the primary target of The Rebel. While not a perfect treatment of Hegel, Camus argues that Hegel's works glorified the state and power over personal morality and social ethics. Worse, according to Camus, Marxism co-opts Hegel and extends his theories to allow any means to an end. In Marxism, as embodied by the Soviet Union and its Communist Party, the state is always &quot;right.&quot; Humanism and equality were important to Camus, not an artificial organization.Camus further offended some leftists by opposing what he considered a trend toward nihilism in European thought. Life was &quot;meaningless&quot; for Camus, but each person did have the opportunity to define a role for himself or herself in life. Nihilism rendered living pointless, which Camus could not accept. Mankind, by its very existence, was in the unique position of defining itself through choice.Attacking Hegel, Marxism and nihilism resulted in a resounding rejection by the left. Leftist critics hated The Rebel and described it as an act of intellectual treason. The May 1952 issue of Les Temps Modernes featured a review of The Rebel by Francis Jeanson. The review affected Camus deeply. Camus found himself described as a traitor to the left and Jeanson suggested no one should be critical of progressive ideas, even when the actions of the left might be &quot;wrong.&quot;The review in Les Temps Modernes marked the end of Camus' relationship with Jean-Paul Sartre. As editor, or director, of the magazine, Sartre exercised a great deal of control. Camus knew that Sartre must have agreed with the review at some level. Camus was compelled to write a response to Jeanson. In his response, Camus tried to explain his belief that the ends, or at least the goals, do not justify the means in many cases. Sartre then published an open letter to Camus. Sartre, himself, wrote nineteen pages, including some very personal attacks. As a result, the friendship was over forever.While not the primary work cited, the 1957 Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Camus in part due to The Rebel."},{"Title":"The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt","review":"Camus' The Rebel is the first book of his that I had the great pleasure of reading. Eloquent and enlightening, The Rebel speaks to me in a way that no other 20th century philosophical work has, at least in its entirety.The Rebel is both an introduction of new ideas and a history of previous ideas and events: Camus' scholarship is unbelievable in the area of revolt. It spans from early greek history and earlier all the way through to the French Revolution and beyond.I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone concerned with spiritual, historical, or any kind of rebellion - and really to anyone who concerns themself over the human condition."},{"Title":"The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt","review":"Of course, this book has not been totally forgotten, but for what a good piece of work this is, it is largely negelected. Flat out, I find this book Camus' masterpiece and if all his other books were destroyed, this one alone would make him seem genius....Why is this book so good? First, it provided a reading list for me, an American, to learn the basics and the names of some of the most important French and European thinkers in the past five hundred years and an impetus to read them (such that I could agree or disagree with what Camus said about them). Second, the book made me think, and made me question, in the logical, precise, but human way that Camus did (which is an invaluable tool for anyone just starting out in the world). Third, in this book you get to see a great swath of history unfold through one of the greatest writers/minds of the twentieth century. How cool is that?I highly reccomend this book to anyone to read. Especially, though, I recommend this book to anyone just starting out on a path in the social sciences or law (who thinks about 'things that matter....') or to anyone going through post-adolecent pangs of conscience....This is the first book that I'd read of Camus if I were new to him too...."},{"Title":"The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt","review":"Without straying into the dogamtism or the sentinmental romantic mindset that Camus warns of, this book had a profound affect on me as it helped me reconcile my 'reasoned' agnosticism and irreligion with my 'intuitive' socialism. I have since come to the conclusion (with the help of Camus) that both the above aspects of my world-view are logical, and perhaps most importantly,that it is necessary to temper whatever ideolgies you happen to find yourself agreeing with, your own intuitive morality.This is in my opinion the crux of The Rebel as Camus examines the history of religous (metaphysical) and social rebellion. From the Marquis De Sade and Neitzche in the former to the French Revolution and USSR in the later.Camus seems to have started from a point of being at a loss to explain the seeming contradictions in apparently well meaning revolution's that dole out (or promise freedom over here) and practice tyranny over there. Camus shows the depth and originality of his thinking by showing that these contradictions can be seen as the logical conclusions to total obediance to the doctrines of Marx, Hegel and Rosseau amoungst others ( these contradictions are found in the works themselves of Marx et al as these thinkers have been 'slaves' to their own logic which can be seen as analagous to Weber's notion of 'over-rationalism' and the 'iron cage' ). The result is a wise and profound analysys of social rebellion and a proscription for future reform as well as presenting a kind of 'eudaimon' for the contemporary existentialist."},{"Title":"The Rebel: An Essay on Man in Revolt","review":"I first read \\"The Rebel\\" while on guard duty in basic training in 1963, and then later upon my discharge and protests against the Vietnam War, and racial injustice. It is like having a good friend to share coffee with on a long summer night and become renewed for the struggle ahead.Camus does not offer a very fair world, or one with divine enlightenment. But he does offer struggles, hard work, and rebellion in the name of the humanity we all share. Robert Kennedy often quoted Camus, including The Rebel, before he was killed. The final pages of the book give some prime rallying calls: \\"Real generosity toward the future lies in giving all to the present.\\" and \\"At this meridian of thought, the rebel thus rejects divinity in order to share in the struggles and destiny of all men.\\"and \\"With this joy, through long st ruggle, we shall remake the soul of our time.\\" Struggle on rebels around the world, and read this book as you march, and speak out!

Camus examines the writings of Sade, Nietzsche (and others) and Marxism to answer whether the conquest of revolutionary movements can change the \\"totality of the world\\" and claim to the \\"unity of life\\" through rebellion (97, 108), that is, living in order to create what we are, not what we are not by the force of terror!It is not by dieing through revolutions we find a place in history, nor by being a god ourselves, nor indulging in our \\"adolescent furies\\" but rather servicing history by throwing ourselves into our own lives and to help others. \\"Rebellion in itself is moderation, and it demands, defends, and re-creates it through history and its eternal disturbances... It (rebellion) is a perpetual conflict, continually created and mastered by the intelligence\\" (301).

Albert Camus is one of the most profoundly influential thinkers of this century. The Rebel is a definite must read for lovers of L'etranger and Myth of Sisyphus. Camus maintains his signature style of short, simple yet hard-hitting sentences that leave a lot to the imagination, thus giving the reader a chance to re-create their our vision. One of the best writers to come out of France, Camus' sharp eye toward the French Revolution shows how inevitably the course of revolution leads to tyranny. Much like his predecessors such as Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky, Albert Camus writes with an unshakable decency and his work is eloquent and supremely rational."},{"Title":"Eyewitness Travel Phrase Book: Norwegian","review":"I work in a travel store and speak Norwegian.

I bought Fuel Fools and Rainy Races from www.Amazon.Ca (Canada) because they have not made it to the US Amazon.com site yet.The stories are OK, but not great. I think these characters would make great cartoons, but there is something weird about them that I have not isolated yet - possibly a UK child psychology consultant with different views than me!?!.I am a native Californian, and I know that Linda Dennis is also from California, but she went way overboard with arcane UK English and slamming the other teams - there are a number of subtle F1 political jabs ala Rocky and Bullwinkle. Maybe this is what kids want, but we are not a Disney based family.These stories do not keep my 2 year old's interest so far, and even the pictures of the cars arguing and the cars stuck in goo made him say \\"No like that ...\\" and \\"Car fall down ...\\". These books will go on the shelf for a few years and we will readdress them then.For the time being, we'll return to normalcy with \`Duck on a Bike', the \`Runaway Ralph' series, \`The Rainbow Fish' and Jay Jay the Jetplane videos."},{"Title":"Lilac Spring (Wild Rose Series #2) (Steeple Hill Women's Fiction #31)","review":"Lilac Spring is just as compelling as her two previous novels. This is the story of Cherish (daughter of a very successful boat builder in the small community Haven's End Maine) and Silas (her father's apprentice in the business). They are briefly introduced as children and then the story resumes as Cherish returns from her education as a young woman. She has loved Silas from childhood but Silas is very aware of his place in society and in their household. He has had an emotionally barren adolesence and really made his love of building boats his world (as it has been). Cherish has a strong faith in spite of her pampered childhood, she is impetuous, vivacious, a little spoiled but overall just innocent and loving. She expects Silas to share her faith since they've gone to the same church since childhood but in reality it is only head knowledge.

We also meet Capain Phelps and Ginny briefly from her previous book."},{"Title":"Lilac Spring (Wild Rose Series #2) (Steeple Hill Women's Fiction #31)","review":"Morren has quickly become one of my top authors. In a matter of months I have managed to get my hands on all of her books. While I still enjoyed it and couldn't manage to put it down, this is my least favorite of her books.I liked the character of Silas. I found him to be honorable and steady. His even keel demeanor constantly reminded me of my husband. However, I felt that his character wasn't fully developed at the end. During the story it is mentioned that he seemed to hide his emotions within and it seemed implied that he had something from the past which caused it. However, while mentions of old love and family were made, nothing was really expanded upon and therefore I never felt he was able to overcome this particular weakness.Cherish, on the otherhand, was very able to express emotion. I felt, like another reviewer, that she was a little spoiled and did sulk when she didn't get her way. But I didn't find her irritating. I still cheered for her because she seemed very sweet.I went ahead and gave it 4 stars because it was very well written and had a good plot. On a scale of Morren books, however, I would really only give it a 3. But only because her other novels have left me with high expectations.As usual, great characters, beautiful romance, realistic struggles. Thanks for another splendid story!! Write another soon!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Lilac Spring (Wild Rose Series #2) (Steeple Hill Women's Fiction #31)","review":"I picked up this book with great excitement, only to be thoroughly let down. The plot was original, but very uninteresting and it seemed to go nowhere. Aside from that, the characters were also very poorly written. Silas was the only one in the story that I actually looked forward to reading about. Cherish to me was whiny and weak, and I found myself hoping she didn't win the love of Silas until she could change her spoiled ways. Her father did a complete 360 in the story, between paternal love and obsessive protection. He randomly over-reacted about Silas, which was not, in my opinion, part of his nature. The dialogue throughout the book was rushed and forced, the characters were extremely underdeveloped, and the end just left me unsatisfied. This one doesn't rank anywhere close to the author's first book, \\"WILD ROSE.\\" There's such a drastic difference in the plot and characters that I'm somewhat leery to pick up the next one."},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Denmark (1st ed)","review":"Having traveled through SEA,Japan,Korea, and Latin America, and now Denmark with lp books, I am a loyal fan.

Marr's topic is not 1945 alone but the period beginning in 1940, when the Germans conquered France and the colonial adminisrators at the other end of the huge Eurasian landmass were left in confusion -- a period that reached a climax of sorts in 1945, with the surrender of the Japanese and the inevitable manuveuring among the various contending factions within Indochina for power in the post-war picture.Back in 1940....some of the French colonials were happy to follow the lead from the new Vichy govt in France (the puppets of the Germans) and so to co-operate with the Japanese. Others had more or less open Gaullist sympathies. One develops some sympathy, in the course of this book, for the Gaullists -- who must have thought, after the liberation of their country in Europe in 1944, that they were entitled to a restoration of the colonial status quo ante as their share of the post-war settlement.Early in 1945, the Japanese decided the French could no longer be trusted to run Indochina in Japan's interests, and they placed it under the control of their own military. This put the French and the VC in an odd alliance. It was also a very ineffective alliance -- the Japanese remained firmly in control up to the time their god/emperor told them in a radio address the war was over and they must lay down their arms.In these events, and much more (I can't convey the thoroughness of Marr's account in this review!), one comes to see the future, the next thirty years of it!, as so much inevitable misery, like a wound-up spring destined to uncoil slowly and painfully for all concerned.So read this book to give yourself the background for any understanding of those 30 years. If you can bear to do so."},{"Title":"Vietnam 1945: The Quest for Power","review":"Scholar and Vietnam historian, David G. Marr has created a work of epic scope in his finely tuned account of the year that saw the end of World War II and defined the postwar world. The detailed study of Allied, Japanese, and Vietnamese involvement during the war and in the postwar maneuver for dominance in Vietnam, is essential for the reader who seeks to probe the politics of a cold war struggle that continued to rage for thirty years of land war in Southeast Asia. France was occupied by Nazi Germany in the spring of 1940 while Axis power, Japan, prepared to invade Vietnam in September. With its seaports, airbases, and overland transportation routes, along with its abundant natural resources and rice belts, Vietnam was crucial to Japan's war errort. In Vietnam a French colonial government had ruled its Indochinese Union, exploiting Vietnam's natural resources and manipulating its economy for close to one hundred years. Fearful of losing its colonial possession entirely by force, the French collaborated with Japanese military forces that allowed a functional French colonial administration to sustain the machinations of government in Vietnam from 1942 to 1945. The Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the CIA, began covert operations in Vietnam in the spring of 1943, working directly with respected and admired communist-nationalist, Ho Chi Minh. Substantial research, eye-witness analysis, photgraphs, and extensive footnotes support Marr's account of Ho's newly formed Viet Minh forces working with OSS &quot;Deer Team&quot; operatives to achieve Allied war goals and oppose the Japanese war effort. The year 1945 is to Vietnam what 1776 is to the United States; it marks the birth of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam headed by Ho Chi Minh. Ho made it clear to his US friends that his primary aim was not to promote communism but to achieve independence and self-determination for Vietnam. All Americans who knew him personally saw him first as a nationalist and second as a communist. Japan seized power entirely in Vietnam from a French colonial administration 9March1945. Vietnamese leaders saw the ousting of the French as a window of opportunity. By the end of July with Japan on the brink of defeat, members of the Viet Minh, Indochinese Communist Party, and associated nationalists seized history in what was termed the &quot;August Revolution.&quot; A tidal wave of revolutionary and nationalist zeal for independence swept the country. On 2September Ho Chi Minh proclaimed the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in a public address to a nation unified in its desire for independence, quoting from the United States' Declaration of Independence, &quot;these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.&quot; Ho concluded his speech with: &quot;Vietnam has the right to enjoy freedom and independence, and in fact has become a free and independent country. The entire Vietnamese people are determined to mobilize all their physical and mental strength, to sacrifice their lives and property, in order to safeguard their freedom and independence.&quot; Roosevelt opposed colonial aggression and returning Vietnam to France after the war stating that colonialism was dead. Before Roosevelt could enact US foreign policy regarding Indochina he died.The US State Department had little knowledge of or policy regarding Indochina. France's Provisional President, Charles DeGaulle, stated that if the US did not help France in Indochina, then France might be forced into the Soviet orbit. Only the US had a solvent economy at the close of WWII. The US believing France to be crucial in Europe in opposing Soviet expansionism, fully funded DeGaulle in taking back Vietnam from the Vietnamese. While DeGaulle organized a French Expeditionary Force to land, US ships transported British and Indian troops to seize control. Shipping, arms, uniforms, and provisions were supplied by the US. Contrary to orders from Allied Command, British General Douglas Gracey upon arrival 6September, maintained surrendered yet armed Japanese troops for internal security. Great Britain had her own colonies in Asia to put in order, hence, a vested interest in seeing colonial possessions regained. The newly formed government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was efficiently evicted from office. Eventually a French Expeditionary Force arrived and took over with business as usual, imprisonment and massacre. Mr.Marr's text comes alive with first-hand accounts from participants in the extraordinary arena that was 1945. Marr writes of the summer OSS &quot;Deer Team&quot; met with Ho and the Viet Minh. Ho wanted to chat about the US, its history, political ideals, and US support of free, popular governments throughout the world. Team member, Rene' Defourneaux, from New York recalls Ho's arguing in broken English: &quot;Your statesmen make eloquent speeches about helping those with self-determination. We are self-determined. Why not help us. Am I any different from Nehru, Quezon, even your George Washington? Was not Washington considered a revolutionary? I too want to set my people free.&quot; With Ho Chi Minh's apparent affinity for the US, for democratic political ideals, and for American friends in the OSS, along with his desire and hopes for a US alliance and support in achieving Vietnamese independence, Marr makes evident that the US had the future of an emerging self-governing Vietnam in the palm of its hand at the close of WWII. The subsequent French and US involvement in Vietnam remains one of the most misled and tragic affairs of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Vietnam 1945: The Quest for Power","review":"David G. Marr scored a knock-out or at least a TKO with, \\"Vietnam 1945: The Quest for Power.\\" David G. Marr launched the readers into Ba inh Square, Ha Noi on that hot muggy Sunday afternoon, 2 September, 1945, to listen to Nguyen Ai Quoc, the founder of the Indochinese Communist Party, read the Vietnamese version of the Declaration of Independence for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the new name for a united Vietnam. The amount of research that David G. Marr put into this book was phenomenal making the readers drooling for more."},{"Title":"Vietnam 1945: The Quest for Power","review":"Along with Duiker, Marr is one ingorrant of history in Vietnam in its people. Ho Chi Minh was a thief, murderer and cruel dictator as the world has seen in Hitler, Lenin, Stalin, Pol Pot and many others of the 20th century.Ho Chi Minh was never a nationalist, he worried about his own persona and legacy to Vietnam as much as the dictators of the world worried about their image. He was a communist because no regular government would have listened to his crazy mind using it as a mean to his end. Just like Hitler, he was nothing until some desperates listened to his so called charisma. When he lead the Communists in Vietnam, he was a much as fault for the 3 millions killed during the war. He, himself ordered executions of countless civilians as they refused to follow him. He forced thousands of Vietnamese to labor and camps in the North. From the North through the South of Vietnam, people were scared of the Communists, that's why the exodus of millions to the South in 1954 when the country was divided. And again in 1975, millions more left the country because the communists took over the rest of the country.Do you really think the Vietnamese wanted Ho to lead the country? Would they submit themselves to tyranny and death camps so they can enjoy the lives of a communist? No! They fled everywhere Communists appear. Because in the Communists' eyes, anyone who is educated was a traitor, anyone who had different ideas than theirs, anyone who had religion, land, some kind of assets, some kind of beliefs, who hold traditional values was a traitor to their cause, and therefore they must be dealt with with torture and death to the whole family, as an example for others. Please refer to the movie \\"Killing Fields\\" as an illustration of what was going on with Cambodie and Vietnam. It was never on the media because journalists were never allowed on the other side of the fence, weren't they? The only thing you could see is just what Americans and the South Vietnamese were oppressing to the poor farmers. And how Jane Fonda made herslef useful to the NVA.So please explain to me where Ho was a nationalist and a liberator?Thirty years after the fall of Saigon, Vietnam still struggles with poverty, corruption and Communism where the rest of the world around Vietnam has taken off. Thanks to Ho and his communists, all the intellectuals of the country are either in jail or fled out of the country, and 95% out of the 80M Vietnamese is in poverty and earn less than $500 per year. And you can vote and have some kind of freedon only if you were to join the Communist Party. The rest of the people won't be allowed to voice their fears and frustations.What kind of freedom and democracy is that?"},{"Title":"Mysteries of the Desert","review":"This book is a gift to read - which may be why I keep ordering additional copies to give as gifts to my friends.

And I do mean little. The short chapters make good, quick reading on the go. I usually have five or six books going at once, so that was great for me. My wife picked it up before I was finished and she found it helpful too. Some ideas in here I found particularly useful:--Limit your intake of negative information. I used to start my day by reading the newspaper. I cancelled my subscription, and now I skim the headlines online later in the day. My mood and outlook have improved tremendously.--Don't spend a lot of time thinking about past mistakes. Learn from them, and then put most of your focus on what you've done right in the past. This one suggestion has helped me be a lot more productive.--Being respectful, thoughtful, and kind gets you farther than being cutthroat. I'm a successful business person, and I have certainly found this to be true. It's nice to have that point of view validated.--Most successful people have failed. A lot. History tends not to remember their failures, but Golden shows how Thomas Edison, Dr. Seuss, Jonas Salk, and other luminaries in all fields failed time and again before striking gold. That's powerful motivation to keep trying until you get it right.I would have liked a little more about the author's personal journey as he's applied these ideas to his life, and perhaps a bit about how some of his management consulting clients have worked with them as well. Of course that would have expanded what is now a very digestible little volume.If you're looking for a detailed, step-by-step how to guide for how to improve your life, this one might not be for you.

Keeping these limitations in mind, this book will be a great help to anyone who wishes to succeed in tournaments.Buntjer examines every facet of a tournament, and describes what to look for, and how to play. He takes the reader chronologically through a tournament. At every step he discusses key concepts. Furthermore, Buntjer accomplishes this in a clear and simple style.

The doctor is also trying to figure out why the man writes and speaks the ancient language in that trane. The doctor makes some interesting finds trying to enravel the strange &quot;trances&quot;. One of the finds is the first medically recognized hallucinagenic mushroom, once thought to never actually exist. The book explores paranormal esp through tests under a controlled environment. It becomes an addictive read, I became facinated with the scientific questioning of paranormal events. It adds a level of intrigue not found in most subjects.

Then, when I did start reading, I couldn't put it down. That is so very unlike me. I read it in three days! Unlike me again. Fiction is usually too sappy and unreal for me to enjoy.It was so well written that I believed all the way through that it was a biography. How could anyone describe so accurately the feelings of Esther unless she was Esther! I so related to those feelings, and I believe we all do. The character development of everyone involved was so real. It seemed obvious to me that Esther was ADHD and had an gift of understanding people.The book was so good that I, being over 40, was crying in the middle because I so related to how Esther felt. Don't get me wrong, it's not really a tear jerker, and not really negative.I am going to buy it to keep a copy for myself. I will also read it to my 12 year old daughter, and perhaps use it as a home school unit.I am now in search of other Han Nolan titles in hopes of finding other awesome titles. Maybe the author will indulge us with sequels!"},{"Title":"A Summer of Kings","review":"A Summer of Kings, is a realistic fiction book it contains adventure. The book is written by Han Nolan, takes place in the 1960s during a time when the world was facing racial tensions between African Americans and Anglos. This book is realistic, historical and emotional. It disputes both sides of racism, the violence of the white man against the black man and the anger of the black man towards the white man.In the book, one of the main characters, King-Roy Johnson, is accused of murdering an Anglo man. Esther, the 14 year old Anglo girl, has very strong emotions about wanting to become something new, something better. She is very frustrated with herself because her family makes statements to her about her being stupid because she failed the 3rd grade. This is obvious when she is told that she should be a gym teacher since it does not require intelligence. She believes that by falling in love with King-Roy, this will begin the process of becoming something new.King-Roy begins to believe the teachings and philosophies of Malcolm X, who promotes the use of violence to resolve racial issues, after meeting Ax (who doesn't like the \\"white-devils\\" which are Anglos) on the bus to live at the Young's House. Esther learns the peaceful ways of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Ghandi principles.Esther and King-Roy produced issues between them. Esther is approaching the issues as not keeping promises and honesty. Esther's first matter is promises because King-Roy said that he would meet her, Sophie, and Stewart at the bus station, but in spite of his honesty they went to Harlem to get him so they would be home on time for dinner.Esther's friend, Pip was \\"in training\\" for cross-country so Esther would run with him every morning at 5:00 a.m. Later in the city, King- Roy and Esther agreed to meet at the bus station at 4:00 p.m. to go back home; King- Roy never showed up after Sophie and Stewart's auditions. King-Roy was found in Harlem with his friend, Ax (who didn't like \\"white devils\\" which are Anglos). Esther then climbed up a tree because she was mad that her family was making fun of her. Her father came to her and said that he was sorry about the incident that happened. Next, King-Roy came and said that he would teach Esther how to tap dance. Lastly, Mrs. Young, Esther's mother, came outside to apologize Esther was complaining because she never received a thank-you for everything that she did. Mrs. Young said that she never receives a thank-you from anybody in the house-hold.I really liked the book, its description and mental visualization. I didn't really like the lack of honesty between each character. The narrator explained their story very well and simple so it was easy to receive the information.The book is one of my new favorite books. It is in my top 3 books!!!"},{"Title":"A Summer of Kings","review":"First, I would like to start off with the cover of the book. King Roy (the black man) looks like a 14-year-old boy without glasses. In the book he wears glasses, but how come not on the cover? Esther (the girl) looks like a 10-year-old, even though she is 14. Now I am going to talk about the characters. Sophia (Esther's 6-year-old sister) is a little spoiled brat who I've wanted to strangle ever since I started the book. Stewart (Esther's 7-year-old brother) is one of the only nice people in the book. Monsier Vichy is a cool character, even though Esther keeps saying he's \\"evil\\" (maybe because he's French, but who knows). Esther's mother is the most uptight mother ever, and she even makes fun of Esther, but she doesn't seem to mind. If I wasEsther, I would already have hitten her with a baseball bat. Esther's father is not in the book that much. The only thing I know about him, is that he is a director. Auntie Pie is a weirdo who has a very sweet tooth, Beatrice is an actress who is bad, and that's all I know about them. Pip is probably my favorite character, because he's calm, and he doesn't do stupid stuff. King Roy is following Malcom X's plan of destroying all the whites (yawn, like that's going to happen) and gets mad practically everyday. Esther is worried about the change, and thinks she is getting left behind. She is an outcast even in her family, and everyone thinks she is stupid, except for Pip. All in all, The Summer of Kings is a good book, but it sure is not a masterpiece."},{"Title":"A Summer of Kings","review":"The year is 1963. Fourteen-year-old Esther Young is used to being considered the dunce of her family. All she wants is something new, something exciting to come along and give her an opportunity to show her family how special she is. She sees her chance when King-Roy Johnson, a black man accused of killing a white man in Alabama, comes to stay with her family for the summer.Esther's parents believe that he is innocent; Esther doesn't know what to believe. But she determines to get to know the mysterious stranger living down the hall, and, in the process, learn a little bit more about herself.A Summer of Kings mixes one girl's coming-of-age story with a powerful message about human nature. Full of well-rounded characters that are easy to relate to, Kings engages both the heart and the mind. It deals with the issue of racial discrimination--from the two sides. Both white brutality against blacks and black resentment against whites are dealt with in equal measure. The author uses Esther's story to show readers how the two sides justify their hatred by dehumanizing each other.Esther and King-Roy want an end to segregation and racial prejudice in their country. But while King-Roy is drawn by the fiery messages of angry black leaders such as Malcolm X, who calls for violent uprising, Esther discovers the \\"peaceful resistance\\" teachings of Martin Luther King Jr. and Gandhi--and begins to long for an end to the violence.Together, Esther and King-Roy find a way to face use these teachings to change their own lives and show the world that love is greater than hatred, and brotherhood stronger than bitterness.Armchair Interviews says: A Summer of Kings is a not-to-be-missed books for young adults."},{"Title":"A Summer of Kings","review":"I've read this novel and I'd like to say that it is really one of the best that Han Nolan had written.

She is determined to fall in love with him, and have him return her feelings, an idea that receives much scorn from her best friend 'Pip'. When King-Roy arrives, Esther immediatly likes him, and he immediatly feels comfortable with her. They would be fast friends, except for King-Roy's internal struggle with what he believes is right. After a terrible tragedy results from the peaceful teaching of Martin Luther King Jr., King Roy is more enclined to believe in the teachings of Malcom X, A man who is against whites and believes that the only way to freedom is through violence. King-Roy and Esther will both go through a tough time in there life, in which they search for what is right, and what the true meaning of freedom is.This book is wonderful!

When she gives up what she wants or gets blamed so that the younger ones wouldn't feel hurt I thought it was so real.Anyone who has ever been in the situation of having people complain about them, or they feel so frustrated and just want people to listen to them and try to understand them then the need to read this book.Wha this books back cover or description portrays that it is a romance or a drama. Its not. What the book truly is is a story of a girl who is the least bright one in her family. If her family was a pack of wolves then she would most definately be the omega. She fanasizes of falling in love with a mysterious black man. She is frustrated throughout the entire book because she constantly sees metaphors for her life of being left behind and hopelessness and never being able to do anything right.If you ever feel like you are in a position that you feel like you are just alone and no one is listening to you then you need to read this book. could really connect wit the feelings of frustration in this book.

Book Value Regarding Asking Price Receives No stars! I ordered this new limited edition book of Dark Carnival. While the stories are some of the best ever from one of our greatest living writers, this book is a complete RIPOFF! When I ordered this book for a whopping $...I thought this book was supposed to be signed by Bradbury and Clive Barker and come with a slipcase and a CD. I found neither signature in the book (no signature page) and no slipcase or CD. Only a printed facsimile of a letter to Bradbury's parents from 1947. I later found out that I would have to shell out another $...for a slipcase and the CD. Pricing an unsigned book with no slipcase at $... on a book that should be priced as a trade edition for about $...-$... is outrageous. Although I love the stories, Gauntlet is overpricing this book, especially when they are misleading as to what customers are actually getting for this money. Of the handful of signed limiteds I own, many have much higher production value for a lot less money. I would hope that more writers would take caution when allowing their books to be published here, and they should know what customers are getting for these signed limiteds. This prohibitively priced book that lacks a lower priced trade edition means that only 700 people will be able to own the book. What about the 1000's of other Bradbury fans?"},{"Title":"Dark Carnival","review":"As a Ray Bradbury fan, this is so far the best addition to my collection yet. Beautiful cover, so much bonus material... In relation to the concern the other reviewer had, you can order it straight from the publisher for the same price and it is autographed (by Clive Barker too)."},{"Title":"Dark Carnival","review":"I am a huge fan of Ray Bradbury's work from 1969. To see this book, with autographs, and in a limited edition was very exciting for me.I think the magazine covers, reproduced with the stories, should have been full page and in color. I also think the reproductions of the old letters was of a pretty poor quality. On the other hand, it was really good to see the covers of each magazine in which the story originally appeared, and I loved the inclusion of the letters at the end.My other disappointment was that I apparently did not read the fine print that would have informed me that my copy, ordered through Amazon.com, would NOT be numbered or autographed by either Bradbury or Cline -- contrary to Gauntlet Press's information. I have purchased through Amazon.com for years with GREAT satisfaction, but feel this caveat should have been much more prominent.There should have been a price for the numbered, autographed editions, and a lower price for the one that is, essentially, a general-run book.But, while I feel [the price] is too much for a book that is NOT a signed, numbered limited edition book, I am glad I have the book.Bradbury's writing is awesome and this re-issue should have been out a long time ago."},{"Title":"Dark Carnival","review":"After waiting most of a lifetime to find a copy of Dark Carnival, I was afraid to read it (and diminish its &quot;value&quot;) when I did.

I have just received this deluxeedition of what is probably one of the best collections of dark tales ever. But i have to admit that i am just a little bit disappointed about the overall look of the book. Sure it is printed on good paper, has a smythsewn binding and nice typography. Compared to the standard american/english hardback this one is definetely a lot better and will look good on your bookshelves in many years from now. But hey, [$$$]!!! Thats a whole lot of money, and when you think about what other smallpress publishers can make for only half or less of that price, then i find it too be just a tiny bit too expensive. The extras are nice, especially the old letters, which unfortunately are badly reproduced here. I had also hoped that the magazinecovers that preceed each story had been bigger and in color, as they are too small and blurry.I know that the publisher will say that the book could not have been made any cheaper, especially taking in consideration the low printrun of about 700 copies, but why not have doubled/tripled the printrun which would surely have lowered the price, or made it possible to use colors inside the book. I know that mr. Bradbury probably wouldnt want to sign this many books, but then a certain part of them could have been sold unsigned. I personally would not have minded if it have meant that i would have a more beautiful book!Just my thought, and maybe i am just used to seeing better produced books here in denmark. The firsteditions here are often much more nicely produced than even expensive american limited editions!But anyway, great book and its fantastic to finally seeing it back in print!"},{"Title":"Dark Carnival","review":"I received my copy of this book today, and contrary to the above notice it IS signed by Ray Bradbury, right above Clive Barker's signature. Beyond that, I can't think of another book that has been compiled with such care and artistry.

It's fantastic to be able to return to Bradbury's early classic stories, a few of which have been out of action since the original edition went out of print half a century ago (there were half a dozen or so that were never reprinted in &quot;The October Country&quot;). One of my favorites is &quot;Interim,&quot; a nasty little zinger just a page and a half long.

Otherwise, that would be biggest obstacle to enjoying this book.The book contains a few simple recipes such as French Onion Soup, Nachos, or Fettuccine all'Alfredo. However, most recipes have an asian slant such as Thai Fried Rice, Spicy Beef, Chicken Goujons (think of chicken strips with a spicy bread crumb covering), or Bengali-style Vegetables. The displays for Asparagus Rolls with Herb Butter Sauce and Stilton Burgers offer a fresh approach to old standbys.Every recipe has a photograph of the end result plus illustrations of each of the ingredients and each step of the production process. It is a very attractive book.If you are looking for new ideas, this book may inspire you. To date, I have not cooked a single recipe, although I think I will eventually go to an asian market and expand my cooking horizons."},{"Title":"The Collected Stories","review":"These cozy mystery stories are a must read for lovers of literature, those familiar with academia, and those disillusioned with most media portrayals of women. Amanda Cross (aka the accomplished Carolyn Heilbrun) peppers her stories with humor and literary allusions, good-naturedly exposes tensions between successful women and men (as well as successful old women and young women), and subtly undercuts misogynistic, ageist stereotypes throughout her pleasant stories. Her stories are a fresh change from violent or aggressive murder mysteries. Instead they focus on the enigmatic quirks of life that an amateur detective might actually be called upon to (informally and without payment) investigate.Many of the stories seek to resolve familial disruptions via fair-minded and calming methods, and for that reason seem the ultimate cozies. Nevertheless, at times the ideas are cold or provocative. For example, my favorite line is this one, describing why a clearly unlikeable misogynist might shoot the wrong old woman: \\"If women are all the same in the dark, older women are all the same in the light.\\""},{"Title":"The Collected Stories","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I recomend it to readers of all ages"},{"Title":"The Collected Stories","review":"I was told that Amanda Cross was a good mystery writer and looked forward to reading some of her works.

Munson","review":"Grape Man Of Texas is the biography of Thomas V. Munson, a Texan credited with saving the world's grape crops from the scourge of \\"phyloxera\\" more than a century ago. The collaborative work of Sherrie S. McLeRoy (former museum curator and professional author) and Roy E. Renfro (Vice President, Resource Development, Grayson County, Texas), Grape Man Of Texas chronicles the life and work of a Texas horticulturist who, working from his North Texas base, was able to develop more than three hundred new grape varieties suited for production in the climates and terrains of the Southern United States, this was in addition to his innovative grafting of \\"vinifera\\" onto certain native Texas rootstocks and thereby achieving a means of keeping the growing of grapes as a viable commercial operation in the face of the \\"phyloxera\\" epidemic of the late 1800s which almost wiped out the world's grape production.

Galbraith is an internationally recognized expert on organization design. He is a Senior Research Scientist at the Center for Effective Organizations at the University of Southern California and Professor Emeritus at the International Institute for Management Development (IMD) in Lausanne, Switzerland. This book is a updated/revised edition of 'Designing Organizations' which was originally published in 1995. It is split up into 10 chapters.Chapter 1 - Introduction - really sets the stage for the rest of the book. It discusses the six main organization shapers: the increase buyer power; increase in the number of products and services; the Internet; multiple dimensions (functions, products, and geography, but also customer segments, solutions or offerings, and channels and processes); the requirement for a capacity to change; and speed (in bringing products and services to the market).The following two chapters discuss how companies have to shape their organizational design, strategy, and structure in order how to deal with these organization shapers. Galbraith introduces his copyrighted Star Model (Strategy, structure, people, rewards, and processes), which looks AND sounds very similar to McKinsey's 7-S framework. Chapters 4 and 5 build on these chapter and discuss how organizations have to link their processes to coordination needs and integrate group processes. Then, in Chapter 6 discusses the easily changeable or reconfigurable organization based on the Star Model, which, according to Galbraith, results from the skilled use of three capabilities: (1) forming teams and networks across organizational departments; (2) the use of internal prices, markets, and marketlike devices to coordinate the complexity of multiple teams; and (3) the forming of partnerships to secure capabilities that it does not have. Each of these capabilities are discussed in detail.The Chapters 7 to 10 are all very current and fashionable. They discuss the organizing around the customer, customer-focused structures, the design of the virtual corporation, and organizing the continuous design process. Although the subjects discussed are important, some of the examples are too long and take up most of the chapters. Some of the examples also do not really apply to every company/organization but are too specific. Still, these are issues that should not be forgotten about, especially organizing around the customer remains important.I must admit that I am somewhat disappointed with this book, which is written by a leading authority in the field of organizational design. I believe it is especially the title that lets the book down. It is not so much a guide into strategies and structures; it more discusses the organization shapers and the possibilities that companies/organizations have to tackle the organization shapers. I believe that the book is especially weak in discussing organizational design and structures. Galbraith discusses his own Star-model (which reminds me of McKinsey's 7-S framework) and his reconfigurable organization (the learning organization?), but leaves all other models/designs/structures untouched. I have not been generous, the book really deserves a 3.5-star rating. The author uses simple business US-English."},{"Title":"Designing Organizations An Executive Guide to Strategy, Structure, and Process","review":"Really good intro to ideas and concepts needed to redesign an organization in terms of its structure.

I had previously read SERAPHIM which was most enjoyable. But, this particularly story falls far short of the quality of Hauf's first book.Although the character of Rhiana would seem to be interesting by description (a tall Amazonian dragonslayer with tumbling garnet-colored tresses... a gold eye and a green one... a woman capable in her warrior skills, yet unsure of her feminine attributes...), she actually is not compelling at all.Bored at reading the first fourth of the book, I had to do my \\"stinky book trick\\" which is to jump to the end and read the last few chapters. (If the ending looks better than I expect, I will go back and read the rest.) Unfortunately, except for her eventual meeting with Seraphim & Co. at the end, the culmination of the story seemed just as weak and predictable. So, I closed the book and piled it on my \\"already been read\\" pile and didn't waste another minute of my time.I had just finished reading Michelle Sagara's CAST IN COURTLIGHT which was infinitely more compelling, so perhaps the blandness of this story came in the comparison for me. But, if I can help another reader save a few bucks in the bookstore when they pick up one of this slightly bigger and more costly paperbacks, I like to do so.So my advice is to skip this one... look at the pretty cover art at the store... skim the book jacket overview... peek at the last chapter... and then put it down and move on. If you haven't read SERAPHIM, do so because that is a much better read. But, save your $ on this one!"},{"Title":"Rhiana","review":"In 1437 in the French village of St. Renan, the residents have become complacent because no dragons have come seeking the vast hoard in years. That abruptly changes when a flock of dragons descend upon the village killing anyone outside when they flew over the site. The village has a dragon slayer Rhiana Tassot, a warrior who is not afraid to enter the dragon's lair.She differs from her neighbors as she can belch fire and is not burned when fires strikes her. Rhiana has no explanation for these phenomena and even her own mother keeps a distance from her changeling daughter. With so many dragons in the area, she welcomes fellow dragon slayer Macarius Fleche, the son of the father who trained Rhiana in dragon fighting. In an odd development Baron Guiscard forbids the two slayers from killing any dragons. Unless they disobey his orders, many innocent people will die; but by doing so Rhiana and Macrius would become outlaws.In a society that thinks women are weak, Rhiana proves they can be warriors too, just ask SERAPHIM or GOSSYMYR. There is plenty of action in this exciting romantic fantasy even as the heroine has doubts about the love of her life which adds a charming subplot to a fantasy that can be too tense at times. RHIANA needs to know more about her heritage as she can sense when dragons are near by the tingling in her blood. She makes the tale soar as Michele Hauf provides an entertaining tale that will elate her numerous fans.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Rhiana","review":"I perfer the other two books with Seraphim, and Gossaymer than I do this one. It's ok, it's not fantastic or all that spell binding but it's cute i suppose. Could have been better with more details, and even with more characters.

That is as true in Rhiana's 15th century France as it is today. But strong women will love reading about Rhiana, even if they have never hunted a dragon in their entire lives.Michele Hauf tells another enchanting fantasy tale in Rhiana, the third in her Changeling series (after Seraphim and Gossamyr).For all her strength and unique gifts, and her determination to protect her family and friends from the dragons attacking her village, Rhiana struggles with how different she is, more comfortable in armored tunic than in gowns, not at all feminine like her half-sister Odette. She wonders if she'll ever be courted and kissed.Mysteries abound in St. R?nan - who is Lady Anne, Lord Guiscard's not-all-there wife? Why does Ulrich, Rhiana's first stepfather, suddenly return after a 20-year absence? And who is Rhiana's father?The tale ends with answers to all these mysteries. The resolution of Rhiana's wonderings comes with kisses and courtship from the only man who could truly appreciate her for all she is, Macarius Fleche, the slayer."},{"Title":"American Girls Trading Cards Three Ring Notebook (American Girls Collection Sidelines)","review":"My daughter loves them as much as she loves all of the Samanatha Books and the series."},{"Title":"The Psychic Healing Book","review":"This book contains simple, straight forward information about how to understand and utilize your psychic abilities.

At her therapist's request, Emily recalls each of her boyfriends starting in her twenties, and works her way up to the present. Dr. D, her therapist, tells her to come up with ten reasons she shouldn't date each man.A chapter is given to each boyfriend, except for one man who gets two chapters; and each chapter is interspersed with reasons (Reason #1, Reason #2, and so forth). Therefore, you already know the relationships aren't going to work, so there isn't much in the way of suspense or dramatic tension to propel the narrative.What does keep the novel going? Gerlach has a fresh and funny, though not sophisticated voice, occasionally marred by lapses in grammar. The most compelling of the boyfriends is Reese, a pro baseball player who worms his way under Emily's skin, and \\"pushes all her little girl buttons,\\" says her therapist. Most female readers will relate to the way Emily falls in love with the idea of Reese, and how when he pushes her away, not knowing what he's thinking \\"drives her batty.\\" She even hires a PI to find out if he's cheating, only to find that he's eating pizza and watching Caddyshack alone.

She analyzes with her psychologist \\"coach\\" Dr. D. how come she has failed to find Mr. Right, but has a lifetime of Mr. Wrongs. Dr. D suggests she draw up a top ten reasons of why these are Mr. Wrongs.Emily begins evaluating the attributes of the hunks she dated to see what trait made them terrible spousal material. She begins to see a pattern of hooking up with womanizing rats starting with her boss and continuing with others including the baseball player. As she begins to realize she exists in the ooze beneath the lowest rung of the Hollywood food chain, with the help of her loving canine Sam and a couple of true friends, Emily begins to look inside to learn why she punishes herself with these losers because she now knows that to find the man who will love her she must first learn to love herself.EMILY'S REASONS WHY NOT is at times an amusing chick lit tale though the heroine is no Letterman or for that matter even a Jones and her whine can turn into a headache. The story line focuses on Emily's analysis of her failed relationships and what she really expected from them. Die-hard genre readers will appreciate her lament as Emily provides solid reasons why fans should read her bemoaning bio on the men in her life; others take a pass.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Emily's Reasons Why Not: A Novel","review":"I'm sorry I wasted my time with this book, if that is indeed what this hastily-thrown-together mishmash is supposed to be. Here's why you shouldn't waste your time reading it:There are far too many characters, and you won't care about any of them. Emily simply rehashes to her therapist every guy she's dated, all of whom fit into stereotypical \\"types\\" (i.e. mama's boy, surfer dude, various forms of philanderers). Even her best girlfriends are ciphers, with no distinct personality traits . (Note to aspiring authors of chick-lit: it's called \\"characterization,\\" and it makes people enjoy reading your book. Yes, events can and should happen in your character's life, but unless we're interested in the people they happen to, most readers would rather close the book.)Another thing that annoyed me intensely: Emily's life is narrowly confined to her desperation over not having a man. Her work life is only mentioned a handful of times, and we never see her doing her job. I'm not (God knows) asking for a report on PR work, but how is she so successful when her job is apparently so low on her list of priorities?There's more I could say but I won't.

Emily, the main character here, does little more than spew insights about the previous men in her life. This is not riveting reading, folks. There is none of the sparkling introspection of Bridget Jones, and the fact that Emily has the requisite female friend duo and the gay male sidekick only serves to further diminish the originality of this pale imitation."},{"Title":"Emily's Reasons Why Not: A Novel","review":"\\"Hollow independence\\"?

Emily Sanders, our main heroine of this novel, seems to have an extraordinarily good nose at picking out the wrong man. So she decides to go to therapy to see what she is doing wrong. Her therapist tells her to make a list of 10 reasons why she thinks it didn't work out for her past relationships. So she does.The novel goes back and forth in time, and tells the story of each of Emily's relationships, while Emily lists the reasons why she thinks it didn't work out. Each of the stories are really good. When she gets to her most recent relationship, which she is still in at the time of therapy, she begins listing why she knows deep down that the relationship won't work out either.This was a great book. I personally feel as though I've learned some things about dating Mr. Wrong, which was an added benefit of reading this novel. Through all her bad choices with men, Emily doesn't seem to me to be a pushover or idiot; instead she seems intelligent and funny, but just needs some guidance in her love life. Another great thing about this novel was that although it went back and forth from past to present, it didn't once get confusing.The only thing about this book that I didn't like as much was that the writing seemed awkward and did not flow smoothly. I ran across a couple of grammatically incorrect sentences that made me raise an eyebrow.However, overall this was a great book that I really enjoyed. Best of all, I feel I came away with some good pointers about how to spot Mr. Wrong. This book definitely isn't for everyone - if you don't like stories about a woman sitting in therapy and rehashing the past mistakes she's made with men, then you most likely won't like this book.

It must be very difficult for an author to make her heroine so unappealing, we wonder why anyone would be attracted to her in the first place, but somehow, the author manages. Her friends are underdeveloped characters and I dont think I need to be told the same \\"reasons why not\\" three times (one list for every guy is okay, but we get THE SAME lists during each chapter, at the end of each chapter, and then again at the end of the book).

I think the editor was on vacation because there were so many grammatical mistakes and sentences that just didn't make sense. The time line of events was disjointed and I never got the feel of how long these relationships actually were. The book had no flow and you found yourself not connecting with any of the characters. Which is odd because the scenarios Emily went through were so universal that you should have been connecting with her. The other characters might as well never even been in the book they were so pale and underdeveloped. Why even put them it? Filling space I guess. The men Emily dated were such stereotypical men that you didn't feel sorry for Emily-- you felt like yelling at her for being so utterly stupid. And to put so much emphasis on sex (which is all she seemed to think a relationship was about) just made her character even more unlikable.

As another reviewer noted, the character is unlikable, and the book is so poorly written and edited that it is rendered unreadable.

Give it a try, and you might like it better than you thought you would.This novel is about a young, reasonably attractive and moderately successful woman looking for love in an image obsessed Hollywood world. Unfortunately, the L.A. singles market is just a little too saturated with self-centered wannabes, with very little quality in a sea of too much quantity. After being urged by her shrink to create a list of \\"Top 10\\" reasons why past relationships didn't work out, Emily begins to learn that while searching for Mr. Right, it might be a little difficult to avoid past mistakes.Granted, this novel lacks a little in depth, but what it lacks for depth it often makes up in style. The main characters can, at times, be a little one-dimensional, due to the fact that they are based on stereotypes, but I still maintain that there is a lot of fun to be had with this book. Stereotypical characters lacking any real depth aside, the story and idea are more fun that it looks. Can any one of us make a great list of reasons why our failed relationships didn't work out -- and actually avoid making the same mistakes? No! We're all human, and so is Emily. She ends up doing a lot of soul searching, while really only having a lasting commitment with her faithful dog (which is actually a heart-warming relationship -- probably the only real one in the whole book). However, in the end Emily continues on down the twisted road of life and love, as we all must do.Unfortunately, this novel was the basis for a sitcom starring Heather Graham that failed miserably in the worst way possible. Despite being heavily hyped prior to it's debut, the show was cancelled after one episode! I'm not sure if it was possibly a scheduling or contract conflict , or the absolutely abysmal ratings it's first episode received (here's a hint -- it's the latter), but in the end I think the only damage the failed show did was to the merit of it's predecessor -- the book!I'm not going to lie, this won't be the best novel you've read -- but it's still charming in it's own way, and a great fun bit of chick lit."},{"Title":"Emily's Reasons Why Not: A Novel","review":"This was a very funny, smart look at single 20-30 somethings life with a sort of odd ending...

Dealing openly with Szilard's ambitions, obsessions, and fears the book delves into the intriguing details of his intensely adventurous life. For example, the very day in 1933 Adolf Hitler became Chancellor, Szilard caught the last train out of Germany; saving his worldly possessions and himself from the hands of the Nazis. Szilard's pluck is revealed when in England, not having access to a laboratory, he borrows equipment and performs perhaps the first nuclear physics chain reaction experiments in his hotel room! Throughout the details of his evolving atomic theories and practical inventions is woven his love life. Because of his genius, vision, and high human values, Szilard is always regarded with suspicion; especially by the American military bureaucracy. Indeed, General Grove who oversees the United States atomic bomb project has it in for Szilard; and even tries to get him deported as an undesireable alien. This is the story of the man who not only ushered in atomic power into the 20th Century but maintained his individuality while doing so. A somewhat sad love story is woven through the fascinating history of Szilard's atomic power. Many classic photographs of Szilard at important and personal events accompany the very well organized text. Although not a literary masterpiece, this book is a biographical masterpiece and should be read by scholars and romantics alike"},{"Title":"Genius in the Shadows : A Biography of Leo Szilard : The Man Behind the Bomb","review":"Anyone interested in Szilard, early 20th Century World History, the A-Bomb, or all of the above will find this book hard to put down.

One marvels at its continued relevance into the 21st Century. Dewey, arguably America's greatest thinker, does an amazing job in sifting through the problems contemporary society faces when forming a polity.The point Public and Its Problems brings up on more than one occasion is the need for political and social policy to incorporate the scientific method of testing and retesting to generate better results. Dewey refers to this as an experimental social method and surely felt corporate capitalism had used up its testing time and that a new socio-economic system should be tried. Public and Its Problems talks about how policies and theories need to be constantly in flux and not rigidly adhered. The social sciences would then work to investigate and interpret the results of the testing process.One portion of the book gives a fascinating look at a puzzling quandary Dewey proffers: that being the contradiction of the French and American revolutions having a philosophy of individualism while being massive collective efforts. This section makes for some complicated reading but it's enthralling nonetheless because it touches on a fundamental political and philosophical question. It's in this chapter of the book where he goes on to pose one of the more audacious and profound points of political thought: the essential fallacy of the democratic creed being that it assumes free human beings can rule themselves. (He obviously does say democracy is a good thing given that it threw off a restrictive cloak.) Dewey goes on to elaborate on the point indicating that what's critically necessary is an improvement to the methods and conditions of debate and discussion. Public and Its Problems goes on to ostensibly say it's the corporate capitalist press that controls policy conduct by controlling public opinion. A most astute observation. Of course this opinion is of a public that hasn't found itself, Dewey asserts. He writes \\"the modern economic regime control present politics much as dynastic interests controlled those of two centuries ago. They effect thinking and desire.\\" Here he touches on false consciousness and monopolistic control over our culture and institutions and the insidious way they thwart the public from finding itself and rallying for its concerns.Most importantly, Public and Its Problems contends that the majority populace can indeed make wise decisions regarding our present day technocratic culture; the key is that they must have access to unbiased sources without a vested interest (commercial profit) in the issue. Only with a relatively independent conduit of information can the masses make informed decisions on complex subjects. Clearly Dewey would be quite dismayed to see the state of the mass media today, being wholly owned and controlled by big corporate conglomerates. He would no doubt find it nearly impossible for a public to make intelligent decisions when pseudo-fascists like Michael Savage, Joe Scarborough, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, Pat Robertson, Laura Ingram, Rusty Humphries, Michael Reagan, G. Gordon Liddy, Ann Coulter (the proud daughter of a union buster), Mike Gallagher, Bob Grant and William Kristol; along with myriad centrist status quo apologists, set the agenda. In one paragraph of the book Dewey showed incredible foresight by remarking that society \\"seems to be approaching a state of government by hired promoters of opinion called publicity agents.\\" With current political discourse being dictated by PR firms it's obvious he was right on the mark eighty years ago when he made the prediction.Dewey comes back to an important question routinely throughout, that being what are the conditions that make the transformation possible for the \\"Great Society\\" to change into the \\"Great Community\\"? The Public and Its Problems does much to stimulate thought on this vital issue that still plagues contemporary society, especially in the United States when the state was able to wage a war on Iraq when virtually ninety percent of the world was against it!Dewey's book serves as a tremendous introduction to history's greatest pragmatic philosopher."},{"Title":"The public and its problems,","review":"Dewey's work here is hard to place: it is certainly not liberal, it is not quite progressive nor is it really socialist, it is something entirely different. This is a book that might take many readings to unearth its meaning, but is entirely worth it for everyone from historians to political scientists to citizens alike. Dewey's argument focuses most closely on where to locate the public, how to create communication, and in turn, community, and how to reinvigorate democracy through true reform. This book is so enjoyable because Dewey is addressing many of the same problems we face today.His prose is thick, and it might seem slightly ambiguous and vague until the second reading (it surely did for me). Ultimately I thought it was well worth the time I put into it."},{"Title":"The public and its problems,","review":"Dewey, in response to Lippmann (phantom public), gives a diagnosis of what is wrong with today's fading public participation and incentive to act in politics. I do not rate this book five stars only because he gives a vague description of exactly how these conditions to upturn public voice can be met. Overall it is an excellent book for those interested in modern public issues."},{"Title":"The public and its problems,","review":"Reading this book reminded me why I'm not a poli-sci or sociology major. It's not that there was anything awful about the book, it's just not my 'cup o tea' as it were.The book is actually a collection of thoughtful and insightful lectures-turned-essays contemplating the form of democracy and what truly constitutes a \\"public\\", a \\"society\\", a \\"community\\" and what government's involvement should be in all these.For me, the writing had some great nuggets scattered throughout but unfortunately I found myself bogged down by writing that felt otherwise tedious. Dewey is obviously very smart and full of great ideas. Too often for my taste, this resulted in (what I felt) lengthy passages where he took a ton of effort to try and expound on a single thought without getting to a clear point until wandering around the subject for 5 or 6 pages.Again, my distaste is mainly due to not having any real deep interest in the subject (which is part of what he exposes as one of the problems of a public...that there are far too many things out there such that a person can't truly be educated or even interested in everything). I found my eyes growing heavy many times and had to put the book down at risk of falling asleep.Still, as I persevered an applied heavy concentration, I found myself enjoying and agreeing with many of his premises.I really appreciated his assertion on the importance of consequences and how it is the consequences of a thing that brings people together. Where a lot of the problems come about is that there are far too many distractions out there such that an individual, or even a collective \\"public\\" can't focus on all of the necessary consequences. As a result, even in a \\"democracy\\", there are only a handful of individuals sufficiently knowledgeable to properly react to the stimuli around us and predict the consequences to the extent that they can ensure a promising future.Along with the 'uneducated' implication of having all these stimuli, we also have a problem in that everyone is being pulled in so many disparate directions that we've lost any real sense of community. There are \\"too many publics\\" out there. We can't have a solid national or global community because everything is truly a microcosm of each of our individual interests, needs and desires. Any \\"community\\" we have is generally very small based on a handful of common interests with others and a single person may be a member of multiple \\"publics\\" or \\"communities\\", sometimes even at odds with one another.Until society can find some way to use its collective knowledge and advances in technology and communication, we can never truly have a \\"Great Community\\" in the sense of a solid national or global community all united and on the same page.What was very intriguing to me is that this book was written 80 years ago and many of the anecdotes he uses could be used today without changing any of the language. If anything, in the past 80 years, I would suggest that the world has gained even more \\"publics\\" and an even more disparate society that continues to lack in a great sense of \\"community.\\" At the same time, some technologies such as the various social networking sites, tweeting, and the blogosphere are helping to create a sense of community. But this isn't the type of community Dewey would have preferred as he was a proponent of truly getting to know the individual...and when we're veiled behind the mask of the Internet and technology, we lose something.***2.5 stars (though I can definitely recommend this higher to a follower of poli-sci or sociology)"},{"Title":"The public and its problems,","review":"It was a good treatise yet after reading this, I wonder what it was that i just read.

He tries hard but ultimately fails. He fails because he has internally inconsistent arguements. For example, evolutionary change in \\"types\\" after the flood is acceptable to him but evolutionary change prior to the flood from a more common ancestory is unacceptable; the flood killed off every single representative of several species INCLUDING aquatic species and burying their bones catastophically, \\"like a cement mixer.\\"The PhD after his name doesn't qualify him as an expert in far-flung fields, yet he has the galling hubris to act as though he understands genetics and molecular mechanisms of DNA change in a very intimate way. This arrogance wouldn't be so annoying if he didn't make obvious errors central to many of his arguments. For example, breeding and specialization does not involve a loss of genetic information (alleles) but a modification of an existing pool. Also, there are well-observed mechanisms causing an increase in genetic information such as gene duplication, transposition, and repeat errors in DNA copying.One last word. While Sarfati condemns evolutionists for being unwilling to think outside of our box and being restrained by academic tradition, the irony is lost on him that his absolute dependence on an already preordained interpretation of events is far more dogmatic and closed to further investigation than any evolutionary biologist could ever be.If you search for your answers in genesis, don't bother with this book, it presents plausible but erroneous data to justify a matter of faith.

After reading this book, you will understand evolution so well you will know why it is an absurd interpretation for the origin of the world and the life on it."},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"Within the short space of 140-odd pages, this book gives a clear, well-documented summary of the major topics of the creation-evolution controversy, e.g. origin and complexity, the design inference, the essential difference between micro- and macro-evolutionary change vis-a-vis the factual evidence (something evolutionist advocates deliberately gloss over), the religious commitment of evolutionists to naturalistic assumptions, etc. The putative evolution of birds, whales, and humans are given a chapter each. The author effectively marshals the scientific evidence to demonstrate that the frequent claim that evolution is proven beyond reasonable doubt, is baseless.Practical and experimental science is religiously neutral, but evolutionary theory is not. Witness the fact that atheistic scientists frequently use evolution to promote an atheistic worldview, while ruthlessly attempting to censor its critics. This pervasive attitude is illustrated by the following words of a leading evolutionist, quoted in the book:&quot;We take the side of science in spite of the patent absurdity of some of its constructs, in spite of its failure to fulfil many of its extravagant promises of health and life, in spite of the tolerance of the scientific community for unsubstantiated just-so stories, because we have a prior commitment, a commitment to materialism. It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us to accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world, but, on the contrary, that we are forced by our a priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how counter-intuititive, no matter how mystifying to the uninitiated. Moreover, that materialism is an absolute, for we cannot allow a Divine Foot in the door.&quot;Despite its misappropriation of the word &quot;science&quot;, the above quote shows why the controversy is so important. This book makes a valuable contribution to that controversy."},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"Since the subject of this book as a whole is just to silly to contemplate, I will simply reply to John Doughboy's review below where he says, \\"The book is valid\\" (Note, he's from Texas)...Now, for one thing, BOOKS are not the sorts of things that *can* be Valid. Only arguments can be Valid.The Philosophy of Logic tells us that a deductive argument is said to be valid if and only if it takes a form that makes it impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion nevertheless to be false. Otherwise, a deductive argument is said to be invalid.A deductive argument is SOUND, however, if and only if it is both valid, AND ALL OF ITS PREMISES ARE ACTUALLY TRUE! Otherwise, a deductive argument is unsound.Now (I don't think it is but) it may be the case that the arguments in this book are Valid. But they are MOST DEFINITELY NOT SOUND. Evolution is a FACT. Thousands of scientists, including religious, God-fearing scientists Know this to be the case.Intelligent Design is NOT SCIENCE. In order to be a science you have to be able to make *a prediction* and then *test* for it!But here's the Big Point for these so-called Christians! What ever happened to FAITH?Faith is a very powerful thing and you either have it or you don't. And if you *do* have it, you would probably assume that the condition obtains, or could obtain, for any number of people. And if you have faith, then you don't need ID. Religion is a heart thing, not a head thing. That's why Jesus and Mary in Catholic paintings are always pointing to their burning hearts and not their heads! Even the Buddhists have their \\"1000-petaled Lotus\\" which is the heart and all it's layers like the petals of an artichoke (Lotus is a member of the artichoke family)) one must pull back all the layers of one's heart to get to the truth at the core (Nothingness). So this whole head/intellect/ID/argument thing is kind of a cop-out from the religious angle in all actuality. It shows the weakness of the ID proponents own convictions and the fact that they LACK faith. That's how I read it.Hegel thought that one could, at last, contain all of experience, including religious experience, in a logical system. Many of Kierkegaard's writings are in reaction to this idea. Kierkegaard wanted to prove that Faith cannot be contained in a logical system, because it is, at base, paradoxical. It is the condition of holding two completely contradictory beliefs at exactly the same time -- a state which cannot exist in logic because of the law of non-contradiction. So Kierkegaard says, \\"I cannot understand Abraham\\" because Abraham knew, at the same time, that God wanted him to murder Isaac and at the same time that God would never let him kill Isaac. If he leaned one way or the other it would not be faith. Faith has to believe both equally at once. The Knight of Faith knows that it is impossible to ever win the Princess's heart, and yet at the same time, he knows the Princess will be his. That's Faith...knowing with all your heart that it is impossible for something to be true and believing it to be true with all your heart anyway.As soon as you go off in search of some kind of empirical proof for what you believe (e.g. the goal of ID) you have fallen out of the paradox, which is to say, out of Faith. You are a Hegelian looking for a system.I DO think there is something beautiful about the underlying **poetics** of ID -- but like it was for the German Romantics who called Nature \\"God's other Book\\" -- they saw order and structure too and saw it as a proof of a Creator. I love that aesthetic! But as far as it works to be a science, it is no better than seeing the Virgin in a tortilla.The sad thing is that people who believe in ID have no understanding of science, and moreover, no faith in God."},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"This book is good. It doesn't touch every single subject, however. If you're looking for an exhaustive book about the fraud of evolution then this book is not it. BUT if you are looking to show your friends who are learning evolution in school this is for you and them. Someone posted earlier \\"why write the book since no evolutionist is going to be converted to creation anyway?\\" (Paraphrased) Well it is better than just throwing our hands up and not giving a defense of facts, don't you agree? Maybe because when people who train the nation's children lie to them, it is our job as truth seekers to uncover suppressed findings and facts. I've had friends turn from evolution to creation because of things like this so fast the lights flickered on and off. Don't underestimate the power of a good and honest heart that seeks, loves, and accepts truth. Anyone with common sense and using a tiny bit of logic rules out naturalistic/theistic evolution as an acceptable explanation of anything. This book is for those people. More helpful works are:Truth About Human Origins by Brad HarrubIn Six Days (50 scientists write why they believe in creation)On the Seventh Day (the sequal, done by 40 more)Darwin's Black Box by Michael BeheNot a Chance by RC SproulThe Big Bang Never Happened by Eric LernerStarlight and Time by Russell Humphreys (DVD version too)There's a ton of quality material. Illustra Media has alot of good DVD's about the claims of evolution as well. Like I said above, the book doesn't even touch on every scientific law evolution breaks. It doesn't mention causality, inertia, thermodynamics, biogenesis, etc. In Six Days is for you if that's what you are looking for. Enjoy the facts, people, God bless you.UPDATED **Josephine said \\"Evolution is a FACT. Thousands of scientists, including religious, God-fearing scientists Know this to be the case.\\" Using words like \\"fact\\" and \\"scientists know\\" doesn't prove anything. Scientists \\"knew\\" for a \\"fact\\" that germs did not exist. *cough* Carolus Linnaeus *cough* They also \\"knew\\" for a \\"fact\\" that if you put meat in a container, it turned into maggots, which \\"proved\\" evolution. *cough* the container was not sealed and flies lay eggs in meat. Geocentricity was also a \\"proven fact\\" that \\"all credible scientists\\" \\"knew\\". *cough* Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler *cough* You would have believed in their \\"scientific facts\\" too if you had lived back then. You would have felt \\"enlighted\\" and above anyone who disagreed. When claims made as fact are disproven, they are obsolete and we look back at them with a smug look on our face as we think \\"boy were they stupid, not smart like us.\\" Well now macro-evolution, natural selection, and abiogenesis are in that hindsight \\"at least they tried\\" category.Also, creation nor evolution can be \\"tested\\" in a lab. Creation of energy in a lab involves laws of thermodynamics. Evolution has NEVER been tested in a lab, it is not even a theory, but a hypothesis.The \\"destruction\\" of my \\"this book is good\\" is a dejected side show. My review wasn't about etymology and logic, it was about how the book is good. Do I mean the cover is good? Or how about the paper, perhaps? Maybe the words? Or the ink? The binding is it? Who cares. Honestly. If I had written a review in favor of your evolution bias you would have lapped up every word I had under my name.

Yuck.This book is so poorly constructed that I find myself despairing to see that it sells in America. Does this guy Sarfati even understand what evolution is? This is a list of piecemeal arguments that are individually flawed and as a whole present no convincing alternative to evolution. It seems that the only people that will be able to consume this book are those that won't read anything else about evolution. If someone were to read this and then read something like Richard Dawkin's &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot; or &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;, then this book would seem ridiculous, not to mention poorly written.Truly this is bad science writing. I cannot imagine someone could misinterpret things so, accidentally. I believe the authors willfully misrepresent the facts with the intention to mislead the lay public, who they know will most likely not be checking their sources or reading other literature in the field.In the end this is just more fodder for the poor sheep that buy into this stuff. I'm convinced the majority of the readers of this book live in an insulated intellectual environment where this book, their local preacher, and their creationist friends are all they hear from. Scary. My coworker is insane. Or I should say my ex-coworker. Where do they teach people to be so crazy? Did I miss the day when they were teaching insane at school?

Dr. Sarfati refutes several major points of a book called 'Teaching Evolution' in a concise, orderly way. His understanding of the issues and keen insight into the tactics of evolutionist propagandists help to drive his points home even for people who are relatively uninitiated into the Creation vs Evolution debate. His commitment to uphold the authority of the Bible as God's inspired witness of His creation is a testimony to the soundness of his views and should put any concerned Christian at ease with his teachings. Dr. Sarfati is one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"After reading this, I see why people have given it bad reviews, as it challenges the belief of evolution and provides scientific evidence of Creation by God. The facts in this book are very accurate and the author has many references both Biblical and non-Biblical to back up his information. The book does a good job describing different theories and hypothesis that science has skimmed over. Evolution is a hot topic for debate, and although Creationism can not be scientifically prove, evolution cannot either, however, there are many signs, evidence, and indicators that Sarfati points out to demonstrate that evolution is not as sound as some believe it to be.Christian Fobian, Author of Why Christ?"},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"Although it appears that the reviews and &quot;useful votes&quot; posted here are biased in favor of creationism, I'll post my review anyway. I was given this book by a friend, and I thought it will be interesting to know what the point of view of creationism with respect to science/evolution is.The author, who by the way is very well knowledged, throughout the book uses very &quot;scientific&quot; terms in order to dismiss evolution. In order to make his point, he has selected some &quot;hot&quot; topics in science now, such as if the birds descended from the dinosaurs, or not. He also goes to length in describing how whales didn't evolve from land mammals, how humans didn't descend from apes, how the age of the Earth and Universe is more accurate put in ~6000 years, etc. To support these, the author discards radiometric age determination, cites a new cosmology that will allow the light from distant galaxies to travel to Earth in less than 6000 years, and uses gaps in the fossil record to discard evolution.I think it is a pretty mediocre book, since it doesn't bring anything new to discussion, just makes up some ideas, and calls communists and atheists to all the &quot;bad&quot; scientists. And, when the author doesn't have an explanation, he refers to: &quot;The ideas of creation science derive from the conviction that God created the universe - including humans and other living things - all at once in the recent past &quot;.The author forgets that all the advancement of science is a trial and error thing. But the beauty of science is that with a few assumptions everything else fall into place, and we don't have to put everything that we don't understand in the hands of God.I think that if you don't know about science or don't care about it, but you overall believe in creationism, this book was designed just for you. With the tools given here you can &quot;blast&quot; anyone that has no idea how to defend evolution. On the other hand if you are any other type of person, this book is a waste of time and money."},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"Jon Sarfati, a Ph.D in Chemistry, has written a nice little book on the creation/evolution debate.

His ability to concisely explain difficult subjects in an orderly - scientific method is this books strong suit. His chapter on \\"Bird Evolution\\" which deals with the famous Archaeopteryx masterfully introduces one into the major arguemnts without getting boged down in jargon. This is a must for beginners into this subject.His chapter on \\"Variations and Natural Selection\\" is also worth noting.

I highly recommend Refuting Evolution for younger readers, especially those who don't enjoy heavy reading.

All I hear is how dare scientific scholars expose readers to such data and how horrible it is for anyone to have an open mind on an imperically tough to understand subject like creation.

This particular book puts forward a sample of hard questions that evolutionists simply can't answer convincingly. For those who like to read about this subject, this book has only one disadvantage: it only takes a couple of hours to read it.This book by Jonathan Safarti exposes the naturalistic assumptions that are used to define science in a priori materialistic terms, and transform the scientific community in a closed circle of naturalistic friends and some acolites of a purely subjective religious persuasion. Count me out. I simply do not accept those naturalistic rules of the game. They are not required by a true science, one the is ready to go so far as the evidence leads, one that is ready to boldly go where no naturalist philosopher or scientist has gone before. Naturalists have to have faith that somehow nothing evolve to become something, that non-life generated life, that invertebrades became vertebrades, and apes evolved to become man. For them, also, faith is the certainty that something happened that they could not and cannot see.One cannot separate science and christian religion. Both envolve facts and assumptions. If God created the world, including our minds (and science cannot rule that out), then he must have a say in the formation and nature of the real world and of our minds, as well as in the connection between the too. God, the Absolute Reason, the intelligent designer of the universe, allows for the connection between objective reality and subjective knowledge of this reality.Since science cannot prove the inexistence of a Creator, so it cannot define itself as excluding the possibility of there existing one. Richard Dawkins says we are overwhelmed by appearence of design and surrounded by \\"designoids\\". But we now know that \\"specified complexity\\" (Dembski) and \\"irreducible complexity\\" (Behe) are scientific notions that allow us to infer design with reasonable certainty. A refutation of design would rest on improbabilities of the wildest order. Design in nature is not just apparent. What's more, design is not just a purely subjective theological interpretation of the facts. It can now be detected and measured with formal rigour and precision, through the concept of complex specified information, in the same way we infer design in all other fields of human activity. So, if specified complexity can detect intelligence, design and information everywhere else, why not in nature? Why reject objectively detected and measured design in nature just because we have an a priori subjective naturalistc dispostion to do so? Steven Jay Gould's NOMA concept doesn't make any sense. But if evolutionists really want to stick to that concept, at least they should understand that naturalistic philosophy and true empirical science should also be treated by their own standards as two non-overlapping magisteria."},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"Jonathan Sarfati has compiled a delightfully encouraging collection of data to increase the exposure of evolution's crumbling stance against God and His creation.With impartial fairness Sarfati leads the reader through issue upon issue in the Creation/Evolution debate, revealing the shabby constructs evolutionists cling to in the National Academy of Sciences publication, Teaching About Evolution.Focusing on the 'intelligent design' controversy, for one, Sarfati quotes molecular biologist Michael Denton, whom the author classifies as \\"a non-creationist skeptic of Darwinian evolution.\\"\\"It would be an illusion to think that what we are aware of at present is any more than a fraction of the full extent of biological design.

Neither should religious beliefs. I, for one, am perfectly happy to have my religious beliefs kept out of science classrooms. I don't need science to tell me there is a God.

The illustration gives everything away. A menacing hammer labeled \\"SCIENCE\\" is crashing through a glass window that represents evolution. Implicit in the image is a promise totally unfulfilled by the contents of this book - that 'science' (as mangled and misused by the author) somehow refutes evolution!Cynically intended to separate uncritical creationists from their money and the actual facts, this aggressively mediocre publication is typeset in a large 'Weekly Reader' font and format that keeps your fingers constantly busy flipping from page to page. Which is appropriate since \\"Refuting Evolution\\" is essentially content-free.If Jonathan Sarfati has any honest cards to play in the seemingly endless game of whack-a-mole that scientists are forced to play with Young Earth Creationists (YECs for short), he should write them up and submit them for peer review in a credible scientific journal. He won't because science is hard work and Sarfati can make an easy living by taking unfounded pot shots at evolution.The threads of error woven into Sarfati's tapestry of nonsense are numerous and perverse. Here are a few highlights:Sarfati postulates that a lack of helium escaping from the atmosphere of the earth supports its 'youth.' He deliberately ignores the evidence NASA, and many others, have accumulated on helium escape that deflates this lighter-than-air YEC balloon.He also trots out the discredited canard about ocean salinity supporting a young earth interpretation. Unfortunately this creationist gambit conveniently omits well known mechanisms, such as basaltic lava quenching, that removes sodium from the ocean.Another whopper posits that radioactive potassium and uranium are \\"easily dissolved\\" in water and that the leaching of these parent radionuclides from rocks supposedly disrupts radiometric dating calculations. Even if this was the case - and it isn't, the minerals these elements form has everything to do with weathering and solubility - this weak argument ignores lunar samples obtained by Apollo astronauts from earth's airless and waterless moon.Physics, chemistry, and geology falsify Sarfati's hand-waving, assertions, and 'Jesus just-so' stories. How about biology?Here Sarfati resorts to what I like to call the creationist 'argument from low self-esteem' - he attempts to invalidate the molecular phylogenetics that show an extraordinarily close relationship (98% commonality) between human and chimpanzee DNA - and fails spectacularly.From chromosomal fusion and pseudogenes to retroelements and transposons the scientific reality of evolution is expressed in the DNA of every person on earth (including Sarfati). These relics (literally) are millions of non-coding segments of DNA, snippets of our genome that eloquently document common descent with uncommon clarity and incontrovertible evidence.Specifics include how human chromosome 2 resulted from the fusion of two separate chromosomes (corresponding to chimpanzee chromosomes 2A and 2B) after the lineage leading to modern humans split from the one leading to contemporary chimpanzees.Transposable elements, also known as transposons and retroelements (aka 'jumping genes'), such as Alu elements, HERV-K, CMT1A, and GULO provide exacting confirmation of human evolution and our ancestral affiliation with other primates.Pseudogenes (including unitary pseudogenes, duplication pseudogenes and retropseudogenes) also supply eloquent evidence for evolution. Comparisons of pseudogene sequences across species reveal a consistent pattern. Human pseudogenes are most similar to those in chimpanzee DNA, and are highly similar to those of other primates. Species as divergent as rodents and humans also display some degree of ancient pseudogene similarity - additional evidence of our shared evolutionary history with kindred primates, and more distantly related mammals.Genomics research addresses the evolutionary relationship between humans, chimpanzees and gorillas. Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences both show that humans and chimpanzees are more closely related to each other than either is to gorillas. Genome-wide comparison of the human and chimpanzee genomes spectacularly confirms that the genes, chromosomes, transposable elements, and pseudogenes of humans and chimpanzees are strikingly similar.Human mitochondrial DNA diversity, X-chromosome diversity, Y-chromosome diversity, and diversity of DNA sequences in all chromosomes unambiguously reveals that the evolutionary cradle of humanity is located in sub-Saharan Africa, and also tracks subsequent migrations across the entire globe - initially to the Middle East and Asia, then Europe, Australia, and the Americas.So much for 'science,' ala Sarfati but then this book really isn't about science at all. \\"Refuting Evolution\\" is a desperately shrill and pandering mishmash of fundamentalist theology and amateur hour apologetics, based on a literal misreading of Genesis and other parts of the Bible.'Truthiness' is no substitute for the truth; scientific facts, however well supported and tested by experiment and inference, are routinely feed to Sarfati's faith-based shredder to justify his absolute and dogmatic faith in an allegorical creation myth.Earth to Sarfati - evolution is a solidly established and widely accepted scientific theory with vast explanatory and predictive power, based on a solid foundation of supporting evidence. Get over it. You may as well deny gravity (Newtonian or General Relativity). Worship as you please and find spiritual solace in Genesis if you must - but don't pimp science to prop up your irrational and medieval worldview."},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"It appears that Creationism has evolved significantly over the years and is converging to closely match modern evolution theory. In his book Refuting Evolution author Jonathan Sarfati Ph. D. easily accepts formerly proscribed facts: Beneficial Mutation, Natural Selection, and Speciation. He might be writing the next high school textbook on evolution theory except for one critical departure from the norm.The main difference between Sarfati's theory and that of Darwin's successors is that Sarfati does not believe a mechanism exists in which new information can be added to a genome without loss of previous information. He does believe that new information can be added to the information space by replacing information that already exists although only at the loss of the previous information.Sarfati claims that organisms can differentiate, yea even unto speciation, but only within their information space or genome. Sarfati bases this claim on the fact no mechanism exists that allows for simple organisms to increase their information space. As a result evolution to more complex forms is impossible. Of course, the reverse is also true. If such a mechanism does exist, Sarfati's theory would be wrong (at least until he absorbed more evolution theory into his own).Hypothetically speaking, one way that information could be added without loss of information might be the duplication of genetic information. This way the information space could be increased without harm to the organism since the new space still carries the old information. Subsequent mutation of the duplicate produces new information without loss of the old. If genetic duplication were true it would be conceivable that simple organisms could become increasingly complex.In fact, genetic duplication does occur, and has been observed both in nature and in the laboratory. A brief perusal of the currently available literature on the subject produces two known mechanisms for genetic duplication. In the case of transposons, the child carries a second copy of a parent gene or section of chromosome. In polyploidy, fairly common in plants, some or all chromosomes in a parent are duplicated often resulting in very large genomes. In both cases the result is that the child has a genome with redundant information but with increased information space. The two copies can diverge through mutation resulting in a child genome with both new information and greater complexity.The fact that information of genetic duplication is and has been readily available since prior to the publication of Mr. Sarfati's book breeds one of two possibilities. Either author Sarfati's research on his chosen subject is deficient due to gross neglect or, for reasons known only to him, Sarfati is withholding facts and intentionally misleading his readership. Perhaps Mr. Sarfati, and beyond doubt his readership, would benefit if he should spend more time at the library and less at the typewriter."},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"Like most creationist books that I've read, this one is full of elementary errors in astronomy, chemistry, geology and the nature of science. For example, when arguing for a &quot;young&quot; Universe, Sarfati (p. 113) claims that no stage 3 supernova remnants exist in our or neighboring galaxies. However, 166.2+2.5, 180.0-1.7, 189.1+3.0, 279.0+1.1, and 290.1-0.8 are just five undisputed examples of these &quot;nonexistent&quot; remnants.Sarfati (p. 113) also claims that a &quot;lack&quot; of helium escape from the atmosphere supports its &quot;youth.&quot; However, recent NASA images show helium and other gases being SWEPT from the Earth's atmosphere into deep space. One event occurred on September 24-25, 1998 after a solar coronal mass emission.So, why don't creationists use heavier gases (e.g. argon) that won't readily escape into space when they try to date the Earth's atmosphere? Perhaps, it's because the atmospheric 40argon/36argon is consistent with an ancient Earth (Dalrymple, 1984, p. 83; Krauskopf and Bird, 1995, p. 576) and it cannot be distorted to support their interpretations of Genesis.Using poorly known numbers from his allies, Sarfati (p. 114) argues that salt concentrations in ocean water should be much higher if the oceans were billions of years old. This argument also fails. When hot basaltic lavas erupt onto the seafloor, they remove sodium from seawater as they quench. This process, called albitization, refers to the accumulation of sodium in the cooling rocks during quenching. Because creationists ignore this important sodium-removal mechanism, their salinity calculations underestimate the age of the oceans.Sarfati (p. 110) also claims that radioactive potassium and uranium are &quot;easily dissolved&quot; in water and that the leaching of these parent radionuclides from rocks supposedly can disrupt radiometric dating calculations. However, as taught in any introductory chemistry course, (doesn't Sarfati hold degrees in chemistry?) water solubility and the ability of uranium, potassium, and other elements to weather out of minerals depend on the compounds that contain the elements and the oxidation state of the elements. For example, uranium (IV) is generally insoluble in water, but (UO2)+2 is highly soluble (Langmuir, 1997, p. 495-496). Potassium chloride is very soluble in water, but potassium muscovite is not and it's low on Goldich's weathering series. Even if Sarfati's accusations were true, they're irrelevant to radiometric dates on rocks from the airless and waterless Moon."},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"Sarfati's \`book' - small pages, large font and all - seems to be a collection of half-truths, bizarre extrapolations, aspersion casting, and nonsense. Does anyone really wonder why the only people that give it the time of day are lay creationists?The laughable naivet&eacute; displayed by Sarfati in his description of molecular phylogeneticsindicates that he has at best a cursory understanding of it. Considering that Sarfati may have had Batten lookover this section for him - a creationist that has made many of the same errors in his own writing that Sarfati does in his book - there is little reason to wonder how such nonsense made itinto print.Sarfati's 'common designer' alternative is a case in point. He mentionsonly similarities - if he had an understanding of how such analyses aredone, he would - or should - have known that it is not mere similarity thatindicates descent.If this 'common designer' schtick of Sarafti's and other creationists made any sense, should notthe DNA of a whale be more 'similar' to that of a shark, given theirmorphological similarity? Sarfati even alludes to this when he mentions therelationships of crocodiles to chickens rather than reptiles (whichactually, contrary to Sarfati's ignorant implication, makes perfect sense).Furthermore, Sarfati makes a blatant false claim on p. 83:\\"Similarities between human and ape DNA are often exaggerated. Thisfigure was not derived from a direct comparison of sequences. Ratherthe original paper inferred 97% similarity between human and chimp DNAfrom a rather crude technique called DNA hybridization.\\"In reality, the % 'similarity' figures had been batted about for a fewyears - it was the Sibley paper that got quite a bit of attentionbecause 1. DNA-DNA hybridization compares the entire single copy genome2. Sibley and Ahlquist were accused of fraud because they did notexplain the techniques they used in deriving their figures and whenothers replicated their work, they came up with slightly differentnumbers.The original numbers were gleaned form direct DNA sequence comparisons,and, sadly for Sarfati's readers (and Sarfati himself), the numbers have been borne out by ever morestudies using many more loci.Studies pre-dating the S&A; paper cited in Sarfati's book:Chimpanzee Fetal G-gamma and A-gamma Globin Gene Nucleotide SequencesProvide Further Evidence of Gene Conversions in Hominine Evolution.Slightom et al., 1985Mol Biol Evol 2(5):370-389.This paper found a 1.4-2.25% nucleotide difference, depending onwhich sets of alleles are compared.(1.8 kilobases).

Koop etal., 1986.Nature 319:234-238.This paper found a 1.7% distance measured by direct comparison ofaligned nucleotide sequences (2.2 kilobases in a pseudogene). That is98.3%.Just one paper of many post-dating it that come to similar conclusions:A Molecular View of Primate Supraordinal Relationships from theAnalysis of Both Nucleotide and Amino Acid Sequences.

ReMine didn't either.Sarfati does not mention that the calculation applies only to fixed,beneficial mutations, and not all mutations (most of which are neutralwith regard to fitness and so can accrue much faster in a population).Why is that? Was it to make the total estimated difference betweenhumans and chimps seem that much more unbridgeable? Or was it becauseSarfati, like his Answers in Genesis colleague, Batten, doesn't understand (or care about) the difference?Did Sarfati present any evidence that even if that number is correct, thathuman evolution cannot be accounted for?No. Just assertions and emotional rhetoric.Most other topics were dealt with in a similar fashion.Of course, as is clear from the many positive reviews, the average reader will not know - or care about - the disinformation, the errors of omission, the empty rhetoric, etc.Again, when one knows a little bit of science, creationist claims can seem tohave merit.When one knows quite a bit of science, one can see how shallow and nonsensical creationist claims can be."},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"I read this book as a science teacher seeking to understand the fiercely critical stance of some holy rollers in regards to teaching/not teaching evolution in the classroom. I went into the book with an open mind, seeking to understand, and after the first two pages I was so offended I was turned off to everything the author had to say. The author takes many liberties with his blatant stereotypes and clumping of all scientists together into one group of &quot;humanists&quot; and claims that we are teaching our &quot;own religion&quot;. I would submit that religion should be taught at the church and in peoples homes where it BELONGS and let us do our job of teaching science in the classrooms. We DO NOT teach that any religion is bad.....WE AREN&quot;T ALLOWED BY LAW to talk about religion. I think it is arrogant of this author to even suggest that we should teach creation in the classroom. What about all of the other faiths? Shouldn't we teach those too? And what do you know, we will be turning a science class into a religion class. Evolution is a theory and should be taught that way. This book is just more fuel for the fire and does nothing to clarify the issue for me. The author quotes other authors out of context in a vain attempt to cast a dark shadow on the science community. I am offended by it in the worst way."},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"For the most part this book presented a good technical look at the scientific problems of evolution; however, there were a few points that troubled me.1) on page 24 of the book, Mr. Sarfati stated that science flourished in Christian Europe while it stagnated in the rest of the world and that it was a fact attested to my historians of many religious persausions [including some athiests]. However, when he went to provide documentation for this claim, he cited a young-earth creationist source. He could have make a more powerful claim by citing one of these other historians, particularly one of the athiest ones.2) I was dissapointed by the inclusion of young-earth creationism in the book when the arguments refuting the neo-Darwinian paradigm was in no way enhanced by such inclusion. The material was of a high enough quality to stand on its own.Point number two, as stated above, is perhaps the most damaging charge. The title of the book clearly states that the purpose of the book was to refute evolution [by evolution, I mean the neo-Darwinian paradigm]. Its stated purpose was not the propogation of the young-earth position. By including such material, it detracted away from the excelent anti-evolution material presented and calls into question what the true purpose of the book was.Was it written to refute evolution as the title of the book implies, or was it written as a means of proselyting readers to a specific theological interpertation [i.e. the young-earth interpertation of Scripture]?"},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"Sarfati's book contains countless errors and numerous misused references. For example, when arguing for a &quot;young&quot; Universe, Sarfati(p. 113) claims that no stage 3 supernova remnants exist in our or neighboring galaxies. However, 166.2+2.5, 180.0-1.7, 189.1+3.0, 279.0+1.1, and 290.1-0.8 are just five undisputed examples of these &quot;nonexistent&quot; remnants. Sarfati(p. 113) also claims that a lack of helium escape from the atmosphere supports its &quot;youth.&quot; However, recent NASA images show helium being SWEPT from the Earth's atmosphere into deep space. One event occurred on September 24-25, 1998 after a solar coronal mass emission. Considering these readily seen escape mechanisms and the effects of modern helium pollution, the helium content of the Earth's atmosphere in NO WAY conflicts with the ancient age of the Earth. So, why don't creationists use heavier gases(e.g.,argon) that won't readily escape into space for &quot;dating&quot;? Perhaps, it's because the atmospheric 40argon/36argon is consistent with an ancient Earth. Sarfati(p. 114) further argues that salt accumulation in seawater indicates that oceans are &quot;young.&quot; However, this argument fails because creationists have refused to properly consider the removal of sodium from seawater by erupting basalts (albitization). Albitization is real and EASILY identified in the glass rims of pillow basalts. All of Sarfati's attacks on radiometric dating are also erroneous. As one example, Safati(p. 110) claims that with radiometric dating, potassium and uranium are &quot;easily dissolved&quot; in water. However, solubility and weatherability depend on mineralogy and oxidation state. Uranium(IV) is generally insoluble, whereas UO2 +2 is highly soluble. Potassium chloride is soluble, but potassium muscovite is not and it's low on Goldich's weathering series. Clearly, Sarfati does not understand simple chemistry.Geologists know that sediments may be deposited slowly or rapidly by mudslides, earthquakes, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, and other NATURAL catastrophes. Yet, Sarfati's(p. 105) discussions of a rapid depositional event at Mt. St. Helens are presented as news. Besides Pompeii, there have been numerous studies over the years that support rapid NATURAL deposition, including the 1973 studies at Laacher See, Germany. Sarfati(p. 106) also mentions creationist Berhault's lab work on rapid sediment layering as if it's news. However, Berhault's results are similar to layering in catastrophic turbidites, which geologist Bouma described in 1962. Sarfati(p. 105-107) is also mistakenly believes that local natural catastrophes can just be scaled up to produce Noah's flood. As geologists discovered by 1840, nature refutes creationism (e.g., blueschists, varve cycles that correspond beautifully with the Earth's 100,000-year eccentricity, thick non-hydrothermal salt deposits, extinct short-lived radionuclides, radiation movement from the Sun's core, fossil soils, metastable aragonite and obsidian, in place coral reefs and their growth rings, silica cement, fossil desert ventifacts, and even polonium haloes according to a 1989 article by Odom and Rink). Polystrate trees may form from modern mudslides and hurricanes. However, sometimes, their formation is much slower than Sarfati(p. 107) realizes. For example, in 1700 AD, an earthquake caused some coastline trees in Washington State to sink to a few meters below sea level. They're still standing today and are slowly being buried to form polystrate trees. Other modern polystrate trees occur in Texas and at Mt. St. Helens, all without Noah's Flood.Sarfati(p. 110) mentions how creationist Austin obtained &quot;anomalously old&quot; radiometric dates from Mt. St. Helens. Austin's photographs CLEARLY show zoned feldspar and other broken xenocrysts in the volcanics, which indicate a long history. Considering the enormous number of microscopic xenocrysts in the photographs, it's ignorant to claim that anyone could effectively remove them before the samples were dated. No wonder Austin got old dates. Interestingly, Austin's dates of the impure mineral fractions are consistent with Bowen's reaction series and indicate a LONG history for the volcanics.Sarfati(p. 18) is correct that science only favors natural explanations. Natural explanations are superior to the wild, untestable supernatural speculations that originate from the boundless imaginations of creationists. If creationists believe that it's suitable to invoke supernatural explanations in biology, why don't they advocate their use in courtrooms, forensic labs, sanitariums, and hospitals? Obviously, even creationists realize that bacteria better explain diseases than demons. Furthermore, any defense attorney would be disbarred if he/she argued that a demon and not the suspect committed the crime. Whether we're dealing with a murder victim, thick salt deposits, or diseases, viable explanations don't involve gods, demons, Noah's Flood or Jack Frost. While creationists object to the lack of eyewitnesses and repeatability in paleontology, how many of them will object to the sole use of forensics with its lack of repeatability and eyewitnesses in criminal trials? Murderers are often solely convicted on forensic evidence without any eyewitness testimony. Indeed, DNA evidence is superior to eyewitness testimonies, which often conflict. At the same time, forensic scientists may have less evidence for the death of a victim than paleontologists have for the death of a dinosaur. How many creationists will demand subjective eyewitness testimony before suspects may be convicted and executed?Sarfati(p. 15) claims that creationists rely on science, but they really rely on &quot;god-of-the-gaps.&quot; Whenever science finds natural explanations and the gap closes, creationists simply remold their plastic Bible interpretations to claim that the Bible had the answers all along (e.g.,Sarfati,p.97-98) or that the obviously ridiculous verses are just non-literal &quot;poetry&quot; (e.g.,Sarfati,p.100-101). Sarfati repeatedly attacks contemporary Christians that support an old Earth in ways that are far more childish than ANYTHING I've ever seen among evolutionists. At the same time, Sarfarti(p. 26) has double standards for famous unorthodox Christians of the past. For example, while denouncing Ross and other contemporary old-Earthers, Sarfarti praises Buckland, Cuvier, Agassiz and Kelvin. Kelvin, for example, believed that the Earth was older than 20 million years. Sarfati(p. 26) also admires Newton, but ignores his Unitarianism. Sarfati (p. 29) even praises Wernher von Braun, but overlooks von Braun's nazism. Galileo, Copernicus and Steno were creationists as Sarfati(p. 26) states, but considering the lethal intolerance of Catholics and Protestants back then, few (DaVinci, Buffon) were brave enough to criticize creationism. Because of the numerous errors in &quot;Refuting Evolution,&quot; this book fails to refute anything."},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"Sarfati's science is abysmal. Period. Victoria University of Wellington should be ashamed of itself if this is the kind of \\"scientists\\" it is turning out, although I suspect Sarfati's religious pathology would misconstrue the facts of scientific reality no matter where he earned his degrees.REFUTING EVOLUTION is so full of elementary errors in astronomy, chemistry, geology and the nature of science, that I half-suspected Sarfati to be an 'agent provocateur' really working in the service of science and that he was only offering up this book as 'disinformation' to make the Creationists look bad by assuming they were either too ignorant, too lazy, or too complacent to bother researching his laughable (and patently inaccurate) claims.The more I read, however, it began to dawn on me that Sarfati actually believed the fantasies he was doling out even though they go against all the basic findings of elementary science. This is downright frightening, to see how religious fanaticism (a kind of mental pathology) should have such a stanglehold on what might otherwise turn out to be a strong and rational mind. It's a pity to see such potential wasted in the service of supernaturalism, magical thinking, and science fiction! What else is Sarfati deliberately and rigorously pretending not to know?"},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"This book is a response to an educators guidebook, published by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), called \\"Teaching about Evolution and the Nature of Science.\\" The author uses this guidebook as a springboard for various quotes and introduction to creationist ideas, concepts and arguments. I'm sure the NAS didn't intend it for this purpose, but Sarfati has done a good job of rounding up the many holes and difficulties faced by those who hold to the evolutionary model.Such as:Sufarti quotes DMS Watson in Nature: : \\"Evolution [is] a theory universally accepted not because it can be proven by logically coherent evidence to be true, but because the only alternative, special creation, is clearly incredible.\\" To which Sufarti rightly concludes: \\"So it's not a question of biased religious creationists versus objective scientific evolutionists; rather, it is the biases of the Christian religion versus the biases of the religion of secular humanism resulting in different interpretations of the same scientific data.\\"For example:\\"For scales to have evolved into feather means that a significant amount of genetic information had to arise in the bird's DNA which was not present in that of its alleged reptile ancestor.\\" Sarfati shows that Natural Selection actually inhibits the supposed transitional creatures from ever surviving. Natural Selection is biased toward those who are best fit to live in its present environment. Sarfati points out that Birds with their, \\"avian lung, with its super-efficiency, becomes especially advantageous only at very high altitudes with low oxygen levels. There would have been no selective advantage in replacing the reptilian lung.\\"Another good point made by Sarfati is the question of what would it take for a rational person to recognize that something was designed? The SETI project uses, the criterion of \\"a signal with high level of specified complexity--this would prove that there was an intelligent sender, even if we had no other idea of the sender's nature.\\" And Sarfati points out that within our cells is just that same specified complexity. Tiny motors that drive the flagellum of a bacterium and magnetic sensing systems found in many organisms, are an example of this specified complexity. But, and Sarfati's first point is right even to the end, that most evolutionists are committed to evolution, even before they open their first book, \\"so the evidence, overwhelming as it is, would probably have no effect.\\" I enjoyed reading this book, as Sarfati did a good job of summarizing the many issues surrounding this debate."},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"This book is not only unscientific, it is actually dangerous. I will make a statement that applies to all examples of mysticism masquerading as science; 1. When a person or a group begins with an a priori statement or assumption and then picks and chooses from amongst the existing data to make ideas fit around their a prioir assumption, that is...well its not science people. 2. Science seeks to disprove hypotheses, at the same time it seeks to draw the most reasonable and cogent conclusions based on the preponderance of the evidence. There is always room for \\"alternative interpretations\\" as one writer put it, however the most likely and simplest explanation (remember occam's razor) should be chosen all else being equal. The fact is that the fundamentals of evolution are solidly proven up, and creationist ID'er are choosing to play around on the edges where science and philosophy begin blending together somewhere over the horizon of provable science or understanding. But my real criticism is this; if you want to believe in creationism I have no debate with that, people are entitled. When you start calling it science and dressing it up for the classroom, I develop something like outrage at the idea. I recently saw a news item on CNN that reported that something like 35% of Americans are firm believers in some form of \\"intelligent design\\", and another 35% or so are unsure. The only question that remains for me is, if there is an intelligent designer, who created these people? This is the kind of thing that will make the United States the laughing stock of the rest of the world. Keep ideas around intelligent design, etc. in its place (religious conversations, campfire discussions, church) and no one will raise an eyebrow, and besides, what is wrong with creationism being faith-based in the first place. Question? Why the driving desire to legitimize it scientifically.Answer. Science is the new religion, and faith needs a foot in the door.Of course there is no shaking someone from a deeply held and emotional belief, so this will change no ones mind, but children who grow up with this in the science classroom are done a tremendous disservice.

Even if you don't accept Creationism, you can not help but to perceive evolution in a new light. Evolution is a theory not a science. Since I began teaching, the Theory of Evolution has changed so much. What was taught as fact 10 yrs ago, has since been proven incorrect. The theory changes too much for a science. Until two years ago, Astronomers believed that the oldest star in the universe was older than the universe itself. This was not at all logical, but they accepted it and continued their faith in their dating methods. A fellow from South Africa was able to prove that their measurement methods were incorrect. Thus the Universe is older than the oldest star. Now let us consider the possibility that the dating methods for determining the age of the earth and fossils are also incorrect. Evolution has become a religion for those wanting to disprove the existence of God. If we teach our children that we accidentally evolved from pond scum, why should they feel special about themselves? I can not accept that we were an accident. Logic would dispute that two humaniods spontaneously evolved in the same area that were biologically compatible enough to produce offspring. In addition, If all creatures are evolving to a higher state, why do we see so much extinction? I propose a lesson in genetics would explain that mutations provide a loss of genetic information not an addition. As a species becomes more specialized, they lose information that is never regained.

Look down below and see that the intelligent-sounding critics don't know what they are talking about. For example, albitization as an &quot;explanation&quot; for the disappearance of salt in the ocean has been shown to be inadequate long ago. Showing that a given material can easily be leached by water is only one of the many flaws of radiometric dating methods that can be cited. There is a world of difference between presently-occurring events that can be checked directly by empirical evidence, and past events whose occurrence and direction of change can only be inferred. Finally, evolutionary beliefs go back at least to ancient Greece.

The attacks by several of the reviewers on Sarfati's book serve only to underscore the blind indoctrination that characterizes evolutionary theory (key word in this sentence: \\"theory\\"). While Sarfati's book is not without some eyebrow-raising statements and logical gaps, his critique of evolution-taught-as-fact is powerful and undeniable. Tellingly, none of the negative reviews acknowledges this argument, let alone refutes it.The point of the book is that there is no scientific \\"proof\\" of evolution, any more than there is \\"proof\\" of creationism or ID. There is a mountain of EVIDENCE that will be interpreted according to one's worldview; some interpretations fit the evidence better than others. But Sarfati's point that one's worldview will ultimately color one's interpretations is completely accurate and is demonstrated in all the reviews of this book here on Amazon (mine included). Something to think about: archaeologists frequently cannot agree on dates and interpretations of data that are, at most, *hundreds* or a *few thousand* years old - yet we are expected to believe that evolutionists can accurately reconstruct *billions* of years of Earth's history with no room for counter argument or dissent. Question an archeological find that dates to, say, 500 BC and you're simply engaging in open scientific discussion; question a dogmatic statement about supposed millions and billions of years of natural history and you're portrayed by the evolutionist crowd as a right-wing bible-thumping ignoramus.Similarly, while some reviewers here complain of the \\"same old arguments\\" against Evolution, they fail to refute them, and also fail to explain how a modern science textbook like the NAS 'Teaching Evolution' book can contain dozens of examples of teaching that evolutionists themselves have refuted and repudiated for years. The unfortunate fact is that, in the origins debate, orthodoxy matters a great deal more than accuracy.As a conservative Christian who believes the Bible, my faith was strengthened by the arguments put forth in this book. Sarfati clearly articulates the ideological battle lines that have been drawn on this issue. The fact that none of the reviews lambasting this book or Sarfati have contradicted one single argument he made is for me an important point.

Much of the book is given over to citing the Bible, and instructing us in what creationsts may or may not believe. Thus, &quot;the Hebrew words for the animals taken into the ark do not include invertebrates&quot; from which it follows &quot;they must have survived off the ark somehow.&quot;(p. 46). Yes, how, and what is the empirical evidence for this amazing statement. On the same page, Koalas could have migrated to Australia from Mt. Ararat. Could they really? Just as easily they could have been dropped by UFOs. There is no evidence for either scenario. One has to conclude that Sarfati has no idea about science despite his Ph.D. There is nothing new in Refuting Evolution. It is astonishing to see how much of modern science the fundamentalist Christians have to reject to uphold their faith. To support their imaginings, devotees have to reject all of historical geology and astronomical cosmology. Any evidence which shows the earth to be quite old must be rejected, which includes earth magnetism, nuclear physics, dendrochronology, as well as glottochronology. What is more, creationists also reject modern historical and archaeological scholarship which sees the story of Genesis as a myth borrowed from older Mesopotamian civilizations. At the end, Sarfati argues that the &quot;intelligent design&quot; explanation is legitimate. He fails to bring forward any evidence showing how a process of deliberate design may have worked. Rather it is the same old negative argument, nature is too complex for the trial and error of evolution. Not even the Bible describes a design process, rather the opening words of Genesis strike this non-expert as plain and simple word magic."},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"Although the author would argue this point vigorously, this is not a book about science. It is a book about religion, as a reading of the first chapter would make completely clear. And it is not just any religious perspective, but that of fundamentalist Biblical literalism. This embodies the young-earth creationist (YEC) position that any scientific finding that is at odds with their particular reading of the Bible, especially the early chapters of Genesis, must undoubtedly be in error. This error is ascribed variously to an incorrect point of view on the part of the scientist(s), to incompetence in performing scientific research, or to a satan-inspired will to disbelieve (with scriptural evidence provided). Against such a backdrop, one wonders why scientific topics are discussed all, since any findings contrary to YEC dogma are rejected out of hand, and all that agree are accepted quite uncritically. The book does serve as a useful conterpoint to its principal target, the pamphlet &quot;Teaching about Evolution and the Nature of Science&quot;, published by the National Academy of Sciences. It mounts the standard YEC arguments in a wide variety of areas in sufficient detail for those versed in those subjects to see their emptiness. For this reason alone, this book belongs in the library of any scientist or teacher concerned with our national scientific literacy."},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"This book goes a long way to demonstrate that, far from being equivalent to such things as the sphericity of the earth, molecules-to-man evolution is extremely speculative. Showing that bacteria can acquire antibiotic resistance is a very different proposition from proving that life came from primordial slime, or that an ape-like creature changed into humans.The hard-core evolutionists will demonize this book all they want, but the facts that it presents just won't go away. As a degreed scientist myself, I heartily recommend it. It exposes many of the flawed arguments for evolution in a lucid manner. After reading this book, the objective reader will agree that it is about time that the intellectuals cease their &quot;all scientists accept evolution&quot; propaganda, face the fact that molecules-to-man evolution is NOT a proven fact of science, and recognize that many educated people reject evolution for legitimate reasons. Members of the liberal media would also do well to read this book.The fact that many religious people accept evolution proves nothing.

Creationists should own it as a current, fairly comprehensive, and absolutely devastating critique of evolution as currently believed and taught.

Yet, fairly well-informed readers will learn much. The book is written in a fairly aggressive style, yet is not polemical (as some other reviewers incorreclty imply). Sarfati knows his stuff, and the critiques I've read quibble about slight blemishes while overlooking the mass of compelling evidence compactly presented, akin I suppose to straining out gnats while swallowing camels.I do suppose, on second thought, that there are some who shouldn't own the book.

Some wouldeven call it unreasonable and its author an unreasonable person,solely on this basis. One could also note here, sometimes, theimplication that what is not \\"proper science\\" cannot be deemedtrustworthy, that every \\"reasonable\\" person should believe thevoice of science rather than other sources.Therefore, in order to see if this attitude is reasonable or not,I need to begin with a general comment on science. What is therole of science? A. Einstein says \\"The object of all science...is to co-ordinate our experiences and to bring them into alogical system.\\" For those who are aware of it, the days when onecould naively think that science is a way to absolute truth arelong gone. Instead, the history of science teaches us, ifanything at all, that any of the theories held true today mightbe replaced tomorrow, in a more or less dramatical way. Withoutgoing into a whole discussion on the philosophy of truth inscience, a generally accepted statement is that the presenttheories are considered better, or \\"closer to truth\\" than theolder ones.One should then inquire where the problems of a certain theorymight arise from, a full discussion of which would undoubtedlyrequire a fairly solid background in many areas of science.However, it is not inaccurate to just say that a theory involvesa mental picture (or representation) of how things work for a setof systems under experimental investigation, of whatever nature.The description must be made slightly more complex by observingthat even the gathering of data itself could be made according toa theory of measurement (i.e. many times the measurement data,far from speaking for itself, requires a set of rules telling us\\"the meaning of what we see\\"). The last, and very important thingto mention is that a theory, be it about abstract concepts orabout the process of measurement, involves a set of primaryassumptions, not to be questioned within the theory (also notprovable within it) and rules of inference. A theory can be wrongbecause of failure in any of the above-mentioned areas and alsobecause the mental world the theory describes is not an accuraterepresentation of the real one.To get closer to subject, let us assume a theory, like the theoryof evolution, would appear to satisfactorily co-ordinate ourexperiences, based on it's primary, unprovable assumptions. Letus also assume that another theory, like the one proposed bycreationists, also appears to fit the data, based on its own,unprovable assumptions. The point is that, if the only placewhere the Bible's message appears was in the unprovable, primaryassumptions, then such a theory would, by the basic principles ofscience, be of precisely the same nature as any non-disputedscientific theory! Moreover, it is a truly unreasonable claim, tosay that the latter is non-scientific, or unreasonable, for thissole reason!! Now, if it did instead, whenever pushed to adifficult position, come up with new miraculous explanations,then the claims of pro-evolution people would start to makesense, but this is not the case, at least in this regard. So,when creationists only mention a young Earth and the Flood andthe living beings fully formed at creation time, and manage toshow how the data we analyze is in agreement with their theorybased on the laws of nature we now observe, then there should beno scientific objection to the science of creation. The onlything one could possibly object to, on a personal, subjectivelevel, is the choice of the unquestionable, biblical foundations.At least one major evolutionist, quoted on p.17-18, has theintegrity of admitting this publicly:\\"We take the side of science in spite of the patent absurdity ofsome of its constructs, in spite of its failure to fulfill manyof its extravagant promises of health and life, in spite of thetolerance of the scientific community for unsubstantiated just-sostories, because we have a prior commitment, a commitment tomaterialism. It is not that the methods and institutions ofscience somehow compel us to accept a material explanation of thephenomenal world, but, on the contrary, that we are forced by oura priory adherence to material causes to create an apparatus ofinvestigation and a set of concepts that produce materialexplanations, no matter how counterintuitive, no matter howmystifying to the uninitiated. Moreover, that materialism isabsolute, for we cannot allow a Divine Foot in the door.\\"The FIRST CHAPTER of the book explains in greater detail, amongother things, just this presence in whatever scientific theory ofthe fundamental, unquestionable assumptions. The chapterconcludes:\\"But the only way we can be really sure about the past is if wehave a reliable eyewitness account. Evolutionists claim there isno such account, so their ideas are derived from assumptionsabout the past. But biblical creationists believe that Genesis isan eyewitness account of the origin of the universe and livingorganisms... Creationists don't pretend that any knowledge,science included, can be pursued without presuppositions (i.e.prior religious/philosophical beliefs). Creationists affirm thatcreation cannot ultimately be divorced from the Bible any morethan evolution can ultimately be divorced from its naturalisticstarting point that excludes divine creation a priori.\\"The SECOND CHAPTER \\"contrasts the evolution and creation models,and refutes faulty understanding of both.\\" In particular, thecreation model of genetic deterioration from perfection isintroduced, together with the natural explanation, within thismodel, of alleged evidence for evolution in action, likeantibiotic and pesticide resistance of some bacteria.CHAPTERS THREE, FOUR and FIVE discuss the problem of the missinglinks and also the very serious problems with the allegedevidence for the very few \\"transitional forms\\" ever discovered.The problem is very simple and very serious, as acknowledged byDarwin himself (p.47): \\"Why is not every geological formation andevery stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredlydoes not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain; and thisis the most obvious and serious objection which can be urgedagainst the theory\\". Since, according to evolution, there shouldhave been many, many transitional forms (a lot more than theactual species), then so should be the probability of unearthingthem, which is clearly contradicted by facts! The \\"transitionalforms\\" are very, very few compared to the others (by relativenumbers are even insignificant, practically zero!) and even thoseunder discussion are controversial. Collin Paterson, seniorpaleontologist of the British Museum of Natural History explainedwhy he did not include any picture of the transitional forms inhis book \\"Evolution\\"(p.48):\\"I fully agree with your comments about the lack of directillustration of evolutionary transitions in my book. If I knewof any, fossil or living, I would certainly have included them...I will lay it on the line - there is not one such fossil forwhich one could make a watertight argument\\"And this is as of 1979, after more than a hundred years ofDarwinism and trials to improve the situation, which now lookssubstantially worse than ever, in what concerns the fossil recordand also other, equally serious objections to evolution, basednot on a consideration of facts from a creationist point of view,but solely on the natural laws in action, as observed today! Ifit comes down to talking about facts, evolution is not a fact atall (to get serious and decent, a fact is something one observes,so nobody can claim evolution NOR creation facts, based on thenormal human abilities of observation we are aware of), but wecan say now that evolution is contradicted by facts (not by ideaswhich pertain to the creationist paradigm!!). We shall see laterthat evolution is also contradicted by pretty well establishednatural laws.CHAPTER SIX discusses human-ape similarities. Well, on asuperficial level, humans and apes look more similar than man andany other animal. However, in order to maintain that man camefrom a less evolved than an ape kind is to posses evolutionistwishful thinking, of the type which can state that the fossilrecord is a proof pro-evolution! Let us pick a certain aspect, onthe difference between the human and ape DNA. The book gives anestimated 96% similarity on page 84 and states that even largerfigures are \\"bandied about\\". This may be a correct or anincorrect statement, given the degree of uncertainty and therelative novelty of the research in question. When I say novelty,I think, for instance, that as of 2002 (if not later, I haven'tfollowed the news in this respect) the human genome has not beenyet sequenced. What it means to be sequenced is described in thesame paper, dated September 2002, from which I am taking thisinformation (Journal of Young Investigators, Vol 6, Issue 3,September 2002 - an Undergraduate, Peer-Reviewed ScienceJournal). One could think that 96% similarity means we are 96%apes... but it could also mean that our biochemistry is justabout 96% similar. The important point the book is trying to makeis that a 4% difference corresponds, given the amount ofinformation coded in the DNA, to 40 large books (500 pages each)of differences. What do some evolutionists say to this? First,they do not address the real issue, but focus on a side,questionable detail, like the reviewer who says that, in fact,98% of the DNA (or even a little more) is known to be the same,claiming that, as of 1984-86 and 1993 (he cites some papers),\\"The original numbers were gleaned form direct DNA sequencecomparisons\\". Okay, leaving aside that he is probably not rightabout his \\"direct comparisons\\" (the human DNA sequencing stillawaits to be solved as of 2002 and, even this being done, thereare some method related accuracy issues - see the paper Imentioned before), let's give him 98%, or even 99%, this stillleaves 10 large books of information in differences, of which thetheory of evolution still has to account for. The question is:can the theory now account for it? The book immediately addressesthe problem: \\"This is an impossibility, even if we grant the 10million years asserted by evolutionists. Population geneticscalculations show that animals with human-like generation times ofabout 20 years could substitute no more than about 1700 mutationsin that time\\". Compare this with the 12 million words arranged ina meaningful sequence the 4% difference entails. Or let's make itonly 3 million words, for the 1% difference. Does it change theanswer? What does the evolutionist reviewer have to say about it?He does not like the 20 years generation rate (he would probablysuggest one a thousand times smaller to help his theory a little)and he says these 1700 are only the beneficial mutations, butother mutations could occur too, in much greater numbers... Hethen accuses the author of not understanding the difference, andfinishes in the following tone:\\"Did Sarfati present any evidence that even if that number iscorrect, that human evolution cannot be accounted for?No. Just assertions and emotional rhetoric.Most other topics were dealt with in a similar fashion.Of course, as is clear from the many positive reviews, the averagereader will not know - or care about - the disinformation, theerrors of omission, the empty rhetoric, etc.Again, when one knows a little bit of science, creationist claimscan seem to have merit.When one knows quite a bit of science, one can see how shallow andnonsensical creationist claims can be.\\"It would be a mistake to engage in this, and maybe a waste oftime to address his statements. If the reader insisted for moreserious proofs on population dynamics calculations, then heshould read \\"Not by Chance!\\" by Lee Spetner, a specialist in thefield. As far as the more recent DNA comparison is concerned, wefind, for instance, the paper: PNAS, 2002 October 15, 99(21):13633-13635, \\"Divergence between samples of chimpanzee and humanDNA sequences is 5%, counting indels\\", by Roy J. Britten fromCaltech, while other recent web-articles cite a differencebetween 1.1-4.0%, depending on what comparison method is used...And, another problem with the apparently so huge resemblancebetween human - chimp DNA is related to what percentage of thetotal DNA chain is genes, i.e. how much really codes forproteins. An estimation of this number is about 1.5%. Therefore,if what does not matter in coding for proteins is the same inhumans and chimps, we get 98.5% similarity! Thus, if a differenceof only 1% lies in the genes themselves, we could get as much as1%/1.5% = 67% difference between humans and chimps and we mayneed a lot more beneficial mutations than 1700 to account for thedifference.CHAPTER SEVEN is on Astronomy and Cosmology, which enters thepicture through the well known Big Bang theory, an essentialingredient to the standard naturalistic-materialist philosophy,in agreement with the theory of evolution. The chapter presentssome important problems of the Big Bang theory and also mentionsa solution of the star-light problem within the cosmologicalmodel of R. Humphreys, a perfectly valid, scientific (GeneralRelativistic) cosmological model, in agreement with the Genesistime-frame of creation. Where does the difference between the6000 (Humphreys) and the many billion (Big Bang) years for ourplanet's age come from? Guess what, from the untestable, apriorichoices at the foundation, each choice being philosophicallyincompatible with the other (which thing has time-predictionconsequences, of course!). So, science tells us the earth is somebillion years old (contradicting the Bible's message), andscience can also tell us the world is 6000 years old, based onpurely philosophical, foundational choices. It is thusscientifically legitimate to take the Bible seriously, if onewants to!CHAPTER EIGHT deals with methods of dating, including radiometricdating, and discusses evidence for a young world.CHAPTER NINE is about the legitimacy of the design argument,including the irreducible complexity argument of M. Behe and theinability of the evolutionary mechanisms to produce theinformation contained in the DNA. These are very, very importantmajor problems for the theory of evolution, pertaining to its ownparadigm and not originating from a creationist point of view.They should be first resolved by evolutionists, together with thefossil record problem, before taking their story seriously evenamong themselves.However, as mentioned in the first quotation I included in thisreview, evolutionists cannot treat the theory of evolutionproperly (by disposing of it) because of their commitment tomaterialism. So, their proposition, taken from a scientific side,is to keep struggling with a theory troubled by facts and byinternal, scientific inconsistency, while denying a concurrenttheory, without such problems, solely because of its differentmetaphysical roots, which are out of question inasmuch as properscience is concerned... Well, this is a matter of personalopinion, and so I would rather stick with the normal science ofthe creation kind. If anybody would prefer other foundations, lethim have the integrity of admitting that and, if his proposal isthe theory of evolution, let him also admit the inherent problemsof the theory and be much less dogmatic about it!"},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"This book is a handy compendiuum of the many fallacies of evolution.

Now I'm not saying scientists are never wrong, but when 99.9% have been saying the same thing for decades, it's probably safe to believe them.To this fact the creationists have 2 answering tactics: either the scientists made everything up (including fossils and rock records), or their science is bad. To the former tactic, one must ask: why? What would be gained by making fake dinosaur bones and claiming they are 200 million years old? All that work to discredit creationists? Seems a tad foolish. As for the latter one, that scientists know less about science than religious zealots, well, it just doesn't make sense. Where are creationists PhDs in geology and molecular biology? Sure, you may find a few here and there, but really that's not enough, and it just leads to the pseudoscience that creationists have been spouting for years, and that actual scientists have been easily discrediting for just as long.My biggest problem with Jon Sarfati's book is not the shoddy science he presents as proof of creation (I won't go into all his faulty data; such topics have been admirably covered by other reviewers). No, my biggest problem with him is that he seeks to prove his faith with data. Its a total non sequitor. Science relies on data to back up its theories: it's the scientific method! Religion, however, is based on FAITH. And faith is belief in something DESPITE lack of proof or data. Thus, to go out and search for tangible proof of your religious beliefs not only shows your weak faith, but is insulting to religion in general. It is this obvious point that creationists like Sarfati miss. Believing God created the universe is all well and good: many scientists also share that view. But to go out and conjure up \\"proof\\" of that belief and then stack that proof against decades of well established science - well, that's how one gets into trouble."},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"This is a very valuable addition to the growing literature on the \\"origins\\" debate. Just as with \\"The Lie: Evolution\\", however, the reader must first understand the intent and scope of the book in order to be able to pass fair judgment on how well it accomplishes its purposes.The scope of the work is made plain on its cover, that is, to rebut the plethora of misstatements and false assumptions presented in \\"Teaching About Evolution and the Nature of Science\\". This rather farcical work of \\"scholarship\\", published by the National Academy of Sciences, assumes evolution as a proven (indeed provable!) fact, and blithely discounts any possibility of an alternative explanation of origins. True science, however, welcomes rather than shuns such alternatives, and ceases to be \\"science\\" when it ceases to allow itself, its methods or its conclusions to be questioned.The intent of \\"Refuting Evolution\\" is to establish that evolution is not the only possible conclusion or inference which may reasonably and rationally be drawn from available evidence about the origins of the universe and of life. It is further intended to show that creationism is a viable alternative to evolution based on that same evidence. The implications of this are staggering to the average atheist for obvious reasons, so they must defend their logically fallacious presuppositions to the death rather than allow even the slightest hint that creation could be true.Within this scope and intent, I thought Dr. Sarfati did an admirable job of refuting the various claims of \\"Teaching About Evolution.\\" It is important to note that the author is NOT trying to prove creation. If you miss this you'll miss the entire point of the book. The author is merely arguing that the best efforts of evolutionary scientists have failed to eliminate creation as a rational conclusion to be drawn from available evidence about the origins of life. Over and over again he punches gaping holes in the NAS's arguments and firmly establishes a viable alternative explanation for each \\"proof\\" of evolution offered by the NAS. The thoughtful reader is left with the inescapable conclusion that evolutionistic interpretations of the evidence are not nearly as unassailable as their proponents would have us believe.The author does all this, however, not as some might expect, that is, by simply reinterpreting the same evidence. Rather, he allows his readers to \\"eavesdrop\\" on the debate among the evolutionists themselves as they tear each other's theories to shreds. It's rather like being a fly on the wall and listening to the bitter bickering of a family that would never allow their true opinions to be known outside the four walls of the home. The evolutionistic scientists, in their bids to outdo and one-up each other, do a fine job of discrediting evolutionary theory without the need for any help from creationists. It's fascinating to listen to what evolutionists have to say about their own theories when they think no creationists are listening.There are some overarching themes that are well developed throughout the book, such as the fact that genetic mutations destroy, rather than create, genetic information. This simple fact points to entropic \\"devolution\\" rather than \\"evolution\\". Even better, though, is to hear the anti-creation bias of the evolutionists in their own words. Consider the quote from Richard Lewontin on page 18: \\"It is not that the methods and institutions of science somehow compel us to accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world, but, on the contrary, that we are forced by our a priori adherence to material causes to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concepts that produce material explanations, no matter how counter-intuitive, no matter how mystifying to the uninitiated. Moreover, that materialism is an absolute, for we cannot allow a Divine Foot in the door.\\"That evolutionism has major, indeed insurmountable, logical problems goes without saying. I particularly enjoyed the quote by C.S. Lewis on page 28, which succinctly summarizes what I have long known, that is, if evolution is true, then every supposed \\"thought\\" in the mind of the evolutionist is merely a random collision of molecules and electrical currents within that random accumulation of tissues we call a \\"brain.\\" Since all such \\"thought\\" is merely accidental, it cannot be relied upon as a source of reason, truth, morality, sensory perception, or anything of the sort. Pure rationalism grounded in evolutionary thinking is, therefore, completely untrustworthy as a means of determining truth, thinking rationally, or even perceiving reality, if one carries evolutionistic teachings to their necessary logical conclusion. Rather a self-defeating position to take, I think.In short, if evolution is true, then might really does make right, and there is no rational basis for law, government, civilization, philanthropy, art, science, environmental consciousness, civil liberties, multiculturalism, toleration, egalitarianism or anything of the sort. All the supposedly noble pursuits and \\"causes celebres\\" of America's predominantly evolutionistic political leftists become so much cosmically meaningless drivel. There is nothing left but rank nihilism, with all that it implies. \\"Let us therefore eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.\\" But I suppose for the truly committed atheist even that is preferable to acknowledging the existence of God, and man's moral accountability to Him.Admittedly, a few of Dr. Sarfati's refutations were less than overpowering, but then, it is not surprising that neither side of the debate yet has the answers to some of these complex questions. Overall, though, this volume definitely deflates the NAS's position, and gives the intellectually honest reader ample cause to question the veracity of evolution as \\"fact\\". And after all, that was the whole point of the book. Well done."},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"After nearly 10 years RE is still beating-up evolutionism.

It raises a question though, after reading negative reviews about this and other creation science books. If evolution is irrefutably scientific and objectively factual, as evolutionists have tried to persuade themselves, then why do they seem to become quickly emotional and angry when any scientific question is raised about its validity?"},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"I'm not a young earth creationist, and I consider Jonathan Sarfati's \\"presuppositionalist\\" faction of the creationist movement to be one of the more extreme. However, I admit that \\"Refuting Evolution\\" is a relatively good introduction to the young earth creationist worldview.The book was first published in 1999, when Sarfati was a leading member of an organization known as Answers in Genesis (AiG). After a split in 2006, Sarfati formed a new group, known as Creation Ministries International (CMI). More recent editions of \\"Refuting Evolution\\" therefore lack the foreword by Ken Ham, who still belongs to Answers in Genesis. The theological differences between the two groups seem to be minor, however. Both are evangelical and based on presuppositional apologetics, something associated with certain strands of the Calvinist tradition. Presuppositionalism means that, strictly speaking, the Biblical worldview is presupposed rather than \\"proven\\" evidentially. Of course, presuppositionalists believe that all worldviews are biased in this way, including Darwinism. To quote Sarfati: \\"It's not really a question of who is biased, but which bias is the correct bias with which to be biased!\\" Since the author cannot explain how the correct bias should be chosen, his position - if consistently applied - is really a form of hopeless dogmatism.\\"Refuting Evolution\\" is a written in the form of an extensive response to a book published by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, \\"Teaching about Evolution and the Nature of Science\\". Most of the standard young earth creationist arguments are featured: micro-evolution doesn't entail macro-evolution, all mutations are harmful, there are no transitional forms (Archaeopteryx is debunked), radioactive dating methods are unreliable, the big bang never happened, etc. The first chapter presents the presuppositional apologetics of AiG/CMI, while the last one argues that intelligent design should be considered a valid scientific explanation.Despite Sarfati's strong Biblicism, the book doesn't contain any specific chapters on Bible interpretation or Jesus Christ. Even rather extreme points, such as the literal interpretation of Noah's Ark, are mentioned in a very calm, laid back and almost \\"rational\\" manner. This suggests that \\"Refuting Evolution\\" is geared towards the general reader. Apparently, Sarfati has been quite successful on this score - \\"Refuting Evolution\\" might be the most bestselling creationist book ever written. Evolutionists of most stripes, for rather obvious reasons, don't like it!Those interested in young earth creationism should definitely read \\"Refuting Evolution\\" by Jonathan Sarfati, together with \\"Scientific creationism\\" by Henry Morris and \\"The fossils say no\\" by Duane Gish. These three books could be considered the classics of the YEC movement. It probably never gets any better (relatively speaking!) than this, and frequently gets even worse. Of course, reading the chapters on the creation and the Flood in the Biblical Book of Genesis, pretending it's all a quite literal story, might also tell you what we're up against here...Since Dr. Jonathan Sarfati's book is a good introduction to a flawed worldview, I graciously give it five stars.(This review was actually posted on April 9, 2012)"},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"If there is just one book to get, on the fallacies of evolutionism and the non sequitur reasoning that flow from evolutionary assumptions, it would be Refuting Evolution, by Dr. Sarfati!

Plain and simple, this isn't a book about science; it is a book about religion.

If you aren't a religious zealot, then this book isn't for you."},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"I'm not a scientist. Science, biology and evolutionary biology are not my fields, so I leave the science to the professionals. What I would like to do is point out some of the author's weaknesses in style and argument.The first thing that caught my eye and really surprised me was the authors frequent use of exclamation points within this text. To be honest I was shocked to see an exclamation point at all in a supposed \\"scientific critique\\". You don't really even have to be in a scientific field to realize the commonly known fact that exclamation points are not used in scientific works. Anyone taking a comp 101 class can tell you that you don't use emotive punctuation in an argumentative work. The use of exclamation points was so frequent that I almost expected to see the :) punctuating one of his really good points. I wonder if there was just no editorial process or what the author was thinking, but I found that to be very weak and had the book not been so short I have would have simply put the book down after seeing the first exclamation point.Next throughout the book the reader will find short quotes from a multitude of sources and then the author will draw extremely broad conclusions from those very narrow sources. He does this throughout the work. At one point he uses a C.S. Lewis quote to allude to the \\"fact\\" that if there is no designer then our \\"ability to reason would be called into question\\" (P. 28). This is of course absurd and completely self-serving extrapolation of a statement by someone who probably agrees with the author's world view, but of course it doesn't stand to reason that without their conception of god physics and all laws that govern the universe suddenly cease to exist. He also takes a quote from Psalms 16:8 \\"I shall not be moved\\" and from that simple quote decides its true meaning is that \\"the Earth . . . will not stray from the precise orbital and rotational pattern God has set for it.\\"(P. 101) This is indicative of the entire work. It would be laughable if it were not taken seriously by the author and apparently some readers. The author will take small and seemingly benign quotes and then stretch them so far out of context that it is amazing.Next his arguments are entirely inconsistent throughout the entire work. When attempting to discredit one aspect of evolution he will work from the assumption that everything on Earth has remained constant such as when he speaks of the amount of Helium still trapped in the ground, but then when it no longer suits his case he will switch to arguing constant changes in the Earth such as when talking about sedimentation and radio carbon dating. The author has no compunction about making 180 degree turns and arguing seemingly at cross purposes from previous or future sections of his own book. I guess it does make one's argument simpler when he isn't constrained by consistency.Next he argues that the global flood is a good explanation diversity of species and their dispersal throughout the world. Of course this is probably the most absurd statement of all. Plus I love the little picture the author has on page 46 of an ark and what appears to be a man and a dinosaur like creature outside of the ark. First off the author posits that there would be about 8,000 (16,000 individuals) different species that would have to be on the ark and that would not be a problem. I will not argue about insects and other small creatures that number well into the hundreds of thousands, but will let the author's number stand. The amount of food that would have been necessary to store on this ark would have been enormous. The food supply alone would have filled up a craft the size of the ark. Not to mention the logistics of about 10 people feeding, watering and cleaning up after 16,000 animals is beyond reason. The whole notion is childish and immature, and for this type of argument to be found in a \\"scientific work\\" is ludicrous. Not to mention the fact that there is no way that this author or anyone else would ever be able to find a credible scientist that would say that any animal population would be viable with only two breeding individuals left in the species. Not to mention the fact that carnivores would have nothing to eat, or whatever they did eat would mean the extinction of a species. Absurdity thy name is Global Flood Model.Next there are a whole lot of little things peppered throughout this book like on page 85 were he basically credits evolutionists with the rise of the Nazis. I loved that one. Or how he continuously calls some of the great scientists of the past like Galileo and Newton creationists even though that term did not even exist. Just because someone is (or was) religious does not make them a creationist. Although I can certainly see why the author feels the need to piggyback on these great men since he certainly needs all the legitimacy he can muster from anywhere he can get it. I also like where on page 22 he decides that anyone who considers themselves a Christian or religious and believes in evolution are not in actuality religious or Christian since to believe that \\"[a] God who created by evolution is, for all practical purposes, indistinguishable from no God at all.\\" I found that statement to be the most arrogant and absurd statement from a book filled to overflowing with such statements. How this man can decide to take on the authority to tell hundreds of thousands of people that they are not Christians is beyond me.This is the weakest and most amateurish piece of propaganda I have yet come across. The author is arrogant, completely inept at creating sound, logical arguments and totally irrelevant. If this is representative of the creationists best and most talented then they are woefully in need of drastic changes. After going back and reading over my own review I feel angry that I allowed this author to waste so much of my own time with this ridiculous book. I am glad that I at least bought a used copy so this poor excuse for an author didn't receive any compensation from me.Do not buy this book and do not waste your time with this book."},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"Dr. Sarfati reviews the National Academy of Sciences book Teaching About Evolution and the Nature of Science in this book.

The overwhelmning use of non sequitors begins on the first page of the introduction with, \\"It's also hard to believe that evolution is an 'essential concept' in biology, because most 'key' aspects of living things were discovered by creationists.\\" Using this as an argument against evolution is like using the fact that Heisenberg's was a nazi to 'disprove' the uncertainty principle. Sarfati, who should know better, then once again acuses the evolutionist of a naturalitic bias. Duh! Science, by definition is the search for the naturalistic explanation of the world around us. He goes on to define science as 'only that which has been witnessed', and that it is dependent on ones 'philosophical bias'. This is the same argument that astrologists and UFO wackos use. It is more postmodernist [garbage]. He uses the disputes between current researchers in evolutionary mechanism to deduce that because we are not yet sure on some of the details, the whole evolutionary framework is wrong. Once again, non sequitor. They just don't stop.As a Christian, I am embarrassed by the pure intellectual drival that this book presents as a valid argument.

Greatly appreciate that I have a chance to read this Refuting Evolution written with such a clarity and passion. Evolution theory can not explain clearly the beginning of the universe, only with lots of assumptions and no facts and it is truly a bad science to teach in school. According to evolution theory, the foundation is very poorly established and everything the evolutionists are trying to build is not going to stand the tests and challenges. That is why no one is allowed to critique and question evolution theory. Anyone tries to do that will be labeled as scientific illiterate or intimidated. What on earth is this to allow that?

Of course, not written for a highly technical audience, it cannot possibly consider every nuance of every issue in detail. Nevertheless, those who criticize it, besides not knowing how to spell, are simply repeating long-discredited hearsay pseudo-arguments against it. Thus, for instance, creationist scholars have long shown that, despite the loss of helium from Earth's atmosphere, the remaining quantity STILL is not compatible with an old Earth. Likewise, the old canard about the albitization of seafloor materials accounting for salt loss keeps making the rounds, despite being exposed as conjectural a long time ago. Finally, the notion that the absence of flowing water on the moon exempts isotopic dates from fatal problems is laughable. It would only be true of waterborne movement of isotopes was the SOLE factor influencing the concentration of radiogenic and nonradiogenic isotopes in rock. In fact, there are many anomalous isotopic dates from the moon, no less than from Earth, and some of these are actually greater than the supposed 4.5 billion age of both.

We know genetic mutations happen. Evolution is indeed extremely complex, but the concept simply boils down to just many small genetic mutations happening in species over eons of time through many, many generations. Do we need to know every detail about evolution to be able to accept it? No. We don't know every detail about many fields of study buy we know enough about them to be able to confirm the validity of the larger concept. If you have a jigsaw puzzle with some pieces missing it does not mean you cannot fit the rest of the pieces together and see the overall picture even with the missing parts.

No. But we know it happens through other means of observation.The bottom line, people, is that there are TONS of information supporting evolution.

Sure, some details may never be filled in, but that does not invalidate the overall concept. I implore you, inform yourselves of the volume and depth of detailed intricate, painstakingly acquired information that has been complied over the years by highly intelligent, highly educated people. Please, look at books and websites about evolution from sources OTHER than the anti-evolutionists.

And if they are . . . then . . . WHY on earth would they? Please do your OWN research - from a variety of sources - and find out. I am a Christian. I did not accept evolution until I started to inform myself. I still don't fully understand it. But I am aware that there is a HUGE volume of supporting evidence for it. I have no problem accepting that there is a God. But I don't need that taught in science classroom in order to believe it.

Rather than speculate about distant subjects such as ancient species origin, let's look at something clearly knowable and only 2,000 years old. My Ph.D. is in linguistics and I have taught or directly supervised instruction in over two dozen languages. Each language is an extremely, elaborately complex, multi-systemic structure. Two thousand years ago, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, etc., didn't exist. They exist today, each as a highly complex structure, but none was created, nor was its direction of development directed by anyone. Each simply evolved from spoken Latin; the evolution of each is known and documented.

Dr Sarfati never mentions Hugh Ross in this book, but does devote a whole chapter to defending a 'young' earth on both scientific and biblical grounds. This 'reader' hasn't said a single thing to refute anything in this chapter.For as long I've read Mr Ham and his associates, they have always stated Dr Ross's views accurately, so falsely accusing a Christian brother like Ken Ham of 'purposeful deception' is wrong and hardly the way for a Christian to behave.In fact, well before the Nov 17 'Reader' wrote his inflammatory review (so there is simply no excuse for it), the same author of Refuting Evolution published a devastating rebuttal of Hugh Ross's teaching in Creation Ex Nihilo Technical Journal 13(2):22-30, 1999 (also posted on the Answers in Genesis and True Origins websites), refuting all his anti-young-earth arguments. Sarfati wrote:'While he [Ross] is insistent about distinguishing himself from \`theistic evolutionists' (TEs), Ross adopts the same basic philosophical approach. That is, he makes uniformitarian (i.e. essentially materialistic, billions of years, etc.) \`science'his authority over Scripture. This means that he must try to fit billions of years into Scripture, with corollaries of a local flood and pre-Adamite soulless man-like creatures, and death of nephesh animals before sin. The only real difference between the two positions is that PCs deny transformism, the changing of one kind into another.'This is hardly claiming 'old-earth = evolution', but is instead fairly noting the similarities and differences. What is 'deceptive' about that!Sarfati goes on to point out that Ross denies transformation to the absurd extent of almost endorsing 'fixity of species'. Adherents of Ross's approach would be helpless against the examples of speciation (within a kind) in the NAS book rebutted by Refuting Evolution.Sarfati also points out -- 'Reader' please take note! -- that if, as Ross claims, a 'literal' meaning of 'six days' is billions of years, then Ross surely has a very non-literal usage of the word \`literal'!"},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"Current!

It is highly weighted towards creationism and the credentials of the author are impressive. He provides some compelling reasons to support the view that the earth is young (~6,000 years old) and expounds upon problems within the evolution model of the origins of the species.While reading the book, I became angry at the evolution community. The scientific community, by definition, should be open to alternative interpretations of scientific data yet they will not even acknowledge the possibility that the creation model better fits the data. This is a debate on a subject that cannot be scientifically verified in a repeatable manner, but instead relies upon assumptions and interpretations. In spite of this, the scientific community treats evolution as a fact.The main argument that the author focuses on is that God created all plants, animals, and humans. The initial creation contained all the genetic information we currently see. The fewer \\"kinds\\" or original animals have diversified into species that have lost genetic information. Evolution requires the gaining of genetic information which is major difficulty of evolution.I have read some of the other reviews criticizing certain arguments in the book that I have not investigated as to their validity. Even if the criticisms are valid, they have not even touched the breadth of subject matter contained within the book.I consider myself an intellectual Christian. Yes, there are some issues that I admit that I don't understand and I do stand on faith (i.e. trinity, etc.). But for the most part my spiritual journey is to try to understand God as best I can through scripture and the modern world. Before reading this book, I felt discouraged from the constant refrain of the media and scientific community that this creature is so many \\"millions\\" of years old and the earth is so many \\"billions\\" of years old. After reading the book, I felt so encouraged spiritually and intellectually. I felt that it wasn't me who was intellectually closed-minded, but the evolution community. A good question is why would they strive so hard to destroy Christianity and religion in general.The author has recently come out with a newer book that is 3 to 4 times as large. I am currently reading it though it focuses not only on the creationism/evolution debate but also the war within Christianity between progressive evolution and creationism. Probably a more important debate to the Christian. About half the book is devoted to both issues since they are related."},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"I have been researching the creation evolution issue for over 20 years. this book is on my top 10 list. I suppose the bad reviews are from humanists who do not like the idea of a Creator. They willingly want to believe in evolution (opposed to God), and they read this book and cannot deal with the evidence so they slander it. The book presents \\"FACTS.\\" For example In the foreword of the book, Ken Ham writes of a woman coming to him after a seminar and saying she was angry. She was angry, she said, at her college professors. Why didn't they tell her there was all this contradictory evidence about evolution? How come they taught her ideas that were discarded years ago (Heackle's Embryos for example)? Why didn't they tell her that not everyone believes in the smooth transition of the fossil record? Why didn't they let her consider evidence put forth by creationists? The way she conducted her life was very dependent on her belief in origins. Why hadn't she been told about this evidence and been allowed to decide for herself if she had evolved or was created - isn't that what education is all about, she said. (Mr. Ham goes on to discuss the possible reasons for this, but I will not include them here).Safarti says it is a fallacy to think that facts speak for themselves - facts are always interpreted according to a framework. The evolutionists' framework is naturalism. Naturalism is a philosophy, a philosophy which holds that all phenomena can be explained mechanistically in terms of natural (as opposed to supernatural) causes and laws. In other words, even if the evidence being reviewed suggests that the event in question has supernatural cause, according to naturalism, a supernatural cause must be automatically ruled out and not even considered. It is not really a question of objective unbiased scientists versus religiously biased creationists, rather the question is whose biases are correct.The facts presented in this book do not have an evolutionary spin put on them. It deals with scientific, historic, and emperical evidence."},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"This book by a highly qualified scientist gives a fine introduction to the issues, and is accessible to a wide audience, from high school to fellow scientists. I like the way it first starts by showing that evolution is a religion, while real science is hardly anti-Christian and was actually founded by creationists and had stalled in other cultures (the author provides documentation, contrary to what some reviewers claim).The subsequent chapters are full of scientific information on variation within a created kind and natural selection; the fossil record with its lack of transitional forms; separate chapters on the origins of birds, whales and people; astronomical support for creation and careful analysis of the Galileo affair and the difference between the historical narrative of Genesis and the poetry of Psalms; the age of the Earth; and design. There are useful introductions to each chapter and a helpful summary at the end.I have to be amused at the intemperate attacks by old-earthers who claim that people won't pick this book up because it promotes a young-earth view (in one chapter!). One must then wonder how it's had a print run of over a quarter of a million!Of more concern are attacks by apostates that are practically identical, and based on a review on an anti-Christian website. But when the sources are checked out, they are found to be full of bluff. For example, the author is accused of overlooking Wernher von Braun's Nazism. But the \`authority' for this is actually a song by the well-known satirist Tom Lehrer! This automatically made me skeptical of the other sources and the integrity of the critic, and sure enough, when I checked the source of the supernova remnant claims, it comes from an article by a self-confessed non-astronomer in an article on an anti-creationist site. Then the \`authority' for the claim of Newton's anti-Trinitarianism turns out to be documentation that Newton denied the authority of the Johannine Comma of 1 John 5:7 - but if that makes Newton anti-trinitarian, then so are James White and Don Carson! (For those who are unaware, these authors have written books against KJV-onlyism explaining why this passage is inauthentic, but have also has authored books defending the Trinity and deity of Christ)...."},{"Title":"Refuting Evolution: A Handbook for Students, Parents, and Teachers Countering the Latest Arguments for Evolution","review":"It is disappointing to see that, as is usually the case, many of the reviewers of books about creation/evolution don't think they actually have to read the book to write a review. It makes me wonder if they ever read their science text books. Having read both Refuting Evolution and Teaching about Evolution and the Nature of Science, I have concluded that Sarfati does a good job with what is actually a fairly easy task, criticizing the NAS indoctrination manual for teachers. It is important to remember that the purpose of Sarfati's book is to refute the specific 'evidence' presented by the NAS. In doing so, he ends up presenting a good, easy to read overview of the creationist position.A word of warning: I purchased Teaching About Evolution and the Nature of Science directly from the National Academies Press and ended up being added to their email newletters. To this point I have not been able to remove my email from their lists. I guess I should have stayed with Amazon.com."},{"Title":"Independence Hall In American Memory","review":"Independence Hall in American Memory is a stellar book. Charlene Mires presents an important, engaging and highly readable account of Independence Hall. She also tells much that is significant and intriguing about the story of Philadelphia and the development of the American nation. The book is fascinating and wonderfully written. The reader will learn about the shifting uses and appearance of this most important building and the variety of ways that people have thought of Independence Hall and its place in American history. There are sure to be many surprises here. This is an excellent book which makes the reader think about the nature of city life and also about history. If you have an interest in Philadelphia, urban life, or our national story, read this book."},{"Title":"Independence Hall In American Memory","review":"Independence Hall In American Memory. Author: Charlene Mires. 368 pages. 2002.If you visit Independence Hall today you will see a typical Georgian public building surrounded by open spaces and other buildings from the colonial to the early federal period. Mostly what you will see though is the building itself, due to the scarcity of buildings on the north side which provides lovely vistas of the structure.The structure itself stands frozen in time. A memorial to the transition from an unhappy colony to an independent country. The building witnessed the debates and proclamations of Independence, the struggles to form a country and for ten years served as a national capital. Its architecture provided a link to the recent separation. When the capital moved on to Washington DC, the Georgian architecture was cast aside in favor of more Roman structures, as the founders sought to build the new nation on the foundations of the Roman Republic.This book follows the history of this building and the landscape around it from its inception through its current incarnation. Besides the evolution of the physical structure it also discusses the building as symbol and the meaning and use of the symbol and its meaning through time.What I found most interesting about this book was what you do not see when you visit Independence National Historical Park. When a building is frozen in time what is lost is what happened to it before it was frozen and the context of that journey. During the British occupation of Philadelphia the building served as a stable and a prison for captured American officers. When the US capital was moved to its current location the building reverted to a city governmental structure with a museum of natural history, and art on the second floor. This was in many ways a fore runner to the Smithsonian complex in one structure. The building did not really begin to register in the national conscious beyond the city of Philadelphia (who still owns the structure) until the visit in 1824 of Lafayette. Even after this visit the city grew up around the structure. Buildings harboring immigrants, blacks, Jews, and factories littered the landscape in many cases dwarfing the structure on all sides.The structure really did not gain prominence in the nation as a touring destination until the 20th century with the rise of the interstate. Even then, the Liberty Bell was a far stronger symbol and touchstone of national myth and feeling.This book is greatly enhanced by its choice of photographs which show the building and its surroundings over a period of time from its time as a small building choked in an inner city environment until its current position is international icon. While the text explains, the pictures graphically demonstrate.This book is in the end a very interesting book because it tells the story of what you do not see when you visit Independence Hall. It tells the story of people and social movements which passed through the Hall or made it a backdrop for their live sand activities."},{"Title":"Independence Hall In American Memory","review":"A fascinating history of Independence Hall in Philadelphia in a different style than the normal textbook discourse. Mires approach of using the building and property as the focus of the social and political history that happened in and around Independence Hall is very original in that one begins to think about the building in the first person. The book uniquely expresses the history of everyday life and its continuum as people and events come and go through the Old State House.While the building remains standing, history pours through it, and the building has survived as a sort of crucible in which that history could transpire.It's not the same as reading a book about the history of other structures such as the White House that has been used for a singular purpose in its entire existence. The Old State House was used for many different purposes by a variety of people...all of whom the building had different meaning and worth as a historical relic. To read about Independence Hall from this perspective has added meaning and depth to what I have been able to learn on my own. Excellent work."},{"Title":"The Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an (Volume One: A-D)","review":"The Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an represents the most current knowledge available regarding Islam and Qur'anic Studies. Jane Dammen Mcauliffe has done an excellent job compiling contributions from an impressive list of scholars. Andrew Rippin, G.R. Hawting, Patricia Crone, Herbert Berg, Bowering, Beatrice Greundler, and a host of others all weigh in on issues ranging from the Chronology of the Qur'an to its Compilation; and from Exegetical issues to the controversial questions of the Origins of the Qur'an. Excellent Scholarship marks the first volume's entries on the topics of Arabic Scripts, Language, and Paleography. It draws on recent research and scholarship, including the &quot;paper grave&quot; of manuscripts discovered in Sana'a Yemen which are currently being analyzed by German Professor Gerhard Puin. This first available volume covers topics from &quot;A&quot; through &quot;D&quot;, and makes many references to future entries in the volumes which are to follow. While the entries are based on thorough research and academic study, several of the conclusions and observations will be quite controversial in the Muslim community, particularly those which call into question the reliability of Muslim Literary Traditions, and those which are damaging to the traditional understandings of the nature of the Qur'an as a monolithic, unevolved (or even uncreated) source of Divine Revelation. This volume, and those which follow, are certain to establish themselves as instant classics in the libraries of scholars and academic students of Islam around the world."},{"Title":"Doctor Dolittle's caravan","review":"Ahh, the feelings of nostalgia I get when I think of Dr. Dolittle, the man who could talk to the animals. In the fifth grade all I did was read Dr. Dolittle books. My school library only had the Story of Dr. Dolittle, Dr. Dolittle's Voyages, Dr. Dolittle's Post Office, and Doctor Dolittle's Circus, and I always had one of them checked out. Consequently, I got sick of them. Then came summer vacation, and my downtown public library had Dr. Dolittle's Caravan. Well, I read it and really got into it. The story ties in with both the aforementioned Dr. Dolittle's Circus as well as Dr. Dolittle and the Green Canary (to the point that read Green Canary borders on redundancy, but I digress). Herein Dr. Dolittle discovers the canary with her sweet songs and bittersweet life's story. My favorite part occurs where the good doctor meets Paganini, the infamous violinist. I liked the &quot;flirting with historical fiction&quot; Lofting tosses our direction. Chronologically, this story MUST take place before 1839, the year the Dr. meets Tommy Stubbins; Paganini died in 1837, I believe, so the timeline for this novel would be the mid-1830s (assuming Dr. Dolittle was taught the language of animals around 1830). I hope this book goes back in print soon."},{"Title":"Doctor Dolittle's caravan","review":"Oh the JOY of reading Doctor Dolittle books! This is a great one.

Unlike a couple of other reviewers here, I already own a DICTIONARY, and so I am aware of what the words PRIMER and ASPIRING mean. Those looking for a book about programming .NET should buy a book titled something like, &quot;Programming .NET.&quot; Those looking for a book about using Visual Studio.NET should buy a book titled something like, &quot;Using Visual Studio.NET.&quot; A book titled, &quot;Programming In The Key Of C# - A Primer For Aspiring Programmers&quot; should present a primer for aspiring programmers. Gee, go figure.Through the years, I have programmed in C, Pascal, Fortran, Cobol, Visual Basic, Delphi, various scripting languages in both the Unix and Windows worlds, Cold Fusion, PHP, and Active Server Pages. I wanted to learn C# from the lowest level and move upward from there so I would have a complete understanding of the language as I move towards my final goal of programming Windows and ASP.NET using C#. Having reviewed the TABLE OF CONTENTS made available here, it was easy to tell that this book would be the primer I was looking for. A previous reviewer claims that this book didn't teach him enough about C# syntax. The syntax in C#, although similar to most other object-oriented languages, is unique to C#. This whole book teaches C# syntax, and also goes into a fair amount of detail of how structures, objects, classes, etc. are handled internally in the computer, and by the C# compiler. I know there is another book written by Anders Hejlsberg which is a most complete coverage of the C# syntax, and I will probably end up buying that book as well to use as a reference. To begin learning C#, however, I wanted to begin in a very comfortable and basic place. I have finished this book, I have purchased and am reading a book on programming Windows with C#, and when I am finished with that book, I will buy a new book that is more specific to programming ASP.NET. I will probably buy books specific to ADO.NET, and who knows what else as I become aware of new complexities that I would like to understand.As a book about learning the basics of programming in C#, Mr. Petzold's book delivers on just what the title implies."},{"Title":"Programming in the Key of C#: A Primer for Aspiring Programmers (Pro-Developer)","review":"For those who rated this down because it was for beginners, I would suggest re-reading the subtitle. It is clear this book is for the beginning programmer. As someone who had barely enough programming experience to be able to confidently do much that was more complex than \\"Hello, World\\" in C#, I found this book an excellent primer on programming. It clearly explains things that I've found other books have a tough time doing (I went through the Murach's C# book in parallel, which I also found very good compared to other books I tried). It just needs to be rated for what it is: a book for people who may not have any programming experience that does a great job in introducing the necessary concepts.For more in depth C# knowledge, a friend at Microsoft recommended Inside C# 2nd Edition.

The book is not for an advanced programmer - you would be disappointed if you thought this was a 300 level book, but it does say it right in the name.What this book does that C# Step by Step does not do is it explains, very clearly, why you are doing what you are doing. It doesn't get bogged down in step 14 of 30. Petzold patiently explains what placeholders are in Console.Writeline() and why they're so useful. He carefully takes you from something you know to something you wish you knew and then explains the how's and why's of everything. His style is almost as if he were talking to you. He uses phrases like \\"Check this out\\" to make the reading livelier. I can almost feel his enthusiasm for C# coming off the pages.If you know C, C++, Java or maybe even Visual Basic this book may be too basic for your needs.

It covers fundamentals of modern objective programming features such as namespaces, classes and instances. It also reassures readers of what basic data types are supported in C# which follows the footsteps of .NET Framework.The book is more of a primer than specific (i.e., a book could be based on data structures or producing games). If you are looking to buy a book, and you are an elementary programmer you will find this book very very helpful in terms of learning C#. If you are a regular java, c and c++ developer you will also find this book somewhat helpful in terms of understanding some of the core technologies behind .NET Framework and C#'s language features. Otherwise, if you are looking for something that cover much more integral aspects of C# this book perhaps, isn't for you.In prelude, it states that the author tried his/her best to avoid making assumptions about any prior programming experience - thus the coverage of some elementary level basics of modern objective programming features."},{"Title":"Programming in the Key of C#: A Primer for Aspiring Programmers (Pro-Developer)","review":"Charles Petzold, a veteran of technical book writing, proves himself in this book (again) to be a brilliant teacher. At around 420 pages it's slim in comparison to other Microsoft text books. Part of the reason is that, concentrating solely on the C# language, no screen shots take up space that is more effectively used to explain key concepts of this language & how it fits into OOP. If you're a VB programmer, (as I was) looking to get into C#, this is a great starting point. It does begin at the beginning, (Variable types etc) but don't let this discourage you as there are some subtle differences that you need to learn about which could save confusion in the future, for example, that there is much less in the way of implicit conversion of certain types & this must be taken care of in code. However, this section is a brisk read, & Petzold's clear explanations are enlightening. He really makes it easy to understand how to use this language with some good examples throughout the book. There is nothing about the IDE or controls & just enough on the Framework, but what he does introduce, he explains in depth. This approach keeps his focus on the language which is what this book, after all, is all about.You will need more once you've read this, but it's an excellent starting point, won't take you months to work through & most importantly, you will \`understand' it at the end unlike other books which confuse the explanations with assumptions that you already know some C++.If I have any problems with this book, it is only that he didn't cover Indexers & Delegate creation as these are not particularly difficult concepts & are important & I'm sure his explanations would have been excellent, but you'll will have to read further to learn about those.

Diamonds have been found and the scramble is on to become rich. Among those headed to the diamond fields is the adventurer, Zouga Ballantyne. He is a capable man and knows Africa. He was born there and has made and lost fortunes there. He heads to the diamond fields with hope, not of becoming a diamond magnate, but of financing his real dream. He has a grand concession from the king of the Matabeles but has had no luck in raising capital. So it is that he turns to the diamond mines.With him he takes his wife and two sons. His wife is a frail thing and has been disillusioned too many times. She does not last very long before succumbing to the filthy conditions of the boom town. That leaves Zouga with his sons and his dreams.Mining is not easy. Labor is scarce and prices are inflated beyond belief. Still, he makes a go of it through hard work and honorable treatments of his peers. His sons develop, each with great skills and talents. Each make new relationships with the natives of Matabeleland. Eventually, though, the dream proves too elusive and each of the men, the boys are grown now, goes his own way.They are reunited under the leadership of Cecil Rhodes, the famous, or infamous Robber Baron of the Victorian age. Rhodes has dreams not only of personal wealth but of empire. The three Ballantyne men are an instrumental part of his plans to seize and hold Matabeleland.This story is well written and enjoyable to read. The characters are larger than life but believable and, the historically base ones seem true to form. It is a story of men with personal honor and men without any honor at all. This includes not only the Europeans but the native Africans as well.It is sad to see how some of the friendships developed early on are damaged or even destroyed by the later conflicts of world views and cultures.

But with millions of books sold and a fan base that spans the world a few times around, he apparently reaches a lot of readers who keep coming back for yet one more adventure...readers like me."},{"Title":"Men of Men","review":"I've read every one of Wilbur Smiths' books and loved them all. Some more than others but there are few writers who know how to bring characters to life like Wilbur does.This book would have received 5 stars if written by a different author but notice most readers are like me, Smith fanatics, comparing this to his other books. You really can't. I celebrate the fact that Wilbur is so prolific and engaging. I hope he lives forever and has many more books left in him."},{"Title":"Men of Men","review":"I have read a dozen of wilbur smiths novels and will continue to the read the ballyntine saga, although I was very disappointed in this one. It was slow, too detailed, harder to follow and didn't live up to any of the courtney novels, the egyptian novels or the previous ballyntine novel....However, you still have to read this book, the entire saga is awesome, the characters grow on you and he brings the land alive....."},{"Title":"Men of Men","review":"I read Birds of Prey -- my first book by this author and loved every minute of it. Consequently, I was very happy to find Men of Men in the library. Unfortunately, my happiness was short-lived. I found it a struggle to get through most of this book, so I finally quit at just over half way through it. I found it rather boring. I gave it two stars because every now and then something would happen that I found interesting, but for the most part, the book was not what I expected. However, because of how much I liked Birds of Prey, I haven't given up on the author yet. I'll try something else. This book just didn't do it for me."},{"Title":"Men of Men","review":"Another good \\"Historical\\" Novel by Wilbur Smith.

Yes??"},{"Title":"Men of Men","review":"Be careful when you order used books - this one had no glue on the spine, when you tried to read it the pages just fell out, and we discovered some of the pages were gone. It's not a bargain when you have to pay postage for something that doesn't work!"},{"Title":"Men of Men","review":"This book was not quite as engrossing as its predecessor, A Falcon Flies, but it obviously is quality writing, and as always with Wilbur Smith, you feel strongly drawn into the story.As a new twist on the Ballantyne series, you see more of the next generation in Men of Men, and it offers interesting conflicts throughout the book that keep the reader on edge and allow for multiple viewpoints on the same events.In order to understand this book better, you will have had to read the aforementioned book, but given the level of depth that Smith always goes to in his books, it does not feel like incredible amounts of reading.Smith writes the most exciting, enthralling books I have ever read, and I could not imagine another writer who draws readers into his books so easily that it makes them feel as if they are watching the story in front of their eyes as they read. Absolutely incredible writer, Smith is, and I would recommend this, along with every other of his books."},{"Title":"Men of Men","review":"like all Wilbur Smith books once you start to read any of his novels you are transported into the world of the subject(s) with a little imagination you can smell the land and the animals ,and even feel for the adversary,you may even flinch as an Assegai is used,these kind of BOYS OWN adventures will never date, read the book again in a few years and you are once more back into the story ,on many occasions i have looked up certain incidents that have been mentioned to find that they are actually factual !"},{"Title":"Men of Men","review":"Since I have not read the books in the series in order, it provided me with the additional background to the family history.

It almost seemed that the an important part of the story was left untold particularly at the end.

It's easily imaginable to place the integrity of forethought into the readings he offers.It will be a very sad day when Wilbur Smith writes, no more. He has an excellent fortitude of reality in past times.Related to the Africikana's personified, life. A Country that roiled under oppression and few hero's prevailed.Men of Men, is part of a trilogy and a most entertaining book. I also find that for buying this series, Bagabook is the most reliable & fast service provider, along with a reasonable price & a new book; kudos, for a well delivered experience on Amazon."},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"I rarely read books twice, but Catspaw I've read three times since finding it, and with each reading I look forward to the next one even more (although what I always WANT to look forward to is another book that I become as personally involved in as I did this one).Joan D. Vinge doesn't just make Cat a character you can really identify with and care about (as other reviewers have noted), but he lives in a world that the reader becomes involved in because it is at once alien (and thus intriguing) and ultimately recognizeable: this Cat shows with his affinity for the low-class garment denim jeans, which have lost favor in an era of highly developed fibers and deep space travel. I was amused by Ms. Vinge's workplaces, staffed with secretaries and clerks as they always have been, filing and answering calls while also using equipment that we can scarcely imagine. After finishing Catspaw the first time, I ached to find a threedy, don its net, and surf it just as Cat would have done...Too often the world that a sci-fi writer creates is so drastically changed or alien that it is impossible to relate to, but Catspaw makes you feel like you'd really caught a glimpse into the future and seen how life would really be. Cat describes the places and organizations he encounters just enough that sooner or later you can make a mental archeological jump between its name and his description to figure out which presentday familiar place or organization lies deep at the heart of its past. Many place name (N'Yuk), organization names, and object names (&quot;threedy&quot; for three-dimensional &quot;television&quot;) have evolved, but in such a way that the reader doesn't need a glossary, their evolution makes etymological sense, and their use is as natural as the English we speak today.Most importantly, Ms. Vinge displays a rare understanding of both individual and group psychology/behavior, and of their interplay and composition. Too often I am frustrated by authors whose work is limited to interesting individuals in unrealistic societies or the larger movements and problems of societies whose individuals are hard to relate to, but Ms. Vinge's characters and societies have real depth. She has the ability to portray individuals, family groups, corporate groups, political groups, the media and the objects of their attention, friends and the friendless, strangers, gangs, loners, and all everyday people with the mixture of immediacy, objectivity, compassion and understanding that really gets a reader involved, and in none of the books of hers that I've read so far (five so far) does she do that as well as in Catspaw. On top of that, her prose flows so easily and naturally that the reader is involved before she or he turns the first page. I'll be reading Catspaw again within the year, I'm sure, and possibly Psion and Dreamfall as well; I only wish there were more books about Cat's adventures for me to explore.Lyle"},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"I can't say enough about this novel. It mysteriously came into my possession at a used book fair. I picked it up because the futuristic cover appealed to my sci-fi tastes. Upon reading the novel, I was pleasantly surprised, in fact that's an understatement. This book is so masterly written, one forgets there's an author at all behind it, but that her beautiful character Cat himself is writing it. The whole Cat series is an amazing read for it contains just the right formula. The plot is well thought out, it has universal themes of society, and the discriptions seem entirely accurate. Joan D.Vinge has created a universe and characters that are incredibly realistic. The reader gets inside Cat's head. His thoughts and emotions make him easy to love, scars and all. I know I fell in love with him. I recommend to anyone who likes Sci-fi, Futuristic stuff, or political insight to read this book.The whole series, in my opinion, is the best sci-fi tale ever written.(Ps: Mrs. Vinge, please write a 4th book!)"},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"This was an amazing story, and when its all said and done isn't that what writing novels is all about? I haven't read either the first or third novels in the series yet, (but I have ordered them) but I know that Cat has now joined Ender who is at the pinnacle of my all time favorite characters list. What is it about wounded child-men?This was an incredibly poignant tale told with just the right amounts of everything. I feel like I know Cat. I can't stop thinking about him. I want to know what happens to him next. I want to know if he ever finds happiness, and if not happiness, at least peace. I laughed when Cat laughed. I hurt when Cat hurt. Like Ender, Cat is now a part of my world. He is like a friend that I will go back to visit time and time again. Vinge just gives him so much life. Character driven stories are the best can. You'll like this book. The science was simple enough so you don't get lost trying to figure out what is going on. Vinge also doesn't assume the need to define everything in this futuristic world (She may in Psion, Book 1). Cat is a very introspective character but Vinge doesn't let him just THINK for chapters at a time, as other SF authors, who shall remain nameless, often do. There is emough action to appease those who must have it, there's even a little sex. Not too much, just enough. Also, there are so many wonderful characters in the story, with some of the most eccentric eccentricities. Come on, you just gotta read this book."},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"I loved this book. I've read the entire series of the main character, Cat, but Catspaw I believe is best in the series. What's more, the book can stand alone. The unique writing kept me interested the entire journey, with the 1st person view of the main character, but his abilities to read minds lets you have the perspective of other characters in the book as well. I liked Cat's personality. He's real, with flaws, and fears, and yet does the right thing without being a do-gooder. Even the villians in the book seem real, and you can almost- but not quite- understand why they are the way they are.This story encompasses Cat being pressed into service to be a body guard for a political member of the very government he hates. You get political intrigue, a hint of romance, and a splendid view of a futuristic world with a well thought out plot. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"This was the first book I'd read in this series, many years ago. At the time, I was more impressed with it than I probably would be now, because I didn't recognize that the world she was building was somewhat standard cyberpunk (never even heard of cyberpunk at that time). Therefore the world seemed more original to me than it actually is (also illustrating one of my standard ideas about genre fiction--if someone who has never experienced a genre before suddenly comes to it, the most hoary and ancient cliches of that genre will seem dazzlingly fresh and familiar).However, though the world fascinated me, in the end, the real heart of the series are Vinge's characters. Cat, Lady Elnear, Argentyne, Jiro, are all wonderfully drawn, and Vinge portrays them with a great deal of heart and honesty; she plays fair with the reader. Good social commentary too, with a message that is both uplifting and sobering; she explores a theme I've seen other authors do as well but one that I think is quite profound, that human connections are necessary to allow human beings to succeed in the face of evil (Cat's bond with Argentyne and his link to Mikah are what enable him to ultimately succeed in his goal). I recently bought a copy of PSION and I'm working my way through it, eager to meet Jewel and some of Cat's earlier friends."},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"In discussions of great sci-fi, Catspaw rarely comes up. Which is a pity. It is not only one of the most well-executed novels in its genres but also one of the most compelling. I first read the book in the mid-80s, immediately indentifying with the brash young outsider Cat. It quickly became one of my favourites. Now, in 2001, I still love and admire the book for its insights into society, human nature and politics.Sadly, Vinge has not delivered books at the level of this and The Snow Queen consistently. While I enjoyed the other books in the Cat series, none compare to the almost epic Catspaw."},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"This is one of the few books which caused me to enter my accelerated-reading-mode, finishing the book in just under four days. Vinge creates a startlingly complete, complex, interwoven universe filled with characters so realistic a reader doesn't recognize his surroundings when he wakes up the next morning.The quick and savvy Cat fends off many troubles in his life, going from the bottom of the trashpile all the way to the top, with several ups and downs in between.I liked this novel so much I started &quot;catspaw.com&quot; many years ago, to be dedicated to sci-fi novels. (alas, the site never got past its domain name.)"},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"Catspaw is the sequel to the book \\"Psion\\", and as the second novel in the series it grows the world and the characters in leaps and bounds. Set mostly on Earth in a far future New York City, it is a world of data mines and body mods. It's classic cyberpunk in that technology intermingles with humanity but it's a fresh take on the genre in that some humans have alien blood in them that gives them psychic powers: telepathy, telekinesis, teleportation.Vinge has fleshed out the society well, with the corporate rich moving in cold Machiavellian circles, the dirt-poor struggling to survive on harsh streets, and the psionically-gifted being thought of as less than dirt by both. Cat is our hero, and although his mind was burned before our story begins, he is given a change to regain his powers...at a price. There are drugs that can reconnect him with his lost abilities, but working with his benefactor is a dangerous game of shifting alliances and surprise betrayals. Cat is appointed as a bodyguard (and spy) for a woman of standing (Elnear, who is to be addressed as 'Lady') who finds herself in the most dangerous square on the chess board. There are conflicting interests assailing her and it is Cat's job to use his powers to keep her from being assassinated.Unfortunately, Cat is everyone's tool in one way or another, and the real struggle inside Cat is to weigh his sense of right and wrong with his need for the drugs--his addiction is to his power and the drugs are only secondary. But this Cat has nine lives, and he's going to need every one of them to slip through the maze of his future.If you're new to the Cyberpunk genre, most of the way it is portrayed here will still be easy to pick up on: Vinge is not as subtle or prosaic as, say, William Gibson or Bruce Sterling. A lot of what we see was new at the time this novel was written but has become part of our pop culture, so you probably won't be lost. If you're already familiar with the style, you'll enjoy the new twist of mind powers and still find a lot of familiar territory that marks Catspaw as a definitive work of the genre. Either way, it's interesting to run across bits of technology that Vinge was guessing about then and are in our world (or about to be) today.Catspaw is better than Psion, though that also is not a bad book. You don't have to read Psion to enjoy Catspaw, but I do recommend both as worth the read."},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"You Must Read This Book.Joan Vinge's *Catspaw* is one of the best novels I've ever read, sci-fi or otherwise. I've read it four times, and each time I cry, get dizzy, get nauseous, nearly choke with anger and fear, fall in love, hurt all over, rejoice, and at the end cry again. Cat is surely one of the most complete and sympathetic characters in all literature. He's part of my world view now. Joan Vinge's beautiful, wounded child-man changed my life. I know that sounds melodramatic, but it's the truth.This series is frightening in the unflinching reality of its characters and their world. Vinge looks dead on at all the worst things in humanity's collective soul, and you can't turn away. She'll show you the worst in yourself, and the best, and prove to you that Good really can triumph over Evil -- if enough of us care, if enough of us dare to open our mouths and SPEAK.*Psion* and *Dreamfall* are also required reading for thinking people, but I, like so many, came in to the middle of Cat's story, and I would recommend that approach. I'm not sure I could've handled *Psion* if I hadn't known that Cat would survive the mines. And I must warn you that *Dreamfall* is even more painful than *Catspaw*, but also contains scenes of incredible joy and magic.I don't understand why *Catspaw* hasn't been made into a movie, unless it's Vinge's resolute refusal, or the nearly impossible task of casting Cat. Anybody got any ideas there? I surely don't. I can't think of an actor that beautiful. But if any sci-fi book has the potential to be made into a movie that wins any of the big Academy Awards, this is it.Dear Joan, please don't leave Cat alone. You've got to get him back with his nashirta, for his sake and for mine, too. Thank you for sharing Cat with us. We're all better for it."},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"Though an orphan street punk, Cat used his psionic abilities to save the galaxy from a peer (see PSION), but his reputation formed that has traveled light years to earth. When someone tries to kill Lady taMing, head of the wealthy and powerful family that runs Centaur Transport, her supporters abduct Cat to provide psionic protection to her.His kidnappers drug Cat, so that the half-breed cannot use psychic powers against them, but provide an antidote so that he can protect Assembly member Lady taMing. However, while doing his new job keeping his client safe, Cat uncovers secrets about powerful individuals including taMing family members who will kill him to keep their skeletons in the closet.CATSPAW is a powerful science fiction that describes an astonishing New York City in a few centuries. The well-designed plot provides a complex multiple helix of a political and social futurology that will stun readers on its realistic but different outlook. However, in building her lush realm, Joan D. Vinge pays a price as the massive particulars that serve as the theme's center with its future's profundity also keeping the story line from attaining light speed. Still, this sequel will please the author's fans and anyone who relishes galaxy building as a key ingredient of a novel set several hundred years into the future.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"Catspaw is easily one of the best I've read.

It really turned me on to the world of science fiction. Since Cat's Paw, I've read both Pison and Dreamfall and after that, only have one question. WHY DOES EVERYONE EXCEPT CAT GET WHAT THEY WANT!!! I mean, in Dreamfall, Cat's soulmate gets to keep on working with Joby. The hydran's are treated better and Cat gets SHIPED OFF WORLD leaving his soulmate BEHIND and all because he HELPED PEOPLE in a slightly illegal way. In Cat's Paw, he literally gets beat up so that a vote will go the other way and then they say, &quot;Good bye!&quot; and ship him off to the University. And in the first book, Pison, Cat loses his telepathy (why didn't the other two lose theirs???). I keep on waiting for Joan to give it back but she keeps side-stepping the issue. Any ways, I just wanted to know (you all notice that gave the book a 10, don't you?). I still highly recomind that people who LOVE science fiction should read this book.

There is no way to dislike Cat. His insights into how bad humans are made me laugh. The book kept me in such suspense the first time I read it, that I could hardly put it down.

A MUST for any sci-fi fan."},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"If you believe in some kind of intrinsic common human experiance, this book will excite you. You will.the 1st time i read this book i was 13 years old. i have since read it twenty or so times. Vinge's insight into human nature is spectacular. Her characters are thoroughly real and multi dimensional. Her plot keeps you on a speedcore edge. The world she portrays is one you can see easily evolving from the world we live in. The first person protagonist perspective of cat is both immediate and fluid; it is virtually impossible not to identify with him. You forget you are reading. You are living this life, this world, at a thousand miles a minute. You share his injustices, his victories, his defeats. Every time i do not want it to end. It is so rare you feel so alive while reading a novel, Vinge's humanity is unbelievable. It is so refreshing to find a sci fi novel that is not only realistic but also a protagonist who is both sensitive and tough. Things matter to these characters(even the nasty ones) the way they do to real people. even the supporting and antagonist characters behave in the ways of real people. We may judge them for their actions but we never question their motives. We understand the emotions behind them very intimately. This was the only book ive read since les miserbles that ive felt was true in such a strong way. Read it. Read Psion (prequel)and Dreamfall(sequel). i am always eager to relive cats experiances. another vinge epic: the snow queen, worlds end, and the summer queen, are also a spectacular 3some. no 1st person though. vinge must write more books about cat. this is imperative.i cant wait......"},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"I bought this for my 13 year old son who is a book worm.

He always finishes series books but I was a bit disappointed that he didn't want the other books by this author. I thought it was interesting, but apparently it didn't appeal to him as much. It was a good book but it didn't capture his interests as much."},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"i just wish i was better able to get around to find more old friends i have missed... thanks to the author for freeing a few dreams to share with the rest of us!"},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"If I could give it a 10, I would. This book is superb on all levels. The first time I read it, I was in high school and it was translated to Hebrew. It had a huge effect over me, and I thought about it often. When I could already read it in English, I searched for it; however, the discrepancy between the original and translated titles set me off for years. I only found it and read the original when I was about 28. And the book is still great when reading it as an adult as it was when I was a teenager. I just love the character of Cat, with his cynical remarks and sharp observations, with his tragic childhood and hope for the future. This character totally makes the book. The plot is great, with lots of suspense, and I also love the fact that every character has clearly-defined and convincing reasons for their actions and behavior. The supporting characters are also great, totally relatable despite living in a setting that is so different from my time and social standing. The setting just sucks you in - after finishing it, I went out and was actually surprised to see buses instead of mods. The writing is amazing, Joan Vinge really is a superb writer, her descriptions are succinct and her metaphors are so true sometimes. And another thing that I love about this book - about the entire series, really - is that it has a theme beyond the actual story, a theme that relates to issues such as racism, xenophobia, tolerance, acceptance; it makes you think about human nature. This what makes the story truly timeless, for me."},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"While this book is obviously sci-fi, it has enough reality in it to make this world real, something that not all sci-fi books are able to pull off. Joan D Vinge has a talent for making these worlds and characters real, and she does a superb job in this sequel to Psion. The story and characters are fantastic, and the settings and story are richly varied and fun to read. A real page-turner."},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"I was really surprised by this book. Honestly, the cover is pretty dorky looking - like a cheap fantasy book. I don't remember how I came across this book originally, but the description sounded promising, so I bought it. Amazing! It's a genuinely unique book and I found myself unable to predict the plot. The writing is fantastic, the characters seemed real, and the emotions were strong. Thanks Joan Vinge!"},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"This book is the sequel to Psion, but it's not necessary to read the series in order, since the main character, Cat, is the only character with a significant role in both books. I read them in order and thought that Catspaw was much more sophisticated and more interesting than the first book. In fact, it's now one of my all-time favorites.There's a hefty amount of future technology in the book, enough that I would say it falls into the fringe territory of the cyperpunk genre. But its real strength is its character-driven story. Not only Cat but every single supporting character, from a 4-year-old girl to the corrupt chairman of Centauri Transport, to the real villain himself, is deeply drawn and realistically portrayed. They have intelligent conversations and feel complex, conflicted emotions and never do things just because the author needs them to to keep the plot moving.But move it does, because there's enough going on and enough subtle connections between the different subplots that something is always happening. There's never a dull moment, and even if you, like me, are distracted by the book's technological fantasies (such as hyperspace travel or alien telepathy or the portrayal of cyberspace as a real place), Catspaw has such a strong plot line and a vibrant cast of characters that those things are easily overlooked. If you enjoy stories with frequent bursts of action, unusual telepathic powers, an original prediction of futuristic societies, and lots of personal and corporate politics, this one's for you. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"When sorting my search results for science fiction books with telepathy as a subject, I was not a bit surprised to see Catspaw come up as readers' number 1 selection. I have a bookself with my all-time favorite scifi books, the ones I would lend to someone who hadn't read much scifi, and this book is the first I would pull out. It has a sympathetic character, great world-building, and a fabulous premis that starts you wondering about the future and possibilities beyond the everyday experience."},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"This is quite possibly the best book I have ever read. Thought provoking, emotional, and exciting, the author draws the reader into a world that could easily be the real future. Cat's unique point of view illustrates the universe in such amazing clarity that his pain and wonder is completely tangible. He's moved from street rat to university student forced to do the dirty work for a huge conglomerate and each word of his experience resonates.This second installment of the Cat books was the first I'd ever read from this author, all because I took a chance on a book in a library give away box. It's one of the most amazing treasures I've ever found."},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"\\"Catspaw\\" is a MUCH better book than its prequel, \\"Psion.\\" As with \\"Psion,\\" I don't care much for its theme that humans, especially wealthy powerful ones, are evil. But, for \\"Catspaw,\\" that's pretty much overridden by how well Vinge writes and by the tightness of the plot. About the only thing I didn't like in the book was the occasional lapse into unnecessary sexual details in about five different places. Other than that, this is a very well-written book that I highly recommend. If it weren't for the sense of loss a reader would suffer without having read \\"Psion,\\" I'd suggest skipping that book entirely. Most of the necessary information comes out in this book. But, it's not complete until almost halfway through the book."},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"Whoah! I've read this book three or four times already! I love it so much. and Cat is just a great character you can just fall in love with him. I really hope others read this book too. i still haven't read the 1st or 3rd books to this series but i feel like i understand them perfectly. but i still really wish to read them. I've never liked a book quite this much."},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"I'm a new fan of Vinge, but now i'm hooked. after reading only one of her books i'm stuck - addicted even. Catspaw is a fascinating adventure with surprizes everywhere.the premise is simple, a young man is recruited by the powerful security agency of an extremely wealthy family to protect one of its members from being killed. the young man, known only as Catis specificall chosen because he is part alien and this part gives him telepathic abilities. as Cat arrives at his destination to protect this VIP his world begins to change, and it will never be the same.this book is fascinating, cvaptivating, and if you read it you'll never get any work done.the entire alien blood series(Psion, Catspaw, Dreamfall) by vinge is amazing in its capacity to entangle you in a strange world that you feel you can completely relate to. i've read all three and i;m dying for a fourth to come out!"},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"I almost doubted whether this book would be as good as the first but it is.This book is officially my favorite.I absolutley love it."},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"What can I say? Catspaw is a masterpiece! Everyone can relate to Vinge's hero, Cat--a streetwise, smart-mouthed punk who really only wants to live his life on his own terms, and finds himself, time and again, the &quot;cat's-paw&quot; of greedy, powerful corporate states, in Vinge's frighteningly probable future world. _Catspaw_ is fast-paced, funny, and intelligent, one of the earliest examples of the cyberpunk vision. But Vinge's world and her vision are uniquely her own, and Cat is one unforgettable guy. He's your best friend, your lover--yourself. They say that for a work to be a success, the author has to really make you CARE about the characters--Joan Vinge does all that and more. This is one of my all-time favorite books."},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"Do all of you agree with me? Catspaw was an awesome book. I felt like I could absolutely sympathize with how Cat felt. A lot of people go through something like that - feeling pressured to do something and hopeless to escape it. Blackmailed into something, your mind frantically searches for a way out - but finds only blank walls. I think anyone who feels backed into a corner or unable to act on something should read this book, so you know you are not alone. I can't wait to read the sequel!"},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"I have been trying to figure out why I love this book so much. It obviously has to do with the main character, Cat, who is at times the quintessential underdog, then the hero of the universe (for at least fifteen minutes). Ms. Vinge creates characters (major and minor) that you not only want to know, but you want to become in some higher sense. The action, intrigue and adventure in Catspaw are also incomparible.I also highly recommend the prequel and sequel to Catspaw - Psion and Dreamfall, respectively. They are both wonderful books, but Catspaw remains my favorite."},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"Catspaw was my introduction to Cat. Like other reviewers, I expected a bit of lite fluff to while away a boring afternoon, and got Paydirt with a capital 'P'. Vinge's creation, whom she called in an interview the embodiment of her sense of outrage at social injustice, is on my personal list of favorite literary characters of all-time. Read the book and find out why."},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"I am a slow reader and I usually read a 200 page paperback in 'bout a month. This book took me about a week to read (it is a 400 pg. LARGE hard cover). I got yelled at in all my classes for reading during the lesson, I didn't do enything but read untill I was done the book. I hardly got any sleep that week because I stayed up soo late reading. Make sure you have lots of time before you pick up this book, because you won't put it down 'till your done. You will love everthing about Cat, and the supporting characters are very complex. The relation ships in the book are real.YOU GET SUCKED INTO THEIR WORLD, YOU FORGET ABOUT YOUR OWN, AND NEVER WANT TO GO BACK.This book will get you hooked on reading. It is a great book to start reading seriosly with. It will change how you act and the way you look at things. You will have to own it so you read it 24 hrs. a day every day.READ THE BOOK!!!!!!I SWEAR YOU WON'T BE SORRY"},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"I was leery when my fiance shoved Catspaw under my nose and insisted I read it; the cover art and the back-cover description made it sound exceptionally cheesy.Time for me to eat crow: it was a really good book. Taken from a literary standpoint, Catspaw is a fascinating look at our own world, and our own self-imposed limitations. Taken as sci-fi, it's refreshingly original in its presentation of common sci-fi/cyberpunk themes. Moreover, it's just a fun, quick read. If you're looking for some modern sci-fi that's not just popcorn, this is your book."},{"Title":"Catspaw","review":"I read Catspaw in french (Cat le psion) a while ago for a class, bought it off of my teacher pretending to have lost the thing because I loved it so much. I've since read it many times, even though I normally dislike reading in french, because the storyline just sucks me in. I also found Psion (same title, but obviously translated by someone else because Julie is Jule and Cat is Chat, whereas in Catspaw they have the english names) in french... but I can't find either of them in english. I can't buy them off of ebay, amazon, etc because I have no credit card, but if anybody has a used copy they are willing to let me pay for with mailed cash, please email me at psion_cat@hotmail.com... thanks!"},{"Title":"Loretta Lynn Coal Miner's Daughter","review":"This is a very touching book, you can't put down once you begin to read it. The life-long story of Lorreta Lynn is powerful andbreath-taking. The words in this book are not fancy, but candid, convincible and colorful, it is the true life of Lorreta Lynn that wins the heart of millions people.How poor is being poor? What is the struggle to escape from beingpoor? How Lorreta Lynn became a country music diva from a coal miner's daughter? From this book, we share the life of Lorreta Lynn with our own, we see the souls and dreams as well as day to day lives of many ordinary people, especially the humanbeing under poverty.Lorreta Lynn was born into a very poor coal miner's family in a remote Kentucky hillside. Her father had little money to feed Lorreta and her family, one Christmas, her Daddy had only thirty-six cents (!) for Lorreta and her three brothers. The work was very hard for her Daddy, he had to crawl on his hands and knees to work inside the ream of coal, of only three feet high. Until seven years old, Lorreta always wore flour sack her mummy sewed as dress. However, with her unyielding spirit and unceasingly struggling, Lorreta went on and up, became the queen of country music and a millionaire.I didn't know the name of Lorreta Lynn until I watched the movie&quot;coal miner's daughter&quot;, this movie led me to this book. The movie is fantastic, but this book let you know more and think more.Either you like county music or not, either you are poor or rich,this book is absolutely good, inspiring, touching and unforgetable."},{"Title":"Loretta Lynn Coal Miner's Daughter","review":"This book is an excellent autobiography that gives you insight into Loretta Lynns public and personal life. This book is written the way Loretta talks; Loretta insisted that it be that way. I highly suggest that everyone should read this book as well as Loretta's new book that is due out Fall 2000. Loretta is a remarkable lady. This book is required reading for any true country music fan, but would be appreciated by all. After reading this book you will come to appreciate Loretta more than you ever have. If you ever meet her, you will appreciate her even more. Loretta is a national treasure, but she does not see herself as a Legend. Loretta's favorite foods are still soup beans an cornbread and skillet fried chicken. Loretta has never left her roots...in this book she shares with you her amazing journey..."},{"Title":"Loretta Lynn Coal Miner's Daughter","review":"The movie is good but the book is excellent. Perhaps the best autobiography ever written. The chapters flow with stories of sadness and humor expressed in Loretta's one phasing. For someone without much of an education, the wisdom and values Loretta shares within the book is inspiring. You will be left wanting to read more about this wonderful lady. This book does not disappoint."},{"Title":"Loretta Lynn Coal Miner's Daughter","review":"A grandmother at 28? Wow! I learned a lot of interesting things about 1) the country music star, and 2) about coming up hard and making it work out.This book is Loretta Lynn's tale of her childhood in Butcher Holler with her poor but pround parents. Her parents allow her to be married off to a man she barely knows when she is 13. Amazingly, she remains married to this man for the rest of his life.Anyway, the husband encourages Loretta to sing publicly because he thinks she has a great voice. And I don't need to tell you how the career goes, because that's pretty popular knowledge.All in all, this was a great book. Very well developed and informative, whether you're a country music fan or not."},{"Title":"Loretta Lynn Coal Miner's Daughter","review":"I have been completely in love with Loretta Lynn ever since I saw \\"Coal Miner's Daughter.\\" I didn't even know who she was til I watched the movie at age 14, then I read the book and became hooked on her music. She is an amazing woman. Her life has been hard, and she doesn't take any of her success for granted. She is who she is. What you see is what you get with her. I don't know if anyone who reads her book could relate to half of what she has experienced, but it makes for interesting reading. I was lucky enough to see her live in concert a month ago, and when she walked out on that stage, I was brought literally to tears. I just couldn't believe this woman I admire so highly was actually standing in front of me. I'll never forget that night. And I will never stop loving Loretta Lynn. Read BOTH of her autobiographies. Both are excellent."},{"Title":"Loretta Lynn Coal Miner's Daughter","review":"I have very high standards when it comes to idols (at least by my warped definition). Mrs. Lynn managed to be both an idol and hero to me. She is a strong out spoken female that refuses to compromise her beliefs to fit into a cookie cutter/hollywood type image. The best day of my life was getting to visit her ranch and pose for a photo on her steps. I love both of her books although Still Woman Enough is my favorite as she is completely relaxed in being herself. Loretta Lynn is an inspritation for all women young and old that have had to overcome hard challenges in life."},{"Title":"Loretta Lynn Coal Miner's Daughter","review":"This is one of the greatest books that has ever been written. My father was a coal miner until he got hurt. I sing my self and loretta is just so good. Being from the same state she is i guess the reason she has such a influenece on my life. If you read this book you will love it."},{"Title":"Loretta Lynn Coal Miner's Daughter","review":"I purchased this book after watching the movie cuz I wanted the complete story knowing that the movies usually cut out a lot. The book is delightful and Loretta Lynn's story of her life is very touching."},{"Title":"Loretta Lynn Coal Miner's Daughter","review":"I am a big fan of Loretta Lynn, probably even more so the person than the singer. I also love the movie Coal Miner's Daughter. Although the movie stuck fairly close to this book, it is still interesting to hear the story in Loretta's words.I also purchased Loretta's second autobiography, and found that book to be much more revealing; it was written after Doo's death and Loretta really opens up."},{"Title":"Loretta Lynn Coal Miner's Daughter","review":"Anyone who loves Loretta Lynn and believes in the American Dream should read this story. This lady moves into the spotlight because she realizes that people genuinely like her songs and her voice. She is so simple and humble that it takes awhile for all this to sink in. She followed her heart and her heart told her to sing - it was one of the few things she felt she did well!"},{"Title":"Loretta Lynn Coal Miner's Daughter","review":"I loved the book. Loretta lyn had a very hard and exciting life you wont be disappointed with the book."},{"Title":"Loretta Lynn Coal Miner's Daughter","review":"Very interesting. This woman has led a very difficult life, but she never seems to lose her spirit."},{"Title":"Loretta Lynn Coal Miner's Daughter","review":"this is a touching story about one of the greatest female country singers ever. this book tells it all about her life and stories about where she came from. a good book for all!!!"},{"Title":"Loretta Lynn Coal Miner's Daughter","review":"Hope she writes a sequel to coal miners daughter love Loretta and her ranch and music cant get enough of her music. Would love too meet her I bet her ranch is worth 4 million dollars or more there at Hurricane Mills. Thanks Crystal"},{"Title":"Loretta Lynn Coal Miner's Daughter","review":"Pics are nifty. Watch Coal Miner's Daughter. Don't try to read this book. I know she was raised in the woods but trying to read like you are illiterate is kinda challenging."},{"Title":"Loretta Lynn Coal Miner's Daughter","review":"This is the first book that Loretta Lynn wrote, which is before her husband died. It is a excellent book and written very down home. Sounds just like her. I really admire Loretta Lynn so I truly enjoyed the book. Her second book is also very good, which was written after her husband died. She even states that she could really be honest in it cause he was dead."},{"Title":"Loretta Lynn Coal Miner's Daughter","review":"Loved the book. I would recommend it to anyone. Good book to curl up with and forget your worrys. She is one strong woman."},{"Title":"Loretta Lynn Coal Miner's Daughter","review":"I am a country music fan and have seen the movie many times.

I had wanted to read it for a long time, then after my trip to Butcher Holler, I had to read it as soon as possible."},{"Title":"Loretta Lynn Coal Miner's Daughter","review":"This book is a great read! It's one of those books where you are endeared to the person writing it, and with Loretta Lynn it is very easy to do. She tells of her life story growing up dirt poor, marrying at age 13 knowing nothing about the marriage bed. Just an innocent little girl. As she describes it she went from her daddy's arms to her husband's arms. There were many trials along the way and Loretta shares them all, the good, the bad and the ugly. It takes you from her first hit recording, \\"Honky Tonk Girl\\" all the way to her becoming rich and famous with all of her Mega Hits and all of the bumps along the way as she rises to become the Queen of Country Music! She is unique! She ventured out into territory where no woman had ever dared go before. She also describes her first meeting with Patsy Cline and how they became best friends.I have been a Loretta Lynn fan for over 40 years now! I fell in love with her voice the first time I heard it on a vinyl 33 1/3 album. It was \\"Don't Come Home A Drinkin'\\" After that I was hooked big time! I started buying every record I could find of Loretta's old and new. I joined her Fan Club so I could get the news of \\"What's Happening\\" with her. I have been very fortunate to have seen her in person many times, mostly in St. Louis, along with her singing partner and friend, the late, great Conway Twitty so it was like getting 3 concerts in one! His concert, her concert and then their concert together with all of their Hits as a duo. When her name was introduced on stage and she first came out there were so many flash bulbs going off it was almost blinding! She has always been a perfect lady, full of charm and grace and so very kind to her fans. She would sign so many autographs till her hand would start cramping and she woulld let all her fans get a picture with her. I love her and always will! She is genuine and like she says, \\"When You're Looking At Me, You're Looking At Country\\" And she is very proud of it!"},{"Title":"Loretta Lynn Coal Miner's Daughter","review":"This was a good book, although I did find it a little difficult to read at times because it was written just the way Loretta talks.I like her, but I had to wonder as I read, if she was being completely truthful in her account of everything that happened.She had no problem telling about how her husband drank, cheated and so on. Yes, she did admit that he was also a good man. But with all her time away from home and those hours and days spent with other men she had to have had some pretty interesting experiences herself. She needed to come clean on her end too.How about a little more honesty Loretta? Barbara Walters wasn't afraid to tell the truth so why should you be?"},{"Title":"Topiary and the Art of Training Plants","review":"As someone who loves the structure of formal gardens and wanting to try to create one on a small scale in my yard, I was very pleased with David Joyce's Topiary and the Art of Training Plants. He assumes his reader has some knowledge of the basics of growing plants, although he does give very general information on preparing beds for topiary plants. The book has sections on the causes and some solutions for established topiary in decline and how to correct a neglected and overgrown hedge. The book explains how to create some shapes in topiary along with step by step illustrations. Regarding hedges, it tells when and how to train widely used hedging plants. The book even relates how to grow pleached screens - training trees with flexible branches. There are sections on creating knot gardens, mazes, and climbers used as screens and canopies. The book gives a directory of a selection of plants for topiary and hedges, along with information on the hardiness, growth, size, maintenance, propagation and problems of these plants. It also lists sources to obtain plants and tools. The book is full of color pictures which will inspire plenty of ideas. It will be a great reference as I design and maintain my own topiary."},{"Title":"Topiary and the Art of Training Plants","review":"David Joyce's book on topiary is well-designed to interest the beginning topiarist, along with those who are more experienced. I've had this book for several years now and I learn something from it every time I refer to it.I recently used it to try (hack?) my first topiary -- a boxwood bird. Joyce offers dimensions (such as plant size, and height at which to begin cutting), which I imagine would be helpful to those who appreciate precise directions. There are also large and detailed images of different types of topiary, along with sections on espalier and the like. This is a valuable reference in my garden library."},{"Title":"Quotationary : Over 32,000 Quotes on One CD-Rom","review":"I was looking up several topics like love, money, family, etc. During the same time I was looking at a new Christmas picture of my five month old son.

It talked about the magic of Christmas and how a grown man, &quot;the little boy-that-used-to-be&quot; could be transformed back to his youth.

The book talks to the child as if they are older than what mine currently are, but basically says what you hope for them and how much you loved them from the time they were born."},{"Title":"The Adventures of a Tropical Tramp","review":"A minor gem. This forgotten book is a classic travel-adventure set in 1920 Peru. Hats off to Dixon-Price Publishing for resurrecting it. Pity that the copy-editing was not done a little more skillfully, as there are a number of typo's and mis-used homonyms in the book the product of unskilled use of computer spell checker.Still, this is a minor quibble. (A map would have been nice too). Harry Foster's casual employment in the mines, cities, and jungles of Peru are a classic of early 20th Century travel writing. Some might feel that his characterizations of Peruvian Indians, Peruvian &quot;Anglo's, and the Irish are a bit harsh. However, he presents a well-balanced narrative of the country, and its types. This lost world (the 1920's) is a rough and tumble time, gone forever. A great loss. Foster preserves those days for posterity through his colorful writing and astute observations of people and cultures.Many modern travel writers could learn from his unselfconscious writing style. The book never misses a beat. A combination of irony and genuine love of people, regardless of differing cultures, lifts this book out of the mundane. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Adventures of a Tropical Tramp","review":"The Adventures Of A Tropical Tramp is the travel narrative of Harry La Tourette Foster, who spent most of his life after the conclusion of World War I wandering the main roads and back roads of the world, from Mexico and South America, to Asia, the South Pacific, The Caribbean, and the Mediterranean. This particular travelogue is the story of his travels in South America following his discharge from the army. He went aboard a tramp steamer bound for Peru. Landing with no funds or resources, he took a series of odd jobs, eventually becoming a reporter for a Lima paper. He went on to join two missionaries trekking overland to the headwaters of the ..., then continued on adventure filled journeys down the ... tributaries. He ended his travels playing ragtime piano in sleazy bars until he was able to earn his passage home to New York. The Adventures Of A Tropical Tramp is fascinating reading and we can only hope for future volumes detailing his later itinerant travels to far away places and foreign climes."},{"Title":"Tass Is Authorized to Announce...","review":"This is far superior to most spy fiction, in which the heroes rely primarily on their combat skills and on their brains secondarily; they usually have supporting characters to help them do hard intellectual tasks like read.Fortunately, TASS IS AUTHORIZED TO ANNOUNCE is a complete break from that. There's only a little action right near the end, the focus is definitely on what is, essentially, a giant game of chess between the CIA and the KGB, with agents trying to outwit and outthink one another.Although there could be a little confusion at times (the translations from Russian weren't always clear, and two similar characters share the same name), I certainly didn't see any evidence of anti-Semitism as was claimed. For the most part I am highly satisfied with this Soviet spy novel."},{"Title":"Tass Is Authorized to Announce...","review":"This is an unintentionally revealing book, written at the height of the Cold War by a skilled Soviet propagandist. The action centers on an East-West struggle for control of a fictional African country, modeled after Angola. The KGB agents are all gentlemen, well versed in Russian litterature and western philosophy. The CIA agents are, wouldn't you know it, drug smugglers and pro-Nazi. Other &quot;bad guys&quot; are the Chinese and the Israelis. In an invocation of classic Czarist anti-semitism, one prominent baddie is a New York diamond merchant (Couldn't the author at least make him a Jewish semi-conductor manufacturer and bring the novel into the present century?). The weirdness does not stop there. The KGB man outfoxes the CIA man because he can hold his liquor better. The CIA is tied to the Kennedy assasination. And on it goes. This book is an excellent insight into Soviet propaganda and the material that has been force-fed to its citizenry during the Soviet era."},{"Title":"Tass Is Authorized to Announce...","review":"Tass is Authorized to Announce is the Soviet version of any spy thriller you have ever read (or seen on the big screen) - but with the KGB as the good guys, attempting to foil the sinster plots of the CIA. However, Semenov lacks the semantics of say, a Tom Clancy. The plot is razor thin, the anti-semitism is revolting, and the the resolution of the conflict is laughable.While the book is certainly dated, (Cold War intrigue in Africa is so passe), it is an entertaining read if only to see how the USSR understood detente and cold war politics. Other than that, the book is tripe - not recommended."},{"Title":"The Best Poems And Poets of 2003","review":"I didn't realize this is what poetry.com did with the first pages of the books sent to each author containing their own poem until I read the other reviews here, two years after the fact. I thought it was nice at the time to have my poem published in the front, but didn't pay it much attention until now when I had to look up the information for a random reason. It's disappointing, though not surprising, to see this kind of move from a company that wants their starting poetry writers to be 'happy' - but I do not think this is a good practice in anyway. I didn't even think this could be done - I thought the book pages and order would need to be standard and that is unfortuantly not the case. If you like reading these works, you should still consider the book.
