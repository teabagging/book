Operating in the shadows of well-funded, high-visibility Air Force and Navy projects, the former truck driver and pet store owner set a new world record for manned balloon altitude. Rising more than 23 miles over the South Dakota prairie, Piantanida nearly perished trying to set the world record for the highest free fall parachute jump from that height. On his next attempt, he would not be so lucky. Part harrowing adventure story, part space history, part psychological portrait of an extraordinary risk-taker, this story fascinates and intrigues the armchair adventurer in all of us.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=w6BfBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Best Friends (Pied Piper Paperback)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mind-Body Identity Theories (Problems of Philosophy)","description":"Believing that mind-body theories will offer a unified account of mind in its relation to body, Cynthia Macdonald traces the complex history of this theory and focuses on the different arguments of J.J.C.

How much work or sacrifice must allies take on to do their share? Ian Ayres and Jennifer Brown--law professors, activists, husband and wife--propose practical strategies for helping straight men and women advocate for and with the gay community. Straightforward advances a thesis that is at once simple and groundbreaking: to make real progress at the central flashpoints of controversy--marriage rights, employment discrimination, gays in the military, exclusion from the Boy Scouts, and religious controversies over homosexuality--straight as well as gay people need to speak up and act for equality. Ayres and Brown take aim at both the hearts and minds of the general public, focusing on strategies that can change the incentives and therefore the behavior of the recalcitrant. The book is peppered with stories about real people and the decisions they have faced at home, in church, at work, in school, and in politics. It is also filled with creative legal and economic strategies for influencing public and corporate decision-making. For example, Ayres and Brown propose the development of a \\"fair employment mark\\" to help companies advertise inclusive employment policies. They also show how a simple pledge to vacation in states that legalize gay marriage can create powerful incentives for legislatures to amend their marriage laws. Engagingly written and sure to spark debate, Straightforward promises to change the way America thinks about--and participates in--the gay rights movement.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EyK1jJybaVMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Geodesica: Ascent","description":"Geodesica: Descent concludes the compelling, space-faring adventure begun by Geodesica: Ascent.

News of the grisly death greets Edward as he arrives in York for secret negotiations with the leaders of the military Templar Order. His unease deepens when an attempt is made on his life.

This seemingly remote history has inspired a wave of contemporary writing involving hidden artifacts, familial whispers and secrets, and clandestine Jewish ritual practices pointing to a past that had been presumed dead and buried. The Converso's Return explores the cultural politics and literary impact of this reawakened interest in converso and crypto-Jewish history, ancestry, and identity, and asks what this fascination with lost-and-found heritage can tell us about how we relate to and make use of the past. Dalia Kandiyoti offers nuanced interpretations of contemporary fictional and autobiographical texts about crypto-Jews in Cuba, Mexico, New Mexico, Spain, France, the Ottoman Empire, and Turkey. These works not only imagine what might be missing from the historical archive but also suggest an alternative historical consciousness that underscores uncommon convergences of and solidarities within Sephardi, Christian, Muslim, converso, and Sabbatean histories. Steeped in diaspora, Sephardi, transamerican, Iberian, and world literature studies, The Converso's Return illuminates how the converso narrative can enrich our understanding of history, genealogy, and collective memory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FvHrDwAAQBAJ&dq=La+saga+de+los+malditos+/+The+Saga+of+the+Damned+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Politics in Brazil, 1930-1964: An experiment in democracy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g4KRAAAAMAAJ&dq=Politics+in+Brazil,+1930-1964:+An+experiment+in+democracy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ashes in an urn","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ETPTjwEACAAJ&dq=Ashes+in+an+urn&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Follow That Monkey","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Telecommunications Primer: Data, Voice, and Video Communications (2nd Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"This is the Hour","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"ALL CORVETTES ARE RED: The Rebirth of an American Legend","description":"The inside story behind the legendary automobile chronicles its development from drawing board to production vehicle, offering additional insight into the inner workings of the U.S. automotive industry.

Anna R. Igra investigates the interrelated histories of marriage and welfare policy in the early 1900s, revealing how reformers sought to make marriage the solution to women's and children's poverty. Igra taps a rich trove of case files from the National Desertion Bureau, a Jewish husband-location agency, and follows hundreds of deserted women through the welfare and legal systems of early twentieth-century New York City. She integrates a broad range of topics, including Americanization as a gendered process, breadwinning as a measure of manhood, the relationship between consumer culture and social policy formation, the class dimensions of family law, and the Jewish community as a source of welfare policy innovation. Igra analyzes the history of antidesertion reform from its emergence in social policy debates, through the establishment of domestic relations courts, to Depression relief programs. She shows that early twentieth-century reformers, by attempting to make instrumental use of poor people's intimate relations, anticipated welfare policies in our own time that promote marriage as an answer to poverty.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3t79l03Q2j0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Mother's Southern Entertaining","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Phantoms in the Brain","description":"Neuroscientist V.S. Ramachandran is internationally renowned for uncovering answers to the deep and quirky questions of human nature that few scientists have dared to address. His bold insights about the brain are matched only by the stunning simplicity of his experiments -- using such low-tech tools as cotton swabs, glasses of water and dime-store mirrors. In Phantoms in the Brain, Dr. Ramachandran recounts how his work with patients who have bizarre neurological disorders has shed new light on the deep architecture of the brain, and what these findings tell us about who we are, how we construct our body image, why we laugh or become depressed, why we may believe in God, how we make decisions, deceive ourselves and dream, perhaps even why we're so clever at philosophy, music and art. Some of his most notable cases: A woman paralyzed on the left side of her body who believes she is lifting a tray of drinks with both hands offers a unique opportunity to test Freud's theory of denial.

Faludi's reportorial and literary skills unfold with breathtaking confidence and beauty... She goes a long way toward eliminating the black and white, good and evil, male and female polarities that have riven the sexes in the past three decades...\\" Time In 1991, internationally renowned feminist journalist Susan Faludi ignited a revival of the women s movement with her revelatory investigative reportage: Backlash was nothing less than a landmark, uncovering an  undeclared war  against women s equality in the media, advertising, Hollywood, the workplace, and government a war that is still being fought today. Stiffed may be even more essential than Backlash to understanding the cultural riptides that led to Trumpian America. Here, Faludi turns her attention to the so-called  Angry Male  politics plaguing the nation. Through deeply researched, nuanced, and empathetic character studies of distressed industrial workers, laid-off aerospace engineers, combat veterans, football fans, evangelical husbands, suburban and inner-city teenage boys, and Hollywood and porn actors, Stiffed goes beyond the easy explanations of male misbehavior that it s driven by chromosomes or hormones to lay bare the powerful social and economic forces that have shattered the postwar compact defining American manhood. Faludi s vivid storytelling illuminates the historic and traumatic paradigm shift from a  utilitarian  manliness, grounded in civic and communal service, to an  ornamental  masculinity shaped by entertainment, marketing, and performance values. Read in the light of Trumpian politics and the #MeToo movement, Faludi s analysis speaks acutely to our present crisis, and to a foreboding future. Stiffed delivers a searing portrait of modern-day male America, and traces the provenance of a gender war that continues to rage, unabated.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MXLdwDPkpWgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Official Patient's Sourcebook on Dextromethorphan Dependence: A Revised and Updated Directory for the Internet Age","description":"This open access book, published under a CC BY 4.0 license in the Pubmed indexed book series Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology, provides up-to-date information on best practice to improve experimental design and quality of research in non-clinical pharmacology and biomedicine.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PPHRDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Seven Checkpoints: Student Journal","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Autostretching: The Complete Manual of Specific Stretching","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Stronger Abs and Back","description":"Build your center of power!

Pastors Gerald Hiestand and Jay Thomas counteract this problem with their paradigm-shifting view of purity and relationships a view that challenges even the basic assumptions of evangelical subculture. Unlike most books on dating, this one cuts straight to the heart of dating relationships, asserting with confidence that the line must be drawn at  no sexual activity  whatever. Few have dared to define and apply the Bible s understanding of purity in premarital relationships to this degree, but Heistand and Thomas have done it. Furthermore, both authors are vocational pastors who communicate regularly with the target audience and have a proven ability to express biblical truth in a winsome and compelling manner. Sex, Dating, and Relationships adds a new, almost provocative voice to the conversation that, with straightforward theological insight, pleads with Christians to get serious about honoring Christ with their sexuality.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pNhjHxPBGXMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Legal Guide for Lesbian and Gay Couples","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Lickety Split and His Adventure Through Time","description":"Lickety Split, the dinosaur, takes a journey through time from the prehistoric era to modern day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HsFjtwAACAAJ&dq=Lickety+Split+and+His+Adventure+Through+Time&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Rebuild the Small-Block Chevrolet -Revised (S-A Design Workbench Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Live-Action Adventures (Star Wars RPG)","description":"GameAxis Unwired is a magazine dedicated to bring you the latest news, previews, reviews and events around the world and close to you.

A beautifully written, witty memoir that is also an immersive exploration of classical music its power, its meanings, and what it can teach us about ourselves from the MacArthur  Genius  Grantwinning pianist  Jeremy Denk has written a love letter to the music, and especially to the music teachers, in his life.  Conrad Tao, pianist and composer In Every Good Boy Does Fine, renowned pianist Jeremy Denk traces an implausible journey. His life is already a little tough as a precocious, temperamental six-year-old piano prodigy in New Jersey, and then a family meltdown forces a move to New Mexico. There, Denk must please a new taskmaster, an embittered but devoted professor, while navigating junior high school. At sixteen he escapes to college in Ohio, only to encounter a bewildering new cast of music teachers, both kind and cruel. After many humiliations and a few triumphs, he ultimately finds his way as a world-touring pianist, a MacArthur  Genius,  and a frequent performer at Carnegie Hall. Many classical music memoirs focus on famous musicians and professional accomplishments, but this book focuses on the everyday: neighborhood teacher, high school orchestra, local conductor. There are few writers capable of so deeply illuminating the trials of artistic practice hours of daily repetition, mystifying advice, pressure from parents and teachers. But under all this struggle is a love letter to the act of teaching. In lively, endlessly imaginative prose, Denk dives deeply into the pieces and composers that have shaped him Bach, Mozart, and Brahms, among others and offers lessons on melody, harmony, and rhythm. How do melodies work? Why is harmony such a mystery to most people? Why are teachers so obsessed with the metronome? In Every Good Boy Does Fine, Denk shares the most meaningful lessons of his life, and tries to repay a debt to his teachers. He also reminds us that we must never stop asking questions about music and its purposes: consolation, an armor against disillusionment, pure pleasure, a diversion, a refuge, and a vehicle for empathy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fiMzEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Doing Second Language Research (Oxford Handbooks for Language Teachers)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"201 Turkish Verbs: Fully Conjugated in All the Tenses (201 Verbs)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Technical Communication","description":"Comprehensive and truly accessible, Technical Communication guides students through planning, drafting, and designing the documents that will matter in their professional lives.

Join John Wooden and Jay Carty to discover the building blocks and key values--from confidence to faith--that have brought Coach to the pinnacle of success as a leader, a teacher, and a follower of God.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BYSaoAEACAAJ&dq=The+John+Wooden+Pyramid+Of+Success&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Professional CSS: Cascading Style Sheets for Web Design","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zl0TPWJikkIC&dq=Professional+CSS:+Cascading+Style+Sheets+for+Web+Design&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lord of Light (Avon N187)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Hindi English English Hindi Dictionary (Hippocrene Practical Dictionaries)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Sean: The Story of a Child's Life and Death","description":"Many families have lost a child to cancer, including Miller whose 14-year-old son died of the disease.

At the Abbey Theatre W. B. Yeats is working with the talented John Synge, his resident playwright. It is here that Synge, the author of The Playboy of the Western World and The Tinker's Wedding, will meet an actress still in her teens named Molly Allgood. Rebellious, irreverent, beautiful, flirtatious, Molly is a girl of the inner-city tenements, dreaming of stardom in America. Witty and watchful, she has dozens of admirers, but it is the damaged older playwright who is her secret passion despite the barriers of age, class, education, and religion. Synge is a troubled, reticent genius, the son of a once prosperous landowning family, a poet of fiery language and tempestuous passions. Yet his life is hampered by conventions and by the austere and God-fearing mother with whom he lives. Scarred by a childhood of immense loneliness and severity, he has long been ill, but he loves to walk the wild places of Ireland. The affair, sternly opposed by friends and family, is turbulent, sometimes cruel, and often tender. 1950s postwar London, an old woman walks across the city in the wake of a hurricane. As she wanders past bomb sites and through the forlorn beauty of wrecked terraces and wintry parks, her mind drifts in and out of the present as she remembers her life's great love, her once dazzling career, and her travels in America. Vivid and beautifully written, Molly's swirling, fractured narrative moves from Dublin to London via New York with luminous language and raw feeling. Ghost Light is a story of great sadness and joy a tour de force from the widely acclaimed and bestselling author of Star of the Sea.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aDzteIlBZ-gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Selling the Sizzle: The Magic and Logic of Entertainment Marketing","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Stand Alone Study Pack for Elementary Statistics: Picturing the World (Your Student Study Pack)","description":"Everything a student needs to succeed in one place.

Six priorities guide today's planning, programming, and budgeting decisions: (1) maintain a credible, modern, and survivable sea based strategic deterrent; (2) sustain forward presence, distributed globally in places that matter; (3) develop the capability and capacity to win decisively; (4) focus on critical afloat and ashore readiness to ensure the Navy is adequately funded and ready; (5) enhance the Navy's asymmetric capabilities in the physical domains as well as in cyberspace and the electromagnetic spectrum; and (6) sustain a relevant industrial base, particularly in shipbuilding.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NQxUwwEACAAJ&dq=PT-Boat+Squadrons+-+US+Navy+Torpedo+Boats+(Spearhead)+(No.+18)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mystery at Blackbeard's Cove","description":"Set on Ocracoke Island in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, approaching Halloween festivities find Billy, Daniel, Stephanie, and Mark exhausted from their trip to sea to give their eccentric friend Mrs. Nemmish the pirate burial she insisted on. But now they are trapped in a tunnel, locked in by Zeek, local scoundrel and direct descendent of Israel Hands, who is racing against them to find the hidden treasure. Is the treasure's location on the map that Zeek took from them, or could it be in the very tunnel where they are tripping over skeletons and struggling to find another way out? Luckily, they have allies - ghostly allies of Blackbeard and Mrs. Nemmish herself, who has been taken on board the ghost ship Queen's Anne's Revenge. This rollicking tale magically combines this unruly group of youngsters, Blackbeard's ghost, secret tunnels, skeletons, hidden treasure, a very mysterious inheritance, the Bermuda Triangle, the Underground Railroad, and a hurricane hitting the Outer Banks in a page-turning delight, full of mystery, laughs, suspense, and adventure. This book also captures much of the essence and rich history of this fascinating location. After 30 years of regular visits to Ocracoke Island, the author has come to know the place and the people, and has enriched this fun tale with real characters, locations, lore, and legends passed down through the generations of residents from the days when Blackbeard had his hideout there. This book is a history lesson of the greatest kind - with the past and the present wonderfully and entertainingly intertwined.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xw7QH-l858IC&dq=Mystery+at+Blackbeard%27s+Cove&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Multicultural Literature for Children and Young Adults: Reflections on Critical Issues","description":"There is much discussion of multiculturalism in education. This is especially true of multicultural literature for children and young adults. The rise of multicultural literature is a political rather than a literary movement; it is a movement to claim space in literature and in education for historically marginalized social groups rather than one to renovate the craft of literature itself. Multicultural literature has been closely bound with the cause of multiculturalism in general and thus has been confronted with resistance from conservatives. This book discusses many of the controversial issues surrounding multicultural literature for children and young adults. The volume begins with a look at some of the foundational and theoretical issues related to multicultural literature. The second part of the book addresses issues related to the creation and critique of multicultural literature, including the authorship of such works and the role of the reader in determining whether or not a work is multicultural. The third looks at the place of multicultural literature in the education of children and young adults. Throughout its discussion, the book makes extensive references to a large body of multicultural fiction and provides a thorough review of research on this important topic.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=X6uHvit9dCQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Meditations Through the Rg Veda : Four-Dimensional Man","description":"This book reconstructs the original and origins of the Rig Veda, (between 5.000 to 2.500 B.C, ) the first Indo-European written document ever to show the origin of cultures and the power of music in the recitation and construction of the original hymns. Here we find the original geometries, original forms, original sacrifice of any form to claim supremacy over the others and the continued movement of human life. This book brings together early humans with modern neurobiological discoveries and shows the origins of multiple centers of knowing (the gods), the movement of the singer and the song in a world that avoids idolatry of substances by insisting in the constant movement of singer, song, and music. If you thought you knew all there is to know about the language you use, read this book and find out the idolatry of its imagery and the possible sacrifice needed for a happy, communal and divine life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t7mNaMDu6o0C&dq=Meditations+Through+the+Rg+Veda+:+Four-Dimensional+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Counterblast","description":"B nis soient les USA, corne d'abondance du surr alisme quotidien.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f11VmgEACAAJ&dq=Counterblast&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The city of trembling leaves","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Food Plants of the Sonoran Desert","description":"Winner of the Society for Economic Botany s Mary W. Klinger Book Award The seemingly inhospitable Sonoran Desert has provided sustenance to indigenous peoples for centuries. Although it is to all appearances a land bereft of useful plants, fully one-fifth of the desert's flora are edible. This volume presents information on nearly 540 edible plants used by people of more than fifty traditional cultures of the Sonoran Desert and peripheral areas. Drawing on thirty years of research, Wendy C. Hodgson has synthesized the widely scattered literature and added her own experiences to create an exhaustive catalog of desert plants and their many and varied uses. Food Plants of the Sonoran Desert includes not only plants such as gourds and legumes but also unexpected food sources such as palms, lilies, and cattails, all of which provided nutrition to desert peoples. Each species entry lists recorded names and describes indigenous uses, which often include nonfood therapeutic and commodity applications. The agave, for example, is cited for its use as food and for alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, syrup, fiber, cordage, clothing, sandals, nets, blankets, lances, fire hearths, musical instruments, hedgerows, soap, and medicine, and for ceremonial purposes. The agave entry includes information on harvesting, roasting, and consumption and on distinguishing between edible and inedible varieties. No other source provides such a vast amount of information on traditional plant uses for this region. Accessible to general readers, this book is an invaluable compendium for anyone interested in the desert s hidden bounty.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_7BYEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Vanishing Hitchhiker American Urban Legends & Their Meanings","description":"The book that launched America's urban legend obsession!

When God saw Adam and Eve choosing a lonely downhill slide into sin and separation from a personal relationship with Him, affecting every human being from that time on, His heart responded as only a Father's could. He sent His Son Jesus Christ to restore every broken relationship by a heart to heart encounter. On a bloodied Cross on a rocky crag in a distant land, Jesus died to show the love of His Father. He rose from the dead to enable everyone who believed in Him, who embraced Him in the heart, to be restored to that love of His Father. By embracing Jesus Christ in the heart through faith, God's heart and man's heart are again one. The offering of that embrace is incredibly documented in one of the most stirring passages ever spoken and written, The Sermon on the Mount. This book covers chapters 5-7 of the Gospel of Matthew beginning with the Beatitudes and Jesus' own commentary that follows them. It is ideally suited for small group Bible Study, home study group series, Sunday School classes, preaching idea and personal devotional study.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PYHfwAEACAAJ&dq=GRAMPAS+ARE+FOR+ALL+SEASONS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Washington University in St. Louis: Off the Record (College Prowler) (College Prowler: Washington University in St. Louis Off the Record)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=krB_0VwEMJwC&dq=Washington+University+in+St.+Louis:+Off+the+Record+(College+Prowler)+(College+Prowler:+Washington+University+in+St.+Louis+Off+the+Record)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bodymapping: The Step-By-Step Guide to Fitting Real Bodies","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Global Journeys in Metro Detroit: A Multicultural Guide to the Motor City","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4D15AAAAMAAJ&dq=Global+Journeys+in+Metro+Detroit:+A+Multicultural+Guide+to+the+Motor+City&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Albert Einstein (Oxford Portraits in Science)","description":"Examines the personality as well as the thought process which led this physicist to his discoveries which have helped shape our understanding of the natural world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4U-14EWnwA8C&dq=Albert+Einstein+(Oxford+Portraits+in+Science)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Merry XXXmas Book of Erotica","description":"Santa has a treat for eager readers who just can't wait until Christmas morning.

Newton had a long and eventful life apart from his scentific discoveries. He was born at the beginnings of the Civil War and his studies were disrupted by the twin disasters of the Great Plague and the Fire of London. A brilliant and enigmatic genius, Newton dabbled in alchemy, wrote over a million words on the Bible, quarrelled with his contemporaries and spent his last years as Master of the Royal Mint as well as President of the Royal Society. This book sets Newton's life and work against this dramatic intellectual rebirth. Among his friends and contemporaries were Samuel Pepys, the colourful diarist, John Evelyn, the eccentric antiquarian, the astronomers Edmund Halley and John Flamsteed, and Christopher Wren, the greatest architect of his age. They were all instrumental in the founding of the Royal Society and their aim was nothing less than to examine the whole field of scientific knowledge.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CCtpQgAACAAJ&dq=Newton%27s+Apple:+Isaac+Newton+and+the+English+Scientific+Renaissance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Challenges","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"When the Dow Breaks: Insights & Strategies for Protecting Your Profits in a Turbulent Market","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ice Floes And Polar Bears: An Inside Look At Nursing Homes","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"La Sexta Isla (La Llave de Cristal) (Spanish Edition)","description":"\\"Now a major motion picture!

Although it took her only three months to complete the first draft, working at night so as not to conflict with her secretarial job, it was another four years before The Enduring Hills was published. Three years later, when her sixth novel appeared, Janice Holt Giles's works had accumulated sales of nearly two million copies. Between 1950 and 1975 she wrote twenty-four books, most of which were bestsellers, regularly reviewed in the New York Times, and selected for inclusion in popular book clubs. Her picture held pride of place in her literary agent's New York office, alongside those of Willa Cather, H.G. Wells, and Edith Wharton, yet until now there has been no biography of this immensely popular American writer. Humbly professing to be \\"just a good storyteller,\\" Giles was a keen observer of life with great sensitivity, an ear for language, and a superb imagination. Her artistic achievements become even more remarkable when placed in the context of her often difficult personal struggles. Dianne Watkins Stuart, for years the acknowledged expert on Giles's work, has traced the path of her unique life. Stuart walked around the small house where Giles's brother was born and The Kinta Years (1973) had its origin, wandered through the yard where The Plum Thicket (1954) grew, and made countless trips to Adair County, Kentucky, to trace the trails of the Piney Ridge trilogy (The Enduring Hills, Miss Willie, Tara's Healing) and seek out the day-to-day life of her later years. Stuart's long-anticipated biography provides both a narrative of Giles's life and an in-depth description of the art and commerce of American publishing in the middle years of the century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HksoEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Secret Doctrine, Part 2: Synthesis of Science, Religion and Philosophy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S9mi4lU4PMUC&dq=The+Secret+Doctrine,+Part+2:+Synthesis+of+Science,+Religion+and+Philosophy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wyoming Wildcat (spur)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Sign of the Crooked Arrow (Hardy Boys, Book 28)","description":"The Hardy brothers interrupt their investigations of jewelry-store holdups to answer a plea from their cousin on a New Mexico cattle ranch.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hHwpAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Sign+of+the+Crooked+Arrow+(Hardy+Boys,+Book+28)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Last Physician: Walker Percy and the Moral Life of Medicine","description":"Collection of essays on the connection between medicine and literature and how novelists and physicians are both, in a sense, diagnosticians; the book focuses, in particular, on Walker Percy, a writer who had trained as a pathologist.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7o7xrLNtNOIC&dq=The+Last+Physician:+Walker+Percy+and+the+Moral+Life+of+Medicine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Present past, past present;: A personal memoir","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eWqePwAACAAJ&dq=Present+past,+past+present%3B:+A+personal+memoir&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Myths & legends of China,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Old Testament History","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Five Star Expressions - Temptation's Warrior","description":"\\"Filled with everything I love most about Highland romance.\\" Melissa Mayhue, award-winning author of Warrior's Redemption She's On Her Way to Safety It's a sign of Lady Rosalia Armstrong's desperation that she's seeking refuge in a place as rugged and challenging as the Scottish Highlands.

She shows that these were arguments that thrived in the medium of eighteenth-century Britain's culture of politeness. In the debate about the balance between truthfulness and politeness, Davidson argues that eighteenth-century writers from Locke to Austen come down firmly on the side of politeness. This is the case even when it is associated with dissimulation or hypocrisy. These writers argue that the open profession of vice is far more dangerous for society than even the most glaring discrepancies between what people say in public and what they do in private. This book explores what happens when controversial arguments in favour of hypocrisy enter the mainstream, making it increasingly hard to tell the difference between hypocrisy and more obviously attractive qualities like modesty, self-control and tact.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uKvR8Yh_mg0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Battle for the Soul","description":"An award-winning political journalist for The Atlantic tells the inside story of how the embattled Democratic Party, seeking a direction for its future during the Trump years, successfully regained the White House. The 2020 presidential campaign was a defining moment for America. As Donald Trump and his nativist populism cowed the Republican Party into submission, many Democrats haunted by Hillary Clinton s shocking loss in 2016 and the resulting four-year-long identity crisis were convinced that he would be unbeatable. Their party and the country, it seemed, might never recover. How, then, did Democrats manage to win the presidency, especially after the longest primary race with the biggest field ever? How did they keep themselves united through an internal struggle between newly empowered progressives and establishment forces playing out against a pandemic, an economic crisis, and a new racial reckoning? Edward-Isaac Dovere s Battle for the Soul is the searing, fly-on-the-wall account of the Democrats  journey through recalibration and rebirth. Dovere traces this process: from the early days in the wilderness of the post-Obama era to the jockeying of potential candidates; from the backroom battles and exhausting campaigns to the unlikely triumph of the man few expected to win; and on through the inauguration and the insurrection at the Capitol. Dovere draws on years of on-the-ground reporting and contemporaneous conversations with the key players whether with Pete Buttigieg in his hotel suite in Des Moines an hour before he won the Iowa caucuses or with Joe Biden in his first-ever interview in the Oval Office as well as with aides, advisors, and voters. Offering unparalleled access and an insider s command of the campaign, Battle for the Soul takes a compelling look at the policies, politics, and people, as well as the often absurd process of running for president. This fresh and timely story brings you on the trail, into the private rooms, and along to eavesdrop on critical conversations. You will never see campaigns or this turning point in our history the same way again.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KJNdEAAAQBAJ&dq=Battle+for+the+Soul&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Constructive Psychotherapy: A Practical Guide","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Lobas De Mar / Sea Wolves (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Rotisserie Chickens to the Rescue! : How To Use the Already-Roasted Chickens You Purchase at the Market to Make More Than 125 Simple and Delicious Meals","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Motley Fool's Money After 40: Building Wealth for a Better Life","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"On Playing a Poor Hand Well: Insights from the Lives of Those Who Have Overcome Childhood Risks and Adversities (Norton Professional Books)","description":"Many happy and productive adults grew up under difficult conditions that they couldn't change, no matter how hard they tried.

Through an examination of a series of case studies and new theoretical developments, Bassnett reviews the current state of comparative literature world-wide in the 1990s. In the past twenty years of a range of new developments in critical theory have changed patterns of reading and approaches to literature: gender-based criticism, reception studies, the growth of translation studies, deconstruction and orientalism all have had a profound impact on work in comparative literature. Bassnett asks questions not only about the current state of comparative literature as a discipline, but also about its future. Since its beginnings in the nineteenth century, comparative literature has been closely associated with the emergence of national cultures, and its present expansion in many parts of the world indicates that this process is again underway, after a period of narrowly Eurocentric research in the field.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=olB5QgAACAAJ&dq=Comparative+Literature:+A+Critical+Introduction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"DEADLY BETRAYAL","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"I have no mouth,: And I must scream;","description":"Seven stunning stories of speculative fiction by the author of A Boy and His Dog.

His techniques have spawned countless imitators, most of whom pay lip service to the buzzword \\"contrarian,\\" but few can match his performance. His Kemper-Dreman High Return Fund has been the leader since its inception in 1988 -- the number one equity-income fund among all 208 ranked by Lipper Analytical Services, Inc. Dreman is also one of a handful of money managers whose clients have beaten the runaway market over the past five, ten, and fifteen years. Now, as the longest bull market in the history of the stock market winds down, there is increasing volatility and a great deal of uncertainty. This is the climate that tests the mettle of the pros, the worries of the average investor, and the success of David Dreman's brilliant new strategies for the next millennium. Contrarian Investment Strategies: The Next Generation shows investors how to outperform professional money managers and profit from potential Wall Street panics -- all in Dreman's trademark style, which The New York Times calls \\"witty and clear as a silver bell.\\" Dreman reveals a proven, systematic, and safe way to beat the market by buying stocks of good companies when they are currently out of favor. At the heart of his book is a fundamental psychological insight: investors overreact. Dreman demonstrates how investors consistently overvalue the so-called \\"best\\" stocks and undervalue the so-called \\"worst\\" stocks, and how earnings and other surprises affect the best and worst stocks in opposite ways. Since surprises are a way of life in the market, Dreman shows you how to profit from these surprises with his ingenious new techniques, most of which have been developed in the nineties. You'll learn: Why contrarian stocks offer extra protection in bear markets, as well as delivering superior returns when the bull roars. Why a high dividend yield is just as important for the aggressive investor as it is for \\"widows and orphans.\\" Why owning Treasury bills and government bonds -- the \\"safest investments\\" for centuries -- is like being fully margined at the top of the 1929 market. Why Initial Public Offerings are a guaranteed loser's game. Why you should avoid Nasdaq (\\"the market of the next hundred years\\") like the plague. Why crisis, panic, and even market downturns are the contrarian investor's best friend. Why the chances of hitting a home run using the Street's best research are worse than being the big winner in the New York State Lottery. Based on cutting-edge research and irrefutable statistics, David Dreman's revolutionary techniques will benefit professionals and laymen alike.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zk8NMSoMDs4C&dq=Contrary+Investing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The fire of creation","description":"This is a new release of the original 1925 edition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3DEUnwEACAAJ&dq=The+fire+of+creation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Monk (Penguin Classics)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Perpetrators","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Restless Wind","description":"A headstrong rancher determined to make it on his own.

Ger Kelly, a tough twelve-year-old, at the centre of whatever mischief takes place in his Dublin neighbourhood, sneaks into the Dublin Horse Show. This is a very posh event and he and his friends are there to cause trouble. Then Ger sees a vision of beauty. She is Suzanne O'Carroll on her horse Star Dancer. They are dancing! Ger never imagined that a horse could float sideways, pirouette, or skip like a child. He is captivated. He hangs around and eventually manages to strike up a conversation with Suzanne. She is learning dressage and dreams of riding her horse in the Olympic Games. Ger longs with all his heart to ride a horse like Star Dancer. Suzanne arranges that Ger can groom her horse at the show grounds every day, and so Ger begins the first job he has ever had. He has entered a magical new world. His pals make fun of him, but for the first time in his life Ger does not care what they think. Suzanne and Ger follow the horse events of the season, to gymkhanas, point-to-points and local and major shows. Ger makes many mistakes and his friends cause problems and difficulties, but Suzanne sticks by him and they become firm friends. The two help each other. It will take years of hard work for Suzanne to achieve her dream, but Ger's dream is even more demanding. He must shrug off his old way of life and become caring and disciplined if he is to be good with horses. STAR DANCER is a story about growing up. It is also an adventure story, filled with thrills and excitement, and a tingle of danger. It is full of the unique atmosphere of the horse world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9JeCBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Double Wedding Ring Quilts: Coming Full Circle","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Crabwalk","description":"Hailed by critics and readers alike as Gnter Grass's best book since The Tin Drum, Crabwalk is an engrossing account of the sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff and a critical meditation on Germany's struggle with its wartime memories. The Gustloff, a German cruise ship turned refugee carrier, was attacked by a Soviet submarine in January 1945. Some nine thousand people went down in the Baltic Sea, making it the deadliest maritime disaster of all time. Born to an unwed mother on a lifeboat the night of the attack, Paul Pokriefke is a middle-aged journalist trying to piece together the tragic events. For his teenage son, who dabbles in the dark, far-right corners of the Internet, the Gustloff embodies the denial of Germany's suffering. Crabwalk is at once a captivating tale of a tragedy at sea and a fearless examination of the ways different generations of Germans now view their past.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3URNvgAACAAJ&dq=Crabwalk&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Juliette Low: Girl Scout Founder","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Spaces of the Mind: Narrative and Community in the American West (Frontiers of Narrative)","description":"Spaces of the Mind reveals how both immigrant European and modern Native communities and individuals use oral and written narratives to define and center themselves in time and space. Elaine A. Jahner skillfully weaves together years of fieldwork among the Standing Rock Sioux in North Dakota, her own memories of growing up in a German-Russian town across the Missouri River from the Standing Rock Sioux, and an illuminating set of narrative concepts. Spaces of the Mind proposes a theory of cognitive style that emphasizes the ways in which distinct cultural identities are expressed through the structure of a narrative and the unfolding of its performance, telling, or reading. Themes of creativity and survival amid loss pervade the stories told by Natives about themselves and their past when discussing the inundation of the original Standing Rock Sioux village during the Oahe Dam construction in the 1950s. Immigrant Germans and Alsatians struggled to reconcile the hardships of the northern Plains with what they left behind in the Old World, and the narratives of a German-Russian community reflect and encourage survival in the face of transition. Jahner also studies how two prominent novelists?James Welch, a member of the Blackfeet community, and Mildred Walker, who left her native New England for the West? perceive a single landscape, the state of Montana, and how it has influenced their thought and narratives. Spaces of the Mind provides a fresh understanding of Western literature and culture, encourages a reconsideration of the formation and modern character of the American West, and contributes to a fuller appreciation of the significance of narrative.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N_pc8FGUQicC&dq=Spaces+of+the+Mind:+Narrative+and+Community+in+the+American+West+(Frontiers+of+Narrative)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Time's Enemy (Star Trek Deep Space Nine: Invasion, Book 3)","description":"The Federation is threatened by this ancient mystery when a battered and broken version of the Defiantis found, frozen for five thousand years, in an icy cloud of cometary debris.

Half-Jewish, he is unable to attend his high school due to Nazi laws, but as a mathematical genius, he has gained access to an opportunity that will assumedly spare and support him and eight other  special cases.  Though Josef is unable to forget about the war and the unknown fate of his family for the two years the Institute offers him sanity and safety, he and the others manage to discover friendship, love, and generosity within and between each other. They work side by side, under the direction of Professor Avilov (The Chief), on genetic experiments and nuclear research quietly attempting to sabotage the war that is funding their work.

But most of us are 200 years behind the curve when it comes to making intelligent risk-based decisions: We refuse to fly, but don't wear seat belts in our far more dangerous cars. We panic about toxic waste dumps, but collectively smoke a billion cigarettes a year. In this entertaining and enlightening look at risk in the modern age, John Ross argues that the burgeoning science of risk assessment has given us powerful new tools to cope in a complex world, if we could only learn how to speak the language. Ross examines the building blocks of this new language, and helps us identify and relinquish long-held, often pre-set, biological and psychological responses to risk. Through vivid stories and compelling science, Ross empowers us to take control of our lives and to exercise our most basic democratic freedom the power to make our own decisions both as individuals and as a society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hDVyswEACAAJ&dq=The+Polar+Bear+Strategy:+Reflections+on+Risk+in+Modern+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Comforts of Home: Creating Relaxed Rooms With A Romantic Feel","description":"The gold standard for learning interior design, now published by Wiley In this Eleventh Edition of Beginnings of Interior Environments, accomplished interior designer and instructor Lynn M.

As religion lost its hold on the public mind, clergymen and educated women, powerless in the male-dominated industrial society, banded together to have a profound effect on the only areas still open to their influence - the arts and literature. Ann Douglas explores their impact on the best-selling novels and magazines of the day to show how women exploited their feminine image and idealized the very qualities that kept them powerless: timidity, piety, narcissism, and a disdain for competition. The result was a far-reaching social preoccupation with banal melodrama which failed to address the real issues of the day. This is a major, polemical rethinking of the American past which seeks to explain values prevalent in today's popular culture by tracing them back to their roots in Victorian times.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rH6hQgAACAAJ&dq=Feminization+of+American+Culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Create Success Brain Sync Subliminal (Brain Sync audios)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l_8PAQAAMAAJ&dq=Create+Success+Brain+Sync+Subliminal+(Brain+Sync+audios)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Twilight of Democracy: The Bush Plan for America","description":"The book that reveals America is already more than three-quarters of the way down the road to fascism","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ohiFAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Twilight+of+Democracy:+The+Bush+Plan+for+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Confessions of a Grieving Christian","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The War to Save Our Kids: Raising G-rated Kids in an X-rated World","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1FDI8AQbbx0C&dq=The+War+to+Save+Our+Kids:+Raising+G-rated+Kids+in+an+X-rated+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The John Wooden Pyramid of Success: The Authorized Biography, Philosophy and Ultimate Guide to Life, Leadership, Friendship and Love of the Greatest Coach in the History of Sports","description":"The John Wooden Pyramid of Success features the words and values of the master: the official Pyramid of Success Lecture, Coach Wooden's favorite maxims, interviews with him about his life and philosophy, and thirty photos of Wooden throughout his life.

Keck mines the same rich vein of candid, confessional humor as these popular comics, but Oedipus Wrecked goes further in single-mindedly, hilariously recounting every grim detail of the author's almost absurdly varied sexual history. Keck pulls no punches in describing his endless, obsessive erotic experiments. In essays like \\"Ass Backwards,\\" \\"Wet, Hot Presbyterian Summer,\\" and \\"I Was a Teenage Homosexual,\\" Keck skewers his eccentric mother (whose dildo he swipes), documents his plunge into the \\"chorus of coming\\" on a sex party line, and limns a particularly outr  encounter with a girl who demands he participate in water sports but won't \\"have sex\\" because \\"that's a sin.\\" For a driven horndog like Keck, sexual taboos exist to be broken. Still he always pays a price through numbing guilt or fear of discovery   though neither prevents him from embarking on the next quest for love and orgasms. Keck's tableaux of sexual excess are rendered in vivid, unflinching language that marks the emergence of a new voice in contemporary humor that's both cuttingly comic and startlingly revelatory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Cn6XDAAAQBAJ&dq=Oedipus+Wrecked&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Enya - A Day Without Rain","description":"(Piano/Vocal/Guitar Artist Songbook).

An African American obstetrician and civil rights activist from Washington DC, she was descended from lawyers, journalists, politicians, and a judge. At a time when African Americans faced Jim Crow segregation, desperate poverty, and lynch mobs, she advised presidents on civil rights and assisted foreign governments on public health issues. Though articulate, visionary, talented, and skillful at managing her publicity, she was also tragically flawed. Ferebee was president of the Alpha Kappa Alpha black service sorority and later became the president of the powerful National Council of Negro Women in the nascent civil rights era. She stood up to gun-toting plantation owners to bring health care to sharecroppers through her Mississippi Health Project during the Great Depression. A household name in black America for forty years, Ferebee was also the media darling of the thriving black press. Ironically, her fame and relevance faded as African Americans achieved the political power for which she had fought. In She Can Bring Us Home, Diane Kiesel tells Ferebee s extraordinary story of struggle and personal sacrifice to a new generation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sBcvCgAAQBAJ&dq=Manhattan+Telephone+Directory+November+1950+(Yellow+Pages)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Book of Golf: Keys to Lifelong Success","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"T.S.

A graph is a very intuitive and rational structure to visually represent such databases. Graph Data Model (GDM) proposed by the author formalizes data representation and operations on the data in terms of the graph concept. The GDM is an extension of the relational model toward structural representation. In this model, a database is defined by a schema graph where nodes represent record types and arcs represent link types that are relationships between two record types. The capabilities of the GDM include direct representation of many-to-many relationships and of the relationships within a single record type. The characteristic operators are those associated with links: existential, universal, numerical and transitive link operators. Graph Data Language (GDL) is a data language based on this GDM. The essence of the GDL is path expressions used for formulation of queries. The concepts of GDM and GDL have actually been implemented by Ricoh Co., Ltd. and a system based on these concepts is commercially available for many UNIX machines.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CM6qCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Napa Valley Picture Perfect","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zqQKAAAACAAJ&dq=Napa+Valley+Picture+Perfect&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sanditon, the Watsons, Miss","description":"Two tantalizing incomplete stories revisit Austen's customary milieu of courtship and venture into new territory, amid guests at a seaside resort.

That moment showcased her down-to-earth, self-deprecating style -- and her frank openness about the ups and downs she's experienced in life and work. But what the world might not have seen that night is that Teri's self-acceptance is the hard-won effort of a single mother with all the same struggles most women have to juggle -- life, love, bake sale cookies, and dying cats. Now, in the hope that her foibles and insights might inspire and motivate other women, Teri opens up about the little moments that have sustained her through good times and bad. From the everyday (like the importance of letting your daughter spill her macaroni so she knows it's okay to make mistakes) to the rare (a rendezvous with a humpback whale -- and no, he was not a suitor), the message at the heart of Burnt Toast -- that happiness and success are choices that we owe it to ourselves to make -- is sure to resonate with women everywhere.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BTCZAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Barnett Newman: Selected Writings and Interviews","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Something To Believe In","description":"In a world where trust in politicians, corporations and the processes that determine our lives continues to dwindle, this innovative book brings together research, case studies and stories that begin to answer a central question for society: How we can create organisations, institutions, groups and societies that can nurture trusting relationships with one another and among individuals?Something to Believe In provides a fresh take on the corporate responsibility debate, based as it is on the work of key global thinkers on corporate social responsibility, along with a raft of work developed from collaborations between the New Academy of Business and the United Nations Volunteers, UK Department for International Development and TERI-Europe in countries such as Brazil, Nicaragua, Ghana, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Lebanon, Nigeria, the Philippines and South Africa. The focus is on business, and particularly how deeper, more systemic changes to current ways of understanding and undertaking business can and have been enacted in both developed countries and in nations where the Western concept of CSR means nothing. The market-based model of economic thinking-the increasingly distrusted globalisation project-which threatens to sweep all before it is challenged by many of the contributions to this book.The book tells stories such as the mobilization of civil society in Ghana to bring business to account; the reorientation of a business school to focus on values; the life-cycle of ethical chocolate; the accountability of the diamond business in a war zone; the need to reinvent codes of conduct for women workers in the plantations and factories of Nicaragua; a Philippine initiative to economically empower former Moslem liberation fighters; and the development of local governance practices in a South African eco-village.The book is split into four sections. \\"Through Some Looking Glasses\\" contains short, thought-provoking pieces about the issues of trust, belief and change from writers including Thabo Mbeki, Malcolm McIntosh and a reprinted piece from E.M. Forster. Section Two asks how it will be possible to believe in our corporations and provides new approaches from around the world on how space is being opened up to found businesses that are able to create trust. Section Three examines the role of auditing in fostering trust. Corporations continue to attempt to engender trust through their activities in philanthropy, reporting and voluntary programmes. But, post-Enron et al., even the most highly praised corporate mission statements are tarnished. Can social and environmental audits of corporate reports, codes and practices assuage our doubts about boardroom democracy? Section Four examines alternative forms of accountability, transparency and governance from around the world and offers some different ways of thinking about the practice of creating trust in society.Something to Believe In provides a host of fascinating suggestions about redefining and renewing the underlying deal between society and its organizations. It will become a key text for students, thinkers and practitioners in the field of corporate responsibility.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LGRQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kokopelli and Company in Attack of the Smart Pies","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Convective Boiling and Condensation (Oxford Engineering Science)","description":"This is a comprehensive reference on two-phase flows, boiling, and condensation.

A must read!\\"  Barbara McFarland, psychologist and author of My Mother Was Right Based on the intimate stories of women who have struggled with issues of self-esteem, this invaluable book offers step-by-step guidance for women who want to transform themselves and create lives that are powerful, energized, and motivated. A Woman's Self-Esteem is also a guide for helping women learn the impact they can make on their own lives and how their positive actions will result in a stronger sense of competence and self-worth. A pioneer in the field of self-esteem, psychotherapist Nathaniel Branden explains that the foundation of a healthy self-esteem rests on six key practices or virtues--living consciously, self-acceptance, self-responsibility, self-assertiveness, purposeful living, and personal integrity--and reveals how women can cultivate these essential virtues to reach their full potential. The author's inspiring, real-life vignettes show how women have come to terms with these complex issues by breaking away from self-sabotaging patterns and taking the necessary steps to create more satisfying lives. In A Woman's Self-Esteem, Branden debunks common myths and reminds us that self-esteem is not a gift given to us by others. Branden offers a revealing examination of the special issues that women grapple with including romantic love, jealousy, fear of selfishness, expressing anger, defensiveness, and success anxiety. Filled with creative exercises, A Woman's Self Esteem was developed to enhance personal development and fortify self-esteem.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dgS_NAEACAAJ&dq=A+Woman%27s+Self-Esteem:+Struggles+and+Triumphs+in+the+Search+for+Identity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yuppy Puppy: The Art of Pampering Your Pooch","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Rookie of the Year","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Guide to Owning a Miniature Pinscher","description":"The experts at Kennel Club Books present the world's largest series of breed-specific canine care books.

Producing and preserving meats for family meals are sound practices for farm families and some city folks as well-they make possible a wider variety of meats, which can be of the best quality, at less cost. Meat is an essential part of the American diet. It is also an ex pensive food. With the costs high, many persons cannot afford to buy the better cuts; others are being forced to restrict the meat portion of the diet to a minimum, or to use ineffectual substitutes. Commercially in the United States, meat means the flesh of cattle, hogs, and sheep, except where used with a qualifying word such as reindeer meat, crab meat, whale meat, and so on. Meat in this book is used in a broader sense, although not quite so general as to com prise anything and everything eaten for nourishment either by man or beast. To be sure, it includes the flesh of domestic animals and large and small game animals as well; also poultry, domestic fowl raised for their meat and eggs, and game birds, all wild upland birds, shore birds, and waterfowl; and fish.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fubzCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gesamtausgabe Abt. 2 Vorlesungen Bd. 26.

In the 1930s and the 1940s Frank Speck observed the Midwinter Ceremony, the Cayuga thanksgiving for the blessings of life and health, performed in long houses on the Six Nations Reserve in Ontario. Collaborating with Alexander General (Desk heh), the noted Cayuga chief, Speck describes vividly the rites and dances giving thanks to all spiritual entities. Of special interest are the medicine societies that not only prescribed herbs but used powerfully evocative masks in treating the underlying causes of sickness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N00rEAAAQBAJ&dq=Midwinter+rites+of+the+Cayuga+Long+House,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Spiritual foundation of Morality","description":"3 lectures, Norrk?ping, Sweden, May 28-30, 1912 (CW 155) Moral teaching and moral preaching cannot establish morality. It is only by delving into the hidden secrets of life that we can advance not just to moral doctrines but to the moral sources of life, true moral impulses. At different times, humanity has manifested moral life in different ways. To understand these differences, the evolution of consciousness must also be taken into account. Originally morality was a part of human nature, for in their essence human beings are good. But through evolution, there have come errors, deviations, times of falling away. In this small, much-loved cycle of three lectures Rudolf Steiner indicates the sources for the recovery of a living morality for our time. Rudolf Steiner shows the transformation of the virtues through the evolution of consciousness and, above all, through the incarnation of the Christ in the Mystery of Golgotha. Since then, morality works to build up Christ's being. Synopses: Lecture 1 -- Why morality needs to be studied. Preaching morality v. founding morality: examples of ancient India (devotion to wisdom) and ancient Europe (courage). Leprosy in the Middle Ages. The biography of Francis of Assisi; the transformation of courage into love. The reality of moral forces. Lecture 2 -- The caste system; differentiation as to a law of evolution. The betrayal of the Atlantean Mysteries; the consequences for the European population. Racial evolution v. soul evolution. The demons of leprosy overcome by the Christ impulse in Francis of Assisi. Francis's prior incarnation; the mysteries at Colchis and the Buddha. Francis's faith in the original goodness of humanity. Plato's four virtues. Lecture 3 -- The nature of evil and freedom; the teaching of the mean. Interest as a precondition for understanding and moral conduct. Spiritual Science, as divine wisdom, stimulates interest. During the third post-Atlantean cultural epoch, interest was regulated by the instinctive virtue of \\"wisdom\\"; today, interest must be regulated by conscious truthfulness. The lack of truthfulness in modern times; theosophy as an educator of truthfulness. Truthfulness as the virtue of the sentient soul. Courage as the instinctive virtue of the mind soul in the fourth epoch; today, in the fifth epoch, it must become love, based on understanding. This is promoted by a theosophical comprehension of the Christ. Temperance as the virtue of the consciousness soul is still instinctive in the fifth epoch; it will be replaced by \\"life wisdom\\" in the sixth epoch. The effect of spiritual-scientific wisdom on the body. The virtue of \\"justice.\\" Knowledge of the suprasensory world through wonder, astonishment, faith. The evolution of conscience. The Christ impulse is naked; it must be clothed by impulses of wonder, love, conscience. Founding v. preaching morality: the reality of the Christ impulse v. abstract ideals of brotherhood. How goodness builds and evil destroys. This volume is a partial translation of Theosophische Moral (CW 155).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1OTClik1UbQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Winter Mantle","description":"Normandy 1067---William may have conquered England, but it is a conquest of a different kind that one English earl has in mind. Fresh from his defeat of King Harold at the Battle of Hastings, William of Normandy has returned home in triumph, accompanied by the English nobles he cannot trust to leave behind. For Waltheof of Huntington, however, rebellion is not at the forefront of his thoughts. From the moment he catches sight of Judith, daughter of the King's formidable sister, he knows he has found his future wife. When Waltheof saves Judith's life, it is clear that the attraction is mutual. But marriage has little to do with love in medieval Europe. When William refuses to let the couple wed, Waltheof joins forces with his fellow rebels in an uprising against the King. William brutally crushes the rebellion, but realizes that Waltheof cannot be ignored. Marrying him to his niece, he decides, is the perfect way to keep him in check. But is the match between the Saxon earl and Norman lady made in heaven or hell? As their children grow, Waltheof and Judith must choose between their feelings for each other and older loyalties. At the same time, the reputation of Waltheof's Norman acquaintance Simon de Senlis continues to flourish. The son of William's chamberlain, he shares a special bond with Waltheof, who rescued him from being trampled by a horse when he was a squire. Now Simon enjoys the confidence of both the King and the rebel earl. And when tension between the two ignites once more, it is Simon who is set to reap the reward. Based on an astonishing true story of honor, treachery, and love, The Winter Mantle is historical fiction at its very best, reaching from the turbulent reign of William the conqueror to the high drama of the Crusades.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kEhopbGFX5YC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My American Heritage; A Collection of Songs, Poems, Speeches, Sayings, and Other Writings Dear to Our Hearts","description":"Collection of songs, poems, speeches, sayings and other writings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=b5cOAQAAMAAJ&dq=My+American+Heritage%3B+A+Collection+of+Songs,+Poems,+Speeches,+Sayings,+and+Other+Writings+Dear+to+Our+Hearts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hacking Video Game Consoles: Turn your old video game systems into awesome new portables (ExtremeTech)","description":"Space Invaders and Asteroids are back!

In A Selection of Modern Italian Poetry in Translation Roberta Payne provides a bilingual collection of ninety-two poems by thirty-five Italian poets, including works of classicism and passionate decadentism, examples of crepuscularism, and poetry by Ungaretti, Montale, and Quasimodo. Payne pays particular attention to poets of the fifties and sixties, futurists, and female poets. She notes that the futurists, who have rarely been translated, were particularly important as they were truly original, attempting to develop new notions of word, line, sound, and phrase.

Samuelson Award for scholarly writing on lifelong financial security, John Cochrane's Asset Pricing now appears in a revised edition that unifies and brings the science of asset pricing up to date for advanced students and professionals. Cochrane traces the pricing of all assets back to a single idea--price equals expected discounted payoff--that captures the macro-economic risks underlying each security's value. By using a single, stochastic discount factor rather than a separate set of tricks for each asset class, Cochrane builds a unified account of modern asset pricing. He presents applications to stocks, bonds, and options. Each model--consumption based, CAPM, multifactor, term structure, and option pricing--is derived as a different specification of the discounted factor. The discount factor framework also leads to a state-space geometry for mean-variance frontiers and asset pricing models. It puts payoffs in different states of nature on the axes rather than mean and variance of return, leading to a new and conveniently linear geometrical representation of asset pricing ideas. Cochrane approaches empirical work with the Generalized Method of Moments, which studies sample average prices and discounted payoffs to determine whether price does equal expected discounted payoff. He translates between the discount factor, GMM, and state-space language and the beta, mean-variance, and regression language common in empirical work and earlier theory. The book also includes a review of recent empirical work on return predictability, value and other puzzles in the cross section, and equity premium puzzles and their resolution. Written to be a summary for academics and professionals as well as a textbook, this book condenses and advances recent scholarship in financial economics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=20pmeMaKNwsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Meet The Stars Of Roswell","description":"Provides information about the actors who portray the characters on the television program, Roswell.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JobGAAAACAAJ&dq=Meet+The+Stars+Of+Roswell&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Did You See What I Said?","description":"What we confess, what we say, is very important.

Yarborough, the People's Senator (Focus on American History)","description":"\\"Ralph Yarborough was a loyal friend and a tower of integrity. He was a shining example to all of us who serve in public office. 'Discouraged' was not in his vocabulary. He taught us never to give up or give in and that, with a courageous attitude, victory was always possible next time or next year. In his biography of this greatly respected and much beloved giant of our time, Patrick Cox shows us why Ralph Yarborough truly was 'the People's Senator.'\\"  Senator Edward M. Kennedy Revered by many Texans and other Americans as \\"the People's Senator,\\" Ralph Webster Yarborough (1903-1996) fought for \\"the little people\\" in a political career that places him in the ranks of the most influential leaders in Texas history. The only U. S. Senator representing a former Confederate state to vote for every significant piece of modern civil rights legislation, Yarborough became a cornerstone of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society programs in the areas of education, environmental preservation, and health care. In doing so, he played a major role in the social and economic modernization of Texas and the American South. He often defied conventional political wisdom with his stands against powerful political interests and with his vocal opposition to the Vietnam War. Yet to this day, his admirers speak of Yarborough as an inspiration for public service and a model of political independence and integrity. This biography offers the first in-depth look at the life and career of Ralph Yarborough. Patrick L. Cox draws on Yarborough's personal and professional papers, as well as on extensive interviews with the Senator and his associates, to follow Yarborough from his formative years in East Texas through his legal and judicial career in the 1930s, decorated military service in World War II, unsuccessful campaigns for Texas governor in the 1950s, distinguished tenure in the United States Senate from 1957 to 1970, and return to legal practice through the 1980s. Although Yarborough's liberal politics set him at odds with most of the Texas power brokers of his time, including Lyndon Johnson, his accomplishments have become part of the national fabric. Medicare recipients, beneficiaries of the Cold War G. I. Bill, and even beachcombers on Padre Island National Seashore all share in the lasting legacy of Senator Ralph Yarborough.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KUr1rOrgVggC&dq=Ralph+W.+Yarborough,+the+People%27s+Senator+(Focus+on+American+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Olcu veya yoldaki isiklar 4","description":"his second compelling volume includes an introduction to the heart and its dynamics, as well as detailed examination of such concepts as freedom, altruism, wisdom, sainthood, intoxication and sobriety, wakefullness, and the universal man.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JBRRCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Transition to Twins: Your First Multi-Engine Rating (ASA Training Manuals)","description":"The essentials of a complete multi-engine training program with study questions, written exam, and syllabus.

By exploring the theological dimensions of Freud's writings and revealing unexpected psychoanalytic implications in the religious philosophy of Rosenzweig's masterwork, The Star of Redemption, Santner makes an original argument for understanding religions of revelation in therapeutic terms, and offers a penetrating look at how this understanding suggests fruitful ways of reconceiving political community. Santner's crucial innovation in this new study is to bring the theological notion of revelation into a broadly psychoanalytic field, where it can be understood as a force that opens the self to everyday life and encourages accountability within the larger world. Revelation itself becomes redefined as an openness toward what is singular, enigmatic, even uncanny about the Other, whether neighbor or stranger, thereby linking a theory of drives and desire to a critical account of sociality. Santner illuminates what it means to be genuinely open to another human being or culture and to share and take responsibility for one's implication in the dilemmas of difference. By bringing Freud and Rosenzweig together, Santner not only clarifies in new and surprising ways the profound connections between psychoanalysis and the Judeo-Christian tradition, he makes the resources of both available to contemporary efforts to rethink concepts of community and cross-cultural communication.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8O0UGAQsEO0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The World and the Wild","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"THE BLACK MAN'S BURDEN: AFRICA","description":"Afrikas moderne historie p? baggrund af at 30 ?rs afrikansk uafh?ngighed har medf?rt onder som korruption, magtmisbrug, overtr?delse af menneskerettighederne, diktaturer, borgerkrig og hungersn?d","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a_kMAQAAMAAJ&dq=THE+BLACK+MAN%27S+BURDEN:+AFRICA&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Enchanted August","description":"Four women struggling with loss, disappointment and overwork rent a small summer cottage in Maine, where they find wholeness in regional comforts while sharing their respective stories and rediscovering their passions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wjpLDAAAQBAJ&dq=Enchanted+August&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Quiet Warrior: A Biography of Admiral Raymond A.

Although this movement has been largely unknown to the public, it now provides a spiritual face for globalization, the economic and political forces leading us all from nationalism to ?One World?. The most ambitious organization in today?s interfaith movement is the United Religions Initiative (URI), founded by William Swing, the Episcopal Bishop of California. Investigative reporter Lee Penn, a Catholic ex-Marxist, exhaustively documents the history and beliefs of the URI and its New Age and globalist allies, the vested interests that support these movements, and the direction they appear to be taking. The interfaith movement is no longer merely the province of a coterie of little-heeded religious idealists with grandiose visions. The URI?s proponents have ranged from billionaire George Soros to President George W. Bush, from the far-right Rev. Sun Myung Moon to the liberal Catholic theologian Hans K ng, and from the Dalai Lama to the leaders of government-approved Protestant churches in the People?s Republic of China. The interfaith movement, including the URI, is being promoted by globalist and New Age reformers who favor erosion of national sovereignty, marginalization of traditional religions, establishment of ?global governance?, and creation of a new, Earth-based ?global spirituality??in effect, a one-world religion. Therefore, the URI and the interfaith movement are poised to become the spiritual foundation of the New World Order: the ?new civilization? now proposed by Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union. In The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times, French metaphysician Ren  Gu non spoke of the ?anti-tradition? (the forces of materialism and secular humanism) finally giving way to the ?counter-tradition? (the satanic inversion of true spirituality), leading to the regime of Antichrist. The ?anti-tradition? weakens and dissolves traditional spiritualities, after which the ?counter-tradition? sets up a counterfeit in their place. Since Gu non?s time, as is well known, anti-traditional forces have greatly advanced worldwide. It is less well-known that counter-traditional movements have also made great strides, and now stand closer to the centers of global political and religious power than ever before. The ?counter-tradition? is making inroads on the political and cultural Right, as much as it is doing on the Left. False Dawn painstakingly documents these trends, and speculates on their future development. In so doing, the author takes investigative reporting to the threshold of prophecy, and gives us a stunningly plausible picture of the global religious landscape of the 21st century. This extraordinary project is the literary equivalent of turning over a flat rock. There is much to be seen and learned here?all of it unsettling, disquieting, occasionally downright scary. ?William Murchison, Radford Distinguished Professor, Baylor University When a bishop of a Christian church happily worships alongside a Wiccan invoking other gods, something has gone horribly wrong. In False Dawn, Lee Penn has produced a comprehensive and critical history of the United Religions Initiative. This book sounds a clear warning: Anyone who makes theological truth subservient to utopianism denigrates all religions. ?Douglas LeBlanc, Editor, GetReligion.org","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MXvBs2PqkUcC&dq=Sympathy+For+The+Devil+(The+Best+of+Hail+Saten)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"We help mommy (A Little golden book)","description":"Martha and Bobby help their mother with a variety of household chores.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uDFQtQAACAAJ&dq=We+help+mommy+(A+Little+golden+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SS and Gestapo: Rule By Terror","description":"The military and political police who enforced the policy of genocide are depicted.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F0xoAAAAMAAJ&dq=SS+and+Gestapo:+Rule+By+Terror&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wild Flowers of the World","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FD6INAEACAAJ&dq=Wild+Flowers+of+the+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ferrari Formula 1: Under the Skin of the Championship-Winning F1-2000","description":"Provides readers with an unprecedented level of detail and understanding of Formula 1 technology, through Ferrari's own technical drawings, computer models, and interviews with key players.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YgNXHAAACAAJ&dq=Ferrari+Formula+1:+Under+the+Skin+of+the+Championship-Winning+F1-2000&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Psychology (5th Edition)","description":"For Introduction to Psychology Courses ?

Anyone who wants to progress beyond this level and become a strong club player or a candidate master, needs to understand that somewhat mysterious-looking resource, the positional sacrifice. International Master Merijn van Delft has studied and loved positional sacrifices for as long as he can remember. This non-forcing tool is not just a surprising and highly effective way of creating a decisive advantage during a game. Positional sacrifices are also instruments of superior beauty. Van Delft has created a unique thematic structure for all types of positional sacrifices. He shows the early historical examples, explains which long-term goals are typical for each fundamental theme and presents lots of instructive modern examples. He then concentrates on those sacrifices that have become standard features of positional play. Solving the exercises he has added will further enhance your skills. Playing a positional sacrifice will always require courage. Merijn van Delft takes you by the hand and not only teaches the essential technical know-how, he also helps you to recognize the opportunities when to take the plunge. Mastering Positional Sacrifices is bound to become a modern-day classic.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9VvvDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PERSONAL REFLECTIONS","description":"This book contains a collection of short stories about the life and times of Susanna Doolin, growing up in England and later in a small, rural town on the outskirts of Toronto.

Stephen Ross developed the no arbitrage principle, tying asset pricing to the simple proposition that there are no free lunches in financial markets, and jointly with John Cox he developed the related concept of risk-neutral pricing. In this book Ross makes a strong case that these concepts are the fundamental pillars of modern finance and, in particular, of market efficiency. In an efficient market prices reflect the information possessed by the market and, as a consequence, trading schemes using commonly available information to beat the market are doomed to fail. By stark contrast, the currently popular stance offered by behavioral finance, fueled by a number of apparent anomalies in the financial markets, regards market prices as subject to the psychological whims of investors. But without any appeal to psychology, Ross shows that neoclassical theory provides a simple and rich explanation that resolves many of the anomalies on which behavioral finance has been fixated. Based on the inaugural Princeton Lectures in Finance, sponsored by the Bendheim Center for Finance of Princeton University, this elegant book represents a major contribution to the ongoing debate on market efficiency, and serves as a useful primer on the fundamentals of finance for both scholars and practitioners.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=phhlY2KP-ioC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Temporal GIS: Advanced Functions for Field-Based Applications","description":"The book focuses on the development of advanced functions for field-based temporal geographical information systems (TGIS). These fields describe natural, epidemiological, economical, and social phenomena distributed across space and time. The book is organized around four main themes: \\"Concepts, mathematical tools, computer programs, and applications\\". Chapters I and II review the conceptual framework of the modern TGIS and introduce the fundamental ideas of spatiotemporal modelling. Chapter III discusses issues of knowledge synthesis and integration. Chapter IV presents state-of-the-art mathematical tools of spatiotemporal mapping. Links between existing TGIS techniques and the modern Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) method offer significant improvements in the advanced TGIS functions. Comparisons are made between the proposed functions and various other techniques (e.g., Kriging, and Kalman-Bucy filters). Chapter V analyzes the interpretive features of the advanced TGIS functions, establishing correspondence between the natural system and the formal mathematics which describe it. In Chapters IV and V one can also find interesting extensions of TGIS functions (e.g., non-Bayesian connectives and Fisher information measures). Chapters VI and VII familiarize the reader with the TGIS toolbox and the associated library of comprehensive computer programs. Chapter VIII discusses important applications of TGIS in the context of scientific hypothesis testing, explanation, and decision making.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v5X6CAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Islamic Political Development in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Three-Seated Space Ship","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"From Hinton to Hamlet: Building Bridges between Young Adult Literature and the Classics Second Edition, Revised and Expanded","description":"Uses thematic groupings built around recent young adult literature as bridges to the classics.

An animal incapable of evaluating anything would be very short-lived; and a social animal that did not observe the accepted social behavior patterns would be punished. These are facts about values, morals and behavior patterns: they are incorporated into the bodies of animals or the structure of social groups. We distinguish then the facts of valuation, morality and action from the study of such facts. This study can be scientific, philosophic or both. wayan animal evaluates environmental A zoologist may investigate the or internal stimuli; a social psychologist may examine the way children learn, or fail to learn, certain values and norms when placed in certain environments.

Transparency is revolutionizing every aspect of our economy and its industries and forcing firms to rethink their fundamental values. We are in an extraordinary age where businesses must make themselves clearly visible to shareholders, customers, employees, partners, and society. Financial data, employee grievances, internal memos, environmental disasters, product weaknesses, international protests, scandals and policies, good news and bad; all can be seen by anyone who knows where to look. Don Tapscott, bestselling author and one of the most sought after strategists and speakers in the business world, is famous for seeing into the future and pointing out both its forest and its trees. David Ticoll, visionary researcher, columnist, and consultant, has identified countless breakthrough trends at the intersection of technology and business strategy. These two longtime collaborators now offer a brilliant guide to the new age of openness. In The Naked Corporation, they explain how the new transparency has caused a power shift toward customers, employees, shareholders, and other stakeholders; how and where information has exploded; and how corporations across many industries have seized on transparency not as a challenge but as an opportunity. Drawing on such examples as Shell Oil s reinvention of itself as an environmentally focused business, to Johnson & Johnson s longstanding and carefully nurtured reputation as a company worthy of trust as well as little-known examples from pharmaceuticals, insurance, high technology, and financial services Tapscott and Ticoll offer invaluable advice on how to lead the new age, rather than simply react to it. The Naked Corporation is a book for managers, employees, investors, customers, and anyone who cares about the future of the corporation and society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HcBWcUZo9p8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Stalin Era","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Tom Waits (Kill Your Idols)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Van Richten's Guide to the Lich (Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, Ravenloft, #9412)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bOXdAQAACAAJ&dq=Van+Richten%27s+Guide+to+the+Lich+(Advanced+Dungeons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Spider of Brooklyn Heights","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Maltese Islands from the Air","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Williams-Sonoma Collection: Roasting","description":"New to the Williams-Sonoma Collection and an essential addition to every kitchen bookshelf, \\"Roasting\\" discusses this all-important aspect of a cook's knowledge.

This text is a study of the background to this and related controversies. It traces the fragmentation of Jewry in the wake of emancipation and enlightenment, the development of heterodox religious denominations and secular Zionism, the variety of Orthodox responses to these challenges and the resources of Jewish tradition for handling diversity. It sets out the intractability of the problem and ends by examining strands in both Orthodox Jewish thought that might make for convergence and conciliation. The analysis employs a variety of disciplines - history, sociology, theology and halakhic jurisprudence - to comment on a subject in which these dimensions are inextricably interwoven. It also explores key issues such as the underlying philosophy of Jewish law and the nature of the collision between tradition and modern consciousness in the clash of perceptions between Orthodox and Reform. Written for general readers as well as the academic, this book aims to present a thought-provoking presentation of the dilemmas of Jewish Orthodoxy in modernity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wgkmAQAAIAAJ&dq=One+People%3F:+Tradition,+Modernity,+and+Jewish+Unity+(Littman+Library+of+Jewish+Civilization)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Advanced Dungeons and Dragons: Fiend Folio","description":"Alphabetical listing, with descriptions and illustrations, of monsters designed for for use with the Advanced dungeons and dragons game system.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4df3PQAACAAJ&dq=Advanced+Dungeons+and+Dragons:+Fiend+Folio&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Postethnic America: Beyond Multiculturalism","description":"First published in 1995, Postethnic America was widely hailed as a groundbreaking proposal for healing our nation's ethnic divisions.

Zachary Arlen Post is an up-and-coming editor at It magazine, one of the glossiest jewels in the glittery publishing crown of Versailles Publishing. The son of a well-regarded architect and an eccentric Palm Beach socialite, Zack was educated at an exclusive boarding school and has studied at Colgate, Berkeley, and Liverpool University. He is an excellent golfer and has a talent for translating Plautus from the original Latin. Or maybe not. He is really Allen Zachary Post, the son of a garment-center bookkeeper from Queens and a pool-supply salesman from Long Island. But for Zack, his background is too prosaic for a slightly lazy but very ambitious magazine editor who wants to move up at It. Even though Zack has concocted a background that is more in keeping with the privileged world he wants to be a part of than the truth, his ascent up the masthead has stalled: Try though he might -- and maybe he's too lazy to try that hard -- he just cannot seem to get promoted. Enter Mark Larkin, a determined, Harvard-educated hire who understands how the corporate game is played. Mark says the right things, he lunches with the right people, and he pitches the right stories. A snob thriving in a world of snobs, he begins to get noticed, and, to Zack's dismay, is promoted quickly. Zack realizes that something must be done. Mark Larkin must be destroyed. To complicate his life further, Zack finds himself involved with two women. One is a cool (or is she just ice cold?) English beauty with a hyphenated last name and vague family connections to Winston Churchill. The other is an eager, sweet-natured intern whose father is the magazine's barracuda corporate counsel. Zack is torn between the style (and hyphen) of one and the good-natured substance of the other. In Slab Rat, Ted Heller uses the magazine industry as a laboratory in which to dissect human nature. He has written a biting, outrageous story of how the rats that battle for dominance amid New York's skyscrapers -- or \\"slabs\\" -- survive and triumph, and the price they must pay to win. Full of dark comedy and a ruthless satire of office life (and death), Slab Rat is a novel rich with the wicked pleasures of the heart.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J1gFIW2R7IcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How Santa Really Works","description":"Top-secret information gathered at Santa's base under the North Pole reveals the machinations and hard work behind how Santa makes Christmas happen.

They follow with collaborative chapters on specific populations demonstrating the value of generalist social work practice, including developing respectful relationships that define issues from the survivor's perspective; collecting and assessing data; setting goals and contracting; identifying culturally specific interventions; implementing culturally appropriate courses of action; participating in community-level strategies; and advocating for improved policies and funding at local, state, and federal levels.

But why are some nations more creative than others, and why do some highly innovative societies--such as ancient China, or Britain in the industrial revolution--pass into stagnation? Beginning with a fascinating, concise history of technological progress, Mokyr sets the background for his analysis by tracing the major inventions and innovations that have transformed society since ancient Greece and Rome. What emerges from this survey is often surprising: the classical world, for instance, was largely barren of new technology, the relatively backward society of medieval Europe bristled with inventions, and the period between the Reformation and the Industrial Revolution was one of slow and unspectacular progress in technology, despite the tumultuous developments associated with the Voyages of Discovery and the Scientific Revolution. What were the causes of technological creativity? Mokyr distinguishes between the relationship of inventors and their physical environment--which determined their willingness to challenge nature--and the social environment, which determined the openness to new ideas. He discusses a long list of such factors, showing how they interact to help or hinder a nation's creativity, and then illustrates them by a number of detailed comparative studies, examining the differences between Europe and China, between classical antiquity and medieval Europe, and between Britain and the rest of Europe during the industrial revolution. He examines such aspects as the role of the state (the Chinese gave up a millennium-wide lead in shipping to the Europeans, for example, when an Emperor banned large ocean-going vessels), the impact of science, as well as religion, politics, and even nutrition. He questions the importance of such commonly-cited factors as the spill-over benefits of war, the abundance of natural resources, life expectancy, and labor costs. Today, an ever greater number of industrial economies are competing in the global market, locked in a struggle that revolves around technological ingenuity. The Lever of Riches, with its keen analysis derived from a sweeping survey of creativity throughout history, offers telling insights into the question of how Western economies can maintain, and developing nations can unlock, their creative potential.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9i1u11Y3wDIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mystic Rebel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FdExj0cUziEC&dq=Mystic+Rebel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Times Square Roulette: Remaking the City Icon","description":"The compelling story of the politics, policies, and personalities that made Times Square's revitalization possible. The spectacularly successful transformation of Times Square has become a model for other cities. From its beginning as Longacre Square, Times Square's commercialism, signage, cultural diversity, and social tolerance have been deeply embedded in New York City's psyche. Its symbolic role guaranteed that any plan for its renewal would push the hot buttons of public controversy: free speech, property-taking through eminent domain, development density, tax subsidy, and historic preservation. In Times Square Roulette, Lynne Sagalyn debunks the myth of an overnight urban miracle performed by Disney and Mayor Giuliani, to tell the far more complex and commanding tale of a twenty-year process of public controversy, nonstop litigation, and interminable delay. She tells how the troubled execution of the original redevelopment plan provided a rare opportunity to rescript it. And timing was all: the mid-1990s saw rising international corporate interest in the city was a mecca for mass-market entertainment and synergistic merchandising. Sagalyn details the complex relationship between planning and politics and the role of market forces in shaping Times Square's redevelopment opportunities.

The personal satisfaction, the pleasure of hands-on work, and the more leisurely, contemplative approach to woodworking is replacing the need for the speed and noise of power tools. In Traditional Woodworking Handtools, the second volume in his Illustrated Workshop Series, Graham Blackburn has assembled a virtual encyclopedia of traditional woodworking handtools, including holding tools, saws, planes, edge tools, setting-out tools, boring tools, and striking tools. Each tool is listed and includes a full description of what it does and how it s used. His engaging writing, which includes anecdotes from his four decades as a master woodworker, entertains as well as instructs. And the hundreds of line drawings of handtools are illuminating. While also a reference for anyone collecting or simply fascinated by handtools, Traditional Woodworking Handtools is a user s guide for the woodworker and crafter, designed to help reintroduce many of these tried-and-true tools into today s workshops.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I6XOngEACAAJ&dq=Traditional+Woodworking+Handtools,+An+Illustrated+Reference+Guide+for+the+Woodworker&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Modern Drama: Selected Plays from 1879 to the Present","description":"This comprehensive and balanced anthology offers a collection of 25 works of modern and contemporary drama from the 1870s through the early 1990s.Features twenty-five plays that often demonstrate a significant breakthrough in maturity of expression and style for each playwright   important leaders in the development of modern and contemporary drama.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sokLAAAACAAJ&dq=Modern+Drama:+Selected+Plays+from+1879+to+the+Present&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Giving Offense: Essays on Censorship","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A woman of means","description":"As a boy's attachment to his high class stepmother and her \\"means\\" grows, her marriage to his father begins to crumble in small, subtle ways, which ultimately lead to larger, more devastating consequences.

The word connotes our often subconscious pattern of erotic yearnings and desire. Each of us has a distinctive lovemap, as different and individual as a fingerprint.In this book, Dr. Money outlines healthy lovemap development as well as lovemap pathology - lovemaps gone awry. Such pathology falls into three categories: hypophilia (sexual dysfunction, such as impotence), hyperphilia (erotomania), and paraphilia (perversions). Paraphilia, another term coined by Money (from the Latin para - away from what is expected, and philia - love) can range from those that are playful and harmless to those that are bizarre and deadly.Presenting case histories, Lovemaps describes the sexual practices of several patients and subsequent treatments of their paraphilias. Money pioneered the application of the hormone MPA, or Depo-Provera, to treat repeat sex criminals. He believes he has proved that science can prevent paraphilic sex offending, as is the case for other, physiological diseases.Lovemaps and its stirring accounts of lovemap pathology in case histories, (which are indexed under paraphilia), can be invaluable tools for those in the fields of sexology, child psychology, clinical psychology, criminology and, with its comprehensive glossary, the general reader - in short, anyone interested in human sexual development.This fascinating book sheds new light on sexual development and deserves a prominent place on the 'must read' list. -Seattle Institute for Sex Therapy, Education and Research","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2HsQ9FrHYZAC&dq=Lovemaps:+Clinical+concepts+of+sexual/erotic+health+and+pathology,+paraphilia,+and+gender+transposition+of+childhood,+adolescence,+and+maturity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ultimate Car Spotter's Guide, 1946-1969","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Blueberry summer","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Great Chain of Being, The Study of The History of An Idea","description":"This is arguably the seminal work in historical and philosophical analysis of the twentieth century. Originally delivered for the William James lecture series at Harvard University in 1932-33, it remains the cornerstone of the history of ideas. Lovejoy sees philosophy's history as one of confusion of ideas, a prime example of which is the idea of a \\"great chain of being\\"--a universe linked in theology, science and values by pre-determined stages in all phases of life. Lovejoy's view is one of dualities in nature and society, with both error and truth as part of the natural order of things. The past reminds us that the ruling modes of thought of our own age, which we may view as clear, coherent and firmly grounded, are unlikely to be seen with such certainty by posterity. The Great Chain of Being is an excursion into the past, with a clear mission--to discourage the assumption that all is known, or that what is known is not subject to modifi cation at a later time. Lovejoy reaffirms the \\"intrinsic worth of diversity,\\" as a caution against certitude. By this he does not mean toleration of indiff erence, or relativity for its own sake, but an appreciation of mental and physical process of human beings. As Peter Stanlis notes in his introduction: \\"Faith in the great chain of being was fi nally largely extinguished by the combined infl uences of Romantic idealism, Darwin's theory of evolution, and Einstein's theory of relativity.\\" Few books remain as alive to prospects for the future by reconsidering follies of the past as does Lovejoy's stunning work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ByHNG8GzUeAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christmas's Most Wanted: The Top 10 Book of Kris Kringles, Merry Jingles, and Holiday Cheer","description":"Highlights the celebration of Christmas in music, television, and song.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AGW_kQEACAAJ&dq=Christmas%27s+Most+Wanted:+The+Top+10+Book+of+Kris+Kringles,+Merry+Jingles,+and+Holiday+Cheer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bitter Homecoming","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"John Thomas and Lady Jane","description":"An account of Constance Chatterley's love for Mellors, her husband's gamekeeper, and the sense of completeness that they find in each other.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ejO8AAAAIAAJ&dq=John+Thomas+and+Lady+Jane&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Neil Young (Kill Your Idols)","description":"The evil step child of Stranded (Knopf's original book of rock criticism), Kill Your Idols is a collection of 35 essays about allegedly great rock albums that this new generation of critics loathe.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QI2fAAAAMAAJ&dq=Neil+Young+(Kill+Your+Idols)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Astrodon: Dawn of Battle","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Household discoveries;: An encyclopaedia of practical recipes and processes,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Honor Lost: Love and Death in Modern-Day Jordan","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Favorite Fairy Tales","description":"Drawn from the rainbow of Andrew Lang s  color  fairy tale books, this charming anthology features more than 25 traditional tales.

In the last fifteen years, M. Gary Neuman, marital therapist and architect of the Sandcastles Divorce Therapy Program, has helped thousands of couples in crisis. Couples who fight. Who ve grown apart. Who are stuck in relationships that run more on routine and rancor than love and understanding. What he s found is that, contrary to popular belief, the problem is usually not poor communication. It s the failure to put most of your focus into your marriage. You ve only got so much energy. Are you spending it by being emotionally unfaithful? Take a quick check: Do you send that funny e-mail to your friends at work but not to your spouse? Do you chew over all the problems on the job so thoroughly with your colleagues that by the time you get home, you just don t feel like going into it all over again? Do you get a secret thrill out of flirting with coworkers thinking it s safe because you know it s not going any further? If so, you re committing emotional infidelity and you re draining your marriage of the energy it needs to be great. Learning how to break this cycle is one of eleven secrets M. Gary Neuman shares in his provocative new book. Based on the ten-week program he s developed in his successful couples counseling practice, the book offers guidelines that are often counterintuitive, even outrageous or shocking. But they work. Dare to limit contact with members of the opposite sex. Dare to need each other. Dare to put in writing the nitty-gritty realities of a marriage plan. Dare to put your marriage before your kids or job. Dare to make love in a whole new way. Dare to change your focus: make the commitment to focus on each of the eleven secrets (ten plus one bonus secret) for one week apiece and you ll reap the rewards of a transformed marriage and a reconfirmed relationship. M. Gary Neuman s program is guaranteed to challenge you and make you reexamine the myths holding you back from true happiness and satisfaction.

Few scholars have influenced the development of the study of black politics as much as Mack H. Jones. Through his writings one can trace the emergence, evolution, and maturation of the scientific study of the field. Knowledge, Power, and Black Politics brings together difficult-to-find and out-of-print essays by this important figure. In the first part of this volume Jones demonstrates how American social science creates a misleading caricature of African American life, one that can only lead to misguided public policies. He offers an alternative frame of reference, the dominant-subordinate group model, and argues that it offers greater descriptive insights and prescriptive utility for those interested in understanding politics internal to the African American community. The framework established in the first section is used to examine a broad range of topics such as the history of black politics from the period of enslavement to the modern era and the dynamics of the civil rights movement, as well as a range of contentious public policy issues, including public welfare, affirmative action, the black underclass, racism and multiculturalism, the black conservative movement, deracialization, presidential politics, and US foreign policy toward developing countries.  For more than four decades, Mack H. Jones s work has been pivotal in directing the scope of black politics. Although his work is widely cited, never before have his seminal writings been compiled in one volume. Taken together as a whole they provide a guidebook to the field and present a powerful commentary on black politics in the current era. With force and clarity, Jones trains his sights on the most significant issues of epistemology, historical developments, policy initiatives, and political figures and groups. His clarity of vision on the instrumental uses of knowledge to advance the principle of freedom drives his incisive analysis, intellectual rigor, and, most of all, fearlessness. We have much to continue to learn from the work assembled in this collection.    Nikol G.

Here, he argues that people band together into political communities to secure a good and self-sufficient life. He discusses the merits and defects of various regimes or ways of organizing political community--democracy in particular--and in the process examines such subjects as slavery, economics, the family, citizenship, justice, and revolution.Peter Simpson offers a new translation of Aristotle's text from the ancient Greek. He renders the Politics into an English version that is accurate, readable, and in certain difficult passages, original. His innovative analytical division of the whole text, with headings and accompanying summaries, makes clear the progression and unity of the argument--a helpful feature for students or readers unfamiliar with Aristotle's studied brevity and often elliptical style. Books 7 and 8 are repositioned--a move supported by Aristotle's own words and much scholarly opinion--to restore the work's logical organization and coherence. Finally, Simpson places the Politics in its proper philosophical context by beginning the text with the last chapter of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, which he sees as an introduction to what follows.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5l3qCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handbook of Educational Terms and Applications","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Williams-Sonoma Collection: Potato","description":"The Williams-Sonoma Collection offers cookbooks that are eye-catching and irresistible, and which appeal to both novice and experienced cooks.

Over a decade ago, Simon Sinek started a movement that inspired millions to demand purpose at work, to ask what was the WHY of their organization. Since then, millions have been touched by the power of his ideas, and these ideas remain as relevant and timely as ever. START WITH WHY asks (and answers) the questions: why are some people and organizations more innovative, more influential, and more profitable than others? Why do some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike? Even among the successful, why are so few able to repeat their success over and over? People like Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and the Wright Brothers had little in common, but they all started with WHY. They realized that people won't truly buy into a product, service, movement, or idea until they understand the WHY behind it. START WITH WHY shows that the leaders who have had the greatest influence in the world all think, act and communicate the same way and it's the opposite of what everyone else does.

Addams first created Morticia, Lurch, and The Thing in a cartoon published in a 1938 issue of the New Yorker though he hadn't named them at the time, or even conceived of a family unit. (When he did name the deadly matriarch, he was inspired by the Yellow Pages listing for \\"Morticians.\\") Other characters were born and developed in a multitude of Addams's cartoons over the next twenty-six years, before the cheerfully creepy clan debuted on ABC television in 1964 and later on the big screen, twice, in 1991 and 1993.The Addams Family: An Evilution is the first book to trace The Addams Family history, presenting more than 200 cartoons created by Charles Addams (American, 19121988) throughout his prolific career; many have never been published before. Text by H. Kevin Miserocchi, director of the Tee and Charles Addams Foundation, offers a revealing chronology of each character's evolution (for instance, did you know that Addams originally named Pugsley \\"Pubert\\"?), while Addams's own incisive character descriptions, originally penned for the benefit of the television show producers, introduce each chapter. As the presence of the Family continues to permeate generation after generation, and in celebration of the Broadway musical debuting in 2010, this book reminds us where these oddly lovable characters came from and, in doing so, offers a lasting tribute to one of America's greatest humorists. A phenomenon of rare proportion, The Addams Family is the manifestation of one artist's dark but irresistible wit, expressed with an uncommonly deft hand.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xp-eQQAACAAJ&dq=The+Adams+Family&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Murky Deep (Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Module GA1)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Copper Range Chronicle: A Family and an Era","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Amarillo In August: An Author's Life on the Road","description":"Through constant touring, author Jonathan Miller sold out the hard cover edition of his novel, Rattlesnake Lawyer, and made it a cult classic.

The extreme volatility in contemporary political economic fortunes seems to mock our best efforts to understand the forces that drive development in the world economy. David Harvey is the single most important geographer writing today and a leading social theorist of our age, offering a comprehensive critique of contemporary capitalism. In this fascinating book, he shows the way forward for just such an understanding, enlarging upon the key themes in his recent work: the development of neoliberalism, the spread of inequalities across the globe, and  space  as a key theoretical concept. Both a major declaration of a new research programme and a concise introduction to David Harvey s central concerns, this book will be essential reading for scholars and students across the humanities and social sciences.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MLmHDwAAQBAJ&dq=Spaces+of+Global+Capitalism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"World War I: A Short History (2nd Edition)","description":"After the unprecedented destruction of the Great War, the world longed for a lasting peace. The victors, however, valued vengeance even more than stability and demanded a massive indemnity from Germany in order to keep it from rearming. The results, as eminent historian Norman Stone describes in this authoritative history, were disastrous. In World War Two, Stone provides a remarkably concise account of the deadliest war of human history, showing how the conflict roared to life from the ashes of World War One. Adolf Hitler rode a tide of popular desperation and resentment to power in Germany, promptly making good on his promise to return the nation to its former economic and military strength. He bullied Europe into giving him his way, and in so doing backed the victors of the Great War into a corner. Following the invasion of Poland in 1939, Britain and France declared war on Germany -- a decision that, Stone argues, was utterly irrational. Yet Hitler had driven the world mad, and the rekindling of European hostilities soon grew to a conflagration that spread across the globe, fanned by political and racial ideologies more poisonous -- and weaponry more destructive -- than the world had ever seen. With commanding expertise, Stone leads readers through the escalation, climax, and mournful denouement of this sprawling conflict. World War Two is an invaluable contribution to our understanding of the twentieth century and its defining struggle.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QC0PPRkr-mUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Imperfect Victories: The Legal Tenacity of the Omaha Tribe, 1945-1995 (Law in the American West)","description":"The Omaha Tribe of Nebraska has borne more than its fair share of the burden created by the federal government s wildly vacillating Indian policy. Mark R. Scherer s Imperfect Victories provides a detailed examination of the Omahas  tenacious efforts to overcome the damaging effects of shifting directions in federal policy during the last fifty years. The Omahas  struggles are particularly significant because the tribe often bore the initial impact of experimental legislation that would later be implemented nationally. Scherer details the disastrous consequences of postwar federal legislation that transferred control over Indian affairs to state authorities as a precursor to the wholesale termination of Indian tribalism. The legislation brought jurisdictional turmoil to the Omaha reservation and placed the Omahas in chronic conflict with local law enforcement agencies. As the tribe fought to become the first Indian group in the nation to escape the effects of that law through retrocession, they waged equally notable struggles for the redress of past wrongs with the Indian Claims Commission and in the federal courts. Scherer demonstrates that the Omahas  successes in those campaigns have been at best imperfect victories, coming only after years of hardship and failing to eliminate many underlying tensions and problems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gDEnG0ZMl2gC&dq=Imperfect+Victories:+The+Legal+Tenacity+of+the+Omaha+Tribe,+1945-1995+(Law+in+the+American+West)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nautical Contraband: A Krewe of Jupiter Novel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"201 Games for the Elementary Physical Education Program","description":"Here is a unique collection of competitive and cooperative games for the elementary physical education teacher.

Forty years later, he had his most recent top-10 finish in a major at the Masters. In between, he won eighteen professional majors, a hundred tournaments worldwide, and provided countless thrills along the road to being named  Golfer of the Century  by his peers and by publications from America to Antarctica. In his unprecedented run at the top of the game, Jack Nicklaus has seen the importance of constant learning and constant refinement. Your game at age sixty cannot be the same as your game at age twenty; where you were once able to overpower the golf course, with time and wisdom you discover new ways to approach the challenges of the game that depend less on physical ability and more on mental agility. Along the way, you learn which fundamentals will always put you in good stead, and you see what advice has stood the test of time. In My Golden Lessons, the greatest golfer of them all takes the best from his many years of playing, practicing, and studying the game, and distills it into over 120 pieces of priceless instruction. Drawn from his immensely popular columns in Golf Digest and Golf Magazine, the topics cover the full spectrum of the game, from choosing the right equipment, on through the fundamentals of stance, grip, and setup, to the pursuit of power and the subtleties of the short game and putting. These techniques helped Nicklaus set the marks that future generations will strive to match, but it was his mastery of the mental side of golf that truly set him apart from his peers and his predecessors -- and he shares his advice on the mind game as well. In addition, the book presents a beautifully drawn sequence of the Nicklaus swing at its peak, alongside advice tailored to the needs of the better players who want to be better still. My Golden Lessons is a book that took a lifetime to prepare, but one that will improve your game from the first few minutes it spends in your hands. These are the techniques that made Jack Nicklaus the golfer he is, and his clear, bite-sized pointers will show you the path to hitting better shots, shooting lower scores, and enjoying the game more every time you play.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KmSL7yq2EesC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Crystal Goblet & the Dragon","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jLoZAAAAMAAJ&dq=A+Crystal+Goblet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hoare and the Portsmouth Atrocities","description":"Although Bartholomew Hoare has acquitted himself nobly on shipboard and battle, and worked his way up to lieutenant in King George III's Royal Navy, he cannot count his present life a satisfactory one. For one thing, he and his brother (as his father before him, all of them descended from Vikings) have always had to use their fists to defend their name and its implications from schoolboys, shipmates, and generally impolite Britons at every social level. That Bartholomew can handle. But a spent musket ball in the throat put a halt to a promising career at sea, and Hoare was left with a glowing recommendation and exclusively shore duties. Obviously, a captain whose orders could not be issued above a whisper could never command a ship. To Hoare, who loves the sea, it is a tragedy, as he is forced to do the land-based tasks assigned to him. His present mission is to discover what has happened to the ship that disappeared in nearby waters, and whether the strange contents of a small keg found in the sand are involved in the mystery. And it is a quest that begins Hoare's acquaintance with the extraordinary Mrs. Eleanor Graves--by his saving her from attacking ruffians, with her active and enthusiastic assistance. It is a meeting that starts a dramatic train of events. For one thing, Hoare is asked to put his talents to work on behalf of a young officer charged with the murder of his captain, a fellow of questionable probity and brutal temper. Hoare's investigation leads to evidence of criminal activity beyond the captain's murder. It's a chance for the lieutenant to further distinguish himself--if he isn't killed first. But life is not all trouble. Hoare becomes close friends with Eleanor Graves and her retired, and much older, physician husband. He meets a rather suspect visitor from abroad, and encounters assorted townspeople, both high and low--including the Graveses' dinner guest his first night in town, one Miss Jane Austen. With its strong period atmosphere, its unusual and colorful characters, and its nautical focus, Wilder Perkins's first novel, Hoare and the Portsmouth Atrocities, will entice readers who love historic naval fiction. And many others as well will be delighted to discover this author and his book, and will wait impatiently for Bartholomew Hoare's next adventure.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BsCFBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Best Gay Erotica 2006","description":"Full of surprises, a collection that will satisfy every wicked taste ranges from a tale of awakening inner dominance to one man's journey through exploration in the seafaring world of sailors.

Why do so many African-Americans whether privileged or poor, urban or suburban, young or old live in a state of chronic anxiety, fear, and shame? Rock My Soul: Black People and Self-Esteem breaks through collective denial and dares to tell this truth that crippling low self-esteem has reached epidemic proportions in our lives and in our diverse communities. With visionary insight, hooks exposes the underlying reality that it has been difficult if not impossible for our nation to create a culture that promotes and sustains healthy self-esteem. Without self-esteem people begin to lose their sense of agency. They feel powerless. They feel they can only be victims. The need for self-esteem never goes away. But it is never too late for any of us to acquire the healthy self-esteem that is needed for a fulfilling life. hooks gets to the heart and soul of the African-American identity crisis, offering critical insight and hard-won wisdom about what it takes to heal the scars of the past, promote and maintain self-esteem, and lay down the roots for a grounded community with a prosperous future. She examines the way historical movements for racial uplift fail to sustain our quest for self-esteem. Moving beyond a discussion of race, she identifies diverse barriers keeping us from well-being: the trauma of abandonment, constant shaming, and the loss of personal integrity. In highlighting the role of desegregation, education, the absence of progressive parenting, spiritual crisis, or fundamental breakdowns in communication between black women and men, bell hooks identifies mental health as the new revolutionary frontier and provides guidance for healing within the black community.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TyJU2psZtEoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Consent Withdrawn: A Novel About The Next American Revolution","description":"The world has entered the new Millennium, and in the United States there are two forces on a collision course.

This can get tricky, as creating a design that looks good in print (300 dpi) as well as on the web (72 dpi) is not always the easiest task to accomplish. But in Clio award-winning designer David E. Carter's comprehensive resource, readers will discover how to create stunning designs and letterheads that work well on both the printed and the digital page.

This valuable resource makes it clear that the web revolution has not rendered print communications obsolete but has, in effect, made the design and letterhead on print communications even more important when conveying a company's message and keeping it consistent. - The author has a Clio and seven Emmy Awards to his credit - Contains hundreds of working, real-world examples","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9RdQAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Big+Book+of+Designs+for+Letterheads+and+Websites&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Influencing with Integrity","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Conspiracy X","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e6pHAgAACAAJ&dq=Conspiracy+X&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deafening","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A gift from the sea","description":"A woman's reflections on life, its stages, and its states, comparing them with the natural treasures of life in the sea","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l8q6m9Xgek0C&dq=A+gift+from+the+sea&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Linear Systems, Fourier Transforms, and Optics (Wiley Series in Pure and Applied Optics)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"STARETZ ENCOUNTER","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Food Substitutions Bible: More than 5,000 Substitutions for Ingredients, Equipment and Techniques","description":"Lists substitutes for thousands of cooking and baking ingredients, tells how to correct for adding too much of one ingredient, and suggests alternative techniques.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BwxGOQAACAAJ&dq=The+Food+Substitutions+Bible:+More+than+5,000+Substitutions+for+Ingredients,+Equipment+and+Techniques&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rationality in Action (Jean Nicod Lectures)","description":"The study of rationality and practical reason, or rationality in action, has been central to Western intellectual culture. In this invigorating book, John Searle lays out six claims of what he calls the Classical Model of rationality and shows why they are false. He then presents an alternative theory of the role of rationality in thought and action. A central point of Searle's theory is that only irrational actions are directly caused by beliefs and desires for example, the actions of a person in the grip of an obsession or addiction. In most cases of rational action, there is a gap between the motivating desire and the actual decision making. The traditional name for this gap is \\"freedom of the will.\\" According to Searle, all rational activity presupposes free will. For rationality is possible only where one has a choice among various rational as well as irrational options. Unlike many philosophical tracts, Rationality in Action invites the reader to apply the author's ideas to everyday life. Searle shows, for example, that contrary to the traditional philosophical view, weakness of will is very common. He also points out the absurdity of the claim that rational decision making always starts from a consistent set of desires. Rational decision making, he argues, is often about choosing between conflicting reasons for action. In fact, humans are distinguished by their ability to be rationally motivated by desire-independent reasons for action. Extending his theory of rationality to the self, Searle shows how rational deliberation presupposes an irreducible notion of the self. He also reveals the idea of free will to be essentially a thesis of how the brain works.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7GnfkbarMHsC&dq=Rationality+in+Action+(Jean+Nicod+Lectures)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Winky's Plant A Seed","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Ghost of John Wayne: and Other Stories (Camino Del Sol)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Last Hero (The \\"Saint\\" Books)","description":"Please note that the content of this book primarily consists of articles available from Wikipedia or other free sources online.

The story was initially serialized in 1929 in a British magazine. Due to this somewhat convoluted publishing history, The Last Hero is occasionally cited as the second volume of adventures featuring the crime-busting antihero Simon Templar, alias The Saint, predating Enter the Saint.

When a cold case dossier lands on Captain Benny Griessel s desk, he and his partner Vaughn Cupido, fellow member of the Hawks elite police unit in South Africa, reluctantly set to work reviewing the evidence. Did ex-cop Johnson Johnson simply disappear on the world s most luxurious train line or was he murdered? Two fellow travelers might have the answers Griessel and Cupido need, but they too seem to have disappeared, and the few clues that exist suggest a cover-up. Meanwhile, Daniel Darret has settled into a new, quiet life in Bordeaux, far from his revolutionary past in South Africa. But now a man from that past has reappeared. And he wants to commission Daniel s unique skills one more time. As the two storylines come crashing together, Griessel and Cupido are left uncertain of the truth and of their own future. A top-notch addition to the acclaimed Benny Griessel series, The Last Hunt makes a brave and powerful statement about the pervasive corruption that has stolen so much from Deon Meyer s native country.

In Discovering Chess Openings John Emms argues that studying openings doesn't have to be hard work at all - indeed, it can be both enjoyable and enlightening. The key to successful opening play is not simply learning lines off by heart; instead it's the understanding of the basic principles, and here the reader is guided through the vital themes: swift development, central control and king safety. An appreciation of these principles and their many offshoots will actually allow readers to recreate and discover opening theory, giving them the opportunity to choose the most suitable lines to play in their games.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LzQQEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Price of the Ticket: Collected Nonfiction, 1948-1985","description":"An essential compendium of James Baldwin s most powerful nonfiction work, calling on us  to end the racial nightmare, and achieve our country.

Why, then, do so many have trouble in school? According to Dr. Rosemary Callard-Szulgit, perfectionism the number one social-emotional trait of gifted children can actually immobilize some children and cause social adjustment problems for others. This explains why so many of today's gifted children do not, or cannot, complete school assignments or even follow through on personal responsibilities. During her forty-five year career, Callard-Szulgit has helped hundreds of students and their parents recover from the harmful effects of being perfectionists. In her second edition of Perfectionism and Gifted Children, Callard-Szulgit provides practical insight into perfectionism, discussing why so many gifted children are perfectionists while also providing common sense solutions to the problems this presents. This book will be helpful to families and educators of gifted students, as well as to gifted children themselves. The expanded question and answer section will better help parents and teachers ease children s anxieties and behaviors that stem from the problems of perfectionism.

Ironically, however, the Oaxacan wood carvings are not a traditional folk art. Invented in the mid-twentieth century by non-Indian Mexican artisans for the tourist market, their appeal flows as much from intercultural miscommunication as from their intrinsic artistic merit. In this beautifully illustrated book, Michael Chibnik offers the first in-depth look at the international trade in Oaxacan wood carvings, including their history, production, marketing, and cultural representations. Drawing on interviews he conducted in the carving communities and among wholesalers, retailers, and consumers, he follows the entire production and consumption cycle, from the harvesting of copal wood to the final purchase of the finished piece. Along the way, he describes how and why this \\"invented tradition\\" has been promoted as a \\"Zapotec Indian\\" craft and explores its similarities with other local crafts with longer histories. He also fully discusses the effects on local communities of participating in the global market, concluding that the trade in Oaxacan wood carvings is an almost paradigmatic case study of globalization.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FcB7AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"McDougal Littell Literature Connections: Kaffir Boy Student Editon Grade 10","description":"A Black writer describes his childhood in South Africa under apartheid and recounts how Arthur Ashe and Stan Smith helped him leave for America on a tennis scholarship","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6VMtSwAACAAJ&dq=McDougal+Littell+Literature+Connections:+Kaffir+Boy+Student+Editon+Grade+10&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Volcano Lover","description":"Set in 18th century Naples, based on the lives of Sir William Hamilton, his celebrated wife Emma, and Lord Nelson, and peopled with many of the great figures of the day, this unconventional, bestselling historical romance from the National Book Award-winning author of In America touches on themes of sex and revolution, the fate of nature, art and the collector's obsessions, and, above all, love.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PYPWAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rose from Brier","description":"Amy Carmichael wrote Rose from Brier after reflecting that most books of comfort for sick people are written by the well and so miss their mark.

They have also been exasperated by their failure to understand its origins or chart its progress. Sceptical both of traditional accounts and of their more recent rejection by revisionist writers, S. J. D. Green concentrates scholarly attention for the first time on the 'social history of the chapel' in a characteristic industrial-urban setting. He demonstrates just why so many churches were built in late Victorian Britain, who built them, who went to them, and why. He evaluates the 'associational ideal' during its period of greatest success, and explains the causes of its decline. In this way, Religion in the Age of Decline offers a fresh interpretation of the extent and the implications of the decline of religion in twentieth-century Britain.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Lfyp0jGqHn8C&dq=Religion+in+the+Age+of+Decline:+Organisation+and+Experience+in+Industrial+Yorkshire,+1870-1920&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"50 Years of Classic Cars","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The New American History (Critical Perspectives On The Past)","description":"Originally released in 1990, The New American Historyedited for the American Historical Association by Eric Foner, has become an indispensable volume for teachers and students.

While studying food policy as a master s candidate at NYU, Leanne Brown asked a simple yet critical question: How well can a person eat on the $4 a day given by SNAP, the U.S. government s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program informally known as food stamps? The answer is surprisingly well: Broiled Tilapia with Lime, Spicy Pulled Pork, Green Chile and Cheddar Quesadillas, Vegetable Jambalaya, Beet and Chickpea Salad even desserts like Coconut Chocolate Cookies and Peach Coffee Cake. In addition to creating nutritious recipes that maximize every ingredient and use economical cooking methods, Ms. Brown gives tips on shopping; on creating pantry basics; on mastering certain staples pizza dough, flour tortillas and saucy extras that make everything taste better, like spice oil and tzatziki; and how to make fundamentally smart, healthful food choices. The idea for Good and Cheap is already proving itself. The author launched a Kickstarter campaign to self-publish and fund the buy one/give one model. Hundreds of thousands of viewers watched her video and donated $145,000, and national media are paying attention. Even high-profile chefs and food writers have taken note like Mark Bittman, who retweeted the link to the campaign; Francis Lam, who called it  Terrific! ; and Michael Pollan, who cited it as a  cool kickstarter.

It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\" centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of persons and behaviours within society. Orwell, himself a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated. The story takes place in an imagined future, the year 1984, when much of the world has fallen victim to perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, and propaganda. Great Britain, known as Airstrip One, has become a province of a totalitarian superstate named Oceania that is ruled by the Party who employ the Thought Police to persecute individuality and independent thinking. Big Brother, the leader of the Party, enjoys an intense cult of personality despite the fact that he may not even exist.

The published volumes provide accurate texts of Madison's incoming and outgoing correspondence, informative notes on textual and subject matters, and comprehensive indexes. They are incomparably rich sources for students of Madison's life and valuable research tools for those interested in the general history of the period in which Madison lived (1751-1836). The project has collected more than 27,000 copies of documents related to Madison's life, including letters, essays, notes, diaries, account books, ledgers, wills, legal papers, and inventories. The project serves the public by translating into print these decaying and often nearly illegible manuscripts, thereby preserving them for future generations and making them easier to use. The published volumes also make the contents of Madison-related documents--the originals of which are housed in some 250 archives worldwide--easily accessible to libraries and interested individuals anywhere books travel. The Congressional Series (seventeen volumes) is devoted to the years 1751 to 1801, containing the fullest possible record of Madison's contributions to the creation of the federal government, including his service in the Continental Congress, the Virginia General Assembly, the Constitutional Convention of 1787, the Virginia Ratifying Convention of 1788, and the first four Federal Congresses.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BVx1swEACAAJ&dq=James+Madison+(American+statesmen+%5Bv.+12%5D)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Plantation Temptation","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VlliKAAACAAJ&dq=Plantation+Temptation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Motley Crue","description":"NOW A NETFLIX ORIGINAL MOVIE STARRING MACHINE GUN KELLY, DANIEL WEBBER, DOUGLAS BOOTH, AND IWAN RHEON, DIRECTED BY JEFF TREMAINE.

He has rigorously updated and edited the book for each of 7 subsequent editions. Featured here is the 2005 printing and 7th edition of The Nashville Number System; expanded with the inclusion of the cd/cd rom, String Of Pearls. By word of mouth, it has become the most recommended source for learning the Number System. The Nashville Number System is used as a text at Berklee College of Music, in Boston, Belmont University, in Nashville, and MTSU in Murfreesboro,TN. SYNOPSISIn the late 50's, Neil Matthews devised a musical number system for the Jordanaires to use in the studio. Charlie McCoy and fellow studio musicians began adapting Matthews' number system into chord charts. The Nashville Number System has evolved into a complete method of writing chord charts and melodies---combining Nashville shorthand with formal notation standards. The Nashville Number System is 130 pages with a step by step method of how to write a Nashville number chart for any song. Included with each NNS book in Edition 7 is the cd, \\"String Of Pearls\\". This is a 10 song cd of instrumentals, including, Amazing Grace. I walk you through the details of each song and explain the Number System tools used to write the charts. Now, while listening to the cd, you can see and hear how Nashville number charts work.String Of Pearls is an Extended CD (CD ROM). As well as high quality audio that will play in your cd player, you can insert the disc into your computer and watch animated number charts as you listen to the songs. On the cd rom, there is a click track with each song and a highlight moving from chord to chord in time with the music. You can see exactly how to count each measure in real time with the music. Counting bars is probably the hardest part of the number system to teach. With this cd rom, you will be able to see, hear and feel how these charts work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5oRpAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Nashville+Number+System&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The statistical treatment of fatigue experiments","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WuY8AAAAIAAJ&dq=The+statistical+treatment+of+fatigue+experiments&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trixie Belden And The Mystery Of The Blinking Eye","description":"The Bob-Whites, plus their friends from Iowa, add detective work to their New York City sightseeing trip after Trixie helps a stranger and receives, as thanks, a purse containing a cryptic prophecy and a promise of great fortune.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G-FFtxEVykIC&dq=Trixie+Belden+And+The+Mystery+Of+The+Blinking+Eye&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The flying ensign: Greencoats against Napoleon","description":"From 1808 through 1809, sixteen-year-old Peter Byrd, known as the Flying Ensign for his mountain-climbing abilities, and his friend, the Honorable Charles Neville--both members of the British army--help to free Spain from occupation by Napoleon's armies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bPQ4JzmkpXoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mindstorms Robotics Invention System 2.0","description":"A guide to the LEGO Mindstorms Robotics Invention System Version 2.0 explains how to build one of ten vehicles, creatures, and machines in an hour.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EmEltPQLhTQC&dq=Mindstorms+Robotics+Invention+System+2.0&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gold-Laced Coat: A story of Old Niagara","description":"Having come from France alone to America to be with his father, Philippe de Croix finds that New France in 1758 is wild, rough and dangerous--especially as his father, Captain de Croix, is charged with defending Fort Niagara against the English and their Indian allies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SXgNAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Gold-Laced+Coat:+A+story+of+Old+Niagara&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prayer: Conversing with God: Special Youth Edition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Cinque Canti / Five Cantos (Biblioteca Italiana)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Immigranty y Bezhentsy (Russian Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"How to Survive Being a Presbyterian!: A Merry Manual Celebrating the Funny Foibles of the Frozen Chosen","description":"In this tongue-in-cheek celebration of the funny foibles of the Frozen Chosen, the 300-year-old Percy T.

So begins Abigail Adams' correspondence to her husband in these volumes: a plea to end their long separation, as John Adams represented the United States in Europe while Abigail tended to family and farm in Massachusetts, and passed on to John Crucial political information from Congress. In October 1782, the Adams family was as widely scattered as it would ever be, with young John Quincy Adams in St. Petersburg, John at The Hague, and Abigail in Braintree with her daughter and younger sons. With the summer of 1784, however, Abigail would have her fondest wish, as most of the family reunited to spend nearly a year together in Europe. As the Adams family traveled, and as the children came of age, so their correspondence expanded to include an ever larger and more fascinating range of Cultural topics and international figures. The record of this remarkable expansion, these volumes document John Adams' diplomatic triumphs, his wife and daughter's participation in the cosmopolitan scenes of Paris and London, and his son John Quincy's travels in Europe and America. These pages also welcome Thomas Jefferson, who soon became one of Abigail's closest friends, into the family correspondence. From the intimacies 0f the children's education, sentimental and worldly, to the details of the 'arm friendship between Abigail and Madame Lafayette, to the grand drama of Edmund Burke and William Pitt the Younger debating in Parliament, the contents of these letters draw an incredibly rich picture of international life in the 17805 and an incomparable portrait of America's first family of politics and letters.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kkDO0HrHoC8C&dq=Adams+Family+Correspondence,+Volumes+One+and+Two&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hermione and her little group of serious thinkers","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bv8gAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alphabake: A Cookbook and Cookie Cutter Set (Book Only)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cBAbAQAAMAAJ&dq=Alphabake:+A+Cookbook+and+Cookie+Cutter+Set+(Book+Only)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Journals of Eleanor Druse","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Big Book of 5000 Fonts","description":"That s where this valuable book comes in.

A dangerous, worldwide coalition of Islamic terrorists, well-intentioned but profoundly misinformed students, right wing fascists, left-wing ideologues, pious academics, feminists, opportunistic European politicians, and sensation-seeking international media have joined together to once again blame the Jews and the Jewish state for the current world crisis. Today, lethal activism against the Jews often takes the form of anti-Zionism. Osama Bin Laden, for example, blamed the 9/11 World Trade Center attack on U.S. government support for Israel. Since then, hundreds of synagogues have been burned, cemeteries and destroyed, and Jews threatened, boycotted, beaten, and killed. Jews have been blamed for huge stock market losses and for the decline of the world economy. The long-ago disproven Protocols of Zion, which accuse the Jews of an alleged world-conspiracy to conquer and control the world, have been revived and promulgated in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East. So what must we do? \\"Fight against the Big Lies,\\" Chesler says. (No, the Jews do not control the world's money and media, and the Jews did not kill Christ.) Avoid rigid, dogmatic ideologies. Focus on the world's real problems (disease, poverty, illiteracy, violence) instead of scapegoating the Jews and demonizing the Jewish state. Be fair to Israel. Form Jewish-Christian, Jewish-Muslim, and Jewish-Palestinian alliances. Restore campus civility and above all, Jews must stop fighting among themselves.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CR5-LLFO4oUC&dq=New+Anti-Semitism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Practical Mathematics - 4 Vol. Set","description":"Popular Mechanics inspires, instructs and influences readers to help them master the modern world.

They are small -- the largest weigh no more than 40 grams, while the smallest emu-wrens are only 5 -6 grams -- and feed mainly on the ground or in low vegetation. Most males are brightly coloured, while the female plumage is duller. They have a fascinating social organization, with resident social groups consisting of long-lasting social pairs and their progeny, retained long after independence. All members of the group help to raise the young. Social pairing, however, does not preclude promiscuity, and most males seek matings outside the group. Although their cocked tails and general appearance reminded early Australian settlers of wrens back home, and the English name has persisted, Fairy-wrens and Grasswrens are not closely related to wrens (Troglodytidae). In the first eight chapters, the authors look at the family as a whole, describing their taxonomy, evolution, biology, behaviour, and conservation. These chapters are include black-and-white drawings showing typical behaviour, as well summary graphs and tables. Then follow the twenty-five species accounts, each one giving comprehensive information on the bird in its natural state. Distribution maps and sonograms are included. All species are fully illustrated in colour, in superb plates by Peter Marsack especially commissioned for this volume.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xcF1QgAACAAJ&dq=Fairy-wrens+and+Grasswrens+:+Maluridae+(Bird+Families+of+the+World,+number+4)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Way Things Work: The Complete Illustrated Guide to the Amazing World of Technology","description":"Grounded in theory and best-practices research, this practical text provides teachers with 40 strategies for using fiction and non-fiction trade books to teach in five key content areas: language arts and reading, social studies, mathematics, science, and the arts.

One such experience is lifelong bilingualism. Moreover, research into the cognitive effects of bilingualism has increased dramatically in the past decade, making it an exciting area of study. This volume combines these issues and presents the most recent research and thinking into the effects of bilingualism on cognitive decline in aging. The contributors are all leading scholars in their field. The result is a state-of-the art collection on the effect of bilingualism on cognition in older populations for both healthy aging and aging with dementia.

As Howard Falco learned, the answers to these questions can ultimately be found in the answer to just one: \\"Who am I?\\" In late 2002, in the middle of an ordinary life, Falco-a thirty- five-year-old investment manager with a wife and two children-sought the answer to this powerful question and remarkably this quest resulted in a sudden and all-encompassing shift in his awareness that revealed more about life and how we each create it than he ever imagined knowing. Startled by this new understanding and its implications for his own life and the lives of all others, Falco set out to share his discoveries. The stunning result is this book. I AM takes readers on a life-changing journey in which they will discover the incredible power they have over their experience of life, finding that the doorway to eternal peace, happiness, and fulfillment lies in one of the shortest sentences in the written word but the most powerful in the universe: I AM.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jXPp6mzmKcgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Girl of the Commune: A Tale of Two Sieges of Paris","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pMtCAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flying for France with the American Escadrille at Verdun","description":"This book presents a first-hand account of an American in the French Flying Corps during WWI.

But now his body was covered in scars, his face half-collapsed. It saddened Kinsey and made her curious. She could see he was in a lot of pain. But for three weeks, as Kinsey'd watched him doggedly working out at the local gym, putting himself through a grueling exercise routine, he never spoke. Then one Monday morning when there was no one else in the gym, Bobby Callahan approached her. His story was hard to credit: a murderous assault by a tailgating car on a lonely rural road, a roadside smash into a canyon 400 feet below, his Porsche a bare ruin, his best friend dead. The doctors had managed to put his body back together again-sort of. His mother's money had seen to that. What they couldn't fix was his mind, couldn't restore the huge chunks of memory wiped out by the crash. Bobby knew someone had tried to kill him, but he didn't know why. He knew he had the key to something that made him dangerous to the killer, but he didn't know what it was. And he sensed that someone was still out there, ready to pounce at the first sign his memory was coming back. He'd been to the cops, but they'd shrugged off his story. His family thought he had a screw loose. But he was scared-scared to death. He wanted to hire Kinsey. His case didn't have a whole lot going for it, but he was hard to resist: young, brave, hurt. She took him on. And three days later, Bobby Callahan was dead. Kinsey Millhone never welshed a deal. She'd been hired to stop a killing.

Middleton: A Biography","description":"Troy H. Middleton (1889-1976) was the youngest colonel in the American Expeditionary Force in France during World War I. Later, he served as commander of the Army s 45th Division and then the VIII Corps. During World War II, Middleton spent more time in combat than any other general officer. General Middleton made key tactical decisions in the largest and most complex military action in which the U.S. Army has ever been involved the Battle of the Bulge. In 1951, Louisiana State University s board of supervisors appointed Middleton president of the university. He had previously served at the school as commandant of cadets, professor of military science, dean, and vice president. While president of LSU, Middleton oversaw a sustained period of growth and academic achievement. Like many other university presidents in the Jim Crow era, throughout his tenure at LSU, he also staunchly upheld his institution s deeply-racist segregationist policies. In this thoroughly researched biography, Frank James Price tells Middleton s life story from his boyhood plantation days in Copiah County, Mississippi, to his public service achievements after his retirement as president of Louisiana State University in 1962. In much of the book, the author, through taped interviews, allows Middleton to tell his own story. In researching the book, Price interviewed and/or corresponded with General Dwight D. Eisenhower, General Omar Bradley, and other personal acquaintances of General Middleton.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rPrkseaVX-IC&dq=Troy+H.+Middleton:+A+Biography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The One in the Middle","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=D7D_4no5M9AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Recycle With Earthworms: The Red Wiggler Connection","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Collected Stories of Chester Himes (Himes, Chester)","description":"Spanning over forty years of the author's writing career, this collection of short stories uncovers the internal struggle of black people caught between rage and resignation in American society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HeNaAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Collected+Stories+of+Chester+Himes+(Himes,+Chester)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wren (World of Art)","description":"Biography and examination of the works of the 17th century English architect.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZeVwQgAACAAJ&dq=Wren+(World+of+Art)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Witchcraft and Paganism Today","description":"Whether you're looking for information on blessings, the Green Man, divination, ritual components, or spellwork, you can find it all in the Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism.

North Korea's Armed Forces maps the most important events from the inconclusive ceasefire struck at the end of the Korean War, throughout the Cold War until modern day, and an especially heavy emphasis is placed on the current status of the Korean People's Army by examining their wealth of indigenously designed weaponry. In the course of the book not only will many of the Korean People's Army's most secret projects and tactics be unveiled, but also new light will be shed on the deadly flare-ups between the North and the South, and novel evidence on tragic incidents such as the Cheonan sinking and Yeongpyeong bombing of 2010 is brought forth. Moreover, an up-to-date, comprehensive listing of the equipment holdings of several branches of the Korean People's Army is included, offering a numerical assessment of its naval and aerial capabilities. From the recently introduced stealth missile boats, ballistic missile submarines and main battle tank families to their often-ignored indigenous aircraft industry, virtually all indigenous weapons systems are discussed extensively. This exclusive content is illustrated by over forty detailed color artworks and various maps put together through exhaustive research and analysis, as well as around 170 unique images, many of which have never before been seen by the general public. Through scrutiny of satellite footage, the observation of North Korean propaganda outlets and by carefully examining information from the United States Department of Defense, the DPRK's advances in each of the Korean People's Army's respective branches are uncovered. Nearly all of the 'hermit kingdom's' military exploits are included and an accurate picture of the North's capabilities in both symmetrical and asymmetrical warfare is provided. This book was written specifically for anyone interested in North Korea's military capabilities or looking to find answers to many questions raised by the minefield of contradictory statements and misinformation that make up current intelligence about this reclusive nation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EoRyrgEACAAJ&dq=The+Armed+Forces+of+North+Korea&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Basic Butchering of Livestock & Game","description":"This guide takes the mystery out of butchering, covering everything you need to know to produce your own expert cuts of beef, venison, pork, lamb, poultry, and small game.

Together with her best friend Maxine, an aspiring actress consigned to playing the comedy-ing nue in plays that regularly folded after five performances, she cultivated the  delicate, illegal art of getting everything for nothing  from free seats to every Broadway show and neighborhood movie and borrowed outfits from Saks to voice lessons for Maxine and Greek lessons for Helene.

She was even showered by Mom until age sixteen while sharing her diaries, email, and all her income. In I m Glad My Mom Died, Jennette recounts all this in unflinching detail just as she chronicles what happens when the dream finally comes true. Cast in a new Nickelodeon series called iCarly, she is thrust into fame. Though Mom is ecstatic, emailing fan club moderators and getting on a first-name basis with the paparazzi ( Hi Gale! ), Jennette is riddled with anxiety, shame, and self-loathing, which manifest into eating disorders, addiction, and a series of unhealthy relationships. These issues only get worse when, soon after taking the lead in the iCarly spinoff Sam & Cat alongside Ariana Grande, her mother dies of cancer. Finally, after discovering therapy and quitting acting, Jennette embarks on recovery and decides for the first time in her life what she really wants. Told with refreshing candor and dark humor, I m Glad My Mom Died is an inspiring story of resilience, independence, and the joy of shampooing your own hair.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lRhJEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Four Centuries of Jewish Women's Spirituality: A Sourcebook","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Caesar's Coin","description":"A historic gold coin marches across history and the world from the time of Julius Caesar to modern America--cursed in death, war, betrayal, hate and finally embraced by love and honor.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hMzOOH5jKq8C&dq=Caesar%27s+Coin&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Omaha to Okinawa;: The story of the Seabees,","description":"William Bradford Huie, joined the U.S. Navy in 1943.

Just think about different behaviors you see at a dog park: We have a good understanding of what it means when dogs wag their tails but what about when they sniff and roll on a stinky spot? Why do they play tug-of-war with one dog, while showing their bellies to another? Why are some dogs shy, while others are bold? What goes on in dogs  heads and hearts and how much can we know and understand? Canine Confidential has the answers. Written by award-winning scientist and lifelong dog lover Marc Bekoff, it not only brilliantly opens up the world of dog behavior, but also helps us understand how we can make our dogs  lives the best they can possibly be. Rooted in the most up-to-date science on cognition and emotion fields that have exploded in recent years Canine Confidential is a wonderfully accessible treasure trove of new information and myth-busting. Peeing, we learn, isn t always marking; grass-eating isn t always an attempt to trigger vomiting; it s okay to hug a dog on their terms; and so much more. There s still much we don t know, but at the core of the book is the certainty that dogs do have deep emotional lives, and that as their companions we must try to make those lives as rich and fulfilling as possible. It s also clear that we must look at dogs as unique individuals and refrain from talking about  the dog.  Bekoff also considers the practical importance of knowing details about dog behavior. He advocates strongly for positive training there s no need to dominate or shame dogs or to make them live in fear and the detailed information contained in Canine Confidential has a good deal of significance for dog trainers and teachers. He also suggests that trainers should watch and study dogs in various contexts outside of those in which they are dealing with clients, canine and human, with specific needs. There s nothing in the world as heartwarming as being greeted by your dog at the end of the workday. Read Canine Confidential, and you ll be on the road to making your shared lives as happy, healthy, and rewarding as they can possibly be.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VfhTDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Let Us Draw Near","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4hnuAAAACAAJ&dq=Let+Us+Draw+Near&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Astrology for the Light Side of the Brain","description":"Laugh while looking ahead with astrology!

Ludwig's eighteen-year investigation into why people want to rule. The answer may seem obvious -- power, privilege, and perks -- but any adequate answer also needs to explain why so many rulers cling to power even when they are miserable, trust nobody, feel besieged, and face almost certain death. Ludwig's results suggest that leaders of nations tend to act remarkably like monkeys and apes in the way they come to power, govern, and rule. Profiling every ruler of a recognized country in the twentieth century -- over 1,900 people in all--, Ludwig establishes how rulers came to power, how they lost power, the dangers they faced, and the odds of their being assassinated, committing suicide, or dying a natural death. Then, concentrating on a smaller sub-set of 377 rulers for whom more extensive personal information was available, he compares six different kinds of leaders, examining their characteristics, their childhoods, and their mental stability or instability to identify the main predictors of later political success. Ludwig's penetrating observations, though presented in a lighthearted and entertaining way, offer important insight into why humans have engaged in war throughout recorded history as well as suggesting how they might live together in peace.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AQM-AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quilt a Colorful Christmas","description":"In Quilt a Colorful Christmas, find a project that's just perfect for that special someone's Christmas holiday.

Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries, and the Governments of several States on the two continents, were deeply interested in the matter. For some time past vessels had been met by \\"an enormous thing,\\" a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale. The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books) agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If it was a whale, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified in science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers times rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length we might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all dimensions admitted by the learned ones of the day, if it existed at all. And that it DID exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this supernatural apparition. As to classing it in the list of fables, the idea was out of the question. On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer Governor Higginson, of the Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met this moving mass five miles off the east coast of Australia. Captain Baker thought at first that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he even prepared to determine its exact position when two columns of water, projected by the mysterious object, shot with a hissing noise a hundred and fifty feet up into the air. Now, unless the sandbank had been submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser, the Governor Higginson had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal, unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water mixed with air and vapour. Similar facts were observed on the 23rd of July in the same year, in the Pacific Ocean, by the Columbus, of the West India and Pacific Steam Navigation Company. But this extraordinary creature could transport itself from one place to another with surprising velocity; as, in an interval of three days, the Governor Higginson and the Columbus had observed it at two different points of the chart, separated by a distance of more than seven hundred nautical leagues.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LGIiDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Life and Death of Adolf Hitler.","description":"Traces Hitler's life from his childhood in Austria to his final days in Berlin, exploring how his promises of prosperity and power along with anti-Semitic rhetoric allowed him to lead the nation of Germany into World War II.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hdEnddrZBVwC&dq=The+Life+and+Death+of+Adolf+Hitler.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tillie: A Mennonite Maid A Tale of the Pennsylvania Dutch","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cQ41AAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Python Programming Patterns","description":"Software -- Software Engineering.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tmNNfSkfTlcC&dq=Python+Programming+Patterns&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elements of yacht design","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LCxFAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fortunes Of Nigel, The ( 2 Volumes ) (BCL1-PR English Literature)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Frommer's South Florida including Miami and the Keys","description":"America s #1 bestselling travel series Written by more than 175 outspoken travelers around the globe, Frommer s Complete Guides help travelers experience places the way locals do.

In the author?s words, ?We have never been as openmouthed and inquisitive, never as astonished and embarrassed at our ignorance about man. We know what he makes, but we do not konw wha he is or what to expect of him. Is it not conceivable that our entire civilization is built upon a minsinterpretation of man? Or that the tragedy of man is due to the fact that he is a being who has forgotten the question: Who is Man? The failure to identify himself, to know what is authentic human existence, leads him to assume a false identity, to pretending to be what he is unable to be or to not accepting what is at the very root of his being.

Once, a long time ago, I walked down a night-darkened road called Firefly Lane, all alone, on the worst night of my life, and I found a kindred spirit. That was our beginning. More than thirty years ago. TullyandKate. You and me against the world. Best friends forever. But stories end, don't they? You lose the people you love and you have to find a way to go on. . . . Tully Hart has always been larger than life, a woman fueled by big dreams and driven by memories of a painful past. She thinks she can overcome anything until her best friend, Kate Ryan, dies. Tully tries to fulfill her deathbed promise to Kate---to be there for Kate's children---but Tully knows nothing about family or motherhood or taking care of people. Sixteen-year-old Marah Ryan is devastated by her mother's death. Her father, Johnny, strives to hold the family together, but even with his best efforts, Marah becomes unreachable in her grief. Nothing and no one seems to matter to her . . . until she falls in love with a young man who makes her smile again and leads her into his dangerous, shadowy world. Dorothy Hart---the woman who once called herself Cloud---is at the center of Tully's tragic past. She repeatedly abandoned her daughter, Tully, as a child, but now she comes back, drawn to her daughter's side at a time when Tully is most alone. At long last, Dorothy must face her darkest fear: Only by revealing the ugly secrets of her past can she hope to become the mother her daughter needs. A single, tragic choice and a middle-of-the-night phone call will bring these women together and set them on a poignant, powerful journey of redemption. Each has lost her way, and they will need each one another---and maybe a miracle---to transform their lives. An emotionally complex, heart-wrenching novel about love, motherhood, loss, and new beginnings, Fly Away reminds us that where there is life, there is hope, and where there is love, there is forgiveness.

In the remarkable life story of one of its most beloved matriarchs 100-year-old medicine woman Gladys Tantaquidgeon Medicine Trail tells of the Mohegans' survival into this century. Blending autobiography and history, with traditional knowledge and ways of life, Medicine Trail presents a collage of events in Tantaquidgeon's life. We see her childhood spent learning Mohegan ceremonies and healing methods at the hands of her tribal grandmothers, and her Ivy League education and career in the white male-dominated field of anthropology. We also witness her travels to other Indian communities, acting as both an ambassador of her own tribe and an employee of the federal government's Bureau of Indian Affairs. Finally we see Tantaquidgeon's return to her beloved Mohegan Hill, where she cofounded America's oldest Indian-run museum, carrying on her life's commitment to good medicine and the cultural continuance and renewal of all Indian nations. Written in the Mohegan oral tradition, this book offers a unique insider's understanding of Mohegan and other Native American cultures while discussing the major policies and trends that have affected people throughout Indian Country in the twentieth century. A significant departure from traditional anthropological \\"as told to\\" American Indian autobiography, Medicine Trail represents a major contribution to anthropology, history, theology, women's studies, and Native American studies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5s3eCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Theory and Application of Digital Signal Processing","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"What Do We Want to Be When We Grow Up?","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MI1NMnHReV0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"City editor,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The First Food Evaluator","description":"Evaluation Technologies for Food Quality summarizes food quality evaluation technologies, which include sensory evaluation techniques and chemical and physical analysis.
