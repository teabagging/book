Instead, he hints darkly at surrendering freedom in favor of security.Oh please. The Soviet Union that Superman serves here is the sort of cookie-cutter comic book autocracy one might have expected in a 1950s comic and bears no resemblance to the murderous regime that truly was an \\"evil empire.\\" At one point, Stalin understands why Superman must rush off to save thousands in Vladivostok. This is the dictator who killed, yes slaughtered, tens of millions of his own people.It's this sort of superficial investigation that dooms \\"Red Son\\" to superficial stabs at political comment, and third-rate reimaginings of history that are, frankly, tiresome.Though the story is redeemed in the end by a circular ending which seems to say we are always doomed to repeat the same mistakes, this \\"devastating critique\\" is not really all that original, exciting, or particularly entertaining. Nor does it comment on anything except the overexcited imaginations of a bunch of leftists who obviously learned their politics from comic books. Grow up, guys."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"Normally, when I get my hands on one of these babies and I just cannot put it down. Not the case with this one. An Elseworlds story on what if Superman landed in the USSR instead? Certainly, this would make an intriguing story. Some of the differences include a new costume, Batman as a vigilante in USSR, Jimmy as a government spy, and Lois as wife of Lex Luthor. Some of these differences are self-explanatory, but others such as Batman being in USSR and Jimmy working for CIA is not really explained. Add to also, really boring writing (took me several sittings to finish it) and not too interesting storylines and you get three snoozefest stories.The first story on Luthor creating Bizarro to battle Superman is very uninteresting. Luthor is hired by US Govt to counteract the Superman threat and is considered a hero in this book.The second story is somewhat more interesting as Batman teams up with Luthor in bringing down the man of steel. I really enjoy how they do this and Batman's costume is pretty nice, but again, there is no explanation to why he is here in this country.Third story is suppose to be epic as the last and final assault launched by the US to destroy Superman. Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, and Lex, attack at the same time. However, the final climatic moment is very weak and quite confusing. And the epilogue is not really as brilliant as one would think, probably tiresome as this book is too long and boring.The only saving grace is the artwork which resembles propaganda-ish cartoon art which is very popular in communist countries. The Wonder Woman in this book is one of the best and most accurate I ever seen."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"\\"Superman: Red Son\\" features the most brilliant premise I've seen in the Elseworlds series: the boy of Krypton lands not on a rural American farm, but instead on a rural Soviet collective during the same time. Naturally as he grows up he acculturates into the Soviet Union and finds its values natural and right.What a wonderful opportunity to explore the origins of right and wrong, of our conceptions of justice, and how our ideas about morality are largely products of a place and time we were born into without being consulted about the matter.At least, this is what I thought this graphic novel was going to be as I eagerly awaited it in the mail. (It seems to be in the process of going out of print.)Alas! When it arrived, it was a comprehensive disappointment. Sure, I didn't have the setup wrong, but what could have been an immortal exploration of the tyranny of culture and the genealogy of morals got quickly bogged down in explaining how the new milieu dovetailed with the doings of the other DC heroes, and what was going on back stateside. The remainder of the book involved a hackneyed plot to wreak destruction by -- you guessed it -- Lex Luthor.What a lost opportunity. Needs to be redone."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"Red Son is an amazingly twisted and introspective look at just how different the Superman story could have been if his capsule had hit Earth even an hour off.Even people who aren't Superman fans need to give this a read, it's is so much better than anything else I own. The twist at the end is pretty wild too."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"To preface this I'm just going to say that I often find Mark Miller, though I don't know him personally, to be a self-aggrandizing prick. That being said the man does know how to tell a story and I suppose it isn't bragging if you can back it up. This story is more or less and 'Elseworlds' story and imagines what if Superman's rocket had been 12 hrs earlier or later and landed in rural Soviet Union instead of rural Kansas. Now Josef Stalin has his 'Man of Steel' and uber-mensch to show off how communism is the best political form of government. There is also Batman who is Russian for the purposes of the story trying to pry the country out from under the steel-fisted grip of the Last Son of Krypton because he has become a Fascist. Lex Luthor becomes the American president, married to Lois Lane, and is still trying to destroy Superman but this time for the good of the country and the world not wanting to become a vassal nation to the Soviet Union. Green Lantern also makes an appearance. This story is wide spread and utterly fantastic and if you like comics or great stories told well then this is a must read."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"SRS presents a what if scenario where Kar-El's ship crash landed on an USSR collective farm in 1950s, instead of Kansas. Superman quickly became the symbol of Soviet power drawing support from around the world. After taking reins from Stalin, Superman successfully realized his vision of utopia in USSR and allied nations. In contrast, America withdrew into political and economic isolation. JFK served a terrible term as the president running the country to the brink of bankruptcy and political chaos. Lex Luthor, a renown scientist and thinker, succeeded JFK and used his intelligence to resurrect America from the ashes. The Cold War between the two great nations became a competition between two personalities of Luthor and Superman, which was, at its core, also a conflict between human free will and alien imposed \\"utopia.\\"A special mention must be made of Batman who was the son of anti-Socialist dissidents murdered by Stalin's secret police. This Batman grew up to be the most formidable terrorist in Moscow. He saw himself as the liberating force opposing Superman's dictatorship. Needlessly to say, Batman and Superman ended in a brutal fist fight (one of the best of its kind since The Dark Knight Returns). This is a good example of how the author cleverly deconstructs traditional comic book heroes, making them totally fresh and familiar at the same time. SRS is second only to Watchmen in deconstructing superhero myth and Cold War ideology, and in wrapping the cast of superheroes in a lean and unforgettable narrative.The last pages reveal the secret connection between Luthor and Superman. One has to read it to believe it. It is mind-blowing and adds a twist to the story preceding it."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"One reviewer argues that the premise--the boy from Krypton landing in the USSR as opposed the U.S.--had the potential to be a brilliant meditation on the genealogy of morals and right and wrong. He deems it a dud, and I must strongly disagree. While the writing may not push the premise to its fullest potential, is is nonetheless a really thougtful \\"what if\\" narrative, that does a good job of thinking about how nationalism is mapped onto the superhero body. I suspect it is accessible for people who do not know Superman chapter and verse, as well as throwing bones to the faithful. I give it 4 instead of 5 stars because I think there are a few intellectual strands that could have been pushed more, the final battle was resolved too easily, and the women are pathetic here. I a big fan of Millar, but he's not great with women, and in this story Lois Lane and particularly Wonder Woman are sad women desiring scraps from their men. However, the ending is a knock out."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"A self contained Superman story that was absolutely incredible. I'm not even a big Superman fan, but if I had to shove one Superman book into a friends face to read, it would be this one. Actually if a friend asked me to borrow my top favorite graphic novels, this would be one of them in the stack along with books like Dark Knight Returns, Watchmen, Sandman and Hellboy.But let me tell you how I really feel... :)The artwork is very nice all the way through the book. I have no complaints here. Does a beautiful job bringing the story to life.The story in case you haven't figured it out yet, is sort of a \\"What if\\" Superman landed as a child in the Soviet Union instead of America. It seemed so simple and so well done that I just couldn't believe it had not been written until now.Luthor, Green Lantern Rings, Wonder Woman, Batman...All play more than exciting roles in this book.It ends very well, with a full circle of events that I found brilliant. .Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"I have never been a die-hard Superman fan, although I enjoyed a few of the movies and the Lois and Clark TV series when I was younger. My stepfather is a lifelong comics fan and got me into The Teen Titans--from there I expanded out into Batman and Nightwing. Those got me interested in Superman, so I began looking for a good Supes book. I was intrigued with the premise of this one and the reviews for it were all very good, so I decided to give it a try. That was an excellent decision! I like the idea behind the story, and it made me wonder what other characters would be like in other situations/time periods.Now, if you are not totally up on the historical details/facts of the 20th century, then you might be more than a little lost at some points in the book. I had to look up a great deal of information to totally understand what was going on, but that is my only pet peeve. And really, there is no way this story could have worked without the historical events. Look at it as a fun way to learn history.The art was very well done; the dialogue seemed a little off in places though. And as I mentioned, you might need help following some of the plot if you are not up to date on events.

He is still trying to do right, but just by Soviet values. To me his confrontations with Lex Luthor in this are particularly good, and are on there own a reason to read this. I would definitely recommend this to any Superman or Else Worlds fan."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"This is one of Superman's best books. Millar hits a home run with this Elseworlds book. Elseworlds only means it's an alternative world, meaning it's not in continuity, meaning it's not boggled down with current DC stories or status. Whew. But who cares as long as the story is good and the characterization is respectful. In fact, many Elseworlds stories are far better than the stories \\"in continuity\\", meaning it's far more creative and far more interesting than the same old drivel used again and again.Lex takes the cake in this series. He's amazing. Superman is superman. Sure he's Russia's Superman, but Lex is the American hero in this series. And we all know Lex is a genius who is only human, but can cripple an alien Man of Steel, the World's hero and moral standard. But Superman is not Superman with Lex. The story takes the readers on a journey that challenges Superman's relevance on Earth. Somewhat political in tone, it's still an old fashioned super-hero wham bam comic book. But it is ever so intriguing and vast in scope.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"I have enjoyed many of the Elseworlds books ever since the precursor, Gotham By Gaslight. This is probably the best Superman title and one of the best overall.A few hours difference in the arrival of superman's space capsule could mean landing half a world away from Kansas and that is the premise. Superman has landed in the Soviet Union and has been raised by loyal Socialists. Superman's presence in the Soviet Union drastically alters the future.Superman rises to power despite the conflict of political ideals and the Warsaw Pact signs on new members. We see the world change and see the lives of many familiar figures form the DC universe; Lois Lane, Lex Luthor, Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman, etc.This is more than just a remake of the Nazi Superman (Ubermensch) as seen on Saturday Night Live. The story is fairly believable and Superman is as true to his upbringing as in the regular DC universe. The story progresses nicely until we see the final surprise plot twist.A wonderful story for Superman and Elseworlds fans."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"First things first.I am not a gigantic comics fan. I've never been to a comic book shop. I know the big names. Basically, if they had a live action TV show, I know them.So, my opinion is not as well-informed as that of some.But, I know what I like and I thought this was some grade-A, high test sci-fi with a good deal of political science thrown in.Superman has always been of limited interest to me. He can't be hurt (technically, I know he can but who has Kryptonite sitting around?), he has the tools to deal with any situation. He has a healthy psyche. Good guy to have on your side but not particularly interesting.But, let's take away his All-American freedom-loving politics and partner him with a truly soul-crushing totalitarian regime. Stalin backed by Superman's talents is a truly scary thought. Soviet theory becomes reality. A true dictatorship of the proletariat becomes possible since Superman hears and sees nearly everything.With that you have enough to make this history teacher happy. Add to it the Lex Luthor (USA)/Superman (USSR) Cold War, a reference to Plato's \\"Republic\\", a Soviet Batman (loved him! Loved the hat!), Wonder Woman, Area 51 and Nixon winning the 1960 Presidential election instead of JFK and you've got a great read!Some may quibble with details, but when you get down to it, aren't the comics supposed to entertain and take you to another world for a little while? Mission accomplished.Bravo.I give this one an enthusiastic A+."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"This graphic novel is not a parody, it's an alternate history. A most unusual alt-history: an alternate to a fictional reality, rather than an alternate version of our history. (The most popular themes for alternate history are, What if the South won the Civil War?, and What if the Germans won WWII?)Alternate history is a concept generally more familiar to those who read SF novels rather than comics/graphic novels. Many of us SF novel readers did read a lot of comics when we were younger, though, and I think this particular graphic novel is aimed at us. We read Superman - and Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman - in the 50's, 60's and 70's. So, although we may not have read any other of this particular series of graphic novels, we have quite a bit of background in the Superman mythos - his real parents, where he grew up, girlfriends, enemies, etc.I think that knowing that background from the original comics may make this book more enjoyable to my middle-aged generation than to people who are used only to the graphic novels. As well, my generation had the advantage of living through most of the history that was really happening from 1950 on. For those who know the history of the Cold War only from school, many of the details wouldn't make sense. It helps a great deal in reading this book if you are familiar with the course of the Cold War, and that you know not only who JFK was, but some of the celebrity gossip about him as well as the official records. (The name Norma Jean should mean something to you.) You should know what the Warsaw Pact was, and something about in what order the Soviet Union took over various countries.I liked the way the book involved similar alternate twists on Batman, and brought in Wonder Woman and Green Lantern as well. Batman's hat is the funniest thing I've seen in a while!A couple quibbles: having the artwork done by more than one artist is distracting; a couple times it was hard to recognize Lois Lane as herself. And I do wish that illustrators would STOP trying to use the Cyrillic alphabet incorrectly. If you can't use the letters for what they really are, don't use them, please. The thing that looks like a backwards R is NOT an R. The letter that looks like a backwards N is NOT an N. So stop it already! Just go for English in the signs and titles, or for accurate Russian. (One illustrator did this correctly, but on many pages, and the cover art, these letters are used incorrectly.) OK, that's one of my pet peeves, since I happen to be able to read Russian a little; it may not bother other people as much as it bugs me.Summary? A graphics novel that may be of more interest to an older generation that doesn't usually read them, in a vein more familiar to SF readers than comics readers."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"I have never quite liked the super-boy-scout-flag-wavering type of character that is superman but this is a superhero-gone-real-politik essay.

The re-imaginings of Superman , Batman , Wonder Woman , Lex Luthor , Lois Lane , and Green Lantern are interesting and there is wonderful little references that made me excited to keep reading. The artwork was impressive and the propoganda and political slant was done quite well.I waited awhile to pick this up but you shouldn't."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"Red Son, for those not in the know, is the Elseworlds tale showcasing how the world would have been different should Kal El have landed in Russia during the beginning of the Cold War. What occurs during the three issues is the rise of the Superman, and the fall of the world under his boot. Oh, it's not a tyrannical rule; Superman has made the world a Socialist community, with only a dilapidated America under President Luthor standing up against the alien's involvement.It's a heady case that Mark Millar brings, but the work stands as one of the best and definite works for Superman. You may ask, \`definitive for Superman? How? It's not a real story!\\" (...)! Millar defines his world using the very paradigm of who and what the Superman character stands for. Oh, our guy is most certainly there. It's just that we get to see how Superman would react given a different lot in life. He is still the highly noble, self-sacrificing hero that we all know and love. There isn't a person on this planet that doesn't know that familiar \`S'-shield, and each one can pick up on the familiarity with the character as he and his cast are presented here. After all, it's the classic story of invulnerable alien versus his greatest nemesis-a brilliant mortal flesh and blood human. Ah....but Lex gets it done. In a brilliant way, Lex gets it done.Art wise, Dave Johnson and Kilian Plunkett share the art chores throughout the telling. Johnson begins the story for the first part, and is joined and later finished by Plunkett. Johnson's work heralds the Superman Fleischer cartoons from the 1940's, where our hero is a broad shouldered man of action, simple in wants and benign in deeds. His work directly expresses the innocence of the years, and it's slow decay as time marches on. Plunkett finishes the tale up, and his style shows a harsher, aged time for the world and Superman. The decay of freedom is complete, and our hero bears that weight in full force. You can clearly perceive the gloom that hangs over all, which is...until....You read it for yourself. What, you think I was going to tell you? Ha! And ruin it? You're out of your gourd!Superman: Red Son more than stands out this year as the story that none should miss. It succeeds on all levels as a defining work that grabs your attention and leaves you overwhelmed come story's end. There is nothing more that I can say that the book doesn't say for itself."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"Every culture has its icons. Characters or figures that are recognizable by anybody who lives there, figures that are almost impossible not to know. And America is very good at producing those icons and spreading them worldwide. I remember reading somewhere - I don't remember where at the moment - that the United States' chief export is dreams, and I think there's definitely something to that.Of all the dreams to emerge from the American subconscious over the last century, Superman is one of the most enduring. Show that \\"S\\" shield to almost anyone on the planet and they'll probably know what it is. For most of his lifetime, he has stood for Truth, Justice and the American Way, with the third element to that tag line slowly vanishing as writers with a more global perspective take over the character.Regardless of his jingoistic past, Superman still remains a popular American figure. He represents what we would like to be, as a country. Powerful and just, upright and honest, but at the same time kind and generous and, at heart, good. Superman has the power to control the world, but he doesn't - he chooses not to - and we like to believe that it was his small-town, American upbringing that instilled such humility in him.This book examines how things might have gone.In the late '80s, DC Comics introduced their \\"Elseworlds\\" imprint, with a pretty simple mandate: take canon DC characters and place them in new situations or environments. This way you could see how Batman might have turned out in an America that had never gained its independence, or what would have happened to the JLA without Superman, or if The Flash had taken the bullet meant for JFK. It opened creative doors, allowing writers to tell new stories about familiar characters without disrupting the regular continuity of the DC Comics line.Of these, Superman: Red Son is one of the best. Mark Millar poses a simple question with a very complex answer: What if young Kal-L's rocket had landed in Soviet Ukraine instead of Kansas?What emerges is a fascinating tale of a Superman brought up under Stalinist philosophy. Still the good man that we know him to be, Superman nonetheless chooses a very different means of interacting with the world. We see from the first few pages that the man cannot stand still - he is constantly in motion trying to save people, not just in the Soviet Union, but anywhere in the world. It is his responsibility, he believes, to keep people safe, much in the manner of Soviet philosophy where the government controls nearly every aspect of its citizens' lives.Taken in by Stalin, Superman eventually rises to lead the Soviet Union to nearly world-wide dominance. Under his rule there are no accidents, no wars and no conflicts. Crime is nearly non-existent, and those who do not mesh well in this well ordered world are mentally reprogrammed until they do. There are dissidents, of course, like the mysterious Batman, a singular force of chaos in Superman's perfectly ordered world, but in the end, even he falls. The only true challenge to Superman's worldwide reign is the brilliant American scientist Lex Luthor, who has devoted his life to freeing mankind from alien tyranny.It's a brilliant take on the myth, with a lot of very familiar characters worked in. The art is gorgeous, with a style and a color palette that evokes thoughts of Soviet-era propaganda posters, yet never fails to be dynamic and fascinating.More important, however, is the message of the story. The idea that comics can have a message is something that a lot of people seem to ignore, fueling the idea that comics are just for kids. The message in Red Son is very important and very, very timely.The story was published in 2003, a time when America was in great pain. We had been badly hurt and wanted to set things right. By doing so, however, we caused far more damage to the world than we had ourselves endured. By trying to fix other people's problems, we created even more, and the harder we pushed, the more the world pushed back. And this was not a new trend - one of the negative labels often affixed to the United States is that of \\"world policeman.\\" We have a long, long habit of trying to help everyone, whether that is the right thing to do or not.In that vein, the Superman of Red Son, despite being a Soviet, is a reflection of ourselves. He is a man of immense power, who decides to help everybody. His intentions are good, but good intentions are not always rewarded with good results. His world is orderly, yes - crime and violence are nearly unheard-of - but it comes at the price of individual freedom. People are no longer in control of their own destinies with Superman in charge, and while that may be a safe life, it is not one that I would like to live.The political message of this book is subtle, but it's there. More interestingly, it's a message that can be enjoyed by a broad spectrum of political views. If you're a liberal, then it's taking a stance against imperialism, against the imposition of one country's values and politics over others', all in the name of making the world a better place. If you're a conservative, it's a call for individual liberty. A government that provides everything for its people is just another form of oppression - without the freedom to make their own choices, for good or for ill, people are not truly free.In the end it's a complex tale, with no real good guys and no real bad guys. Except for Brainiac, who will probably never be anything but a bad guy. It's a story about the choices we make, both as citizens and as societies, and the understanding that we must have the freedom to make those choices. They may sometimes be the wrong ones, but making mistakes is part of the package. In the end, there can be no Superman to save us. We must save ourselves."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"In this Elseworlds take on the Superman, the \\"what if?\\" proposed is if Kal-El's ship had crash landed on a ranch in the Soviet Union. I expected Superman's personality would have been altered considerably, but he is pretty much the same character, just with everything around his being radically different.Not to say that history is completely re-written here. There's still a Metropolis and a Daily Planet where Lois works, however she is now married to Luthor. A major portion of this story concentrates on Luthor and his battle against Superman to keep the US communist free. Luthor has the most interesting character development out of the cast of characters here. You could ever argue that he is the story's protagonist.Other familiar faces pop up in guest roles from the DC universe. Wonder Woman is pretty much unchanged. There is a new take on Hal Jordan's Green Lantern, and my favorite, Batmankoff. For an Elseworld's title, Mark Millar does a pretty decent job of deciding what to keep from the Superman mythology and what can be played with. Not everything makes sense exactly, but being that its a stand alone story, it grants itself creative license.The artwork is pretty great. It suits the style of the story and is never ugly or boring. The colors are always eye pleasing as well. I enjoyed the sketches in the back showing the other possible redesigns for some of the characters. That's all in the way of features though.If you're a fan, you'll probably get something out of it.

But it seems to fit this dark and moody story that seemingly without Superman, America's heroes ceased to come into being.

Does forcing morality onto people create a better society, or just a better looking one?These are some of the questions tackled in Superman: Red Son. The first question it asks is, \\"What if Superman landed 12 hours later, ending up in Soviet Russia rather than Midwest, USA?\\" The Soviet Union exploits this fact, and with your belief structures largely based on what your parents believe and the culture you're raised in, Superman would come to believe in the Communist agenda.Inevitably, a belief in communism combined with Superman's morality and the death of Stalin pushes him to a point where he believes that if he was in charge of the Soviet Union, things would be better. And soon more and more of the world comes under his control. But not everything is peachy. Not everyone wants to sign up for the Superman plan of world domination, including the U.S., and a character who's appearance I don't want to spoil.In the process of telling this engaging story, it wrestles with the questions I listed at the beginning. Can you force morality onto people, and does that make for a better society? Does an alien or higher power have the right to interfere in the lives of humans, or are we better off on our own? These are the kinds of questions humanity has been asking itself for a long time. And while Red Son does it's best to answer those questions, I'm not sure all of it's implications are correct.Regardless, Superman looks pretty cool in a Soviet military inspired costume."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"When I heard the premise--baby Superman landing in the Soviet Union--I imagined something very different from what this graphic novel ultimately delivered.Owing to the mid-century influence of the Comics Code Authority, Superman was the champion of a United States in which the American ideal was perfectly realized. I imagined that Red Son would give a similar treatment to the USSR, with young Kal-El growing into the champion of the society of mutual-aid. We could witness Batman and Superman transform from state-sponsored enemies to men with begrudging respect for each other's ideals and abilities. Backed by the good-will of the American people, Lex Luthor wouldn't be forced to sink into depravity, and could just possibly illustrate the moral virtue of the American way of life.Given the prospect of conquering all capitalist opposition, Superman might be forced to struggle with how his presence is preventing the predicted transition of the Soviet Union from socialism (a classless but state-run society) into communism (a classless and state-free society). He might be forced to come to terms with the fact that, as a Nietzschen \\"overman\\", he has no place in the Marxist world he is helping to create. That thread is explored a bit, but I was hoping for some authentic and ruthlessly boring political and moral philosophizing in the tradition of so many Russian authors.Instead, Millar keeps the man of steel much closer to canon. I understand that Red Son was not published under the Vertigo label, and that it fits into a tradition of alternate-universe comic book stories. Given that, I can appreciate a story about a Soviet Superman written with American sensibilities. I can appreciate why Smallville, Jimmy Olsen, and Lois Lane appear in this story, and the particular philosophizing Millar does explore.There you are. If you were hoping for the former but will accept the latter, it's a decent read."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"Loved every second of it!

It's a thrilling story that illuminates the great contradiction of Superman, between his loyalty to his native country and his raw idealism.

What's Batman's motivation for being a Soviet dissident?), but altogether I consider this one of the few mainstream superhero comics worth reading."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"These \\"elseworlds\\" stories are great - it gets a little hokey at the end but worth the ride. Remember that Superman would not have known about Stalin's brutality, as they kept a tight lid on that stuff inside the USSR."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"It's not often that you find a comic book with critics' reviews quoted on the back. Right there that means one of two things: that this is a better-than-average comic book, or DC is trying ^way^ too hard.Fortunitely for my attention span, it's the first. This comic book is good -- no, great. It's only when you take him out of his original setting that you find out what made Superman American, and more intriguingly, what still makes Superman Superman. His dance with Wonder Woman is beautifully surreal -- he wears the uniform of a human, yet makes no effort to hide what he is and they're both actually floating off the ground.I found that the biggest question \\"Red Son\\" raised was, \\"Would Communism have worked if the Russians had Superman to run it?\\" Statistically it does work, but somewhere along the line, Superman the Moralist becomes Big Brother, and the \\"Superman Robots\\" are disturbing! Of course, it all makes sense -- power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.And then the entire thing ends in a quasi Jennifer Paradox. Joy.Strongly reccommended for anyone who likes escapist literature and wants to stretch the imagination."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"Mark Millar comes up with a simple but interesting idea for \\"Superman: Red Son.\\" What if the rocket ship carrying the infant Kal-el from Krypton landed in the Ukraine rather than in Kansas? The idea of Superman wearing a hammer and sickle rather than a big \\"S\\" and standing next to Joseph Stalin on top of Lenin's tomb is certainly captivating. The problem with \\"Red Son\\" is that Millar takes this idea and goes way too far in finding variations on virtually every significant element of the Superman mythos.I was a bit concerned when this story did not begin with Superman being raised by his Soviet parents on a collective in the Ukraine. It was not just that Superman landed in America, but that he was found by the Kents. How they raised him was more important than where he was raised, and Millar skips over that part. Having President Eisenhower announce that the Soviets had Superman was a nice touch, transferring the paranoia about Sputnik from that period to the threat of a Soviet Superman. But then there was Millar's reworking of the introduction to television's \\"Superman,\\" which describes the strange visitor from another world who, \\"as the champion of the common worker, fights a never-ending battle for Stalin, Socialism, and the International Expansion of the Warsaw Pact.\\"Millar does not just throw the kitchen sink in with this one, but pretty much every other fixture he can find. Lois Lane is still a reporter for the \\"Daily Planet\\" but is married to Lex Luthor, the scientific genius of the age. Wonder Woman shows up and this world has its own Batman on that side of the Iron Curtain and Green Lantern on this side. There is also a point where you are going to be thinking Frank Miller's \\"The Dark Night Returns\\" than the original story by Jerry Siegel & Joe Shuster. There are just so many changes here that keeping track of all of them and figuring out how they are coming into play in the story. Ultimately, it is not that the Soviet Superman is most different here, but rather Lex Luthor without any rational justification other than the dictates of simple role reversal. Superman landing in the Ukraine would make him Soviet rather than American, but what turned Lex Luthor into the guy who makes Albert Einstein feel stupid?This three-part comic book story is penciled by Dave Johnson & Kilian Plunkett and inked by Andrew Robinson & Walden Wong. There are a series of \\"posters\\" extolling the \\"Comrade of Steel\\" in the introduction, but that style is extended in part to the storytelling itself. A story about a Soviet Superman drawn in the style of Soviet propaganda art appeals to me, especially since I think this one really needed to look different to sell the story and a specific artistic style was clearly available to be emulated.\\"Saturday Night Live\\" did a skit once where Superman landed in Nazi Germany and used his x-ray vision to identify circumcised spies trying to get to Hitler. That skit had a simple elegance that \\"Superman: Red Son\\" could use more of that approach. Part of my problem is that I had a strong expectation that Stalin would have used Superman to not just end but rather to win the Cold War, and I was expecting that it was in subjugating the United States and the rest of the West that Superman would experience a crisis of conscience over his Proletarian ideals and the execution of a Soviet master plan for world dominance. Less would have been more here, and there is a sense in which this story end, in a manner of speaking, where it needed to have begun to tell this variation on the familiar tale."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"This story is intriguing and deep. It incorporates all the tropes and famous events and characters in Superman, but turns them on their head. The hopelessly idealistic Superman fits the Soviet model perfectly. Anarchist Batman is an amazing addition. Lex Luthor is an incredible pseudo-hero! The story doesn't just tell you Lex Luthor is brilliant and Superman is idealist--it shows you! Character development and plot tension are amazing. The artwork looks like it comes from 1950s Soviet propaganda. The whole thing is wonderful and I highly recommend it to anyone getting into comics."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"What if Superman had landed in communist Russia and had become a Russian hero during the Cold War?That's the question this book tries to answer, as we see Superman going from working class hero to strategic asset (much like Doctor Manhattan in the much more relevant Watchmen book), then to Soviet president.This Superman is nearly omnipotent and, despite being raised by normal folks, absorbs enough Soviet propaganda to become a benign (in intent, at least...) but very strict dictator, going as far as lobotomising defeated rebels. This oddly reminded me of One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, but not entirely in a good way, since Kesey's masterpiece is on an entirely different level and much, much more subtle too, especially when compared to Millar's typical in-your-face approach.In any case, this different attitude is well portrayed, although oversimplifed.Much as I enjoyed this book and much as I enjoy the work of both its creators, this has failed to impress me as other works by them have.Trying to compress 60 years of history in 160 pages while at the same time re-inventing al main DC Universe heroes in addition to the title character might have bee too much for Millarto handle. It apparently was for main artist Dave Johnson too, who had to be replaced by Killian Plunkett in issue 3. It must be said that Johnson does an astounding job of channelling Soviet propaganda posters in his absolutely marvellous covers, which possibly are the real highlight of the book. And the Russian Batman wearing a pelt hat...? A classic! Funny as hell, and so blatantly practical it makes you chuckle.However, my guess is that Millar wrote it years before ad that it suffered from the artist's slowness, as the writing here is more reminiscent of some of Millar's less succesfull early efforts.Nonetheless, Millar shows a deep and thorough understandng of what makes Luthor such a cool villain and why one might root for him instead of the all too perfect alien God he faces.Luthor's \\"inhumanity\\"is often played upon, but eventually he's the one saving and reforming the world to reach the Utopia Superman himself couldn't achieve. Luthor finally beat Superman, using layer upon layer of carefully orchestrated plans and incredible discoveries and inventions that are born in a phrase and never expanded at all (thus sounding cool while not having to withstand closer examination, or further development). This is even above the average the likes of Millar and Morrison usually manage in their high concept-crammed but still much better books.If you are really interested I'd recommend waiting for a decent price, and steering clear of the uselessly more expensive hardcover re-release!"},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"A very different relationship between Luthor/Superman and Superman/Batman/Wonder Woman, in this recreation of the Superman myth, witch Superman growing up a Ukrainian farm boy.Taking over for Stalin, the world becomes happy and communist, except for Luthor and the USA.A little twist at the end, too."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"Liked it, quite a bit.

This one should be up there with Moore's Watchmen and Miller's Dark Knight with regard to landmark events in the graphic novel. I won't give away any surprises, but this is a fun and intellectual exploration into the history of an American icon, propaganda, and post-war history. This places the Seigel and Shuster creation in an historical epoch, paying homage to the Man of Steel's early socialist roots while exploring alternate past and alternate future histories, with a neat sharp left turn at the end. Even an iconoclast such as myself enjoyed this trip through truth, justice and 1917. You have nothing to lose but your chains of ideology."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"\\"What was the point of Lex Luthor. A human being who dared to challenge a God.\\"Superman, Red SonThis statement by Superman pretty much sums up the relationship between Superman and Lex Luthor except that in a weird twist the God is the hero and the man the villain. \`Red Son' turns the dynamic 180 degrees into its more natural state. Baby Kal-L lands in a Soviet Union farming collective rather than Kansas and becomes the standard bearer of Stalin's Communist vision. Thanks to the sheer might of Superman the Soviet Union is able to rise up while the United States (and Chile??) are left isolated and in disarray.This is a very deep story that cuts to the core of Superman in a way that canonized stories cannot. Essentially Superman becomes a metaphor for an all intrusive government. Benjamin Franklin once said, \\"Those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety\\". The question of liberty vs security is more important today than ever before with many Americans jumping to give up civil rights guaranteed in the Bill of Rights to feel a little safer. Should we submit to random searches, warrentless wiretapping, suspension of habeas corpus, automated traffic cameras? Superman is a reflection of increasingly sophisticated technology that monitors and dehumanizes us all. In America, Luthor is as obsessed with destroying Superman as he is in the canonized version except this time his goal is more reasonable (regardless of his despicable personality).The Soviet Superman is never meant to be evil just overprotective and stifling. Unfortunately the author chose to absolve the alternate Superman of most of his crimes by blaming them on outside manipulations reducing the impact of the story. I also have to question the ending lesson. After Luthor is successful in wresting control of the world's destiny from Superman he takes a similar path of top down social engineering called Luthorism with even better quantifiable results than those attained by Superman including a life expectancy that went from 120 years to an astounding 180 years. The point of the story seemed to be that Superman's good intentions were oppressive because they dehumanized man but in the end the book seemed to imply that Luthor was better because he could put up superior statistics."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"Red Son is awful in his superficiality. What could've been a very beautiful statement about mankind, economy and Super-powers ended basically just as another regular Superman story, just with him using another black suit. There is nothing in Red Son about a communist Superman or about Comunism itself. It's just another mediocre Superman story throwing just bits of uneducated and biased ideas and giving hints of him dating WW (who cares about that?).Worse than that, the format make the issues so large they become tiring to read.

This is up there with the very best. Superman is perhaps the most boring comic book character of all time and yet some how Millar is able to breath life into him and make him interesting again.This is the Citizen Kane of comic books."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"This is a book that is inventive enough, and good enough, that it makes me ask more from it than I would a normal book.Wonderful reimagining of the Superman story. It seems so obvious, but it takes a special genius to actually generate this idea. Superman lands in the Soviet Union instead of the United States. Brilliant concept. I've never cared for Superman, he's not that interesting of a superhero to me. Yet this context makes him far more intriguing.Generally, the art is quite good. It does vary some. Other heroes make appearances, Wonder Woman and the Green Lantern are handled well. The coolest thing is the inclusion of \\"Batman\\". The Russian Batmen have the perfect costume for their role. Great translation of the American batman into the context of this story.The one letdown, and perhaps it isn't even a fair criticism given how much the book achieved, is I feel the story could have gone one step further down the subversive road. I think there was another level of satire that might have been achieved. Maybe it's how things wrapped up that just felt a little too standard for this type of effort, though they certainly put an interesting twist on the end. Personally, I feel it would have been stronger without the twist, though many people will certainly like it.This is a really unique book and I definitely recommend it, particularly to people who may not be pure comic book or Superman fans. There is enough interest in the story for anyone with basic familiarity with Superman to enjoy. Perhaps it is missing that one tiny element that lifts it to true greatness, but that is a a request for perfection rather than an insult to this tremendous effort."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"I havent read a comic book in many years.

I'll just close with pick it up if you want a great story with beautiful artwork and some great action."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"I don't read many Superman comics (he's just not really one of my favorite heroes to be honest) but this book...is excellent. You don't have to have any knowledge of Superman or the mythos of any of the characters that show up, because Mark Millar takes everything and turn's it on its head.Mark asks the question...what if Superman's ship landed 12 hours later on planet Earth in Communist Russia? Where would the world be? What would happen to some of our old friends like Lois Lane and Lex Luthor? Or even Wonderwoman and Batman? The world is a vastly different place with Superman having been raised in Communist traditions, versus American. And yet...we can still recognize him as the one person that continually wants to do good, even if it doesn't always work out.The writing is superb and constantly keeps the reader on the edge wondering what will happen next. Millar expertly takes a question that in the hands of a lesser writer could have been a horrible work, but instead is something downright fantastic. He uses other DC heroes, such as Batman and Green Lantern, and reimagines their stories all because of this one event and weaves their tales in. And of course the two biggest Superman villains show up--Lex Luthor and Brainiac, each with their own twists on their tales. The artwork complements the story well and is a darker tone than what we normally see.Even if you aren't a Superman fan read this book. It will challenge what you know about the DC universe, in a good way."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"Superman: Red Son is a simple story that all starts with a \\"What If\\". What if Superman had landed in Soviet Russia instead of Smallville? From that one question Mark Millar weaves an incredible alternative history where Superman ultimately becomes a supreme world leader.Many other well known characters appear as well, including a freedom fighting Batman that I would love to see more of. However it is of course Lex Luthor that is Superman's main nemesis as he devotes his life and neglects his wife, Lois Lane, to defeat Superman. Luthor's obsession with Superman is perfectly in character while remaining unique to an Elseworld, since his motives are somewhat pure.Ultimately Superman shows that whether raised in America or Russia he is good at heart and would prefer to help people instead of ruling them. The ending drags on a little, but since it is a one-off Elseworld I understand tying up every loose end. I gave this 4 stars since I think it could be a little better with such a rich premise, but I would still recommend this to anyone. If you love Superman, Elseworlds in general, or are just a fan of alternative histories, you should definitely read this."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"This is by far one of the best alternate universes ever written. Way better than others I've read, including Superman:Earth One. This is a \\"what if\\" scenario at it's best. What if Superman arrived just a little early and crashed in Russia instead of Kansis? Well he would have been raised with Communist values in mind and not baseball and apple pie. This Superman once his superpowers manifast themselves becomes the poster boy for Russia and enemy number one for America. Lex is sort of the good guy in this novel. Superman eventually takes power after Stalin is poisoned and spreads communism to the whole world, except the U.S. He has the best of attentions in mind. He just wants everyone to be safe, have food, etc, at the cost of free speech and thought. Batman makes a short but memorable appearance as well, along with Wonder-Woman and Hal Jordan. Can not recommend enough, I read within 2 hours I loved this so much!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"This book operates on a fascinating principle. What if Superman fell to earth a few hours earlier?It's an interesting book. There are no heroes in this book, only anti-villains. Superman is trying to do what he thinks is best, but he's using surveillance, brain washing, and lobotomisation to achieve that. Lex Luthor is fighting for truth, justice, and the American way, but he's still the supervillain we know and love. Wonder Woman gets sucked into Superman's way of thinking before being tossed aside; when she fights to end Superman's corrupt rule, it's not for the good of the people but to get revenge for him not loving her. The closest to a hero is Batman (and his sexy ushanka). He's still fighting against the people who killed his parents, but this version is much more willing to kill, even if he tries to minimise the damages. So he's a bit more anti-hero.The artwork is great, and the colours are true and vibrant. A lot of work was put in to determine how this brave new world would look. It's not just our world with a few more Soviet flags; it has a different design aesthetic. The best example would be in the Green Lantern Corps uniforms. The Red Son GLs don't look remotely like the DCU's GLs. The former have a far more militaristic look and feel.The story is well thought out, and there are shout outs made to earlier Superman stories. There's stuff in here for every Superman fan. The only problem is sometimes a lot of stuff happens on one page. Also, characters are very briefly referenced and never show up again. (An example is Ma Kent.) However, the latter is done to make Superman fans happy so it's acceptable. Whilst it's a serious story, it's obvious Millar is having fun with it and wants the fans to have fun too.Overall, it's a good book for fans of \\"What if\\" scenarios. Also, it's totally worth it just to see Batman in the ushanka."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"Though it is certainly not on the level of something like, say, Watchmen, this is still a decent book, and I found it entertaining enough. My chief criticism would be that while most of the story was very intriguing, the climax and resolution felt a bit contrived and ham-fisted. The resolution of Superman's struggle happened too suddenly, and though there was plenty of set-up, the story didn't seem to be setting up for the particular conclusion it reached. But apart from this somewhat clumsy ending, if you have a few bucks to spare and have bought all the other great graphic novel essentials (Watchmen, Batman: The Killing Joke, etc.), this story is still worth reading."},{"Title":"Superman: Red Son","review":"Like so many of the greatest works of the iron age of comics, Red Son is at its heart a dialectic (to use a classically Marxist term) between the merits of freedom on the one hand, of and the controlling hand of benevolent superpower on the other. As usual, this title comes down on the side of freedom with a heavy, resounding thud. But even if it is a little crude in hammering home its ultimate message, in all other aspects there are ample shades of gray.It's this capacity for moral complexity and ambiguity that made all the best iron age titles what they were, and this one is no exception. Red Son tells the tale of an alternate DC universe in which Superman's capsule lands not in Kansas, but in Stalin's Ukraine. And, simply put, just as the \\"regular\\" Superman stayed true to the mainstream ideology of the culture in which he was raised, so too this Superman grows up to be a committed communist.The fact that the story begins in a very specific mid-twentieth century world, with Stalin in the Kremlin and Eisenhower in the White House, is absolutely fundamental. For, much likeWatchmen, Red Son is a tale that inherently takes place within a definite social and political milieu. And, again as with Watchmen, this adds considerably to the depth and resonance of the work. All that said, it's important to stress that the other great thing about Red Son is that while the standard iron age themes do predominate, this story is not just another repackaging of Watchmen. Mark Millar, the writer of Red Son, most definitely takes his own path, and explores his chosen themes in his own way.A number of artists lent their talents to rendering the graphic side of this story: it was initially released as a series, with different artists working on different issues. While there are noticeable differences between their respective styles, all do an exceptional job, and there is also a cohesive, unifying vision holding the work together. This is particularly noticeable in the coloring, which is far more restrained and subdued, even brooding, than in most other offerings.A great many of the characters who form the pillars of the standard Superman cosmology - Lex Luthor, Jimmy Olsen, Louis Lane, a couple of Green Lanterns, Wonder Woman, and even Batman - show up in this tale, and all make memorable appearances. Yet in this alternate universe, in the absence of an American Superman they too are in varying degrees profoundly altered from the characters we are all familiar with.But the very fact that first and foremost it is Superman who is altered has profound implications for this tale on both logical and emotional levels. Unlike, say, Spider-Man or Batman, and indeed, unlike almost any other superhero, Superman commands a sheer magnitude of power that can inherently very easily skew the mortal world from its normal axis. At the same time, because the traditional Superman is so \\"plain vanilla\\", when Superman does stray from this expected purity, it has an immediate emotional impact that would be difficult to achieve with another hero.Overall, Red Son is a work that easily earns its five stars. If you have any interest at all in the superhero genre, the graphic novel medium, or - dare I say it? - just in Superman, this is not a title to miss.Theo."},{"Title":"A Scandalous Marriage (Harlequin Presents)","review":"On the back cover: \\"WANTED: ONE WIFE.

While they were at the old age home they try to get along with the old people but they are very grumpy.

They all learn that there is more to people then meets the eye.I enjoyed reading this book because I haven't read anything quite like it before. It has a good life-lesson that I think everyone should know and respect.

Earl, the boy who has been in trouble before is living with Steve and Steve's parents on a trial basis but wants to have a permanent home.

I can't really think of another book that I can compare it to but that is a good thing.

I was disappointed in my choice as soon I opened the package and saw how briefly each topic is covered.There are plenty of pictures and short biographies of the great hoteliers, which were about the most interesting parts of the book. Many other pictures showed typical workers smiling as they did their jobs, taken right out of the archives from the major hotels. Each chapter also had a summary and review questions section which takes up a good portion of the book. Other than things I had no interest in, such as pages of checklists on the steps to efficiently cleaning a hotel room and sample franchise agreements that used up more valuable pages, there was very little depth to any of it.It only glanced at the subject of the night audit and accounting functions, which is what I originally bought the book for, and it's coverage of PMS (Property Management Software) systems was limited to remarking that this is one of the biggest changes to happen in the past ten years. I wondered if the author had ever had any exposure to any of the popular PMS packages in use today, or even knew of any since he didn't list or provide references for further study on this subject. With a copyright date of February 2001 I assumed I would get the most up to date coverage but the few pictures and paragraphs of front desk automation were of ancient terminals circa 1985 or so and virtually nothing was mentioned of recent technology changes such as the Internet and online reservation systems now being integrated and handled in-house.This book is listed as 400 pages but is actually only a little over 300, which was a blessing in a way, since I couldn't wait to get through it and get started on more substantial book on the subject. I'm used to buying computer books with list prices in the range of this book's price tag, and expect to get a comprehensive guide to the subject when I do. I was disappointed with what I got for my money on this purchase though, and couldn't recommend it for anyone who doesn't have to buy it for a course they are taking in school. As a book to keep around just for knowledge, review and reference it is of little value to me.Joe Buchberger"},{"Title":"Hotel and Lodging Management: An Introduction","review":"This book proves to be very helpful for anyone interested in hotel management.

Folding a piece of paper to create something resurrects (as often as you like) the exciting sensation of opening a gift that is all for you. This book came into our house when I was ten years old and I spent many delightful hours entertaining myself poring over its pages. More than thirty years later, I asked my parents what had happened to the book, and they didn't know. I became obsessed with finding it because there was one model which I had not quite mastered-- \\"It's Magic!\\" But, my parents' copy of the book was gone. Happily, it can be found in very limited supply here and there online. If you can find a one, snatch it up. Harbin is the grandfather of origami written instruction in America. This book is his \\"piece de resistance\\", where he put everything together and set the bar for others to follow. Watch out for subtle errors which may cause confusion.

It provides a very rich diversity of models and covers a wide range of difficulty levels (although none are as hard as in some \\"enthusiast\\" books such as some by Montroll). Many of the models convey a sense of simple beauty. I had lost track of the book over the years, and was very pleased to recently discover that it was republished. I just bought another copy and folded a pigeon (but folding the head according to one of the other bird models since the suggested pigeon head is a little simplistic).

One of my favorite hosts taught Sumi-e and Origami. By the time I was five I could paint a decent horse and fold cranes, water-bombs, boats, and a bunch of others. I don't paint that well any more, and rarely get around to folding paper, but it was crafts and arts such as those that are the foundation of my being.And this lovely work has been my origami bible since I originally got it in hardback, lo these many years ago -- around 1971 or so. Some of the folds are brilliant, some exceedingly difficult to do well (no lack in the instructions -- there's Art in some of the details!) and some simple. The one I remember feeling accomplished with was Fred Rohm's \\"It's Magic\\" -- a rabbit standing on a cube, all out of one piece of paper. After many months, lots of paper, and failed attempts, I finally got adept at it -- and I still can't imagine how he figured it out!I forgot how to do this fold year's ago, but there are some examples of my attempts in private collections, and I get to visit once in a while. Maybe it's odd to be proud of a little bit of folded paper? Maybe. At one time I could manage \\"It's Magic\\" out of the liner paper from a pack of cigarettes -- that ends up at about an inch tall, when all's said and done.So anyway... last Christmas I had an extra passel of kids to gift, and decided to make the gifts more or less unified... and the one family with three youngin's and not much money got a bunch of origami papers and some books, peaking at the Dover Press edition of this wonderful collection.This may not be the best book to learn the essentials from, nor the most unified or complicated, or the greatest folds or largest scope, but it's dear to my heart, and I will always heartily recommend it in any collection."},{"Title":"Secrets of Origami: The Japanese Art of Paper Folding (Dover Origami Papercraft)","review":"I really like this book, but you need to have a little experience with origami to use it.

The writing is fluent and inspiring. Wasserman is clearly and undisputably a master craftsman of writing. Having paid my dues of admiration to the style and technique, I want to focus on the ideas that fill this book.The Maurizius Case deals with the conflict of Law vs. Justice &amp; Morality: Law, as a set of dry rules enforced by representatives of the State, leaves no room for mercy or compassion or sympathy for the defendent. Morality, as capturing the essense of Right and Wrong, Good and Bad, Justice and Injustice: Unyielding and harsh as the Law, but in a different sense: In the sense that our moral sensibilities should not rest until justice has been served, the innocent victims vindicated, the guilty metted punishment befitting and proportional to their crime and personal accountability. Until Good has been done.Law and Justice are not opposites, nor are they synonyms. Sometimes they intersect, and we are satisfied. Other times they do not, and we feel a disappointment that everything went correctly and yet the end result is far from good.Wasserman casts his characters into a predictable set of roles: A merciless, emotionally frozen Chief Prosecuter as harsh father. An intelligent, educated, rebelious and unhappy child as his son. The first represents Law, while the other -- Justice. The struggle between Law and Justice is thus super-imposed onto an adolescent rebelion against a father figure. The basic plot starts off as follows: A person was sentenced to life in prison for murder. The Father was the prosecutor in that case. The child believes in the innocence of the prisoner and sets out to clear his name. Quite a bit of the outcome of the story becomes predictable at this point, and trivialised. Schmaltzy, as some would say.I don't want to give away more details about the plot, and would like to turn back to the ideas behind the story.Rest assured that the conflict between Law and Justice is not resolved by the end of this book. Instead, exploiting the adolescent appeal as cheaply as he was able, Wasserman marches on into the Land of Oversimplification: Justice is cut off from what can be demonstrated, what can be shown, what can be brought into a court of law. Once the hero of this story decides that he's heard enough, that he understands the facts of the case, once he believes what he's told and that all is clear to him, he rushes back to confront his father.I find this book nothing less than moral corruption. It is corruption in the sense that Socrates never deserved to be executed for:- The book encourages a simplistic, superficial and over-emotional attitude towards justice in a way that is guarenteed (albeit in other settings) to cause great injustice. Cultivating a sense of Justice that is above demonstration in a court of law, that is based on a leap of faith, that is eschatological in nature, is cultivating injustice.- The book is in fact anti-intellectual. This is a difficult claim to make, since the book encourages (and indeed relishes over) a kind of fanciful salon-intellectualism where polyglots, historians, and poets use their erudition to entertain, impress, and manipulate others while inflating their already tremendous egos. It is the level headed application of intelligence towards social order that the author scorns. Social good will not come as a result of the ideas in this book.- The book is loaded with racial theory. The author being Jewish, this racial nonsense put in the mouth of a Jewish character in the book is simply sickening. Even though this character ultimately turns out to be a villain, the specific way and context in which psychological phenomena are attributed to racial differences causes me to think that the author is not unsympathetic to these views. It's sad that Wasserman (who passed away in 1934) didn't live long enough to see these ideas through to fruition.As I wrote before, the book is very well written. The ideas it expresses are sick. The book reeks from decadence and nihilism. Read it at your own risk."},{"Title":"Schaum's outline of theory and problems of thermodynamics","review":"The Schaum Outline Series has stood the test of time and Thermodynamics by Abbott and Van Ness is no exception. If you want to learn thermo beyond the typical undergraduate level, progressively working through the problems chapter-by-chapter in this book will do the trick.Although this book does follow the old sign convention for work (positive when the system does work on the environment), it properly follows the specific energy convention of \\"energy/mass\\". Thus, the ideal gas equation is PV = RT, where V has units of \\"volume/mass\\". Once this simple terminology is understood, steam tables can be readily used without confusion."},{"Title":"Schaum's outline of theory and problems of thermodynamics","review":"This outline, like that of Clyde R. Metz (Physical Chemistry) is defective in its presentation of the very first fundamental quantities of thermodynamics, Enthalpy (H) and Internal Energy (U). I find it hard to believe that the authors of these supplements can't seem to understand that (1) PV has units of ENERGY, *not* units of energy/mol*K, (2) H and U (and their associated changes) would PERFORCE have to have units of energy also, since H = U + PV, and (3) using \\"molar volume\\" without explicitly defining it as V/n while using the SAME symbol as \\"ordinary\\" volume without telling the reader is nothing more than pedagogical carelessnes...or possibly stupidity. Abbot and Van Ness aren't doing anyone any favors by doing silly things like blithely declaring the Ideal Gas Law to be PV = RT, which automatically gives the student pause wondering if it's a typo. Having foolishly bought both Metz' \\"Physical Chemistry\\" and Abbot & Van Ness' \\"Thermodynamics With Chemical Applications\\", I'm here to warn anyone else contemplating similar purchases: DON'T DO IT, UNLESS YOU LIKE BEING CONFUSED. These authors are apparently too \\"advanced\\" and \\"learned\\" to bother with such petty details of presentation, and unless you learned your elementary thermo on some other planet where they don't use n (or always use molar quantities,) you're going to be scratching your head wondering where n went, or where n suddenly came from in their example problems.

He has finished the last of four volumes of his systematic theology. Like the first three of the series the layout of the book is the same. At the end of almost every chapter he gives you quotes from the eary church and the medevil church and the reformation. Also it's very apologetic. In this last volume he gives his view about the church and the end times. Dr. Geisler is a dispensationist. He is pre- trib and pre-Mill in his view of the end times. He also talks about church govt and the gifts of the spirit and touches on the issue of tongues. This book is great from the dispensational view point and I give it 5 stars and a book I would recommend. Having said all that, he made some errors. I hope that Dr. Geisler will correct the errors because it is misrepresentation at best and have his chapter on the tribulation redone. In that chapter he talks about preterism. He mention 4 people and rightly explains the different camps in preterism. The problem is ( I don't know this happen being a book by Geisler) he misrepresent two preterist. He makes mention that Full pretersim is a hersey and rightly so. Partial preterism is okay in the Church. He puts Gary Demar and R.C. Sproul in this camp. Which is where they belong. He goes on to mention two more guys and put them in the full preterism camp. Anorld Chilton and Kenneth Gentry. This is errror and make Dr. Geisler look bad. He already misrepresents Calvinism. Now going on to misrepresent Preterism.Arnold Chilton was a partial preterist all his life until a heart attack then change his position to a full position after that. A Few months later he died. From my understanding he didn't write a book from this position. Dr. Gentry is a partial preterist and the best advocator for this position today. He was the one to influnce R.C. Sproul to this very position. Dr. Gentry already wrote to the pub to have this change and to forward this to DR. Geisler and I hope that Gielser changes in the next edition.Good work except for the errors."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology, Vol. 4: Church/Last Things","review":"This is volume four of Geisler's systematic theology, and it deals with the doctrines of the church and of the last days. Geisler is a dispensational premmillenialist, so he believes that the church was a mystery to the Old Testament saints and was not revealed until the New Testament and was brought forth in Acts chapter two. He believes that the age of the apostles died out when the last of the original 12 apostles died out. He forcefully rejects opposing viewpoints (especially Catholic and Lutheran perspectives) and his dogmatic opinions are occasionally abrasive and irritating.He believes that the miraculous gifts of the Holy Spirit also ceased when the apostolic age ceased.Geisler also teaches that the souls of believers go immediately to heaven upon the death of the body, and that the souls of unbelievers to perdition.He also believes in the bodily resurrection of Christ and aggressively attacks the slightly modified viewpoints of Murray Harris and Wayne Grudem.As far as the end times, Geisler believes that the rapture of the saints to heaven to be with Christ could occur at any time. He believes in a literal approach to the book of Revelation and in the future establishment of the millenial kingdom of Christ on earth.Geisler's book is easy to read and is loaded with scripture. Sometimes his argumentation is bad. For example, in arguing for the necessity of hell, Geisler contends that it is more compassionate for God to create people and allow them to choose eternal hell than for him to not create the person at all. he says that it is better that God loved and lost some than to not have loved them at all. Some of his other arguments for hell seem similarly twisted.it is true that God created some people who will end up eternally separated from God in the lake of fire, but it is hard to argue that this is somehow indicative of God's compassion.Otherwise, the bulk of this book is very helpful. 4 stars."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology, Vol. 4: Church/Last Things","review":"Norman Geisler is a famed apologist and theologian. This is the fourth volume of a four-volume series, the other volumes of which areSystematic Theology, Vol. 1: Introduction/Bible,Systematic Theology, Vol. 2, God/Creation, andSystematic Theology, Vol. 3: Sin/Salvation.He argues, \\"...even if Peter were the rock referred to by Jesus, he would not be the ONLY rock in the church's foundation. Again, Jesus gave all the apostles the same power to \`bind' and \`loose'... ALL the apostles (not just Peter) are the church's foundation.\\" (Pg. 77) He then concludes, \\"Hence, there is no one visible church: There are many visible churches---with one invisible Head, Christ---that are to be based on the teachings of His infallible Word.\\" (Pg. 101) He further argues, \\"Human depravity calls for the existence of independent, self-governing churches.\\" (Pg. 127)Concerning the Eucharist/Lord's Supper, he observes, \\"the early Fathers had only a fallible interpretation of the infallible Word. They could be and often were wrong, and there is no reason any of them could not have been wrong on this issue (the Eucharist).\\" (Pg. 157) On baptism, he suggests, \\"Those who confess Christ are to be baptized, and the New Testament mode seems to have been immersion. Other modes were later and exceptional rather than original and primary.\\" (Pg. 185) About spiritual gifts, he asserts, \\"The general phenomena of tongue-speaking today is not a real language but a spiritual gibberish.\\" (Pg. 195) Interestingly, he suggests, \\"The miraculous GIFT of healing has ceased, the temporary gift used to establish the church's foundation. Again, this does not mean the FACT of miracles has ceased; God can perform a miracle anytime he chooses.\\" (Pg. 197)He wonders, \\"Will those who die in infancy remain babies in Heaven? Probably not. Heaven is a place of maturity and perfection, and babies stunted in their growth, short of maturity, would not reflect a state of perfection. It seems to better befit God's nature and plan for those who were not granted earthly maturity to attain it in heaven.\\" (Pg. 309) About eternal punishment, he suggests, \\"The Bible reveals (different) degrees ... (Matt 5:22; Rev. 20:12-14). Because 'degrees of annihilation' is implausible---non-existence would be the same for everyone---annihilation is irrational.\\" (Pg. 410)On eschatology, he supports \\"dispensational premillennialism.\\" (Pg. 551) But he admits, \\"one could say that the literal hermeneutic (which yields premillennialism) is a hermeneutical fundamental, though not a doctrinal fundamental. This may be why premillenialists are less likely to slip into liberalism...\\" (Pg. 553) He also adds, \\"Posttribulationists have a veritable logjam of events at Christ's second coming, at the end of the tribulation.\\" (Pg. 620)Geisler's series is one of most important recent contributions to evangelical theology."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology, Vol. 4: Church/Last Things","review":"Reading through the series, one sees it narrow from the broad to particular. In the first two volumes, Mr. Geisler teaches standard Christian theology using his excellent format. In the third volume, Sin and Salvation, the view narrows to Protestantism and tackles predestination/ sovereignty vs free will, although few dogmatic Arminians or Calvinists will agree with his arguments.This series proposed to explain \\"evangelical theology.\\" While true in volumes 1-3, it is hardly true in Vol 4. Considering that a large percentage, if not a strong majority, of evangelicals are not dispensational congregational cessationists he continues to use the term \\"evangelical\\" while advocating those specific positions.One key to understanding Vol 4 is that he refers to Dallas Theological Seminary as \\"moderately dispensationalist.\\" Geisler is dogmatically dispensationalist. Geisler's exposition of dispensationalism is among the best and clearest, if not the most convincing.Dispensationalism is more than just a set of end-time beliefs; it is a framework for biblical interpretion that leads to a particular eschatology. However, due to dispensationalism being relatively new and limited insofar as historical support, his arguments are less polished, less thorough, and far less convincing than previously. It becomes clear that heretofore, Geisler has leaned heavily on others' work. I find nothing wrong with that - it is the presentation, organization, and summation of 2000+ years' work that made the first 3 volumes such treasures. But here, he quotes authorities who clearly did not support a position. Positively, he caveats the extracts with the understanding that the authority opposed or did not support the general point he is arguing, but that the quote is a concession to the point Geisler is making.However, this leads to a point that really bothered me. In defending dispensational premillenarianim on page 567, he argues that DP's view of an impending Millenium fueled the great missionary movements. He particularly mentions (without caveat) John Wesley among a list of otherwise DP evangelists and, by insinuation, the Great Awakening.Finally, the topics do not flow and the overall impression is that this was a grab bag of miscellaneous beliefs he wished to argue.Stripping out the DP veneer I found valuable material. Geisler's views of death, heaven, hell, and the new earth illustrate an active, dynamic hereafter. He rejects the unbibilical, Platonic concepts that dominate eschatological imagery. This was the first I had seen these important beliefs given more than lip service and led me to further research. Because of this, I felt the book was edifying and satisfying.This is important! Seekers ask all the time, \\"what happens when I die?\\" \\"What happened to my loved one?\\" Most evangelizing Christians really don't know these answers. A fuller treatment is in the excellent book by Randy Alcorn, titled \\"Heaven.\\"Overall, an excellent book that explains a popular, but narrow portion of evangelical Christian theology."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology, Vol. 4: Church/Last Things","review":"Prompt shipping.

Additionally, even if you do not have time to read the book, you should still own it as a peer-reviewed and conservative resource material.

To this book's credit, it is academically rigorous.It acknowledges that African-American males are (mis)perceived as hypercriminal.

It becomes clear that creativity is not always appreciated until sometime after the idea itself. Mendel and Copernicus were never classed as creative until after their death. The artist van Gogh was not considered creative until others deemed him to be so. To me, one of the most fascinating chapters is the link between creative genius and socially labelled 'madness'. There appears to be a link between eccentricity, psychiatric disorders and moments of brilliance. Does the brain need some 'disorganisation' before it reorganises the data in a different and unique way to create a genius idea? This and many aspects of creativty are discussed. Whether you are a student of intelligence and thinking, or whether you are curious as to why you or others think differently, then you will throughly enjoy this book by a very clever author who got a PhD in Renaissance English literature before becoming a psychiatrist. That blend of background alone should alert you to a fascinating read. You will learn that intelligence does not make you creative. As a bonus, she even gives you a chapter on how to think creatively yourself. I'd love to have a long lunch with Dr Andreasen."},{"Title":"Creative Brain the Science of Genius","review":"The objective of this review is to critique and summarize this book for educational purposes: I am taking Introductory Neuroscience at the Georgia Institute of Technology and was assigned to find a book with a topic of interest that pertains to the science of the brain, read it, and summarize my thoughts on it. The topic of creativity is of extreme interest to me and would rather be creative than \\"book-smart.\\" Overall, the book was easy to read and interesting, although I did find it to be a very surface level introduction into the science of creativity.The Creative Brain begins with an introduction to what creativity is and is measured in terms of originality, utility (how useful the creation is), and its final product. Author Nancy Andreasen colorfully describes many instances of creative thinking at work, from the moment a person obtained a stone and realized its potential use as a tool, to the creation of beautiful and awe-inspiring masterpieces of artists. What separates these people from others that give them extraordinary creativity that only a handful of individuals possess? According to the author creativity is found and further enriched in terms of nature and nurture. One possible example of \\"hereditary\\" creativity is the Huxley family. Thomas Henry Huxley was a notable English biologist. His grandson Julian Huxley was an anthropologist who worked on the theory of evolution. Andrew Huxley was a distinguished physiologist who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work on neural impulses and muscle contraction. Aldous Huxley was a novelist who famously wrote Brave New World in 1932. One possible example of nurtures influence on creativity is, as the author describes, the cradle of creativity. The cradle of creativity explains why there exists certain periods of time when creative contributions occur in clusters and then disappear for years after: a nurturing environment, rich in artistic or scientific thinking, are conducive to producing creative outcomes. One such example is the late nineteenth and early twentieth century in the U.S. Inventions like the cotton gin, telegraph, telephone, light bulb, assembly line, and airplane all occurred within a relatively short period of time. Ultimately though, creativity is a product of nature AND nurture, genetics AND environment. An example of this was Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo Buonarroti. These two artists were raised in households with no exposure to art but both displayed a unique ability towards art (nature). Eventually, both were taught and reared by artistic masters who helped these young artists cultivate and train their artistic abilities (nurture). The book also discusses the relationship that exists between creative genius and mental illness. Because creative people view the world with an unbiased point of view they are able to make connections that are otherwise non-existent in normal people. But this same unbiased point of view can sometimes be vulnerable to connections that are dangerous or incorrect. Take mathematic genius John Nash who displayed schizotypal behavior at the age of thirty. He has been quoted saying \\"the ideas that I have about supernatural beings came to me the same way that my mathematical ideas did, so I took them seriously.\\"The book gives many examples of different types of creativity and is well organized in thought and structure. Because of her background knowledge in fine arts she offers a lot of knowledge on creative artists. The language used by the author is very easy to understand and it is obvious that she is very passionate about her studies in creativity because it makes the book that much more interesting to read. Most of the studies cited in this book are anecdotal because of the subjective ways creativity can be measured. Andreasen herself has conducted her own studies of creativity through the Iowa Writer's Workshop Study. One of the aspects of the book I found to be less interesting was the last chapter which describes what can be done to increase creativity in adults and infants. For adults, it described mental exercises like learning new things and meditation (that's right, meditation!). For children, it had recommendations like limiting the time available to watch television, interactive reading, and emphasizing diversity and curiosity in the young mind. It was written as if these were the steps that would guarantee a more creative individual. It was particularly obnoxious to learn the tips for increasing an infants' creativity levels because it reminded me of the movie \\"Nanny Diaries\\" where a baby-sitter works for a rich family that insists French culture, organic food and museum visits are necessary to raise their young son. Whatever happened to the traditional ideas of childhood like climbing trees, playing with your Sega Genesis game console, and eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches? Ultimately, the last chapter read to me like a self-help/new age themed pamphlet whose objective is to create baby geniuses in five simple steps (!).Overall, the book was a very interesting read and I would recommend it for people new to the arena of neuroscience and creative thinking. One of my favorite quotes from the book is that:\\"A child who reads a book about Robin Hood or Harry Potter is learning to visualize and imagine for herself... once shown to her on film... instead of the many Harrys occurring in the minds of children, there is now one \\"standard Harry\\" that will passively adopt rather than create on their own. As Darwin has pointed out, evolution thrives on variation.\\"The author has a colorful way of describing situations throughout the book that make the actual task of reading it, fly by."},{"Title":"Creative Brain the Science of Genius","review":"\\"The Creative Brain: The Science of Genius\\", by Nancy Andreasen, Plume Book, NY 2006.

The author is an MD, who has a PhD in English Renaissance Literature. Despite the complex nature of the topic, straddling arts and science, the book was an effortless, breezy read but I had to go back and reread my marked/highlighted lines and pages, to commit them to some alcove in my brain.So, what did I gain from reading this book? Some insights, such as:* \\"...most creative people are smart but don't have to be extremely smart. An IQ around 120 is good enough...except for scientists.\\"* \\"Personality traits that define the creative individual include openness to experience, adventuresomeness, rebelliousness, individualism, sensitivity, playfulness, persistence, curiosity and simplicity.\\"* The key components of the creative people: 1. Slip into a state of intense concentration and focus. 2. The muse sits on my shoulder. 3. Prone to have a wandering mind, flooded with ideas and thoughts and a tendency not to censor them. 4. Disengaged, dispassionate observers, and seem aloof, detached and even coldhearted, at times.* \\"During the creative process the brain begins by disorganizing, making links between shadowy forms of objects or symbols or words or remembered experiences that have not been previously linked. Out of this disorganization, self-organization eventually emerges and takes over in the brain.\\" (Shades of Chaos Theory!).* How the brain's self-organization process, when done right can lead to a new idea or creativity.

While the beginning chapters of this book are quite interesting, by the later ones Dr. Andreason dispenses with the empiracle approach and instead she commences a less-satisfying portion of the book that is all anecdotal.In the past few months I have read a lot of material on the brain, from the writings of Roger Sperry (Noble prize 1981), to \\"Inside The Brain\\" (mostly about brain damage) and \\"On Intelligence\\" by Jeff Hawkins. (Best one in my opinion).In the interest of full disclosure, I worked on the psychiatric unit on 2JPE where Dr. Andreason conducted her studies of unmedicated schizophrenics. She is indeed talented but I felt sad for her after I finished this brief book. There really is not yet enough evidence to support her thesis. For that reason, I found the latter two thirds of this book to be disappointing. She did attempt some interesting studies of the writers at the Iowa Writer's Workshop but those studies--apparently, from this book--did not really gell into firm conclusions. Surely, she found some linkages between creative people and the incidence of mental illness but I do not find them conclusive.

The presentation is not anecdotal or interesting though she does choose interesting people to profile like John Nash and August Kekule. She misses an opportunity to delve into the bipolar aspects of creativity and to identify bipolarity as a characteristic of many richly creative people. Overall this is a disappointing and poor read."},{"Title":"Creative Brain the Science of Genius","review":"Andreasen offers a great sourcebook introducing the history of research concerned with the nature and nurturing of creativity and genius. Written in clearly accessible language for the average reader, this volume explores what is known (and currently knowable ?) about famous artists, musicians and scientists, the possible environmental circumstances facilitating their creative genius, and the putative neurological brain developments which supported their creative behaviours. Perhaps a little disappointing in its inability to truly reveal the underlying neural basis of creativity, the book is nonetheless valuable for its concluding chapter's inclusion of several 'mental exercises for adults', and the even better section concerned with 'tips for teaching tots', with a view to parents and teachers enhancing the individual creativity of very young children.The early historical reviews and landmarking of the key writings concerned with hereditary genius was welcome (and well referenced for those unfamiliar with this literature), but surprisingly, does not greatly extend Galton's claims and conclusions of 100+ years ago to become within easy reach of a new and detailed understanding of the neural basis of creative genius. The author's own 'clinical' research contribution to the empirical parts of the thesis presented in this book would appear to be largely confined to her finding of a significant correlation to exist between creativity and instances of hereditary mental illness, and in particular, with both personal and familial mood disorders. That experience itself, plus proactive sensory and motor opportunity combined with the autoregulatory cognitive processing that supports determination of the significance of objects, event and experiences gives rise to changes in brain structure (and thus the potential development of individual brains capable of increasing levels of creativity), is an important omission and left to the reader to work out for him/herself.More transparent perhaps are the listed correlate personal characteristics and lifestyle opportunity choices found common to many an acknowledged creative genius. Plotted biographical information as available from previous accounts (although often anecdotal), have afforded Andreasen to compile a useful, if non-exhaustive, typical creative personality profile, and some correlate environmental opportunities and circumstances often seen to support its expression. Many readers will undoubtedly enjoy identifying the existence of their own genius potential as determinable by their possession of certain identifiable personality-trait indicators, the most significant of which appear to include clearly abnormal social lives, sustained attention to differential detail, prolonged and self-motivated concentration, good working memory, which, together with a wealthy patron/funding body (if not poverty) and the ability to work alone for protracted periods of time with little/no sleep may well help you towards your first novel product or discovery !The author's attempts to outline the neural basis of creativity and genius begins with a great primer on neuro-anatomy (Ch.3), but unfortunately is not extended to describe what she believes 'the creative brain 'to look like (in contrast to those of less creative people, which the current reviewers predict will show quite different patterns of neural connectivity, plasticity potential, and network density distributions). A further irritation is seen with Andreasen's allowing the language of early stimulus reception to become confused with the language of experiential perception (and other conceptualisations of cognitive processing), when describing neural circuit activity transmission pathways. A similar effect occurs again in the later functional neurobiological section when returning to discuss 'building better brains' (Ch. 6). For example, we read that in certain parts of the cerebral cortex \\"the sounds and words are connected to their associated memories and given meaning\\", and again later that \\"Because the eye was unable to see, the visual cortex did not grow properly\\". Although perhaps wishing to avoid the more technically-correct vocabulary and conceptual conciseness of modern cognitive neuroscience, the choice of relatively colloquial language employed here may serve to confuse rather than elucidate the functional brain mechanisms underlying an especially less well defined behaviour such as creativity. The very few extant neurological imaging data studies discussed here showing clear brain-structure differences with expertise will be familiar to many readers (London taxi-drivers are possessed of enlarged hippocampi with increasing experience and use of memory related to spatial-awareness, and male professional orchestral musicians showing increased grey matter in their Broca's area), but the specific way(s) in which the brains of creative genii differ from those less profligate in their output, remains elusive, both in terms of gross descriptive functional detail and developmental ontology. We would at least expect to have found Andreasen's predictions with respect to the kinds of brain connections and pathway developments that might conceivably result from exposure to particular learning strategy experiments, perceptual affordances, personal interpretive experiences, and/or environmental exploration opportunities as may correlate with creativity and giftedness (if not genius).Still wishing to recommend this book, we applaud the section in the final chapter concerned with providing a selection of helpful tips and environmental enrichment ideas for fostering the increased likelihood of a given child attaining (if not actually demonstrating) enhanced creative talent, as may be expressed in any number of significant ways. To list a few as based upon the personality profiles and associated environmental opportunities available to the historical geniuses previously discussed in the earlier chapters, such simple tips include, for example, not stifling curiosity (otherwise highly correlated with creativity), engaging collaboratively with your child in investigatory projects, visibly modeling (as a parent) the activities of reading and engaging in homework-like behaviors within the home, and using 'direct observation' of nature (rather than relying solely on book and video/TV-based reference materials) for fact-finding missions.Indeed, these and many other attributes of the life histories of the creative geniuses of past eras have much to exemplify for us all, as role models, the potential significance of life-style choices and our sensitivity to observable/discoverable environmental opportunities that may result in the development of the kinds of brains likely to support each our own enhanced creativity. This is all the more interesting given that we currently remain largely in the dark with regards the way(s) in which the specific brain structures required to support extraordinary creativity can, and do, develop and change their structure within the span of an individual human lifetime.Dr. Tony Dickinson & Claire KanAcademic Research Laboratory, Global Choice Psychometric, HK."},{"Title":"Creative Brain the Science of Genius","review":"Neuroplasticity is a rather new concept, formerly a taboo in the neuroscience realm, which has caused a lot of excitement. The idea that the brain is not hardwired and can adapt it self has many exciting implications. As the brain is the central command center for our body it takes the credit for many of our qualities good or bad. As children grow up, in early years of childhood it is not uncommon for relatives or parents to use the term \\"smart\\" to describe them. This may be as a result of putting together a house from Lego's or putting a puzzle together. The ability to see something that does not exist yet but has the potential of being created is called creativity. Where does this so called \\"creativity\\" come from? Are we born with it, in other words is it a part of our \\"Nature\\"? Or is it routed in our upbringing or in other words our \\"Nurture\\"? Are there ways of enhancing our creativity or is it dictated to us by our genes? How can we find out?This book offers an extensive investigation into the rout of creativity. Primarily a method of study is chosen in which a group of highly creative people are compared with a group of ordinary people. The study compares different aspects of the people's lives in order to find the rout of creativity. Other case studies on famous people through out history who have contributed masterpieces as a result of their creativity have been preformed. These include Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Peter Tchaikovsky, Henri Poincare, Friedrich Kekule, Stephen Spender, etc. Another subject that the book covers is the relationship between genius and insanity. There are many cases of genius individuals who have had great contributions but they have developed some mental illness such as schizophrenia. One of such is John Nash the great mathematician and Nobel Prize receiver. He developed schitzotypal traits early in life and developed a psychosis at age thirty. His son also suffers from schizophrenia. Other examples of this nature are presented in the book. In search of finding a definitive relationship between genius and insanity the book reviews studies that have been preformed which address this issue. One of these studies by Havelock Ellis is \\"A Study of British Genius\\" in which a statistical approach has been taken towards the issue of genius and insanity. Finally in the last chapter the book delves into neuroplasticity and after giving a brief description of it, the book explores the relationship between plasticity and development of the creative brain. Finally the book explains how mental exercises can take advantage of the plasticity of the brain. Especially in adults as the age increases the brains sharpness tends to dull. The mental exercises explained in the book help to fight off this phenomenon.One of the more interesting sections of the book for me was the description of the creative process. The book presents a brief description of the creative process by famous people who have great creative contributions, in their own words. On of such is one of the most famous descriptions of the creative process written by the nineteenth-century Romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Kubla Khan: Or, A vision in a dream which is considered his finest piece. In the following Coleridge explains how he came to write this piece:\\"The Author continued for about three hours in a profound sleep, at least of the external sense, during which time he has the most vivid confidence, that he could not have composed less than from 200-300 lines; if that indeed can be called composition in which all the images rose up before him as things, with a parallel production of the correspondent expressions, with out any sensation or consciousness of effort.\\"As Coleridge awakes from this dream he manages to write 54 lines semi-automatically but then is disturbed by a task he must perform as a result of a phone call. On the returning he can not capture the other 200-300 lines he wrote in his dream.Nancy C. Andreasen, M.D. and PhD in English Renaissance literature is the chair of psychiatry at the University of Iowa. In this book she takes on the issue of \\"Creativity\\" in many different aspects. Through statistical studies she compares personality traits of extraordinarily creative people. Also through these case studies she delves into finding the rout of creativity and its relationship with insanity. The book reviews studies that aim at isolating \\"Nurture\\" and \\"Nature\\" in order to present a well defined explanation. From a sociological prospect she concludes that with out \\"Nurture\\" many creative minds might not have the opportunity to flourish. She well defines properties of an environment fertile for creativity. Indeed Dr. Andreasen's opening line for her book \\"To the lost Geniuses of the past, in the hope that this book will help more thrive in the future\\" has been fulfilled!"},{"Title":"Creative Brain the Science of Genius","review":"This book was a boring reading. It didn't stand the author's distinguished career nor as a good science writing. It may help to educate very novices on brain science as a whole. But it failed to give a solid answer to its main premise - where does the creativity lie in brain's multivaried structure. This book though gives some very important examples from extremely creative people's experiences, \\"moments of epiphanies\\". It mentions what Mozart, Poincare or similar person's description of their individual feelings when they were on the verge of some creative thought. On the whole this books failed to explain how and why geniuses are geniuses, but has not forgotten to mention that the author herself was a genius (at least twice in the book). Better books are by Edelman, Koch and Crick's books on conciousness."},{"Title":"Creative Brain the Science of Genius","review":"I think the author's intention in this book was to use pieces from English literature as case studies in her explanations about creativity. However, these cases dominate the book to an extent that discussions about psychological and neuroscientific explanations of creativity become less important. The book deviates from its promised topic.I offer the following recommendations to the author to improve this book:1) Do not use only English literature pieces as case studies for creativity. Scientists, engineers, philosophers, architects, craftsman etc. can also be creative. Try to enrich the book by using examples from different fields. You might be an ex-professor of English literature but not all of your readers are students of English literature (I bet most of them are not).2) Creativity is not limited to the Western world. You only refer to artists, authors, poets etc. from Europe and North America, who have lived since the Renaissance. Try to read and learn about Chinese or Arabic poetry for example. Your narrow perception of creativity without any cultural variations becomes quite boring in this book.3) It is not necessary to distinguish ordinary creativity from extra ordinary creativity when we are talking about the nature of creativity. Your criteria for making this distinction are quite subjective. There might be a genius cook (an example given for ordinary creativity in the book) whose creativity can be as extraordinary as Einstein's creativity. You seem to make this distinction based on the product. I do not agree that product is an essential element in creativity (unlike what the book claims). Idea generation, by itself, is a creative process which may or may not end up with the production of a tangible element.4) The idea of learning something novel just for the sake of having a mind exercise is horrible.

Secret Service agent, Spur McCoy, is on his way to break up a counterfeiting operation in Durango, Colorado. On his way, he finds Valerie Bainbridge, shot and covering her dead husband's body near their burned down home. Spur nurses her back to health while teaching her how to shoot and track. Valerie is determined to kill the men who shot her husband and raped her.A very exciting adult western book with explicit violence and sex. Fans of Buckskin, Longarm and Slocum adult western series will enjoy this book too."},{"Title":"Rocky Mountain Vamp (Spur)","review":"What a surprise this novel was! I had not known about this series when I came across it in a bookstore.This is #1 in the series that started in 1983 and was reprinted in June 2003. I have been a long time fan of the Longarm,LoneStar and Trailsman series,so I thought I would give this one a try. I found it a great,action-packed read;much along the lines of these other series.I don't know if there is really an author by the name of Dirk Fletcher, or if several writers write under this name. I'll have to do some digging. Looks like the series has been continuing since 1983 so there are a lot of episodes. I'm not surprised that this one is still 'on the go' as it has all the elements of a great weatern yarn.The artwork is also real good and representive of the characters in the story..which is also a big plus with me.Each of the main characters in these long running series have similarities as well as differences. Spur McCoy grew up in New York City,the son of a well-known merchant,graduated from Harvard in 1959.Voluntered for the army in 1861 and was a Captain when the war was over.After the war, he worked in Washinton for Senator Walton of New York.In 1865 the Secret Service Act was passed and Charles Spur McCoy was appointed one of the first U.S. Secret Service agents.He was transferred to the office in St.Louis where he handled all agency work west of the Mississippi.He was chosen for the posting because he was the only agent who could ride a horse and had won the service markmanship contest.Skills that would be invaluable in the days ahead.This first assignment has Spur heading to Durango,Colorado in pursuit of counterfeiters. The storyline is very good and we meet up with some real interesting Old West characters.Along the way, Spur comes across a settler's wife ,whose husband has been murdered before her eyes,and she has been left for dead by Rawhides. Little did they expect what would follow from this determined lady!A great read, and I plan to read some more episodes in this long-running series."},{"Title":"Help Your Dog Fight Cancer: An Overview Of Home Care Options","review":"We got this book when our dog was recently diagnosed with Lymphoma. This really is a great book and I highly recommend to anyone having to go through this tough journey. I only give it 4 stars though because you really need to take everything she says with a grain of salt and NEVER do anything without discussing with your vet first. Some of the things she talks about, my vet(s) did not agree with. We got three opinions on our dogs condition and all the vets did not agree with everything she said. BUT, this is a great book to educate yourself and it gave us a great starting point on asking intelligent questions of our vet(s) and what to expect."},{"Title":"Help Your Dog Fight Cancer: An Overview Of Home Care Options","review":"This book arms you with the information you need to know in order to be able to help your dog fight cancer.

We could immediately exptrapolate her information to our situation."},{"Title":"Help Your Dog Fight Cancer: An Overview Of Home Care Options","review":"I lost my Siberian Husky a little over a year ago to a very aggressive form of cancer.. I found out less than 10 days before she passed away. Needless to say, it started me on a crusade to find out ways to treat cancer and prevent cancer, both in dogs and in humans. I found out that 1 out of every 2 huskies will get cancer in their lifetime.. !!!! I now have another husky, Bandit, who is 2 years old. I give him one GNC Shark Liver Oil pill a day to help prevent cancer.. the same works for people as well. If you do some research, you will find that Shark Liver Oil is used in several high-end dog supplements, and that is why.. My aunt had breast cancer several years ago and was given less than 5 months to live. My dad sent her a full box of shark liver oil.. she took about 4 -5 pills a day for a year.. that's right, not only did she survive, but the doctors couldn't find any more cancer in her body! She is not in remission, she is now cancer-free!I know it sounds incredible, but God has put many things on this earth to cure illnesses, it is up to us to find them.. Another natural remedy I have found works is Cat's Claw (Una de Gato), Esiak Tea, Graviola (esp. for Prostate, Lung & Colon Cancer), Turmeric (another great preventative, take 2 pills daily), and IP6 (Inositol Hexaphosphate).. IP6 is very powerful.. It kills (yes, kills) cancer cells when combined with calcium and magnesium. The only brand I trust is Jarrow formulas.. It's about $12. Take 2 pills (or 1 if you are giving to your dog) first thing in the morning, at least 3 hours before you take any other pills. IP6 is extracted from Rice Bran grown in Japan. All of the natural remedies described above can be given to dogs, either as a preventative or treatment for cancer. Simply cut the dose in half (in porportion to their weight) as a preventative, or give the full human dose, if you are using it as treatment. I like VitaCost for ordering these, also local health food stores are good. Now brand, Thompson Nutritionals are my fave brands. For the Esiak Tea, only get \\"Flor-Essence\\" by Flora.. it is somewhat pricy, but it has been shown to effectively treat cancer.Good luck and God Bless!!

This book answered my questions and helped put my mind at ease, and we went on to treat my dog for her cancer. She lived another year and a half to age 13 (she died from an unrelated illness). She had a high quality of life, even while being treated for her cancer (her treatment was primarily oral chemo - yes, just pills! I put them in Pill Pockets and she thought she was getting extra treats!!), up until the last couple of weeks. I am indebted to Laurie - thank you for writing this book and giving us more time with our beloved Sheena. Her efforts in this book and The Magic Bullet Fund are nothing short of extraordinary.

Laurie's advice helped us implement the homemade diet all of our dog's veterinarians had recommended (a high protein, low carb diet is highly recommended by both holistic and allopathic (traditional) veterinarians for canine cancer patients -- as a side note, Laurie recommends Hill's N/D, which is a prescrpition food formulated for cancer patients. I prefer a similar grain-free, high protein/low carb food called \\"Innova Evo,\\" which is made by Natura Pet -- the nutritional content and price are almost the same as N/D, but Innova's ingredients are more natural/higher quality, in my opinion. This is a brand new food that wasn't on the market when this book was published. website: www.naturapet.com). Perhaps most importantly, this book gives us caregivers hope and a real sense of being able to help our canine friends through this ordeal.

However we did use a lot...like changing Cody's (sweetest Golden Retriever in the history of Golden Retriever's) diet to something more organic..gave him yogurt which he loved..chicken..and filtered water. But after the first chemo treatment caused such unusual discomfort and stress in him, we decided to forgo any further treatments and let him go naturally. He did very well for about 8 weeks after the chemo stopped but when we found one morning he could not get up..then we knew it was time. He could still eat voraciously and drink like there was no tomorrow and as aware as ever...but he couldn't get up. It was a sad goodbye....very very sad. Sorry..anytime I have a chance to talk or write about Cody, I go off. It is very helpful to me.

I wish the book was much more visible: It should be on the suggested reading list for every new dog owner."},{"Title":"Help Your Dog Fight Cancer: An Overview Of Home Care Options","review":"Conveniently enough, Laurie Kaplan reviews her own book for us in the following paragraph: \\"His 'bedside manner' was perfect.

It's like having a calm, friendly, no-nonsense person sitting next to you, explaining everything you could possibly want to know about cancer in dogs, from possible-and-avoidable causes to treatment options to home care to moral, emotional and financial considerations.

It is a compassionate and supportive book that offers hope and help. The topics are comprehensive and insightful and are meant to help you and your beloved companion combat a frightening disease.

Laurie's book was different, and a savior for us, as it carefully and non-judgementally presented options for integrating nutritional, herbal, homeopathic, and traditional approaches (like radiation, chemotherapy and surgery). Along the way she charms us with her and her Bullet's very personal and brave story.

Using stories from their childhoods, the authors, especially Florence, draw the reader into an intimate visit which inspires the reader to look into her own past.

Ellis Amburn's biography is one of the first to ADMIT in any \\"official\\" capacity, and show through the biographical medium of Jack Kerouac, the simple undeniable fact that the Beat Generation is, like most rebellious movements comprised of the young, the unaccepted, the lost, misplaced, unacknowledged, leaderless, angry, artistic, philosophical, experimental, et.al---largely consumed by dark, forbidden ( by society) impulses and passions too powerful to deny and are often obsessed and fascinated by them too much NOT to explore.... It is Kerouac's dream that people want, not the truth of his life; even the numerous biographies have but scratched \\"the beat surface\\", somehow writing their way around the truth as if it were a reality whose skirts they were too terrified to lift, as a veil guarding from sore eyes what is not a handsome leg! Not so with Ellis Amburn's subterranean Kerouac! Amburn was Kerouac's editor the last decade of Kerouac's life.... He came into Kerouac's career, fittingly, about the time of \\"Big Sur\\", in which K, admits for the first time on record to his Angel that he is going absolutely crazy in the horrific manner of narcotica... K.'s literary skills of graphic description here do not tantalize, but horrify! This is the book that alienated Kerouac's own audience, and Amburn coming on the scene from here onwards is qualified to paint the portrait of Kerouac in a realistic manner worthy of Soviet Realist Literature, who is writing from personal memoir as well as from biographical investigation. Of course all Amburn writes is verified, one can investigate matters thoroughly for oneself thanks to concise bibliographical notated sources, including Kerouac's own \\"sex-lists\\", and the information it contains is valid only because, unlike the multitude of biographies out there, it's sources ARE cited.... Kerouac struggled all his life, and the fact that he eulogizes his youth in way that produced the most Romantic literature of his generation cannot ever completely exorcise his roots in the black soil of a poor French-Canadian family of working class origins, replete with all the stigmata of the hell it is to be poor, with an alcoholic, unemployed gambler for a father and repressed, clinging, religious old-world peasant for a mother, and a dutiful son of deep inborn sorrows, \\"Ti Jean\\", who loves them at the same time they all lovingly murder one another with smiles on their faces...you know the story, writ in high Romanticism, if you've read his works, which of no writer can I recommend more than Kerouac that you read his own works first before consulting ANY biograpical tomes as Kerouac wrote his own autobiography the way Twain said \\"noone is more prepared to write about your life than you are\\" and if you want to learn about Kerouac's spirit written straight from the heart consult his works! If you want the gut-level truth about his exterior life I recommend this one. Out of them all, however, if you don't want to be enlightened as to the truth of Kerouac's life,and believe me many do NOT, then do NOT read Amburn's biography. Even though much of what Amburn writes is mentioned in the previous what?-20?-biographies,it is yet glossed over in a deceptive manner allowing the delusion and the propoganda to continue flourishing and sellsellselling everything from romantic pants to cigarettes. On a deeper level, Amburn is championing Kerouac by writing the TRUTH of his exterior life as it can only raise Kerouac's spirit that much higher exposing as it does the true grit and stamina NOT to suicide himself the easy way, but to create immortal literature in which people will find the Solace and COMPANIONSHIP Kerouac wrote for! Amburn's Subterranean Kerouac is beyond the petty bickerings of what exactly went on at some party in the village 50 years ago, who ahhumped who so immensely they had to be resuscitated...that stuff is all fine-n-dandy but it does NOT get to the heart of the matter that is Kerouacs'! I suspected such a biography as this would upset the lies people want so much to believe, myself included, and they are anybody but Kerouac's lies; but true romanticism is not a flight from reason but a journey towards the ultimate self, and if such a book can upset so many innumerable critics, it's a sign beckoning: \\"There is something this book did to me that is really troubling to me!\\" and people rarely get upset by lies if they truly have no significant connotation, let those who admonish and want to kill the messenger bearing bad news go back to their idle worshipping of a false idol, and believe me, it is NOT Kerouac that is false in any way, it is largely the media who has so warped the true vision these writers had, but also those who would not find out the truth for themselves, even when they drink from the very source, that metaphysical horror of existence that Kerouac with sheer courage stands under the gaze of and stares back, constantly driving himself onwards \\"on the road\\" to get to the very heart of the matter, as if it were a very definitely real place somewhere within the confines of an \\"America!\\". Like any good biography, and there are thruths in each one not to be gleaned from any other, there is rarely any who don't break-down and cry their hearts out at the end of the life of Jack Kerouac. Many, rightly-so have said that to American Artists as well as the average reader, it is akin to the death of JFK for those who hold him close to their heart, a national tragedy. Disarming however is the real tragedy concerning Kerouac was the wretched manner in which he was treated while alive. The brutality of the establishment and the cruelty of mean spirited closed-minded people Kerouac fought against by using beautiful words, in the business of healing words...in the way he is used and marketed today still makes him very much so a 20th century American martyr. Amburn's biography is a portrait of Kerouac's inner-life in the tortured yet beautiful stylizations of German Expressionism. Kerouac fans are lucky, and some doomed, to have it. Regardless, the truth is now definately out there."},{"Title":"Subterranean Kerouac: The Hidden Life of Jack Kerouac (AUTHOR INSCRIBED FIRST EDITION)","review":"This biography is articulately written.

It's interesting that in Kerouac's \\"Vanity Of Duluoz\\" the dedication page states \\"Extra special thanks to Ellis Amburn for his emphatic brilliance and expertise\\". It's pretty evident what drove Jack to write. It's all in his books. \\"Dr Sax\\" comes to mind.

Hidden life? What do you expect? Gore Vidal, Capote et al surely approved."},{"Title":"Subterranean Kerouac: The Hidden Life of Jack Kerouac (AUTHOR INSCRIBED FIRST EDITION)","review":"Ellis Amburn's thesis is that Kerouac's personality and art were shaped by his struggle to reconcile his macho side with his latent homosexuality. His argument is not altogether convincing but thankfully it is basically a minor theme in what is otherwise an excellent biography. And Amburn's theme does raise valid unanswered questions about Kerouac's sexuality. Ginsberg's homosexuality is, of course, no secret, and both he and Kerouac acknowledge that there was some activity between them. And Neal Cassady's attempted hustle of the homosexual driver of the &quot;fag Plymouth&quot; in the motel scene in &quot;On the Road&quot; suggests that he was probably bisexual. But Kerouac himself is purposely vague on the details of his own homosexuality, so Amburn's interest is justified.Anyone familiar with Kerouacs work, however, will likely have problems accepting Amburn's argument. Conflict over sexual ambivalence simply seems inadequate to explain Kerouac's obsession with life and death, joy and suffering, and man's relationship with God. Certainly Kerouac's loss of his brother Gerard at age 4 had a greater impact on his art than did reconciling whatever homoerotic feelings he had with his self-preferred image as a macho writer.Many critics have apparently dismissed Amburn's book altogether. The fact that the chapters have been given ridiculously purple titles like &quot;Muscles, Meat, and Metaphysics&quot;, and &quot;Sucking Asses to Get Published&quot; doesn't add much to the book's claim to respectibility. ButI found it a valuable and highly readable biography, which presents a picture of the author which I found more accessible and understandable than the Charters or Nicosia books. His research seems sound enough,and there are extensive notes and references, many from JK himself.Amburn was Kerouac's last editor (he edited &quot;Big Sur&quot;) and his comments on working with Kerouac are interesting in their own right, especially when he comes out and asks Kerouac just what he meant in certain ambiguous passages. He also presents numerous details that are omitted or glossed over in the other books, such as the details of the Kammerer murder and the exact nature of Bill Canastra's gruesome death during a subway prank. After reading his book I have a much better understanding of Kerouac's football career, the attraction he felt for Borroughs, and his comples relationship with his mother and with women in general. Details like this flesh out the picture, and do much to make Kerouac's personality more understandable.I disagree with those who denigrate this book, and after two readings, it has become my favorite Kerouac biography. That Amburn's central thesis doesn't quite hold water (for me, at least) does nothing to lessen the value of this very enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Subterranean Kerouac: The Hidden Life of Jack Kerouac (AUTHOR INSCRIBED FIRST EDITION)","review":"This book is a tricky one.It's interesting to read a work that was so elegantly written and thoroughly researched but with the obvious agenda to &quot;out&quot; a man who is already well-known to have been &quot;bisexual&quot; in his activities. A credit to the author is that he does freely admit Kerouac's love (and in fact preference) for beautiful women, but do we as readers really need a diatribe about how wholesome homosexuality is?It's kind of a stretch to blame most of Kerouac's problems on his supposed conflict between hetero and homo leanings. Sexuality seems more a spectrum that is embraced by bisexuals, not a stark decision that must be made on either the &quot;hetero&quot; or &quot;homo&quot; side. Kerouac seemed to revel in his openness, not always torment over it! Obviously gays experienced much discrimination in the fifties and Kerouac probably felt a bit of this tension. Many readers do not need to hear so much about his sexual feelings/behaviors in general and grandiose psychological theories about the underpinnings of his conflicts and genius.The substantive portions on Kerouac's strivings as an artist and goal toward publishing are very well-written and quite informative. I really felt that I was taken into the mind of this ambitious genius beat writer.Amburn's discourses on his closeness to Kerouac did not upset me; they seemed like ingenuous efforts to convey his fondness for Kerouac.The football content was treated thoroughly and reverentially, which I enjoyed. Also, Subterranean sheds much light on the real itinerant nature of Kerouac, his undying love for his mother, and a variety of other tidbits seemingly culled from trusted sources.Mainly the book is intelligently written, engrossing, and the fact that it's pissing off a lot of people would have probably warmed Jack's heart.This book meets my number one criterion for a biography about a person who is no longer with us (if you can ever justify writing one) - that it is written mostly objectively, and with a lot of respect. This one successfully does just that.I'm raising a glass right now.B. Wallace/author/Labyrinth of Chaos"},{"Title":"Subterranean Kerouac: The Hidden Life of Jack Kerouac (AUTHOR INSCRIBED FIRST EDITION)","review":"Ellis Amburn's biographical account of Jack Kerouac is a phenomenal undertaking of this brilliant writer's life. To paraphrase, Kerouac insisted that he wrote the truth as he saw it. Kerouac's life story as Amburn writes it, is full of the lurid (Kerouac's homosexual past heterosexual &amp; homosexual activity and substance abuse may far exceed the comfort level of readers) is an inverse tragic story -- Kerouac's genius could have taken him to the heights of one of the greatest American writers (&amp; Kerouac would have thought so himself, too), rather than that of the Beat period. Amburn certainly conveys that sense of a broken promise in Kerouac. Amburn's research is meticulous, being that he was Kerouac editor; yet, his account of Kerouac is fond and the tone of the biography is that of a close friend. You will be heartbroken as you ride the crests and valleys of Jack's life. It has provoked my interest in reading other biographical accounts of Kerouac, as well my shelved copies of Kerouac's work."},{"Title":"Subterranean Kerouac: The Hidden Life of Jack Kerouac (AUTHOR INSCRIBED FIRST EDITION)","review":"I opened this book as a prejudiced reader, ready to dislike what I was sure would be Amburn's narrow-minded take on the writer, one more reduction of the artist through a filter of one more specialty school. Kerouac dissected by the scalpels of queer theory. I was delighted to find Amburn's immensely readable life of Ti Jean written with open mind and full heart. Satisfying in a way that few of the previous biographies have been, Amburn gives an authentic sense of a very complicated man across a busy and confused lifetime. No easy feat. The bonus is that Amburn also offers up tidbits from the archives unknown until now. (I was unaware that Kerouac once thought of merging Dr. Sax with On the Road and making the first novel the story of Sal Paradise's childhood). Clearly, the biographer cares about his subject even when he delineates Kerouac's failings in a clear-eyed, stinging fashion. There are fine insights into all the supporting cast of characters and its ever-shifting relationships (Burroughs, we learn, thought Cassady a low class con man. John Clellon Holmes suffered with his own alcoholic demons). The whole book is written in a pleasing, non-obtrusive style. Until Douglas Brinkley's official biography arrives, Amburn's book will do nicely to help sate the ever-expanding hunger for Kerouac studies."},{"Title":"Subterranean Kerouac: The Hidden Life of Jack Kerouac (AUTHOR INSCRIBED FIRST EDITION)","review":"I found this book interesting and illuminating in a gossipy sort of way. Amburn is obviously a writer in love with the genius of his subject, but appalled at the devastation alcoholism brought to Kerouac's life and art. The emphasis on his struggles with his homosexual tastes struck me as almost a side-bar to the tragedy of his alcohol abuse. Most of the characters come off as simply human and flawed, though some come off as sicker than others (Burroughs), while others come off as decidedly healthy (Snyder). In the end, the book made me want to read more Kerouac, and therefore I call it a success."},{"Title":"Subterranean Kerouac: The Hidden Life of Jack Kerouac (AUTHOR INSCRIBED FIRST EDITION)","review":"This is pure, addictive reading pleasure as it leaves no stone unturned in its investigation of Kerouac the author and Kerouac the man. Not only that, but it also sheds light on a whole generation of bohemians and contemporaries of Kerouac whilst providing valuable background and insight into the literary masterpieces produced by this generation that included William Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, Paul Bowles, Neal Cassady and many others. Their lives prove that the path of excess often leads to the most sublime literature. This book has stimulated my interest in the Beat writers all over again and I shall reread their classics once more, this time with a clearer understanding of the interpersonal relationships and mutual influences underlying the text. I believe Amburn's excellent book is indispensable for a thorough understanding of the Beats and is a brilliant reference work with its copious notes, extensive bibliography and thorough index. The text is enlivened by black and white photographs all the important people, places and documents that played a part in Kerouac's life. Impeccable scholarship and an engaging writing style combine to ensure a riveting read and a valuable reference source that I certainly will return to again and again."},{"Title":"Subterranean Kerouac: The Hidden Life of Jack Kerouac (AUTHOR INSCRIBED FIRST EDITION)","review":"Only the gullible would believe this slanted garbage. The sex list is a major break in the understanding of Kerouac, too bad Amburn tries to make him a one dimensional person. The main premise in the book is that Kerouac was afraid that his homosexual leanings would become common knowledge. In many interviews mentioned by Amburn, Kerouac talks about his homosexual activity. He shouted in a NYC bar that he had sex with Gore Vidal. The sexlist kept by Kerouac includes homosexual encounters. The more information Amburn gives about Kerouac's &quot;fear&quot; of being found out, the more laughable the book's premise becomes. Amburn's weak claim of being a friend of Kerouac (over and over he mentions that Vanity of Dulouz is dedicated to him) is amusing when compared to his own words about Kerouac and previous editor Robert Giroux, &quot;Failing to realize that the author-editor relationship is strictly business, Kerouac had naively assumed Giroux to be his friend for life...&quot; Amburn knew a positive book wouldn't sell so he took the low road and dug up a bunch of stale dirt."},{"Title":"Subterranean Kerouac: The Hidden Life of Jack Kerouac (AUTHOR INSCRIBED FIRST EDITION)","review":"this book ought to rank with the best of the kerouac biographies. while the noted ann charters bio (kerouac) isgood and the nicosia bio (memory babe) is one of the best it is this one that really gets into the seamier side of the beats and kerouac. this book by his former editor falls short though because of his constantly grinding his axe on homophobia and anti semitism that aside it is still one of the best"},{"Title":"Subterranean Kerouac: The Hidden Life of Jack Kerouac (AUTHOR INSCRIBED FIRST EDITION)","review":"This was an excellent book that gives the reader an in-depth look at the so-called &quot;Beat Movement&quot; and its' major players.

I am also a nurse (and also a Red Cross nursing volunteer, although I have never worked full time for the organization), and a former officer in the Navy Nurse Corps. My speciality is international health; my work has taken me to some of the poorest and least developed places in the world. I have seen first-hand the work of the Red Cross in war zones and after natural disasters. I currently work in a human rights organization. I recently visited the ICRC Headquarters in Geneva, along with its spectacular museum.All this is to say that I bring more than an casual perspective to this book--and it dazzled me. Despite its incredible length, it felt too short. Ms. Moorehead writes lucidly, compassionately, and well. Her research is scholarly, her documentation is meticulous, her compassion and her critical abilities are always evident. She rightfully praises the individual courage of the Red Cross founders and leaders (not only Dunant, the Swiss banker, but the other significant figures in Red Cross history, including the American nurse, Clara Barton, who founded the American Red Cross and pioneered its role in natural disasters).But the book is not just an encomium to the good deeds of idealists. Moorehead is frank in her appraisals of the weaknesses and foibles of both the people and the organization itself. She examines the evolving role of the Red Cross, which began as an adjunct to the gentlemanly wars of the 19th century, grew to a worldwide relief agency in the unimaginable horrors of the 20th century and, most recently, has had to become a competitor for the world's glory in humantarian activities.Most importantly, she examines the historical record and the ethical dilemnas of an organization which was founded on the Swiss principles of neutrality and quiet diplomacy and was then faced with atrocities in its own back yard: she provides a very careful appraisal of the role of the Red Cross during the WWII Holocaust. It is clear that the Red Cross as an organization provided too little aid to the victims of Nazis, gave it too late and perhaps gave it for the wrong reasons--publicity rather than compassion. (A horrendous, but little known, fact is that the physician who was appointed head of the German Red Cross by Hitler was behind the savage medical experimentation done in the camps. He committed suicide before he could be tried as a war criminal).Nonetheless, Moorehead is unstinting in her admiration for those individual Red Cross delegates whose independent actions were able to save thousands of Jews and others. There were Red Cross delegates who raced along lines of Jews being forcibly marched to their deportation and death, desperately throwing them food and attempting to rescue anyone they could by bribing, cajoling or fooling the guards.Moorehead depicts the failures and the multitudinous successes of the Red Cross, and includes enough individual tales and humor to make her account extraordinarily readable. Despite its failings in some arenas, I remain an overall admirer of the Red Cross itself, and I am an unabashed admirer of this book. \\"Dunant's Dream\\" can be read for its comprehensive and engrossing history, but readers interested in the larger diplomatic and ethical issues of international aid will find it invaluable. Absolutely recommended."},{"Title":"Dunant's Dream: War, Switzerland and the History of the Red Cross","review":"This book is definitely an investment of time and energy at over 700 pages long. However, depending on your interest level, it may be worth it. I decided to read this book after going through my volunteer and instructor training with the American Red Cross. I wanted to understand the history, culture, and development of the international Red Cross organization and \\"movement\\" as well as the issues it faces in dealing with wars and disasters. This book definitely did not disappoint. It offers a fascinating look at the founding of the organization as well as an in-depth look at its work in a variety of world conflicts. The focus is mostly on its work in war vs. in natural disasters, including World War I and II, Korea, Biafra, Cambodia, and others. The author admits in her introduction that there are many conflicts that are not covered. Vietnam is left out, Latin America is barely touched on, and there is only one chapter that deals specifically with the American Red Cross (in its early years). However, this book definitely provides an overview and concrete examples of the moral, ethical, political, and logistical issues this organization faces. Moorehead is indeed a good writer, but her work definitely alternates between engaging and overdone. Some chapters are so fascinating that the reading is effortless, while in just a few instances she provides too many minor details that can bog the reader down. But on the whole, her book was very enjoyable despite its length. It definitely left a hunger for more on the Red Cross' encounters in other world conflicts as well as in natural disasters. It might have been worthwhile for Moorehead to separate the book into two volumes, but that is of course the author's choice. Regardless, I feel I have been offered a unique glimpse into the Red Cross and international issues by reading this book."},{"Title":"Dunant's Dream: War, Switzerland and the History of the Red Cross","review":"This book is not for the faint of heart. It is a hefty seven hundred page epic. However, I found the book spellbinding and finished reading it in less than three weeks time. I would especially recommend DUNANT'S DREAM to those interested in human rights or history. Caroline Morehead is a gifted writer who balances objectivity with revealing glimpses at the men and women who have made the International Committee of the Red Cross the premier human rights and relief agency in the world. I came away from Morehead's book with a clearer understanding of the complex circumstances involving humanitarianism during times of conflict and turmoil. I am sorry that this very worthwhile book is now out of print. However, I am glad that is available in libraries and through &quot;out of print&quot; dealers."},{"Title":"The Era of Good Feelings","review":"Well deserving his Pulitzer, Dangerfield opens this fascinating study with the negotiations at Ghent and closes with the advent of the Jackson presidency.

From the heated discussions of the Monroe Cabinet to the skirmishing between churches in the field and their congregational headquarters to Andrew Jackson leading the invasion of Spanish Florida, Dangerfield captures a time of great growth and transition. Dangerfield is also excellent in showing how English politics and economics shaped the fledgling republic during these years. Dangerfield's takes on the leading political actors form a wonderful portrait gallery: the elusive James Monroe, the puritanical John Quincy Adams, the merry Henry Clay and raging John Randolph, the logical John Calhoun and the emotional Andrew Jackson. Dangerfield offers an excellent bridge between more established periods of American history and shows the importance of this neglected period."},{"Title":"The Era of Good Feelings","review":"While there's a lot of good details in The Era of Good Feelings, it is probably best left for the scholars and researchers. There are great details about the Treaty of Ghent, the Second Bank of the U.S., the Seminole War, Monroe's diplomacy, the Missouri Compromise, and the Presidency of J.Q. Adams. There's also a nice chapter on the first wave of the Industrial Revolution. While the Era of Good Feelings is generally associated with Monroe, this book also includes the Presidency of Adams to round out the bridge between the Treaty of Ghent and the Jacksonian Era. When Dangerfield puts the story together, however, it is not as approachable as other tales of American History. There are too many references to unexplained names and events that leave the novice historian with too much work to piece the whole story together."},{"Title":"The herbalist almanac: A fifty year anthology","review":"If you want the best book on Herbs,try Culpepper's book instead.This book is charming to a point.It has the complete list of all well-known herbs and uses.Yet,there too brief and not very weighty in content.The references come from out-dated herbal source books that can not be so easy to verify.So,i withheld one star here.Yet,the knowledge presented is credible and useful.

Germano's writing is witty, enjoyable, and informed - it's as though you're receiving guidance from your academic advisor rather than reading a how-to book written by some faceless, self-proclaimed publishing \\"guru.\\" It should come as no surprise that Germano is the VP and publishing director at Routledge. His wealth of insight is remarkable - he covers the process of publishing scholarly work from beginning to end. From writing the manuscript, to crafting a successful proposal, signing a contract, and seeing the work through to publication, Germano doesn't miss a beat. He even covers the not-so-little details, like copyrights, permissions, quotations, artwork, and cover design. His discussion of the various publishing houses and their tasks (\\"What do publishers do?\\") was most informative.\\"Getting It Published\\" is a must-have for those new to scholarly publishing. Newbies to the world of publishing who aren't looking to publish scholarly work won't be disappointed, either - there's plenty of useful information in here for everyone. It also serves as a much-needed break from all those awful \\"For Dummies\\" books and \\"Idiot's Guides\\" that seem to saturate the publishing market!"},{"Title":"Getting It Published: A Guide for Scholars and Anyone Else Serious about Serious Books (Chicago Guides to Writing, Editing, and Publishing)","review":"The former editorial director of the Columbia University Press lays it all out for aspiring non-fiction authors.

He stirs up his own concoction of romance, magical realism and Canadian hockey history in an artful blend of true events (such as the demise of the professional hockey team in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada), fantastic tall tales and the sojourns and adventures of two brothers, as they make their way in an eccentric, surreal world.From Winnipeg?

The potent overtones of living a life of fear are gut-wrenching; I cannot imagine living in a place where nobody is an ally, justice does not exist, and evil men are obeyed to the letter according to their own whims. That people could live lives so ordered by terror and yet accept it to no end boggles my autonomous American mindset. A real-eye opener, so much that I can't seem to write a proper review in coherent sentences. Just, wow."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"This is Anchee Min's best book, in my humble opinion, and it happened to be the first I read of hers. I was drawn in by it almost instantaneously. Since, I have read Becoming Madame Mao, Empress Orchid, The Last Empress, Wild Ginger and now I am reading Pearl of China. Min's stories are intensely relatable and she articulates herself beautifully. I probably won't stop until I've read all of her novels. They are as haunting as they are intriguing."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"This book, to me, started out with the current book-club favorite theme of 'overcoming a significant obstacle to grow and go to another country'. Please don't mind the tongue in cheek. Anyway, as it rolled along, I did find myself becoming engaged in and with the main character and beginning to know the folks around her. I ended up liking the book. Especially because it kind of proved that not everybody goes along societal upheaval: change is difficult for everybody everywhere. We don't change until we absolutely have to and even then, we do it reluctantly. What I found especially interesting is that the author and I are very close in age. Here in the United States, Black Americans were stepping up and facing the fight for our Civil Rights. In China, civil rights were diminishing painfully. I was wearing miniskirts and my afro and going to college; she, on the other hand, was really struggling to live. My family didn't have much but through education, I achieved access to whatever I wanted. Her family didn't have much but finally through education, she achieved access to whatever she wanted. I don't know that I could have lived the life she did, and she probably feels the same way."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"This story is a good story. It is not a bad story in any way. Anchee portrays her life during Mao's rule in an interesting light.

I have learned so much about China. and felt like I was there."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"History books tell us facts and figures. We know how egregious were the acts perpetrated against the citizens of China under Mao. But, to read it as lived by a child who grows up from psychological indoctrination that enslaves to disillusionment that causes her to question and finally freedom from entrapment to emigrate, brings it home on a very personal level.Anchee Min tells her story in a concise way. No wasted words, yet the feeling is that nothing of significance was left out. I was so enthralled with Red Azalea that I read it through in one day; couldn't seem to put it down.I was surprised to learn that Madame Mao was the worse of the two; the one who brought Mao to the apex of his power. Strange to me is how she is seen as reprehensible (and rightfully so) while he is still thought of by many with affection. They were both monsters in their souls.This is a book that must be read if one wants to understand the impact Mao had on the life of the average Chinese citizen and their society as a whole. The depths of abject poverty and despair to which he plunged them.It is a lesson we in America, given the present political agenda, must be very cognizant of in order to avoid becoming such a country. We are the last true bastion of liberty, to which the Anchee Mins are able to emigrate. If we fall, there will be no refuge - for us as well as anyone else."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"All aspects of the purchase were fine. Book in good shape and arrived as predicted."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"While I found the syntax a bit off putting in the beginning, the story conveyed a view of the culture and mind set of China which I found engrossing. Enjoyed the read."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"Anchee Min writes a very interesting memoir of a young woman experiencing the Cultural Revolution in China. She is assigned to a rural farm where she falls in love with another woman. Any form of love is forbidden, and lesbianism would be even less tolerated than heterosexual love. All loyalties and positive emotions are supposed to be directed toward Maoist ideology and government.By some fluke, Ms. Min becomes noticed by the state opera and is moved to Beijing to compete for the part of 'Red Azalea', the symbolic woman of the Cultural Revolution. She gets the part and plays a role designed to promote the cause of the Cultural Revolution.Part historical commentary, part love story, it is a mesmerizing and poetic discourse on the pain of an individual trying to survive as 'self' in a bureaucracy that recognizes only the collective."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"As required reading for a college course on Asian history, I picked up this book one night and finished it the next. It is a heart-stoppingly real, rough and dramatic account of a young woman's ascent and descent in the Red Army during Mao's reign in China. At times I was moved to tears, literally -- while commuting on a subway. I was enthralled with the author's &quot;voice&quot; in telling her own sad, victorious, heart wrenching story from childhood through adulthood. Red Azalea is an important piece of writing which I'd recommend not only to students interested in Chinese history, but to anyone who enjoys a real human story with historical reality."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"Anchee Min's raw, abrupt writing style is a good vehicle for this compelling account of her life during China's misbegotten Cultural Revolution. From party loyalist to disillusioned communal farm serf to candidate for the starring role in an important propaganda film, her journey embodies the phrase &quot;the personal is political.&quot; Surely few documented lives have been so victimized by politics as hers was. With all its rough edges, her spare, direct prose speaks through remembered pain to put experience into a larger perspective. Leaving the incredibly cramped quarters of her intellectualized family for the huge labor farm was an adventure that quickly soured, redeemed only by the dangerous passion she shared with an admired woman named Yan. The punishment meted out to a heterosexual couple found making love in the fields at night reflects the risks she and Yan were taking. Later, selected as the potential lead for a propaganda film, she competed fiercely with other young women equally desperate to escape the brutalities of farm life. Her story demonstrates how love does not depend on gender. One of the most remarkable sections of this memoir details the efforts she undertook to have a love affair with a party official referred to only as the Supervisor -- trying to connect in the midst of an anonymous crowd at a mountain Buddhist temple, and meeting him after dark in a notorious public park frequented by scores of others searching for love, or sex, in the midst of a regime that repressed sexual expression along with political freedoms. Indeed, in a society so fundamentally paranoid as she depicts, where citizens were conditioned to betray their neighbors over the pettiest infractions of party doctrine, it is a small miracle that she finally managed to leave China at all. Anchee Min is one of the lucky ones. The effects of the Cultural Revolution were felt long after it ended. As late as 1989, the democracy demonstrations in Tianamen Square were a direct, if delayed, reaction against it. Her book stands as a testament to the personal toll of a dictatorial government."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"Anchee Min has created a powerful sense of life in China during its darkest period: the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The year was 1966, revolution powered by the Red Army just began to crumple the country. 9-year-old Min was the most excellent student in her grade for her revolutionary mind. She had memorized Mao's Little Red Book, secretively criticized her parents' reactionary (counter-revolutionary) behaviors, sang heroic operas raved by Jiang Ching (Madame Mao) and was selected as the head of student Red Guard. Utterly ignorant of the revolution's poignant consequence, Min, afterall, was too young to understand the meaning of public criticisms and purges. Manipulated and brainwashed by the Party members at her school, Min openly criticized and betrayed her most favorite teacher by accusing her as being a spy from the United States.At the age of 17, Min was told that she needed to be a model to the graduates as a student leader. The ambitious I'll-go-where-Chairman-Mao's-finger-points attitude stirred Min's heart and made her eager to devote herself in hardship at the Red Fire Farm. Upon cancelling her residency in Shanghai, along with million other youths Min joined the Advanced 7th Company to plant rice in leech-filled water along the eastern coast. There Min finally caught up with the terror and hardship of Mao's ambitious revolution. She befriended with and eventually worshippped and fell in love with Party commander Yan. Here Min contrasted the dark horror of Communist China, the purges and the criticisms with her own desirous passion. She picked fight with the deputy commander Lu who diligently sought to catch Yan's mistakes. The secret meeting with Yan at the brick factory, the fondling and cuddling in bed under the mosqutio net-such personal desires are politically dangerous that the culprit could be rewarded a death sentence. Min was then engaged in an affair with the \\"Supervisor\\" who directed the revolutionary film Red Azalea. After Cultural Revolution and the arrest of Jiang Ching, pro-Revolutionist like Min was labeled. She continued to work as a set clark at the film studio. The Party sent her younger sister Coral to the Red Fire Farm in order to fulfill the peasant quota for each family. She was not granted sick leave even though she caught TB. \\"My despair made me fearless\\", noted Min. She decided to fight for permission to leave not only the film studio but the country. The year was 1984. At the age of 27, Min immigrated to the United States. *Red Azalea* is her powerful memoir-a joltingly honest testimony to life in China under Mao. The prose is haunting, heartbreaking, and erotic. 4.1 stars."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"When Anchee Min was 9 years old, she was the perfect revolutionary. She had memorized Mao's Little Red Book, sang heroic operas and was head of her school's Little Red Guard. The year was 1966, and the Cultural Revolution had just begun to turn Chinese society inside out. Too young to understand the public criticisms and purges, Min thought she was fighting for the ''final peace of the planet.'' Then the hardship and terror caught up with her.Red Azalea is her achingly beautiful memoir of the time, a story remarkable for its absence of anger or recrimination against the Communist Party and Chinese government. Told to serve the revolution as a peasant when she turned 17, Min left her family in Shanghai and joined the Advanced Seventh Company to plant rice near the East China Sea, toiling 16-hour days in muddy, leech- filled water. Two years later she returned to Shanghai to compete with three other women for the title role in Red Azalea, a film project based on the revolution, written by Mao's wife.**Min contrasts the gray regimen of her society with her own passions, first for a female lover in the army and later for a mysterious man who supervises the production of Red Azalea. Each secret rendezvous and illicit tryst -- whether in a Shanghai bathhouse or a Buddhist temple brimming with scents of incense, jasmine and the crush of worshippers -- is all the more poignant in a country where personal desires are politically dangerous.Min emigrated to America in 1984, but in Red Azalea she has created a powerful sense of life in China during that country's most heartbreaking time."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"Excellent prose and a powerful story add up to one of the better books about life in modern China under the rule of Mao. This story of life under the repressive regime of Mao after the cultural revolution is eye-opening in regards to how one can take freedom for granted."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"Red Azalea is not difficult to read - it is a book easily consumed in one or two sittings. However, when it comes to the digestion of what's been read, that's a different story altogether. Red Azalea is the story of the author's childhood under China's Cultural Revolution, but tackled with seemingly simple language that manages to impart complicated undercurrents of meaning to the reader. Min has stated in interviews that she admires the painting style of Henri Matisse, and that her writing style is a reflection of that simplicity and naivete.Red Azalea tells Min's story from elementary school where she is a good communist leader right off the bat, to her time spent at a farm where she has a relationship with her supervisor, to being chosen to star in a film version of one of Madame Mao's operas, Red Azalea. I found Min to be inaccessible, and the memoir difficult to ground in reality; however, this did not prevent me from enjoying the book and being vastly educated by it. The tone of the book was almost otherworldly, perhaps because of the lack of everyday details that would somehow anchor the events. I found myself often glancing back at the cover of the book, as if to remind myself that this was indeed nonfiction. Red Azalea is quite different from any book I've ever read: a memoir both complicated and simple, a plot both clear and elusive. Recommended for a challenge where you'd least expect one."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"There are many books dealing with Mao's China and Red Azalea would be a fine choice to begin. It is a truthful account of life under an oppressive political system and does much to help one understand what it was like to live and struggle and survive in such a difficult period."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"Red Azelia is the most poetically accurate account of life, love, and sexuality in Chinese culture to date. From western sensibilities, the relationship between the narrator and Yan seems a little strange until one realizes that there is a fundimental difference in Chinese and western views on sex, sensuality, and physical/emotional fulfillment. To a westerner, the relationship seems to have not been entirely satisfying for the two people involved. However, in the cultural framework in which it occured it must have been deliciously satisfying for the two participants.The book shows the results of the Chinese (both Mainland and Nationalist) tendancy to marry much later than westerners. Few women marry before 25 and few men before 30. For women, sexual relationships before marriage are devestating if future husbands are aware of them. As a result, may women turn to each other for physical intimacy (as opposed to men visiting prostitutes for the same purpose). This book places this cultural tendency in the context of another cultural disaster in China: The Cultural Revolution.I can not recommend this book too highly, especially for people who have a vested interest in understanding sexual aspects of Chinese culture that most Chinese are unwilling to discuss openly.One must also understand that sensual expression between two people of the same sex is not viewed as negatively in Chinese culture as it is in the west. It is common to see two women waling hand in hand or see two women dancing in the clubs (often quite sensually)."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"A rather quick read for such a heavy subject. Min writes with an odd matter-of-factness so that all the details of her life both good and bad are given equal weight as she reports them. It is difficult sometimes to judge how things affected her. I come away feeling I have learned more about the Cultural Revolution but Min still remains a mystery."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"Very touching, and although I consider myself to be a rather slow reader, I finished this book in a day and then re-read it again the next day. I found the perspective on madame Mao to be somewhat peculiar, but I am no historian...see what you think. This is an exceptionally well-told memoir of an extremely talented writer. I highly recommend reading this book, along with \\"Wild Swans\\" by Jung Chang for added insight on life in a China of the not so distant past."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"I expected to find that the main character would have a relationship with another woman but was a bit taken aback when later into the story there is a section describing their meeting outside the camp with a man and how she is involved. I found it very disturbing and too graphic. It is always very eye opening to see how a person's circumstances can change the way they must think to survive the hardships. It helps us to understand a bit better why the Chinese tend to act and react so much differently than us in the western world. Overall very insightful and helpful in understanding their communist way of life, but thought the latter part could have been done more subtly and less shockingly. I assume the author wanted us to experience that along with the main character, but very unnecessary."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"I normally avoid dramas and books about people who emerge from adversity, but this book was SOMETHING ELSE. I was so fascinated I couldn't put the book down. The events move along, preventing the reader from becoming bored. Also, I had never learned about what Mao's reign meant for the daily lives of the Chinese, so the rules and propaganda were all new to me and also horribly fascinating. The author's story is told with beauty and in an endearingly straightforward style without any of the sappiness and drama that usually gives me the heebie jeebies. A MUST READ if you don't know anything about Communist China and/or if you love a good (true) story."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"A beginging so heart throbing and tretorous only leads to the life in Communist China.

This little girl soon grows up in a communist camp...a scary, yet sad story of life."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"\\"Red Azalea\\" is to Maoist China what Anne Frank's \\"Diary\\" is to Nazi Germany, what Ayn Rand's \\"We The Living\\" and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's \\"Ivan Denisovich\\" and \\"Gulag Archipelago\\" are to Soviet Russia. It should be required reading in every High School literature class in the semi-free world, even with its frank eroticism - today's students are already getting stuff far more explicit, and in this case it's there for a valid reason.The imperative to read this work is especially true given the fact that high-ranking members of the current American(!) Administration, most notably one Anita Dunn, have expressed deep admiration for the collectivist butcher Mao - a dictator who murdered in excess of 40 million people, who engineered precisely the vast, subhuman misery chronicled by Anchee Min in this autobiography. Note\\"Red Azalea\\" is not just a report on the unspeakable evil that is collectivism, it's a meditation on the will to survive, and on the psychological methods by which people under extreme material and spiritual bondage cope with the destruction of freedom and the extermination of hope. \\"Hope\\" - now there's an ironic word, huh?I myself had read all of the dry factual data about what Mao and his regime had done - and to a degree are still doing - to the people of China, but aside from the outsider's peek beneath the veneer of collectivist China afforded by Mark Salzman in his excellent book and film \\"Iron and Silk,\\" I was fully unprepared for the stark, riveting story of day-to-day life - if you want to call it \\"life\\" - that Anchee Min relates in this book. The first fifty pages read like a horror novel - but this is an *autobiography* of a woman born in 1957, and of events she survived, from childhood right up to the 1980s.Min's prose is bleak and unadorned with literary flourishes - and is all the more moving, even poetic, for that carbide-steel starkness. In a 2008 interview Min said she started Red Azalea as a practical exercise in learning English, and that querying people on elevators on grammatical corrections was her primary means of editing her work. The result, amazingly, is a book that reads more like a novel than an autobiography, to the point that I found myself repeatedly stunned by the self-reminder: \\"This - is - REAL.\\" When you finish the last page of \\"Red Azalea,\\" you will find yourself breathing a silent, horrified \\"Thank You\\" to the people who forged America's Declaration of Independence and Constitution, to America's first Founder, Aristotle, and to the people who today are struggling to defend those Founding principles from America's own corrupt collectivists.In exactly the same way that American collectivist \\"intellectuals\\" denied the facts chronicled by Rand and by Solzhenitsyn about Russia - and who continue to evade those truths even in the face of the mountain of data released in the wake of the Soviet collapse - so today's collectivist \\"intellectuals\\" stand up and, with utter ethical agnosticism, profess open *admiration* for Mao (not to mention the dictators Chavez, Castro, Ahmadinejad and the like.) Monsters like Anita Dunn - and politicians who place such monsters in official positions within government - are only able to avoid the public ridicule and ostracism that justice would demand, by the fact that We The People rarely find enough information about horrors occurring halfway around the world - committed by the very same totalitarian dictators America's collectivists continue to worship. As was the case with the collapse of the Soviet empire, we can be assured that the Dunn/Obama types will continue their corrupt flight from facts and ethics long after the Maoist regime has faded, China has embarked on the road to becoming a nation of ethics and liberty, and the old regime's human rights crimes have been fully exposed. Ms. Min deserves the highest gratitude and admiration for having first survived, then having related this harrowing life story to the eyes of the world. The rest of us should consider it essential reading.Run, don't walk, to checkout for this book. Get extras and give them to family and friends - this story deserves to be heard as widely as possible. I would say it's a ready-made movie script, but Hollywood's \\"writers\\" and producers are orders of magnitude more corrupt and evil than even our collectivist politicians. So...just get the book."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"This is an interesting work of fiction set during the Cultural Revolution. Although the action that takes place in it is a bit difficult to believe, it does make for a good yarn. I had just finished reading an excellent book of stories set in the Cultural Revolution, &quot;White Snake and Other Stories&quot; by Geling Yan and saw the movie based on one of Yan's stories directed by Joan Chen -- both Yan and Chen are contemporaries of Anchee Min -- and was hungry for more.

I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"I was excited to read this book, because I collect Asian culture books. I did not enjoy this one! Anchee Min has a beautiful way of writing ( if you can overlook the fact that she does not use quotations ) I kept reading thinking there would be some valuable content only to be disappointed in the end. I don't even know why I stuck with it to the end, I guess it was because I didn't have another book to read.I can see Anchee Min writing poetry, I'm sure it would be beautiful.Red Azaelea was boring.I had just finished Falling Leaves by Adeline Yen Mah. It was wonderful. Red Azaelea...disappointing!"},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"From the start of the book the reader is enveloped with several odd concepts and aspects of communism and the Chinese culture that many may find simply odd. This is one of the books most fascinating qualities that make it partly likable. My problems with the book come primarily from Min's raw and almost poetic writing style. At times her simple sentence structure was a major drawback that led to a choppy feeling and rough delivery. I felt that her memoir would have been more appealing if she had spent less time dwelling on descriptions that were in many cases not necessary. Overall this book in my opinion deserved three out of five stars. I will undoubtedly recommend this novel to others for the reason that this story is one of a kind and at many points heartwarming."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"Anchee Min's book about her life during and after the Cultural Revolution is rather naive. She doesn't even mention the real reason behind the CR, namely the fact that Mao lost the majority in the Central Committee and unleashed the youth in order to regain his power, causing millions of deaths (see Simon Leys: The new Clothes of Chairman Mao.)The only comment on the CR in this book reads as follows:'Jiang Ching's unfulfilled desire ... that made ancient tragedies stir the souls and foster civilizations. And it was that very same desire that sparkled the flame of the Great Cultural Revolution.'(p.250)This comment is also an extremely flattery (an euphemism) portrait of Mrs. Mao ('She was a heroine.' p. 243), while it was not a secret that she took control of the Cultural Ministry to take revenge (by tortures and assassinations) on all people (e.g. movie directors) who had refused to give her major roles in their movies.As a member of the Gang of Four she tried to take Mao's place after his death. For a formidable portrait of Mrs. Mao I recommend Lucien Bodard's masterpiece 'Le Chien de Mao'.The work camp scenes, the erotic encounters and the mass rally to insult a forged 'class enemy' are more convincing. They show us that each member of the Red Guard had to loose its individuality and privacy (no sex, no secrecy, no free speech, mass confessions) and had to be a 'cog in a big revolutionary machine'. It was a jail life under the iron fist of the proletarian revolution with the slogan 'killing the chickens to shock the monkeys'.But underneath the 'purity' of the revolutionaries we discover jealousies, drive for power and dominance, manipulations, fierce competition, fear and lies. The author herself is far from innocent: 'I am my ambition.' (p. 245)Overall, the atmosphere in this book is rather sentimental and not without a certain narcissism. Also, the sudden change in the character of one of the main players seems extraordinary.This is certainly, and by far, not the best book on the Cultural Revolution or on the work camps.Therefore I can recommend two masterpieces: Nieng Cheng's 'Life and Death in Shanghai' ( a moving and inhumanly biting biography of an innocent woman caught in a political quagmire) and Xianliang Zhang's 'Half Man is Woman' (a formidable tale about work camp inmates and an in depth analysis of the gender battle)."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"Anchee Min has written a number of novels that could have been non-fiction if not for Mao's government. She no longer lives in China, but had the books not been fiction, she would have suffered greatly. Red Azalea was banned in China for years but is now sold there. It is an accurate portrayal of the damage Mao did to China in his early year's of power. His later years were awful, too, but he was better in between."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"I love to read books about women but I found this book a little hard to get into. Once I got into it I did enjoy it. So give it a few chapters before you make up your mind as it is worth reading. It is a true story of a woman growing up in Mao's China. It is nice to read a book written by the person who experienced it."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"My teacher recommended me this book. I feel the money spent on it is worthwhile. Recommend it to all ages and groups."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"The writing style is dry, but still very evocative, and the story changes pace and surrounding so often that the book feels like a snap journey. A great read for an unsettled mind."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"I learned so much about communist china in this book and all the others by this author, the things they don't teach you in school are amazing to hear. Even if its a book based on fictional characters. They history is true. I would recommend this book to all my friends and family."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"I first picked up Red Azalea when I was fifteen, primarily reading it to pass time at school. I wasn't sure what to expect, but as I read, Anchee Min's autobiographical tale moved me; the story is a factual account of a young life spent in the PRC under Chairman Mao's communist dictatorship. The novel takes Min from a troubled youth in Shanghai, doing her best to conform to the propaganda filled society she has been born in, to her time spent in a government labor camp, and then her brief tenure as a hopeful actress at Shanghai Film Studio. It is a brutally honest story, portraying the conflicting desires of a youthful woman in an oppressive, rigid society.Red Azalea is an eye-opening story, revealing a world and culture that many Americans will no doubt be clueless about. I was, in all honesty, shocked at the incredibly difficult life many Chinese men and women endured under Mao's regime, and touched by Min's own tale. I would, without a doubt, recommend this to any and all readers looking to gain some insight into a communist, dictatorial China.I will admit that Anchee Min's prose is, at times, a bit dry - and at other times somewhat confusing, perhaps owed to the fact that English is not her native language. The descriptions of places and events can be a bit off, but otherwise, the novel is fantastic."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"The book was a fascinating read by a very talented author. I delight in using my Kindle for the convenience of ordering books. I am able to read more books immediately instead of waiting to receive them or find them in a library.The story places you in a very important part of China's recent history. Reading the book helps the reader better understand how China and it's peoples became what it is today."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"Red Azalea is a compelling memoir, even though the writing is not always engaging. The prose relies on simple declarative sentences and often seems stilted. One observation follows closely upon another; thus, a description of setting might be followed immediately by a description of mortal danger, all in the same even, subject-verb syntax. You feel like you are reading a translation, and, in a sense, you probably are, since Anchee Min knew no English when she came to the U.S. in 1984, although the memoir was written in English. (Red Azalea was published in 1994.) Interestingly, she does not use quotation marks for a character's speech, but does use them for the numerous quotations from Chairman Mao, which has the effect of making Mao a powerful presence in the book. Two things make the book compelling. One is the sheer force of the events of the Cultural Revolution, particularly Min's depiction of her childhood and of her time on Red Fire Farm. The other is her eye for detail, like the bright red underwear hung out to dry in the spartan barracks of the collective farm. Min's recollections of sexual repression (and expression) during the Cultural Revolution are interesting. Such sexual puritanism is exactly what George Orwell's character Julia rebels against in the totalitarian society of his novel 1984, written in 1949, the year Mao came to power."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"Essentially this is a book written for the Americans. While the narrator's account of her struggle in the Communist society hits close to a home-run, the graphic portrayal of the main character sexuality leaves an obscure taste in one's mind- a true piece of true Chinese literature would never be so visually explicit, even in communicating the most intimate passion."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"I've never read a book so fast. I was at work when I read it but I just couldn't stop until I finished. When I read, &quot;reads like a novel&quot; I almost put it back because I don't normally read fiction but I'm really glad I got it. This book is amazing. This book deals with such powerful personal feelings. It's too bad that many people who've reviewed it here seem to have glossed over the point of Anchee's feelings. After reading it I was speechless. One of the things I liked best about the book is she talks about the hope and joy when things are at its worst. Not because it's uplifting or anything, but because it shows how the small joys become so important as to become obsessive.It's a feeling that cannot be easily described. Nor can the book. Reading the book was a beautiful experience and I would highly recomend it to anyone who's interested in anything. I will buy whatever she sells. Anyone know where I can find her photos and paintings? doreme66@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"I have read the book in one day and it was really amazing how impressed I was.

I could feel the pain in her heart and the darkness inside her. It made me cried and laughed at the same time. I wish i could meet the author some days. i felt like reading the book another time. Its sad and beatiful full of interest in each readers mind. at first starting reading it, it took me forever but when i was half way I wish this book will never end."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"The author reveals much about Communist China's impact on family life, self esteem and the will to survive. It's incredible to think these atrocities occured in our lifetime. They seem so distant until you read this book. This account brings the realities of the harsh Chinese lifestyle to light and make you feel grateful to be residing in the United States."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"After I read the first page of this book, I couldn't believe what I was reading. For instance, the graphic details with her family's disturbing neighbors, and the accusations made on her mother by the whole town. If anything even remotely close like that ever happened to me, I wouldn't take it. Because nice people will probably be reading this, I won't go into detail. On a brighter note, this book helped me understand communism much better. It was a very blurry picture to me before. This book also helped me take what rights I do have in the US (that most people, including myself, take for granted), and understand them with so much more appreciation. I definitely recommend reading this book. Its for your own good."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"This is a wonderful book. Ms. Min keeps you turning the pages because you want to learn more about her characters and where they are going. She really makes you care about these people. She describes well what it was like to live in China during the Cultural Revolution. As an avid book reader who has found many flawed books, I must say that not only is this NOT one of them, it has become a favorite."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"This book is well written and shows someone living in a political and social climate very different than ours; it does a good job showing how the author felt as she starts by believing in the Cultural Revolution and as her experiences progressed grew dissolusioned and bitter. It shows the true emotions and attitudes of someone living through this time period on the inside. I disagree with the reviewer who believes the China of today is much the same; I am visiting China right now and it is much changed."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"I bought this book after I had read Memoirs of a Geisha. I was looking to find another book that was just as good. While this book was not anything like MofG it was still a great read.Anchee Min is an awesome write. At times I couldn't believe she was willing to let the reader know some things that many authors may have kept private.Min gives great detail of what growing up under the leadership of Mao was like for a small child-then teen. It's hard to belive that life in the 60's could be so different in China that it was in the U.S. The part of the book that will keep its readers attention is when she goes to live and work as slave labor (even though she believes that she is being guided to a better life by Mao) at the Red Fire Farm.I agree with another reviewer when they say this book is heartbreaking and erotic. Although this book is normally found in the fiction section of the book store, I think it is helpful in teaching the readers about what China and Mao were actually like.Min is an author that should be noticed for her work as well as her survival. I hope that she will continue writing for many years to come."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"In Red Azalea, Anchee Min creates a vivid image of growing up in China at the height of Communist rule under Mao. She became leader of the little Red Guard as part of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution and eagerly demonstrated her devotion to the Party. The real story begins when she is seperated from her family and sent of to the Red Fire Farm,a dreadful work camp, durring her teen years. Life under Mao was a struggle for survival where the individual's needs were not considered. In her writting, Min does not show disrespect for those in powere, but rather describes the poverty and condition of the counrty. Min's fate took a remarkable turn one day when she was chosen from many girls to become and actress in training. This account is easy to read yet the concepts are deep and meaningful. Her life makes the reader think about their own fortunes or perhaps misfortunes. Red Azalea is a beautiful autobiography that creates a powerful sense of life in China during the country's most heartbreaking time."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"Anchee Min's book is very subtle and I am impressed not only by what she reveals about China in the Maoist era, but also by what she hints at throughout the book. I wonder if other readers get the same sense that she holds back as much as she offers.If the book is a memoir and not fiction, then the mysterious Supervisor must be a real person. I am intrigued by the parallels between the Supervisor, whose name she is never told, and Jiang Ching, whom she says she has never met. Did Anchee Min ever meet Madame Mao? Why does the Supervisor provoke the same feelings she has for Yan?Anchee Min's lack of quotation marks and blending of dialogue in paragraphs made it tricky to keep straight who said what. I wonder if this was purposeful--to keep enough ambiguity in the writing to protect the identities. Certainly an American editor would have pointed out the conventions of print dialogue.The ending of the memoir is also a puzzle, since it seems to end on such a despairing note for the rights of women in China. The gender equality that Red Azalea (the fictional heroine of the opera)seems to represent is finally and permanently suppressed with the imprisonment of Madame Mao.Yet I wonder how the author rose above these social conditions and her own despair, during the years that followed the book, and escaped to the United States. Wouldn't she have needed help to get across the ocean?Details of these crucial years, and whatever events may have led to her coming to the United States, are not included. Indeed, the letter from the friend from the U.S.A. seems to be a deus ex machina that doesn't quite explain the situation for me. Why don't we hear about this friend in the course of the narration?There is more to the story than Anchee Min has revealed. I hope she will someday write about her voyage to America."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"One of the best literary books I have read about the intersection of large political forces and individual human character. Stunningly written, in a clear, deceptively simple voice that goes down like water but affects you like vodka--intoxicating, heart-stopping. I keep buying new copies because I loan it enthusiastically to friends who never return it. Only read this if you are interested in the dark, harsh side of human nature--and in redemption. (However, *the* best book I know in this category is Under a Cruel Star, Heda Kovaly--a must read.)"},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"The story of a woman coming of age in Communist China. A must-read for anyone who has ever wondered what it's like to be an ordinary person in that society. Brief moments and small details show hints of the whole picture: a brother named &quot;Space Conqueror,&quot; a tender moment in bed with a lover who says, &quot;Let's do a self-criticism,&quot; a mother who is punished for bad calligraphy.Following the author as she grows through childhood accepting Maoist tenets with all her heart, into a young adulthood within a system that denies every bit of individuality, we see the inhumanity of the world she lives in. Her endurance and ability to survive as a part of the machine, and a despised part at that, are astounding.The simple, stark language is not to everyone's taste, as is clear from previous reviews. To me, it was the right way to tell the story of a few moments of activity among days upon years of drudgery."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"So insitefull and overwhelmingly honest. Intense. It's impossible to imagine anyone could have had a life like that. I burned through each page and was so impressed by this book I ordered everything in Amazon's catalog written by Anchee Min. Of all the books written on modern Chinese culture that I have read, this one seemed to have the biggest impact on me. I would even rate it more insitefull than \\"Death of a Red Heroin\\" (with regret because I loved that story)."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"Others have described the plot and characters so I will limit my review to my recommendation...I suggest that you read this book and follow-up with Becoming Madame Mao. Both are painful, page turning must reads. I have loaned both books out and received VERY positive feedback. I also read \\"Katherine\\" by the same author but it really can't compare to this one.This book will change how you feel about your own life and perhaps give you a greater appreciation of the political and personal struggles in China."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"A powerful, beautiful, achingly honest book. I was blown away when I first read this book. Beauty and pain co-exist side by side in this firsthand account of growing up under the Mao revolution. An extremely moving account of essentially what it's like to live under oppression. This book stayed in my memory for a long time."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"I finished the book in 2 days...I could've finished it in one but I'm a student so I couldn't finish it as early as planned. However, I love this book! I love Anchee Min..she is definetly my favorite author. I bought almost all her books. One of the book I really liked is Empress Orchid."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"Red Azalea is a wonderfully written book by Anchee Min. Her narrative is rich in description as it takes the reader into her world during Mao's reign. This was the first book I read about that period in China where we see how people had to camouflage their emotions in such a hard and cruel world. As a child growing up in the 70's, the rhetoric used scared everyone to think that the people in China were robots who didn't feel. I thought the Chinese lacked human emotion because I did not realize just how oppressive the government was on its people.Reading Anchee Min's book revealed that under the blanket of fear were real human emotions alive and bubbling during such a repressive time. I highly recommend this book to everyone in order to understand the human element of the Chinese during the last years of the cultural revolution!"},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"This story is beautifully written and compelling to the extreme. Freedom is a gift that I personally often take for granted. I learned so much from this book about a culture so different from ours, that it made me very sad to think that this was real and not fiction."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"Anchee Min's story is a remarkable tale of survival and unbelievable strength.

I recommend this book to anyone interested in Chinese history."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"I think I walked around in a daze for days after reading this book.I found Anchee's first part is a little choppy as I grew accustomed to her style. From part two on, I was her captive - unwilling to put the book down for a moment. I fell into her beautiful language and wept for the emotions that rose in me, especially during her experiences with Yan in the labor camps. I ached for her sadness and was uplifted by her hope. The book changed me - the mark of a truly wonderful author. You owe it to yourself to read this book."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"The story and her experience was very interesting, at times enthralling. However, at times, usually the most critical, her writing style would fall very short of what one wanted.Describing a very intimate, vivid experience in short, basic sentences grew old with me very quickly.I hope maybe her writing, and perhaps her relationship with her editor, has grown over time, as I am going to check out her other books."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"Book had great momentum,... at the end it slowed a bit. But was a great book,... some of the romance was a bit too much for me. A good illustration of living thru the cultural revolution.....All in all a good one RECOMENDED"},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"Anchee Min could be a somewhat decent writer if only she was so self-conscious and self-indulgent. This shows in the early parts of the book, where Min casually portrays the grand tragedy of the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution years via small, personal sorrows. The bizarre, forced relocation of her family and the tale of her pet chicken shine with the subtly humorous depth of the personal farce. Later, the passing portrayals of her parents and neighbors exhibit a similar tender insight.The problem arises when Min steps in front of her own camera, so to speak. The aspiring starlet can only manage Maoist opera-style overacting and melodrama, losing her coherency of narrative in her eagerness to be the tragic heroine. It is the rare writer who can pull off an unironic first person narrative without waxing self-important. Like other contemporary Chinese women writers, such as Hong Ying and Wei Hui, Anchee Min is unaware of how tiresome navel-staring can be in literature.Moreover, while description is essential to a story, Red Azeala relies excessively on flowerly language, falling ever deeper in its mire until the final chapters, which are unreadable for all the decaying rose petals the author buries us in. That sort of exotic erotic orientalized imagery may sell books, but it also destroys their integrity."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"An engaging and emotional account of a young woman's struggle to escape the confines of the Cultural Revolution. Miss Min draws the reader in to her life in such a way that the reader feels her pain and joys. The book reads well at a consistent pace until the end. Unfortunately, Miss Min ends her story abruptly. There is no transition that takes the reader out of Communist China and to the U.S. The pace of the book changes dramatically in the last several pages, leaving the reader hungry for all that happens in between the death of Mao and Miss Min's arrival in the U.S"},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"I enjoyed reading Red Azalea even while squirming at the control and lack of sensitivity of the Communists, the Red Brigade and the way people believed in Mao and his Little Red Book. It is very scary to see that a country with such an enormous population could get to this state. I would really like a book by Min about leaving China and how she felt when she came to the U. S. Is she a citizen?"},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"While I was fascinated and often frustrated by the experiences with Chinese communism, especially during the Maoist era, that Min has written so eloquently about, I have read and re-read her novel simply to take in the tantilizing details of her love affair with her commanding officer Yan. I am currently doing research on female homosexual relationships in China, and Red Azalea acts as an incredible source of information regarding Chinese attitudes towards homosexuality in the twentieth century.It turns out, contrary to what other reviewers have posted, that homosexuality is feared as much, if not more, in China than in the United States. I experienced this firsthand while studying in Beijing last year. While it is true that there are no religious barriers for homosexuals in China and Taiwan, there exist a multitude of other societal disagreements with homosexuality. Research is showing me, however, that this was not always the case. Female homosexual relationships in particular were tolerated and accepted in Chinese dynastic times. The drastic change in public opinion about homosexuality is due largely in part to Western influence, both in terms of religion and Western sexology, which was for the most part developed during the Victorian era.Min's novel is a heart-breaking example of the shame surrounding homosexual relationships that many womnen in China face on a daily basis. While physical closeness and indeed female homosexuality are common in modern day China, this does not indicate that society has accepted homosexual relationships back into the realm of the normal."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"Anchee Min tells the story of her experiences in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Most Americans understand too little about the Chinese political situation, and Ms. Min's story can help us to understand the human side of the story, the suffering and humiliation suffered by so many.Unfortunately, her story doesn't bring much new to the table, except perhaps the lesbian aspect of her sexuality. This aspect remains unexplored, and instead seems almost inserted as an afterthought, for the purposes of titillation rather than real exploration.There are many books about the Cultural Revolution. If one is interested in Ms. Min's story, they would do well to use it as a starting point for reading, rather than as a destination in itself. Too much is left unsaid; the situation leading to the Cultural Revolution was incredibly complex.As light history, Ms. Min's book is interesting, but her writing is often stiff and without the fire that moves the rea! der."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"A VERY OUTSTANDING STORY....FROM COMMUNIST CHINA, WITH ALL THE HARDSHIPSAND BEING FRIENDLESS STRUGGLE WITH LIFE IN A NEW CHINA.LOVE READING ITEVERY MINUTE...HARD TO PUT DOWN."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"Having read Becoming Madame Mao before reading Red Azalea blunted the impact. Both essentially use the same plot background. Nevertheless, Red Azalea was a good (and easy) read. The narration almost carries a feeling of a monotone in the telling but the blunt force of the brutal Mao regime balances any intimacies. We need to remind ourselves from what the Chinese are now recovering--and that cruelty and incredible backwardness still lingers in that society. That passion which is revealed is sad, for it comes from great loneliness and lack of family.I'm curious as to how Anchee Min got through the process of coming to the U.S. and what her life has since become. I'd like to know more about her parents and how her siblings fared. I was left hanging."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"Anchee Min's story of growing up in post-cultural revolution China is a beautiful and compelling narrative that grows on you the more you read. Her prose style, bare and abrupt, echoes the environment in which she grew up and helps to set the tone and the mood. Intensely emotional scenes are rendered in a distant, removed fashion that serves to highlight both the depths of the emotion and the overwhelming necessity to keep that emotion hidden and controlled.The strength of the prose and the compelling nature of the story are almost enough to make up for the sudden, unsatisfying ending. It is impossible to read a story this engaging without wanting to know more about how all the characters fared in the end. Min ends her story right after the death of Mao and the disgrace of Madame Mao. She tells us that she spent another six years in China before moving to the United States, but those six years are summarized only briefly, and we never learn what happend to her one-time lover, Yan, or the mysterious &quot;Supervisor&quot; who had such a strong influence on her career and her life. Nor do we learn anything about what happened to the other members of her family.All in all, the book is stunning and powerful, and highly recommended despite the unsatisfying ending"},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"Red Azalea is a memoir of Anchee Min's life as she grew into a young woman during the time of Chairman Mao's rule. It is a good stand-alone book, or a companion book with Jung Chang's Wild Swans. This is an autobiography that reads like a novel and kept me turning the pages to see how her life would progress. Her writing style is smooth, and easy to read, her passions, fears, sorrows, despair, and her strength of will are all laid bare with honesty and passion. If you have read Wild Swans, you will have a clear understanding of the story behind her telling. If this is your first book dealing with life under Chairman Mao, and you would like to learn more about the history and life of the Chinese people during Chairman Mao's time, then follow this book with Jung Chang's Wild Swans."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"Red Azalea by Anchee Min is an autobiography of a young woman's life in China under the regiment of Chairman Mao.It begins when she is 5 years old and already having to look after her younger sisters and brother while her parents work.Life in China is extremely repressive with the possibility of anyone being a spy who will report you as a reactionary to the party.Sexual expression is forbidden outside of marriage, and the party decides when or if you will marry. Romantic love is considered a bourgoise lie.Anchee is raised on Madame Mao aka Comrade Jiang Ching's operas of revolutionary heroines for the rise of Communism. Any other form of entertainment expression doesn't exist in China. Everything is for the good of the people's party.The Party decides how you can best serve. The Party assigns what job you will do.At sixteen, Anchee is sent to a large, communal farm. There, she makes an emotional and sexual connection with a woman she greatly admires.However, it seemed to me the two women did not necessarily have lesbian sexual orientations. It was more a matter of two people starved for human love and contact in a harsh, barren world.Eventually Anchee is choosen to be an instrument in furthur spreading the message of Communism. This takes her into a different world from what she has known with her parents or at the communal farm.However, when Chairman Mao dies, everything falls apart. Chariman Mao's wife, Comrade Jiang Ching has powerful enemies. I think this is a good book, and well worth reading. It gives a great deal of insight into what life was like in China at that time. And, from all indictations, it is very similiar today."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"I read three of Anchee Min's other novels before this - the Empress duology and Becoming Madame Mao. Compared to these, this book is not as good, especially since Min uses a lot of short sentences, so some parts almost feel like 'See Spot Run'. This offers a nice firsthand account of the Cultural Revolution, but does not offer a whole picture - not that Min can be blamed, since she had been confined to Red Fire Farm so much. I do wish she could have provided more detail on her home life - what was it like for her and her family to live in just two rooms after being forced out of their bigger apartment?I wish that Ms. Min could have focused a little more on her family, childhood, and outside events, because compared to 'Empress Orchid', this book comes out as rather dry and lacking when it comes to description. If you're new to Anchee Min, I recommend that you read Empress Orchid before this book. It's a enjoyable read, but not the best memoir."},{"Title":"Red Azalea: Life and Love in China","review":"I'm not really sure what to make of this book. It was very powerful and personal.

However, the authors, for some reason have felt it necessary to rename simple ideas with more complicated, and often hard to recall language. For instance, procedures to reduce problem behaviors are called \\"practical reductive techniques\\" (basically punishment with a moral lesson) and the \\"compliance Matrix Program\\" is just bingo for good behavior. In one summary the authors mention the technique of \\"maximizing antecedents through precision request\\" and I really have no idea what they are talking about...unless I go back and find out that what they are really saying (I think): is stop problems before they happen by being specific about what you want. The title \\"The Tough Kid\\" is crystal clear; I only wish the rest of the book was as succinct."},{"Title":"The Tough Kid Book: Practical Classroom Management Strategies","review":"Lots of great tips and ideas for motivating and engaging 'tough kids'.

The Scarsdale diet was doing high protein before Atkins was out of medical school. This diet is a combination of the high protein philosophy with low fat ideas. I always refer back to Scarsdale when I have to lose that extra 10 pounds, and he never lets me down!"},{"Title":"The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet: Plus Dr. Tarnower's Lifetime Keep-Slim Program","review":"I have never had the will power to say no to a cookie or a big slice of cheesy pizza. After reading this book and going on the diet, I lost 7 pounds in one week. Never in my life had I ever imagined a diet this painless and with such quick results! There was no fatigue, but I did miss my milk and sugar in coffee and jelly on my toast. I am still on the diet with about 25 more pounds to lose but it will be a quick trip..."},{"Title":"The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet: Plus Dr. Tarnower's Lifetime Keep-Slim Program","review":"This diet is very easy and quick. The food changes daily, and you are never bored. And about low carb, this diet isn't entirely low carb. For example, DAY TWO for lunch you can eat all the fruit salad you want. Thus, lots of carbs. Plus, for dinner one night you can have all the steamed veggies you want. So if you aren't sure of low-carb or have failed because of cravings, this diet is better and healthier as it incorporates fruits and veggies, and lean meats vs. high fat and cheap fatty meats. Great diet!"},{"Title":"The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet: Plus Dr. Tarnower's Lifetime Keep-Slim Program","review":"I have used this diet for over 20 years. When I gain weight, it is the only one that works for me."},{"Title":"The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet: Plus Dr. Tarnower's Lifetime Keep-Slim Program","review":"I know of ppl who have had great success with this diet. I have taken off about 20 pounds, and I could have taken off much much more if I stuck with the diet religiously.This is definately a way of eating that I could feel comfortable with for a lifetime. Whats great about it is that it isn't overly restricting like the Atkins diet- therefore I don't have the crazy urge to binge on sugars unnecessarily... Whats even better is that I CAN allow myself to a treat once in a while with little or no consequences (weight gain), and in the cases where I do overdo it and eat too much junk, I can quickly take the weight off the very next day :)Now, as far as the book goes, it isn't as entertaining and convincing as I'd like a diet/weight loss book to be. Instead, check out some support groups for the SMD on Yahoo Clubs."},{"Title":"The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet: Plus Dr. Tarnower's Lifetime Keep-Slim Program","review":"This book has worked better for me than any of the current best selling $40 diet books out there. I have been off of this diet for at least 9 months now and without ever working out or dieting. I first whent from 220lbs to 197lbs in less then 2 months. And 9 months later I am jumping back and forth from 200 to 205 lbs. If you still want to call that a Yo-Yo diet then I guess I am hapy with this YoYo.This is not a diet for everyone. It takes 100% will power and, trust me... You will have to fight to stay on it. But if I could do it. So can you!!! Trust me! I can recall me cheating and eating some mexican food for lunch and/or dinner. I did not fallow the book to the &quot;T&quot; But with me cheating with only one meal a day it worked!Just the other day my friend, who hates to say I am right. Asked me for this book. He asked me if I was still on it and I said not for 9 months and he said &quot;WoW&quot;. So I gave the book to him. I dont think he will have the will power to fallow the first 2 weeks. But I have enough trust in Scarsdale that evin if he cheats more then I did he will still lose the weight. I plan on buying this book for all the women I know. This book is just that good. I laugh at people on South beach and Atkins. This book putes all the over priced books and ideas to shame."},{"Title":"The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet: Plus Dr. Tarnower's Lifetime Keep-Slim Program","review":"This book contains the \\"original\\" low carb diet.

He was an overweight guy (26years of age) Very unhappy with himself because of his weight. He had tried several diets but to no avail. This book changed his life. He regained his confidence, got back his sex appeal and now 19 years later is still going strong. My new partner needs to trim a little so I am repurchasing the book for him. I will go on the diet with him (not because I need to lose weight- but purely for the fun of going on it with him.) The food variety is great.Well worth the investment!!!"},{"Title":"The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet: Plus Dr. Tarnower's Lifetime Keep-Slim Program","review":"I first bought this book in 1980 when I was on a sabbatical in New York. I had read about the demise of Dr. Tarnower in the newspapers and was just curious. I have adopted his recommendations and i keep track of my weight, dieting for 2 weeks once in a while, whenever my scales show 2kg more than my usual weight. This was easily done, notwithstanding the life style of a hospital medical doctor which I have led all those years. I am 69 years old now and this still works.

He is correct. I have weighed myself periodically and on average I've lost 1 pound per day since starting the diet. I really like the fact that each meal is planned for you. This diet seems to be similar to the Atkin's diet but it is much more flexible than that one in my opinion. The protein bread toasted tastes pretty good. The best part of this diet is that you only have to stay on it for 2 weeks. The following 2 weeks you monitor your food intake, with even more flexibility in food choices and basically eat healthy. If you still need to lose more weight, then you return to the 2 weeks on portion (which I plan to do). I really like this approach to weight loss and as the Doctor says in the book \\"It works!\\". I don't have anything negative to say about his approach. I wish more doctors would provide plans to patients who need to lose weight, like they used to in the \\"old days\\". But now that the doctors are so hurried, it is good that we can still go back to how things use to be and get this book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet: Plus Dr. Tarnower's Lifetime Keep-Slim Program","review":"I read about this diet on low carb friends after a few posters had phenomenal success on it, losing 40-50 pounds in 1-2 months and loving the food. I found the diet on the internet and followed it for about a week and a half. I lost 13 pounds. Unfortunately, I had a persistent cocktail habit that derailed me.I kept going back to Atkins over and over, but it stopped working for me. Why? Too many calories! Too much freedom to eat too much food.The truth is, you've got to get your body used to eating less. You have to just gut it out, do it strictly without \\"treats\\" and lowcarb cocktails and lowfat iced cream, and get back to basics: mostly lean meats, tons of fruits and veggies.With an ingenious diet, Tarnower accomplishes just that by retraining the mind and body to eat less, eat lighter, and love it. Yeah, its painful at first! You're hungry! But once you start fat-burning, it feels great. I'm going into it with the attitude that I'm basically in boot camp. :)"},{"Title":"The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet: Plus Dr. Tarnower's Lifetime Keep-Slim Program","review":"I read in the internet about this diet and bought the book.

Is it easy--no, but for someone like me who has a sugar addiction and can't seem to have ANY without it sending me into a sugar binge, this diet does the trick. It's written in an easy to read and understand format. If you follow it--you WILL lose weight--and in noticeable amounts. And the weight seems to come off in all the right places too!

I have 3 small children and no time to exercise. My mother gave me a copy of this book 12 years ago to remove weight that had piled on in Europe. It worked great and now that I am done breastfeeding my 3rd child, I plan on using this to get off the rest of my pregnancy weight, I have already lost 16 lbs. I find the menus to be simple to follow and easy to prepare. I grill all my meats so that they have a great flavour and lose the excess fat. I really love GOOD Food so I do have to discipline myself. This diet is great for you if you have little time for yourself and a spouse in grad school who's not about. Plus, I can feed it to my children with little complaint. Just add some homebaked Scarsdale Protein bread (which I made in my machine)or a potato with butter and they'll gobble up the rest. Also use good lettuce like romaine and fresh tomatoes. Dress up the salads with Balsamic vinegar and use pink grapefruits as opposed to plain. I have also noticed you can use cucumber slices as a snack as well. I snack on Veggies all day and still lose at least a pound a day! This diet is much better than Atkins."},{"Title":"The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet: Plus Dr. Tarnower's Lifetime Keep-Slim Program","review":"I could write a book on how much I appreciate this book. I'm somewhat frustrated with people who look at this &quot;diet&quot; as a fad diet. If you read the book, you will realize that is meant to be a lifetime change in eating. I was on the diet some time ago and unfortunately did not remain on the &quot;keep trim&quot; plan, so I did the usual yo-yo thing. Finally, I decided to try it again. I lost over 60 pounds (some yo-yo huh?); my husband lost 45. We are at our goal weights and weigh every day as the book suggests, so that we don't regain more than 5 pounds before getting back on track. It is a low carbohydrate diet (as in &quot;complex&quot; carbs NOT no carbs - a common misconception). Reasons I was successful with the diet: 1) It's real food I can purchase at my local grocery store and feed to my family and guests; 2) It does not involve counting calories or measuring/weighing food; 3) No daily requirement of water to drink, sending you to the bathroom for the duration. The book also contains variations in the two-week program and suggestions, recipes, Q&amp;A, etc. that are very helpful and motivating.

On any diet I have been on, I have never lost 9lbs. in one week. I am now on my second week and still seeing results.

Wrong it did work and it worked fast, which is what I needed to see, to keep me on it. My first 2 weeks on the plan, I lost 20 lbs. Then the 2nd 2 wks. on again, I lost 12.5 lbs. The following 2 wks on, I lost less than the 12.5, But... atleast I was losing, and feeling better and better. I really got into the program. I had my son take pictures of me from before starting the diet, to all during my weight loss. I kept them in my own special photo album, and dated the front on each picture. It truly is amazing to see how fast the weight came off. (78 lbs.) There are of course days that you don't lose anything and boy was I disappointed on those days. But still it was fun to see the look on people's faces that hadn't seen me for say a month or two or esp. three! I too, have given out copies of the book. Mostly because People wanted MY book and I wasn't about to part with it. Now here's the truth ---&gt; if you are prone to being overweight, you must forever watch what you eat. Don't think that once you lose the weight you want to, that your problem is over, it will NEVER be over. Once you start eating like you did before, the weight will come back ----&gt; I KNOW!!!

With 15 baby pounds left to lose, I'm going back on next week!Tips:- You WILL be Desperately Hungry, despite what the good doctor says, especially for the first 3 days or so until you adjust. Try diet sodas to help assuage this.- You must exercise. I found that I did not lose weight on the days that I didn't run a couple of miles. The diet is very low calorie and your metabolism will adjust accordingly if you don't kick it into gear.- The \\"Fruit salad every day\\" may hinder your weight loss.

When I happened upon this book in a stack at the back of my closet, I thought I'd re-read it from that perspective.First, a few words about the diet itself: Written in the 1970s by New York cardiologist Herman Tarnower (who was murdered a few years after the hugely successful book was published), the Scarsdale Medical Diet is really a two page, two week, low fat, low carbohydrate, higher protein diet. For some people it works well. For others it may not. Tarnower's diet is more healthy-seeming than Atkins' in that it includes some complex carbohydrates such as bread and fruits, but that point is arguable, I'm sure. It also bridges the gap somewhat between Atkins' wide-open, free choice (within strict bounds) diet and the minutely-detailed diets often sold by &quot;weight loss centers,&quot; in that it lists what should be eaten by meal by day, but stops at prescribing how much of everything. (Certain items are quantity limited; for example, breakfast is one slice of &quot;protein bread&quot; and one half grapefruit or fruit in season.) Another interesting wrinkle is Tarnower's admonition to remain on the diet for two weeks, take off (and eat sensibly) for two weeks, and return to the diet for two more weeks if needed. After the initial session, Tarnower offers variety in his meal suggestions, with international, gourmet, vegetarian and other options.As history, this book is certainly more interesting. When Tarnower wrote this book, U.S. society had not yet completely fallen under the control of the processed foodstuffs conglomerates. Indeed, one often bought a twelve-ounce bottle of a carbonated beverage and had to worry about how to keep the product fizzy between servings. Contrast that to today's Super Big Gulp-sized servings of carbonated (and sugar- or chemical-laden) beverages! Exercise, too, was an entirely different undertaking in the 1970s. Very few people actually worked out at a gymnasium, and almost no women lifted weights or participated in sports. (Some things have changed for the better!) People jogged or played tennis for exercise. Tarnower suggests walking, especially for the aged (anyone over forty fell into that category), as sufficient exercise. Eating out was still a special occasion, not a regular part of daily life. Reading this book is a reminder of those days.In summary, the Scarsdale diet may or may not help one to lose weight. The book is moderately interesting as a part of the body of work comprising weight-loss history; I certainly wouldn't suggest buying a book for a diet plan that is freely available on the Internet. In all likelihood, the best way to be healthier and more fit is to follow the tried and true four word plan that's always worked: Eat less, exercise more."},{"Title":"The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet: Plus Dr. Tarnower's Lifetime Keep-Slim Program","review":"I was a faithful follower of the Scarsdale Diet in my twenties and thirties. It NEVER failed to work. Any time I needed to shed some pounds quickly, I could always count on it and I'm one who has always had a hard, long time losing weight. However, my body has changed as I've aged and the last time I tried it, I could only do it for four days before I had a horrific acid response. As promised, the diet puts your body into a state of ketosis, which is a state of acidity, and which for me now, is painful and detrimental. I've NEVER had acid reflux in my life--at least not until I tried this diet again (after a 10-year absence). I followed the diet to the letter and by \\"Friday,\\" my chest and esophagus felt like they were on fire, I was throwing up digestive acids and could not keep anything down for a week. My brother's nutritionist was astounded that I would deliberately put my body into a state of ketosis and recommended I try an alkaline diet to recover from the damage done by Scarsdale. In about another week the burning sensations stopped, but buyer, BEWARE. Anything that is not alkaline is acidic, and if you're sensitive to acidic foods, this diet is not for you."},{"Title":"The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet: Plus Dr. Tarnower's Lifetime Keep-Slim Program","review":"Dr. Tarnower created what might be the worlds healthiest diet back in the late 1970's. Since he was a cardiologist his primary concern was, of course, with the ticker. The book is written in plain english so lay persons, like myself, may understand it. The only problem I have is with who is given the very first acknowledgement in the begining of the book. Jean Harris is thanked for her help with getting the book published. Since Jean Harris is also the person who shot Dr. Tarnower five times, and eventhough this sounds redondant I will say it anyway, and killed him, one year after the book was published, I see no reason why the acknowledgement to her was not deleted from all future printings.I know Amazon.com has nothing to do with the printing of the books they sell, but, well, you asked for my opinion so I gave it to you."},{"Title":"The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet: Plus Dr. Tarnower's Lifetime Keep-Slim Program","review":"I have been using The Complete Scarsdale Medical Diet since it was first published, and have gone through two books.

However, Flik's got one problem... he's a bit of a clutz... he shows children and adults that standing up for what you believe in and never giving up is the best way to live life. I'm fourteen, I love the book and the movie, and I WILL be seeing the movie, as well as reading the book, again and again.

There is also a really fun bit of animation of Dot from a very talented animator, Karen Kiser. I only wish they would make more of these books, from &quot;A Bug's Life&quot; and other animated films. Flipbooks are the simplest way to look at animation; frame by frame, page by page. I highly recommend this book for anyone (especially kids) interested in animation.

Naturally, we need to find unusual words in order to stump our colleagues. This book is the answer. Great fun to browse, as well."},{"Title":"Mrs. Byrne's dictionary of unusual, obscure, and preposterous words: Gathered from numerous and diverse authoritative sources","review":"Mrs. Byrne's dictionary is indeed rich with useful and uncommon terms. In a quick at random browsing through the dictionary I checked and compared Byrane's headwords to other sources as Franklin's electronic-dictionary Merriam-Webster MWD-1500, which has 400,000 definitions and 500,000 synonyms; and M-W's Unabridged Dictionary ISBN #: 978-0517151419. I chose 13 terms present in Byrne's dictionary which were omitted in the electronic-dictionary and looked them up in M-W's Unabridged Dictionary; out of the 13 terms listed below, only 2 terms were found (\\"pervicacious\\" and \\"oniomania\\" ), the 13 therms were : \\"philalethe\\" one who loves to forget; \\"humstrum\\" second rate or defective musical instrument; \\"maschalephidroasis\\" massive sweating of the armpits; \\"gapo\\" forest near a river which is partly inundated every rainy season; \\"genicon\\" sexual partner imagined by one who is dissatisfied with her actual partner; \\"geromorphism\\" condition of appearing older than one is; \\"pervicacious\\" extremely obstinate, willful; \\"philauty\\" self-love, selfishness; \\"philalethist\\" a truth-lover; \\"oniomania\\" a mania for buying things; \\"kinology\\" physic of motion; \\"musard\\" absentminded, dreamer or a fool; \\" monepic\\" consisting of one word or of one word sentences. To my surprise Windows' word processor does not recognize the above 13 terms either, each one of these headwords has a misspelled red line beneath it.From the above one realizes that Byrne's dictionary consists of useful but very rare terms taken from any field one can think of. Since these terms are of seldom daily usage in speech, journalism and literature; here actually lies the disadvantage of terms being organized in an alphabetical order, as is in Byrne's dictionary . To begin with it's unlikely that you'll encounter with most of these misunderstood words, therefore you won't need turn to Byrne's dictionary to check them out, secondly the alphabetic arrangement does not give you any clue on how to search for a term you have never heard of. Mrs. Byrne spent 10 years of her life to compile and define these terms pity the author didn't consider the possibility of terms' classification since the dictionary is considerably less useful without it. Suggestion for subject classification e.g.: main group of \\"behavior\\" with subgroups:\\"character\\"; \\"attitude\\"; \\"relationships\\"; \\"feelings\\", which are further divided to: happiness, sadness, anger, love etc. Other main groups could be \\"physiology\\" with subgroups of body functions (normal ,abnormal) , appearance ; additinal headgroups: \\"science\\"; \\"politic\\"; \\"sounds\\"; \\"colors\\" and so forth.Subject classification would save one from skimming the book repeatedly ,endless times, from cover to cover and he may end up empty handed too. Even with this short subjects and grouping sample, one can already classify most of the 13 terms listed above and reach them at will. I partly indexed this dictionary to access terms when needed."},{"Title":"Mrs. Byrne's dictionary of unusual, obscure, and preposterous words: Gathered from numerous and diverse authoritative sources","review":"I love this book.

Sometimes the folks make up the answers (&quot;Fear of a geography test?&quot;) but it's easy to win when you can look on page 83 and see it means &quot;fear of crossing bridges&quot;.This book is also helpful while playing Scrabble, especially if you play with a person who tends to come up with unusual words - if it's not in the Oxford and it's not in this book, it doesn't count for points in Scrabble.So buy this book and entertain your friends, torment your co-workers and tease your fellow Scrabble players with bits of information gleaned from this excellent reference book.

It can be overly violent (especially the manga) and there is some nudity and adult language and subject matter. But once you get past that it's a great sci-fi drama story with very interesting characters. I like to think of it as a story about a girl who goes through great hardships and struggles just to apologize to a young man she loves for killing his family when they were children.

I would say that I am defintely a more contented person, because developing contentment is a priority now. And in many ways I am less fearful. I am in touch with my own courage. It's inside me for sure.Definitely, reading the book and taking in what Gurumayi says and thinking about it and trying to live as she suggests, has made a tremendous difference for me.What is remarkable, that I've just realized, is that &quot;Courage and Contentment&quot; really addresses fear and greed, which have run rampant in my life and, from what I can tell, are pretty much the causes of a lot of what's happening in the world today.

With this book, I know that I ALWAYS have time to read something no matter how much time I actually have in front of me.

I have been studying Religion and Philosophy for quite a number of years now, and I must admit that having read almost all of Gurumayi's books and Muktananda's, I really understand why they are said to be amongst the most authentic and powerful Indian meditation masters of the century (cf. &quot;Encylopedie des Religions, Bayard, Paris). Any sincere seeker should read this book."},{"Title":"Courage and Contentment: A Collection of Talks on the Spiritual Life","review":"I have easily read Courage and Contentment over 10 times since I bought it in 2002. Everytime I open this book, I find EXACTLY what it is that I need to learn at that given moment. When a seeker is tuned into the Heart and is truly searching for the Truth within, Gurumayi's words are just the bridge that is needed to take one across the ocean of wordly life into Heaven on Earth. This may sound like an awful lot of praise for a simple book; however, this is not merely a 'simple book'. Although the ideas appear to be simple and the words used are easily understood by all, the writings reveal a deeper level of meaning upon each reading.I cannot express in words what a gift this book is. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for the Bliss of the Heart; for the innate joy within their very own being. Courage and Contentment is a blessing of a book, and regardless of what faith (or lack thereof) or religious background, I guarantee the reader will benefit from Gurumayi's simple, yet poignant message.Blessings."},{"Title":"Courage and Contentment: A Collection of Talks on the Spiritual Life","review":"I just ordered another copy of Courage and Contentment because I keep giving mine away. I've read this book cover to cover several times, flipped open to a page or read a chapter that is pertinent to what's going on in my life at the moment. The beauty of it is that Gurumayi's words have never failed to help me change my inner state from negative to peaceful almost instantly. The book is a treasure."},{"Title":"Courage and Contentment: A Collection of Talks on the Spiritual Life","review":"This book is one of my all time favorites.

It was Kane and Abel and after watching it for the last 22 years I have been fasinatied with that story. I did not know until 2006 that it was a book so I bought it and its sequel. I loved the Prodigal daughter although I do have some things I would have done differently. I for one who have call the book the Prodigal children with a focus on Richard childhood as well. One of my favorite things in the novel was that while FLorentyna was a Democrat Richard was a Repulican (The good kind not the crazy ones you have today.) I guess becuase although there is around a 10-15 year age difference between the chacters and my own parents that is how they are. (My favorite scene in this is when RIchard puts a Barry Goldwater bumpersticker on their car she rips it right off. ANother one is when RIchard after telling his wife that he did not cheat on her FLorentyna said \\"You should have slept with her\\" meaning RIchard's old girlfriend becuase that would have cemeted a business deal ) I also did not like fact that RIchard died and they brought in Edward WIncheaster as a second husband or that the book went into a future that never could come true. BUt then again that is nit picking. By the way a book in which a blond 60 something CHicago born woman seantor becomes the first female United States President.

The only problem with this book, is that so much of the firsthalf of the book is a review of the previous book. And it is kind of predictable..........but all in all I enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"I am a huge Archer fan, and have read most of his works. Kane & Abel was very nice, but this second installment of the series was several notches below. Almost 50% of the book is a recap of the first book (though things are narrated from Florentyna's views, but a rehash nonetheless). The second half of the book is too procedural, in the sense that anyone not knowing the American election system will be absolutely lost and bored. The second half is a little too descriptive of the electoral processes, and even otherwise there is really nothing much to the plot. Planning to now read 'Shall we tell the President'..... hope that turns out to the usual Archer affair."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"I was first given a copy of The Prodigal Daughter in high school, and have reread it several times since then. It is not only an entertaining and well-written story, it is very inspiring --especially to young women. Archer neither downplays nor exacerbates the difficulties faced by women in fields that have traditionally been dominated by men, and his chronicles of Florentyna's rise through business and politics are among the best available in fiction. Archer also does a good job of portraying the years of work that go into creating a successful political career.By the time you're finished reading the book, you almost feel exhausted yourself--but the journey is worth it."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"I thought KANE AND ABEL was one of the best books I'd ever read, so I was eagerly anticipating THE PRODIGAL DAUGHTER. Although it falls a shade short of the greatness of its predecessor, this is still an outstanding novel that reveals more about the characters I had come to love in the first book.Some may argue that Jeffrey Archer cheats the reader since approximately the first 200 pages are a recap of KANE AND ABEL. However, instead of getting the story from the viewpoint of the two men, we see the events throught the eyes of Abel's daughter Florentyna and the added insight makes the second telling of the events highly worthwhile.Florentyna Rosnovski is a formidable and unforgettable character. She endears herself to readers as a young girl through her relationship with her governess Miss Tredgold and her adventures from elementary school through college. Even the expected meeting with Richard Kane takes on new dimensions as they marry despite the deep rejection by both fathers.It was after the initial marriage and career boom that I thought the book faltered slightly. Florentyna became too perfect, everything came too easily, and even the tragic events did not seem to touch her as I would have expected. However, her rise to fame and her battle to achieve her childhood ambition by becoming President of the United States is a page-turning read, one that will surely satisfy fans of KANE AND ABEL."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"This is an excellent sequel to the consummate novel, Kane and Abel. Archer once again is at his best. He remembers to interwine key details of the book with Kane and Abel, and the reader easily recalls the suspense and the pure entertainment of Kane and Abel in Prodigal Daughter. Jeffrey Archer molds Florentyna into one of the most memorable characters written. Not many authors would have dared to write a sequel to such a superb novel like Kane and Abel, but Jeffrey Archer willingly accepts the challenge. The result is The Prodigal Daughter, and it is one of the best novels ever written."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"This sequel's not as good as Kane & Abel, but still not a bad read. Jeffrey Archer is a great storyteller and he does a good job of telling the story behind Florentyna's life from childhood to her life after her father's death. The third part of the book does get very politically heavy and I found it to be a little on the boring side. The first and second parts of the book are good pageturners. I felt this novel lacked a purposeful direction and the intrigue of Kane & Abel ."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"I found this book to be very much up to Archer's standards. To me this book was every bit as captivating as his first. This is a wonderful read for almost anyone interested in history, politics, or just in search of a great book."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"Florentyna was an exceptional girl. Born of immigrant Polish parents, one of whom become a powerful and wealthy businessman, she was tutored well, learned well, and trained well. Until she threw it all away to marry the son of her father's most bitter enemy.Richard Kane had also defied his father to marry his love, and the two were cast off without a cent into the world. However, not only do they live on love, but they forge their own business empire in the process. If Kane and Abel were rivals, but successes; only to see their greatest dream dashed at the hands of the other, Richard and Florentyna show what their father's might have achieved by working together.Indeed, together they build the empire of both their father's dreams. Both of their fathers recanted their hatred at the end, and they build together. But eventually success at business bores Florentyna, and she goes into politics.Florentyna is a success in many ways in politics. Congress, then the Senate... and the White House?Indeed, I don't know if the novel makes or breaks itself with the dirty tricks played at the end. Florentyna made her biggest mistake when she didn't outright reject one offer. Character wise, I think that is the biggest weakness of the novel. Florentyna wasn't that stupid or naive. Would it have hurt to have had her cave in if the man had outright lied (and still trapped her), and her serve her term as vice-president with no illusions about him? PLus, I have to wonder if she, faced with the end of her career, wouldn't have conceeded defeat - and then dragged down certain people as well?"},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"After reading Kane and Abel I was told that this was a sort of sequel to the book and I had to read it. Once again I loved this book and the author. Its one of those books where you just want to keep reading and never stop. I highly recommend reading Kane and Abel before reading this book so that you understand the characters more completely. This book does give a shortened introduction of the characters in the beginning but it is recommended by me that you read Kane and Abel which you will enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"Jeffrey Archer's 1980 best-seller Kane & Abel introduced readers to William Kane and Abel Rosnovski, two boys from vastly different circumstances and opposite ends of the world who grew up to profoundly affect early twentieth-century America. In The Prodigal Daughter, Archer continues the story of these two men and carries it on to the next generation.Archer's storytelling technique is in some ways archaic, relying heavily on narrative prose and shunning contemporary \\"rules\\" about showing versus telling. He is able to pull it off, however, partly because most he earned his reputation in previous decades before the evolution of the modern thriller and partly because his colloquial voice and strong characters make his books a pure pleasure to read even without much action or dialog.The Prodigal Daughter is the story of Florentyna Rosnovski, daughter of hotel baron Abel Rosnovski. At the end of Kane & Abel, Florentyna fall in love with Richard Kane, the son of her father's arch-enemy, banker William Kane. The sequel begins by backing the story up twenty years and painting a picture of Florentyna's childhood. The story doesn't actually catch up to the end of the first book until about halfway through.As the story continues, Florentyna and Richard marry, against the wishes of both of their powerful fathers. They are cut off from their families' fortunes and must start life on their own. Florentyna starts a fashion shop, while Richard begins building a reputation for himself in the banking industry. By the time they reconcile with their aging fathers, the young couple have managed to become wealthy on their own merit. After their fathers are dead, Florentyna becomes chairman of the Baron Group, her father's hotel chain, and Richard ends up on the board of Lester's, his father's bank. The middle part of the book, then, focuses on their experiences in corporate life.When Florentyna decides to run for political office, their lives change yet again, and the last part of the book details her various campaigns, her time in Congress, and the nation's response to the first serious female contender for president of the United States.Through it all, Archer adds a touch of realism through ties to real-life events and public figures, placing the story within its historical context. As always, his primary strength is his characters, and he puts them in situations that make them highly sympathetic and believable. Readers who have enjoyed Archer's other books--particularly those who liked Kane & Abel--will appreciate this continuation of a story they may have resonated with. Readers who are more accustomed to contemporary political and corporate thrillers, however, may find it difficult to engage with Archer's style."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"This is an excellent sequel to the novel, Kane and Abel. Archer once again is at his best. He remembers to intertwine key details of the book with Kane and Abel, and the reader easily recalls the suspense and the pure entertainment of Kane and Abel in Prodigal Daughter. Jeffrey Archer molds Florentyna into a very memorable character. Not many authors would have even tried to write a sequel Kane and Abel, but Jeffrey Archer makes a triumph of challenge. The result is The Prodigal Daughter. While it lacks some of the intensity of K&A, it is well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"This is a soap opera. If you enjoy reading about romanticized daily life you will no doubt find this book interesting.I was expecting an action novel. It isn't here. I waded through about half the book and then gave up.

The other thing I didn't like about Prodigal Daughter was that everything always seemed too perfect. Otherwise, I love Jeffrey Archer and this was an acceptable read."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"Definitly up to par......one of my favorites. Kept me interested enough to put my Kindle in my purse in case I had a few minutes to spare. Keep 'em coming, Jeffrey!"},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"It is a generational story which is my favorite kind of book. I first read Kane and Abel so the first part of Prodigal was a review and for people who did not read Kane and Abel, it gave you the background for this story. The daughter was a very strong character, and Archer made her a charismatic woman as well. Loved it!"},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"Loved Kane & Abel & was looking forward to reading the sequel. I understand that in a sequel you briefly recap some of the history that happened in the book before but I found the first half of this book, except for a few added details was basically a recap of Kane & Abel - in fact the one chapter was word for word what happened in Kane & Able. It was kind of like re-watching a movie you had already seen. I found myself wanting to skip pages till I got to a part where I did not already know what was going to happen. The second half of the book was mostly politics which I know interests a lot of people but personally for me was incredibly boring.....I should have stopped at Kane & Able"},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"If you have read Jeffrey Archer before you will not be disappointed. He is one of the most readable of authors and always has a great story to tell."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"I haven't even finished the book and love it. Usually I like something with an in your face plot. This is so subtle, I'm surprised at every turn of events.

I have recommended this book to several women."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"The beginning repeated so much from a previous book, that I thought maybe I had already read this one... but alas the story continued and satisfied my J Archer fix until the next book."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"A riveting story with a very unusual theme. I totally enjoyed it on my Kindle. It illustrates what can happen in the politics of the United States."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"Jeffrey Archer has been one of the world's best storytellers for over 25 years and all of his books have been page-turners for me. This is one of his early stories and a good one. In part it is a sequel to his wordwide bestseller Kane and Abel but it is mainly about the lives of the children of Abel Rosnovski and William Kane.At birth Abel gives his daughter, Florentyna, a Teddy Bear named \\"President\\" after US President Theodore Roosevelt, whose nickname was \\"Teddy\\". Florentyna's first word is not \\"Daddy\\" or \\"Mummy\\" but \\"Prusident\\" - a sign of things to come. At age 11 she makes a pact with her father for him to finance her Presidential campaign if she wins the first major primary for the Democratic Party.Abel Rosnovski gives Florentyna every support in her education, including employing a wonderful English Governess who guides her through her early days to give her the strength, personality and skills to become a very successful person both commercially and politically.The bad blood between Abel Rosnovski and the powerful banker William Kane continues and escalates when Kane's son Richard meets Florentyna.The latter part of the book covers Florentyna's commercial successes and eventual entry into US politics. Archer displays a detailed knowledge of the US political system. While it is an older book (1982) it is not dated and much of the political action is a reminder of more recent US political events.As well as being a best selling author, Archer lived an eventful life as a UK Parliamentarian and Conservative Party Chairman and was made a life peer. His career was suspended when he was convicted and imprisoned for perjury. Despite all of these traumas Archer has never lost his great story telling skills.His latest book - Sins of the Father in the Clifton Chronicles series - still has his magic touch and the ending will keep you in suspense again until he has written the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"Having read almost every book that Jeffrey Archer has written and I missed this one. I found it on Audio and it was cheap, but it was read and was so boring I could not believe that Jeffrey Archer wrote this. I loved Kane and Abel but this is not well written or even worthy to be a sequel. I wonder if someone else wrote this book? I have finished recently Prisoner at birth and loved it. Even the person reading this novel was horrible. Read Kane and Abel and miss Prodigal Daughter."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"I started to read this book and the first part (1934-1968) looked rather familiar. Indeed, it is a slightly modified rehash of a section in Kane and Abel. Fortunately, I read Kane and Abel some time ago and I forgot some of it. Not all of it, so I am again skipping many pages.Unfortunately, I was not aware of this prior to purchasing the book. I am trying to warn people who read Kane an Abel recently - the repetition of lot of the material may annoy them.Still, Jeffrey Archer is a REAL writer unlike some guys whose books sell here for $0.99 and are not worth even that. Maybe I'll enjoy the second two thirds of the Prodigal Daughter - it deals with stuff after 1967, I presume. Kane and Abel goes only through 1967.I finished the book and added one star. I was considering to comment on the rather preposterous politics of Archer's writing but it is irrelevant. The book is a 100% fiction and quite well written to please almost everyone.It may become 'literature' in some 20 years. Maybe the definition of literature is that it has to whitstand the 'test of time'. I have no idea whether this book will be read even five years from now. The trouble with writing about future that quickly becomes the past is formidable."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"This is my second Jeffrey Archer novel, the other being First among equals. There's no doubt about it, Archer can write.The Prodigal Daughter centers around Florentyna Rosnovski, the daughter of Abel Rosnovski. There is background of her father and his migration from Poland to America and his subsequent building of the Hotel empire, the Baron Group. Archer paints a portrait of a self-made man who draws on his Eastern European discipline and struggle to build his empire.Though wanting a son, Abel gives Florentyna everything she needs to become successful including an education and resources. From an early age, it's clear, Florentyna will go on to greatness.Lurking in the background is a long running feud between Abel and the Kane family. A feud with a twist. Florentyna, not by design, ends up falling in love, and marrying Richard Kane, the son of the the man her father is feuding with.This sets the stage for a great novel that you can immerse yourself in.I like Archer's style. He moves us along at a good pace and the number of characters, twists and turns, don't overwhelm the reader but more colors in a great story.Highly recommended for novel lovers."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"After reading Cane & Able this book just wasn't as good. There was so much repeating what happened in the first book that I knew just what was going to happen so eventually gave up and went on to read something else."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"After reading and loving \\"Kane & Abel\\" it was a natural to continue the great story with this sequel. I was not disappointed. Now there is a another sequel \\"Shall We Tell The President\\" which I have read and enjoyed immensely."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"The life of Florentyna Rosenofski is well read out in the sequel to Kane &amp; Able.Life is good for this young heiress, privilage, a nanny, loving mother, college etc..., untill she is propositioned by an attractive man at Bloomingdales, where she works behind the counter, who keeps asking for gloves.Her relationship with her loving but overbearing father turns upside down when she reveals to him that her lover is Richard Kane, son of his most hated enemy.Suddenly out in the real world with the love of close college friends and mother, &quot;Jessie&quot; and Richard strike out on their own.Florentyna soon finds out her real calling is politics and she soon starts off down the road that will see her obtain the highest office in the land, albeit with tragedy and a few revelations along the way."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"This book is a little disappointing as a sequel to the excellent Kane and Abel. The plot of Prodigal Daughter was too predictable, the dialogues - especially the ones between the husband-and-wife - were so script-like that it spoiled the beautiful decription of Florentyna and Richard Kane in the earlier book."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"This book was a really interesting one. It is pretty much about the daughter of Abel and how she grew up. The first half of the book was pretty much Kane and Abel from his daughters eyes. But the second half gotten into her politcal life after her father died. If you enjoyed the first one it is a must that you continue onto the second book in the series."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"I enjoyed the book itself, but the prologue is one of the best pieces of writing I've ever encountered. Loved the punchline! If you want to read a satisfying and plausible account of how Florentyna becomes the first woman President, you'll enjoy this book, but be sure to read the prologue!"},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"Kane &amp; Abel was a 5 star book. I read The Prodigal Daughter in the hopes that it would come close to Kane &amp; Abel. For me the first about 200 hundred pages were good because it tied up some things from the first book. The rest of the book was very well written but just plain boring when it became all political. Jeffrey Archer tells a story like few others. So if you read the first book and like political issues this would be a 5 star book for you."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"Life is too short to read this ongoing , never ending rubbish. My problems is i actually finished the book."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"I didn't realize this book was a sequel to one I had read 20 years ago. It could have been better written."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"The Prodigal Daughter is one of the best books I've ever read.Jeffrey Archer included everything in this novel, suspense, romance, humor, despair.From now on every book i read will be compared to this on and i doubt any will come even close!"},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"I loved it."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"After reading &quot;Not a penny more, not a penny less&quot;, I was expecting a witty and sharp piece of work. Not so this time. Girl meets world, girls wants it, girl overcomes all kinds of obstacles, girl gets world. Yawn. &quot;Not a penny more...&quot; is a FANTASTIC book, if you've never read Archer before, start with that one. And pass on &quot;The Prodigal Daughter&quot;."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"This book caught my eye with it's title--having a different spelling of Kane than the Biblical spelling. I read the back cover, and it looked interesting. Once I started reading, I was spellbound--I couldn't put it down. It's the story of two men--one born rich, the other poor, in two different countries, whose lives later become intertwined. This author is a master at transporting the reader into the human feelings of his characters. When I finished this book, I immediately ordered five more of Archer's books, just because he writes so well."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"An ambitious woman who sacrifices her family to try to become President.

Personally, I expect a lot more of Archer and this juvenile, embarrassing excuse of good writing completely stuns me. I have one word for him - edit!"},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"I read Kane &amp; Abel and think it was perhaps the best book I have ever read. I just could not relate or get care about the 'Prodigal Daughter' Being ambitious is great but not at the expense of your family and loved ones. Very dissapointed."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"This book picks up where Kane and Abel left off. It is the story of the daughter, Florentyna. She runs the hotel empire. Entertaining, fast paced, a good read."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"Before reaching the end of this novel, it had already moved into the position of being one of my favorite books of all time. It is engaging from the first page until the final sentence. I could not put it down. This is the type of book that makes you want to read everything else the author has written, because if any of his other books even come close to this they will be amazing. For anyone looking to read this I would definitely recommend reading Kane and Abel beforehand. The two novels complement each other very well, and you cannot have the complete story if you only read one."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"Well, first of all I have to tell you that I don't have anything against Jeffrey Archer, I read from him the eleventh commandment (an excellent book) I didn't read Kane & Abel but I saw the picture, I didn't like that picture because I am not agree to send away your son because you hate his father in law, of course there is a Spanish saying \\"Never say you will never drink of this water\\", so I hope not to do what Mr. Kane did in that book, other interesting book is The Fourth Estate, but is the same story of Kane & Abel but instead of an hotel owner and a bank owner they are two newspaper owners, but they don't send away their family because of their fight.Now, this book, half of it is the story of Kane & Abel, here I have a question: Mr. Archer doesn't have another stories to write that he has to write the same story in three books?The last part of The Prodigal Daughter, when her father and father in law, both died, is really good, how Richard and Jessie (Florentyna) help each other to have their own goals, and other thinks like that, that you can learn how to be a good husband or wife.This book has his own message, but is a waste of time reading the first part of the book if you know the story of Kane & Abel."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"The only reason I have rated this book four stars instead of five is that the second half of the book gets really extensively into politics, to the point where it bored me. If you enjoy politics you will certainly rate this book five stars. It follows the life of Abel Rosnofski's daughter from her birth until the epitome of her success, in her 60's. I don't want to give away the ending, but will say that the ending was EXTREMELY satisfying, in spite of my having gotten a bit bogged down in the politics."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"This books makes an excellent sequel to Kane and Abel but lacks some of the intensity and development that the former has."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"The Prodigal Daughter is the second book in the Kane and Abel trilogy. It goes back in time to the childhoods and lives of the daughter of Abel Rosnovski, Florentyna, and the son of William Kane, Richard. She is an intelligent young lady with high ambitions from the start. The Prodigal Daughter has a lot of politics involved in it, with Florentyna trying to become the president of the United States. Of course, her being a woman and extremely rich will make her face difficulties, but she fights against all odds.I like the book also because its protagonist is a woman. She was gifted with beauty and spirit but above all with an indomitable will. There's a lot of politics involved in this book but nonetheless a terrific book with a twist in the end. The rest of the story is filled with betrayals, political intrigues and suspense, some tragic incidents like Richard's death, follows the pursuit of Florentyna to reach the highest office of the country.Most people are of the opinion that this book was better than Kane and Abel but I would anytime choose the latter over this book. Even though I put the heavily detailed politics in the book as a minus point, it is that very portion which gives life to the book. I recommend this book to all those who have already read Kane and Abel or even otherwise. This book rightly proves that Mr. Archer is a great storyteller."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"I loved this book. I first read Kane and Abel and throughly enjoyed it. As a die hard political junkie, I found this book even more delightful. Some have complained that Archer found it necessary to at times copy straight out of Kane and Abel. Of course, he had to. What was he to do - invent new dialogue? I found it interesting that he showed us the other side of the story in the Prodigial Daughter, especially the scenes where Richard and Florentyna must confront their fathers with the news of their love. In Kane and Abel, we saw it from Florentyna and Abel's points of view. In Prodigal Daughter, we saw it from Richard and William's points of view. Prodigal Daughter is a throughly captivating book with a surprise ending."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"Is America ready for a female president? This sequel to the highly successful \\"Kane and Abel\\" explores that possibility as it follows the life of the only daughter of famous hotelier Abel Rosnovski. Florentyna Rosnovski, born into wealth and groomed to one day overtake a hotel empire, is a second generation American immigrant who has a falling out with her father after falling in love with the son of his fiercest enemy. Forced to make a fresh start on the West Coast, Florentyna combines her extreme intelligence and love of women's fashion to open her own chain of high class clothing boutiques. Upon Abel's death, she inherits a slew of hotels second-to-none in every corner of the globe and teams with husband Richard to ensure their continued success. Always possessing a vested interest in politics, it is only at the urging of a childhood friend that she enters into the spotlight as a public servant. Everything else, as they say, is American history. The book is insightful and entertaining but lacks the creativity and depth of its predecessor, with which it was sure to draw comparison. In fact, any \\"Kane and Abel\\" fan will be sorely disappointed and feel cheated during \\"Daughter\\", as Archer feels it necessary to repeat, in exact words, page after page, whole episodes and storylines previously penned in his original epic. It is only after Florentyna reaches adulthood and pushes the past behind that readers will become immersed in her struggle to be successful in both business and politics."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"I had just finished Kane & Abel and thought the continuing story line of this family would be great. I have gotten through 70% of the book and I'm bored solid and there's not one character in the book that I can say I even like (or don't like). They're all dull. I've read all of Nelson DeMille and David Baldacci and I thought I would try a new author. My search continues."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"I kept waiting for something exciting to happen. By the time I realized I had made a mistake starting this book I had so much time invested that I was determined to finish it.

Thank you Jeffery Archer!"},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"Like always, this Jeffery Archer book held my total interest from the time I started it until the last page. If you're an Archer fan, this book is another one to add to your \\"read list\\". If you haven't read him before, its a good place to start."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"\\"The Prodigal Daughter\\" focuses on the life of Florentyna Rosnovski Kane, the daughter of a Polish immigrant who lived the American dream. The first half of this book is a retelling of events from \\"Kane and Abel\\". The reader gains a few new insights seeing things through Florentyna's eyes, but these were rare because so many passages were completely lifted from the original book and put into this sequel.One element that seemed to be missing in this book compared to \\"Kane and Abel\\" was the tension and plot twists that came about from the bitter feud between the Kane and Rosnovski patriarchs. These two strong wills really made the first book shine, whereas the summary retelling in this book was a bit disappointing.The latter half of the book deals with Florentyna's life in politics. I found this to be rather dry at times, and somewhat predictable as to where Florentyna would eventually end up. If I had read \\"The Prodigal Daughter\\" as a stand-alone book, my review would likely have been higher, but it seemed cheap and lazy to reuse so much material from the first book."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"I was happy to read this book because it was so hard to come to the end of its predecessor, Kane and Abel. The latter was a better book and in Daughter there seemed to be a lot of formulaic replays in presenting the characters and what they'll do next. When it was written, the idea of a female president thrilled the American imagination as we had had a real contender for that happening in our country. Now, with a black man in the White House and women's lib a bit of a banality (with Rupert Murdoch, the inspiration for a character in another Archer novel, The Fourth Estate, rapidly feminizing the Wall Street Journal as we speak) this story's innovative edge has been lost. Still, as with all Jeffery Archer's tales, it offers an entertaining escape by a writer who knows how to put together a decent read."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"Once again Jeffrey Archer has put out a great read. I love his books and always look forward to the next."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"Oddly, I read this on my kindle and now it is no longer available. :(I loved the first in this seriesKane and Abeland enjoyed \\"the rest of the story\\".

Enjoyed reading about a powerful woman in a political world."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"This book is the second in a three book sequel starting with \\"Kane and Abel\\" and ending with \\"Shall We Tell The President\\". About the first 200 pages are a recap of \\"Kane and Abel\\" and is about the earlier life of Florentyna--not covered in the first of the series. It gets a bit too political as you get into the story, and it reveals the background maneuvers politicians make to get ahead, leaving Florentyna trying to be one step ahead. It's a \\"must\\" to read \\"Kane and Abel\\" first. I did not bother to read the third book in the series. About Florentyna: She's a strong woman with determination, not unlike her father and father-in-law. Enjoyed the ending."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"If you ever want to know about politics on a level that you don't read in the headlines, this is an excellent book to read.Jeffrey Archer has captured so many details and such strong character development, that it is easy for you to believe in this storyAs for the title, though, I still wonder why this is titled &quot;The Prodigal Daughter,&quot; since prodigal means wastefully extravagant. Although the protagonist was born into wealth, and married someone who became a banker, her character was actually frugal.This is one of those books that you can't turn the page fast enough, because even if you read it years ago, you become so caught up in the drama."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"This follow up and sequel to Kane and Abel shifts focus from the indomitable male characters of Kane and Abel to a witty female protaganists who captures our attention as she scales the heights to become the first woman president of the United States.

A worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Celebrate Passover Haggadah: A Christian Presentation of the Traditional Jewish Festival","review":"This little \\"How To\\" book offers an easy way for Christians to experience a Passover meal (from a Christian perspective).

Well done."},{"Title":"Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics","review":"Chandler's \\"Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics\\" is a wonderful book: clear, complete, intense, enjoyable and short. Yes, it is short, because here there are no useless digressions or repetitions, it gets straight to the point, sometimes condensating a lot of results in a sentence.I used this book to fill the gap between the basic thermodynamic and modern statatistical mechanics, expecially for understand the concept behind monte carlo simulation I studied for the computational physics course. I made the right choise using this book.I have to remark that this book, while very satisfactory, is not \\"simple\\". It assumes that the reader has other references at hand(I used Hill's \\"introduction to statistical thermodynamics\\" and Fermi's \\"thermoynamics\\") and the many exercises do not have solutions.Anyway, Chandler's book is perfect for understanding both thermodynamics (the first chapters are pure art) and statistical mechanics with an eye on computation."},{"Title":"Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics","review":"This is a clearly exposed text on Statistical Mechanics, with a very modern approach. I find the problems particularly interesting (look for the Solution Manual of this title)."},{"Title":"Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics","review":"The book cover is in worse condition than I expected, but the contents are all there, and it came within a week of ordering."},{"Title":"Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics","review":"The best part of this book is that it is modern. You have chapters on Monte Carlo simulations, the Ising model, and more. You don't get long chapters on the partition function of an ideal gas, for example. The bad part about this book is that it is not immediately transparent if you're reading stat mech for the first time. I like it more the more I know about stat mech, but it's not a good beginner's book, and I think it's better to have another book with it - maybe Hill or McQuarrie - since it's not really that long either. Still, recommended (get the soln. manual too) with these caveats."},{"Title":"Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics","review":"This was a great book. It covered the important material and left out all of the extra garbage that most books carry on for pages about. The presentation was done using clear mathematics and modern, easily followed notation. The book is short making it practical to actually read the entire book if you are extremely busy. We used the book in conjunction with Hill. I don't recommend Hill because it is hard to follow."},{"Title":"Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics","review":"I used this book while taking the course for which this book was designed, Prof. Chandler's stat mech course for first year graduate students.I agree with the reviewer who wrote that this book avoids a lot of filler that can distort the main thrust of the material at hand.I disagree with the reviewer who wrote that this is not the book for a beginner. I used this book having studied undergrad p-chem but essentially no stat mech. Being a concise text, one must read carefully to extract the point of each paragraph. I sometimes found myself re-reading certain sections a few times in order to understand them. The abundant prose should be evidence that the author is trying to provide a physical picture to improve the scientific intuition of the reader.This doesn't mean the book isn't for a beginner. It just means what you should already know: you will not learn stat mech by skimming any text just once with a pint of beer in your hand.I constantly return to this book for review of thermo and stat mech concepts. For my grad qualifying exams I mostly used McQuarrie for general p-chem overview, but switched right back to IMSM for thermo and stat mech review.If you're looking for a reference book with every possible stat mech problem worked out to help with your problem sets, this is not it. If you want to understand stat mech this book is the first step."},{"Title":"Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics","review":"After learning almost nothing in my graduate course on stat mech taught by a famous physicist, I decided I would have to teach myself Stat Mech over the summer. When I found this book, I really started to make progress. Right away I got the big picture on what statistical mechanics is all about, and that made all the difference. I was able to work my way quickly through the book, doing the problems as they came along in text and understand almost everything.I wasn't able to make it through the denser chapters at the end on nonequilibrium stat mech on my own, but the book was well worth the price and is one of my favorites. The explanations are pure gold.A few tips for the reader:1. Do the problems as your read. The best place for the problems in a textbook is in the text itself, not at the end of the chapter.2. Get the solutions manualI purchased the solutions manual so that I could check my solutions. It had about half the solutions and only half of them worked out in detail, but it was still very useful for getting started on some of the problems I wasn't sure how to approach.3. Make a notation conversion chartSome of the greek letters are different than the usual notation for physics courses, so I had to make a notation conversion chart on the front inside cover and that was very helpful.4. If you find the book too hard, use Schroeder's book as an introduction.5. Be prepared to see a missing spot on your shelf.I'm constantly loaning this book out to people in my research group and other students."},{"Title":"Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics","review":"If this is your first time taking a grad-level course in statistical mechanics, this should not be your only book. Chandler's writing is incredibly difficult to follow and often frustrating unless you already have a decent grasp on the concepts. My impression is that if you already understand stat mech fairly well, the conciseness of this book may aid you in getting a \\"big picture\\" view of the most important methods and results of stat mech without the dross that tends to dilute other books. (One advantage in this regard is that Chandler often uses more general forms of statistical mechanics equations, e.g. not limiting work to P-V work in many contexts.) If you are looking to acquire an understanding of stat mech for the first time, try Statistical Mechanics by McQuarrie."},{"Title":"Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics","review":"A clear, concise explanation of statistical mechanics. Some people may complain about the \\"concise\\" part--in many cases, mathematical exercises are left as exercises to the student. However, this practice allows the reader to really understand the material by doing, not just reading. I learned stat mech for the first time from this book, and only examined other texts (mcquarrie or hill) afterwards."},{"Title":"Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics","review":"My statistical mechanics class for my Physics PhD used about 4-5 books and the professor lectured from none of them but instead used his own notes. This little book basically taught me all I needed to get an A in his class. It is spectacular. Nice and short, but it cuts out what you don't need. The derivation of PV=nRT is one of the nicest results in stat mech, and following Prof Chandlers' proof will aid you in almost ANY homework assignment that your professor might throw at you."},{"Title":"Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics","review":"The book starts with an adiabatic system instead of isolated system, which makes the following derivation more pretty and casts a new insight into the stat. mech.. The only flaw is that it is too concise."},{"Title":"Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics","review":"This is by far the most concise treatment of thermo and stat mech. I have came across. If you want something that goes to the point and is filled with gem, this is it.However, it is very mathematical and at times hard to follow. This is not a book you can sit down in the sun and glimpse through. But at the same time, it is a great introductory textbook for those willing to accept the challenge. Unlike the other textbooks, this provides a physical intuition and leaves no rock unturn. In short, it is a hard book...but a good book."},{"Title":"Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics","review":"This book is very brief, and a nice reference to have, but I would not recommend for an introduction to statistical mechanics. McQuarrie's text is much more thorough, and great for a upper level undergraduate or graduate course. For a very basic overview of the canonical ensemble Molecular Thermodynamics, by McQuarrie and Simon is a nice resource. Overall, Introduction to Modern Statistical Mechanics is stat mech in its briefest form, and useful for a physical chemist's reference shelf."},{"Title":"Michel Thomas Spanish Language Builder (Michel Thomas Series)","review":"Given the number of reviews for the 8CD course, I am surprised that there is none for Michel Thomas's Spanish Language builder.This 2 CD pack, diverges from the now famous, Michel Thomas technique. There is no classroom scenario, no stumbling students. It comprises of Michel Thomas listing off phrases and also offering slight variations of those phrases using different grammatical constructs. It is up to the listener to use the pause button as you go along (unless you are very fast). I didn't enjoy this format as much. For a start, it is pretty heavy going, I certainly couldn't go through one cd in a session. Also, without another student to \\"compete\\" against, it wasn't as much fun.However, that said, MT goes through some very useful phrases and there is a substantial booklet that goes with it (about 20 pages) that lists the vocab/phrases he introduces. A worthy addition to the original series, adding more vocab to those that wanted it. 4 Stars."},{"Title":"Michel Thomas Spanish Language Builder (Michel Thomas Series)","review":"This is a great CD, but please becareful to realize that this 2-CD set is the exact same as the Michel Thomas Spanish Booster 2-CD set.

MT is the only one talking. There are no students. You really have to pause the CD, but I can't because I am driving!!!One good thing though is that there is a booklet in the CD. There are no written materials accompanied the 8-CD course. Maybe you should consider the 4-CD advance course instead."},{"Title":"The Battle of Resaca (Civil War Georgia)","review":"As I usually point out in cases like this, Mr. Secrist's book is the only one to focus specifically on the Battle of Resaca. In this early fight of the Atlanta Campaign, Secrist believes Sherman had a great chance to trap and destroy Johnston's Army of Tennessee, thus ending the campaign before it had hardly begun. Instead, says Secrist, Sherman failed and doomed his Army to a long journey before they reached Atlanta. The book is rather thin at 102 pages, especially when one considers that only Part I (the first 65 pages of the book) is a narrative of the battle. Part II consists of the Battlefield from the end of the battle through today, with an emphasis on relic hunting and preservation efforts. The maps are average. On the plus side we have topographical lines on the standard maps, but these maps are of the Resaca area today. However, since the land has changed so little since 1864 (aside from the construction of I-75 directly through it!), this is not necessarily a large minus. The troop positions leave something to be desired on the standard maps. Sherman's and Johnston's lines are drawn as one large line, with Corps (and sometimes Divisions) marked off in a vague manner. Secrist does include other maps taken from the Official Records Atlas, but these are pretty small and a little difficult to read. On a lot of pages, text ends early, so this book is really even shorter than the listed 102 pages. On the plus side, Secrist is well-qualified to write the book. He has been studying the Resaca Battlefield since 1958, and is a noted relic hunter. I enjoyed his writing style. The book was definitely not a tedious read. All in all, though, The Battle of Resaca was too short for my taste. It just did not contain enough detail, and only whetted my appetite for more detailed discussion. Sadly, a more detailed discussion does not exist.102 pp., 12 maps"},{"Title":"The Battle of Resaca (Civil War Georgia)","review":"Ideal book for a Civil War buff.

While well written, I could feel the effort that went into making it fit the mold. The maps and illustrations as reproduced in the book are almost unreadable. The addition of two multi-color pages of maps help but do not fully cover the action. This made it almost impossible to follow the battle as I frequently tried to locate the map and the place on it. The author is determined that Sherman is a poor battle commander and never misses a chance to point this out. At Resaca, like many battles the plan was not what happened, some was Sherman's fault but the reader can figure that out.Part two is a history of the battlefield. This is a labor of love for the author and he does a very good job here. Preservation is a problem and we see what is being done, how it can be done and why we need to do more. The photographs here add real value to the book.This is not a bad book nor is it a good one. You are getting fair value for your money and a good overview of the battle and the battle to preserve the field. It is not a great small battle book and I feel it could be better."},{"Title":"The Battle of Resaca (Civil War Georgia)","review":"I have read the Battle of Resaca by Philip Secrist and I highly recommend this book for the serious student of the Battle of Resaca.Dr. Secrist has done an outstanding job by going into more detail than is normal for a Civil War book.

But the book left me confused as the the flow of battle. Some better and more detailed maps would have helped, with units located a little better. I just never got a good feel for what happened there. He mentions advanced Confederate lines in front of the main line, but fails to position these on the map. He mentions the dismissal of Union General Judah, but leaves it at that, with no follow up. The author uses the same map and corresponding unit movement arrows for the 1st day as the second. So did the Confederates attack over the exact same ground? I'm sure Dr. Secrist is an expert on the battle, he just didn't keep in mind that most reading his book would not be, and he left out lots of explanitory details. Why did the Confederates choose Resaca to make a stand? Why didn't Sherman just choose to expand the Lay Ferry bridgehead? I do agree with him totally that Sherman was not a great tactical commander.

This is not the book for the discussion of why your gun does not feed consistently, nor why you use so many barrel seals. Instead this is more of a no frills, paint by the numbers, race through taking apart and putting together a myriad number of dissimilar models (with an index of other guns that are similar, or variants) that cover the entire spectrum of shotgunnery.

I found the essence of the book to be found in this quote: \\"If we are faithful to the sacred, the Mystery, what we call God, we will always keep searching, for we will never find it, it will always be beyond, it will always be more. Authentically religious people know that...\\" (pp.178-179) We will never find it? It will always be beyond? I simply cannot agree with that. I believe that it is possible to know God in this life.Albacete entirely talks about 9/11 and sexuality but skirts what I and many others consider to be deep problems with the church: discrimination against women by barring them from the priesthood and discrimination against gay and lesbian people. (And yes, of course, sexual abuse by priests.)Over and over again he talks about \\"The Mystery\\" and mentions that God didn't tell Job in the Bible why he allowed him to suffer- it is only for Job to submit to the Mystery of God.If you were hoping for something more or different from this book- I can only suggest giving it a pass."},{"Title":"God at the Ritz: Attraction to Infinity A Priest Physicist Talks About Science, Sex, Politics, and Religion","review":"Monsignor Lorenzo Albacete has written a serious and humorous book about the human longing, desire, and attraction for the infinite, the eternal, the mysterious &quot;beyond.&quot; Albacete is an intellectual, and his brief critiques of other thinkers testify to a brilliant mind, but his illustrations and vignettes always spring from life: a very earthy life, his life. And so the relationship between reason and human experience forms the thread that ties this book together. That thread is a kind of judgement, but his judgement is so humble, so full of humanity and understanding, because it flows not from an abstract theory, but from a life fully lived, from a mind and a man engaged with human reality in his search for the meaning of that reality, for what lies beyond it and ultimately constitutes it. Here is a book capable of speaking to any man of any time, brimming with the humanity and generosity of its author."},{"Title":"God at the Ritz: Attraction to Infinity A Priest Physicist Talks About Science, Sex, Politics, and Religion","review":"God At The Ritz: Attraction To Infinity is the candid discourse by Lorenzo Albacete (a Catholic priest and physicist with a degree in Space Science and Applied Physics), about the essence of life itself, its meaning, God's plan, and a great deal more. From surveying the balance between science and faith; to addressing the eternal questioning of why such suffering and horror exist in God's world; to the \\"big three\\" contemporary issues of sex, money, and politics; God At The Ritz is a refreshing, insightful, articulate, \\"reader friendly\\", and highly recommended attempt to make sense of the great mysteries of life, and to acknowledge that there are some concepts that can only be understood by God himself."},{"Title":"God at the Ritz: Attraction to Infinity A Priest Physicist Talks About Science, Sex, Politics, and Religion","review":"Msgr. Albacete is a modern day Pascal, and this is his Pensees'. Albacete writes a column for the NY Times Magazine, and is respected by the cultural elites (the recent PBS special on &quot;Faith and 9-11&quot; ended with his comments). Yet, he is a Catholoic priest completely committed to the teachings of the Catholic Church, as well as a personal friend of Pope John Paul II. How so? Read this book and find out. Where Pascal shattered the smug rationalism of his day, now Albacete performs aikido on modernism and post-modernism, reconciling all that's true and good in them with genuine faith, while exposing modernity's fallacies -- its hidden ideologies, utopias, and deceptions that keep us from fulfilling our genuine desires, especially our inborn longing to know the meaning of life and the universe. While written for seekers of all kinds, this book makes it possible, for the first time since Darwin, Marx, Nietzsche and Freud (and Seinfeld), to be a really intellectually satisfied believer. If you think you've given faith every chance, and it's always come up short, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"God at the Ritz: Attraction to Infinity A Priest Physicist Talks About Science, Sex, Politics, and Religion","review":"While advising on a film about John Paul II, the eccentrically brilliant Monsignor Albacete stayed at the Ritz in Hollywood and was accosted by all kinds of people who asked, on location and at poolside and everywhere else, incisive questions about God, religion, evil, hope, and other matters that really matter. This little book joins their questions and his responses in a winsome apologetic that might be categorized as pre-evangelization. However categorized, it is thinking of a high order set forth with literary grace and humor, and all in the service of understanding the irrepressible human aspiration toward the infinite. This is a First THings review."},{"Title":"God at the Ritz: Attraction to Infinity A Priest Physicist Talks About Science, Sex, Politics, and Religion","review":"This is a whimsical and amusing little book on the rationality of believing in God but also how believing in God is a response to the longing of our hearts or, to be more precise, of our whole person. The fad at the minute is to regard all religious believers as dangerous loonies - Albacete's response is not to take a highly polemic stand against those railing at us who believe but to provide an insight into the joy of believing. Further, he shows, in his capacity as a physicist, that, for him, there is no contradiction in believing in the laws of physics and believing there is a God, who has revealed Himself. Both the believer and the scientist are seeking \\"knowledge and truth\\" except that the believer considers that human life cannot be explained in totally scientific materialist terms. Focusing exclusively on the latter leads to a \\"reduction in desire\\" and the \\"secularisation of interiority\\" - the longing of the heart is in effect denied. Critically, Albacete reminds us though that the order of discourse for science and philosophy/religion are different. Each follow its proper method. And, we must not suppress reason - to do so would be inhuman.At times, particularly in his \\"Real Beer\\" chapter, I was reminder of Benedict XVI's Encyclical \\"Spe Salvi\\":\\"The infinity our heart's desire is not endless time, a linear succession of moments that go on forever> No matter, how long we live, this desire remains> Ironically, perhaps the infinity the heart desires is within the limited within the particular within the concrete. It is a measure of quality not quantity. It is measured not by numbers but by intensity of fulfilment\\"Readers should note that this is not a conventional book (thank heaven's for that) -it is clear that some reviewers thought this book would seek to demonstrate the truths and practices of Catholicism and provide an answer to some of the scandals but that is not its remit. In a way, this book is for everyone, atheist or believer in God (of whatever description or creed) who simply wants to reflect on the topic. There is nothing specifically Catholic about it apart from a key issue: Albacete, like St Thomas Aquinas, rejoices in the wonder of being (\\"amazement and passionate curiosity\\") - everything is interesting to he who seeks the truth. For me, this sums up the Catholic spirit where there is fidelity to harmonising faith and reason. Further Albacete does not shrug off life's mysteries such as the mystery of suffering - he says we must always ask \\"why\\" and we must suffer with others: \\"To co-suffer is to share the question \\"why\\", to be a companion, and to walk together towards transcendence. \\"Co-suffering makes us stand before those who suffer, with profound awe and respect. In these experiences, \\"Something very great\\" visits us\\" He then makes one of the most striking and surprising statements in the book: \\"The most intimate encounter between human beings is through shared suffering\\".There is an amusing (actually the motif of the book is lightness!) piece where he cautions against thinking we have found all the answers (which really shuts the door on \\"why?\\") : If you discover the meaning of life at 2.00PM, one afternoon, what are you going to do that night? Won't life becoming boring? Searching, seeking, and struggling at least make you open-minded and tolerant of those whose \\"meaning of life\\" is not searched for where you search for yours!\\"This is an enjoyable book - each chapter is short - so it is an ideal book to take on a journey - further whilst the themes are deep, the material is handled with an eye to easy comprehension and accessibility. The constant companion of humour also means that one gets to chuckle from time to time. I should say that I never would have come across this book if it were not for Fr James Schall on whom I am very dependent for my reading.Thanks again Fr Schall who continues to feed me with material to feed my zest for life!!!"},{"Title":"God at the Ritz: Attraction to Infinity A Priest Physicist Talks About Science, Sex, Politics, and Religion","review":"The book just came in, and I gave it to a friend, so I have to buy another one.

Company delivered book in excellent condition in a timely manner."},{"Title":"God at the Ritz: Attraction to Infinity A Priest Physicist Talks About Science, Sex, Politics, and Religion","review":"Albacete's vision of a 'rational faith' is one everyone on either side of the 'God Issue' should read. It is witty, down to earth, but well reasoned and persuasive.It seems to me that what we have here is ultimately a powerful, persuasive, and well put together (sound?) version of the 'argument from desire'. Or in Albacete's case, the 'argument from desires'. Besides CS Lewis and the current pope, other intellectual influences range from Levinas and (I think) Miguel De Unamuno. I see a lot of Unamuno's outlook underlying much of what Albacete is talking about.Albacete's overall point seems to me to be an issue that is widely accepted in many philosophical circles nowadays: that one cannot take a value-neutral stance on what rationality IS when the question of what constitutes rationality is the issue on the table. Any epistemological theory is going to be based on certain pre-existing beliefs, values, convictions and commitments. Hence Albacete's observation that science itself is based on 'desire'.What the latin priest does is to take these ideas and make them accessible to anyone, leading up to the conclusion that, given science's reliance on commitments much like those that lead us to religion, religion is a justified (rationally speaking) enterprise."},{"Title":"God at the Ritz: Attraction to Infinity A Priest Physicist Talks About Science, Sex, Politics, and Religion","review":"Father Albacete is fun to know! The title comes from the fact that he wrote the book over a period of time including many days at the Ritz Carlton in Pasadena, California as a guest of PBS' Frontline show. His many approaches to persuading the reader of the sheer reasonableness of faith, of the &#34;religious sense&#34; as being part of our humanity, include forays into science, literature, politics and sociology. He says that true faith (in a transcendent, and very real, God of mercy) is founded on humility. This is not a message our age likes to hear, as most prefer to be their own God, thank you. Fr Albacete has given me some gentle, colorful, and realistic ways to talk to my atheist neighbor, not shrinking from any of the problems of our time: the suffering, the scientific materialism, the love of luxury, the gap between rich and poor. A very rich little volume of essays."},{"Title":"God at the Ritz: Attraction to Infinity A Priest Physicist Talks About Science, Sex, Politics, and Religion","review":"Albacete makes a good case for the belief in God- what ever you want to think- the powers of our commiserationare not to be taken lightly.

There is quite a bit of detail as to the financial aspects of launching an IPO, and the roller-coaster ride that entails, but much of the writing felt like sheer exposition of 'let me explain how much I know about the &quot;new economy&quot;.' This shifting of focus from story to economics is forced, and causes this book to read like non-fiction (something I did not want from this book).The base storyline is great -- a financial guru decides to start his own dot com, after seeing the wealth of the dot coms he launches the IPOs for. And that the company, Artemis-5.com, has no tangible product, is entertaining. While entertaining and whimsical, to believe that Hanley could snag top notch board members without revealing his business plan is utterly unbelievable. Of course, life is only so good for Hanley until the SEC starts poking around. The ending to the book is where the only real suspense exists. For a book billed as a Mystery/Thriller, there isn't much mystery or thrill to learning the ins and outs of Wall Street finance.This story is based so clearly on existing dot-coms (in particular: Yahoo, AOL, Amazon) and their executives, that to stray from the possible to the improbable doesn't work. Gruenwald relies too much on financial fact and successful dot-coms, instead of suspensful creativity, to create &quot;The Street.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Street","review":"I loved every word of this book.

Come to think of it, I probably would have gone into a different field altogether rather than investments, where I'm now stuck. It wouldn't surprise me if, a hundred years from now, we look back at stock hustlers the way we now look back at turn of the century snake oil salesman, namely, conscience-less swindlers worthy only of contempt. And if that happens, this book will be cited as one of the reasons why. A lot of people got hosed in the dot-com madness, and even though it's hard to feel sorry for people who were looking to make a quick buck without lifting a finger, the prevailing cultural ethos said it was alright for them to do so. That needs to stop. People need to read this book. That it's a hugely entertaining read is beside the point, except insofar as it will induce people to pick it up and to recommend it to friends and colleagues. The Street is one of those rarities, a guaranteed wothwhile investment of your time and attention.

In the middle of the sixteenth century people began to buy tulips imported to Western Europe from Turkey, not because of how beautiful or rare they were, but because they thought their prices would keep going up...150 years ago investors bought up shares in railroads, even for companies that hadn't yet put any rolling stock on the rails...during the twenties speculators gobbled up shares of airline companies that had never flown a single passenger...and now, on the eve of the new millenium, people are gobbling up shares of companies that have the fanciest web sites on the planet and no solid operational experience and steady profitability records at all.This intelligent book was written before the beginning of the market's meltdown. This fact alone speaks volumes about Gruenfeld's insights and understanding of Wall Street, brokerage and financial analysis industry. Now, with the benefit of hindsight, the situations depicted in this book are so true to life that it's almost scary.The only problem I have with this book is that sometimes it goes to extremes. While it may be true that investing on the market, even in sound, profitable companies is risky, I can hardly believe that \\"laying 100 bucks on Microsoft is no different from laying it on the eight the hard way\\". It may also be true that there's only one determinant of the price of a stock, and that's what people are willing to pay for it. The share price has nothing to do with the underlying value of the company at all? Yes, in frenzy times! Aren't financial evaluation theories still worth anything nowadays?Anyway, besides the subject matter and the story itself, there are so many great lines in this book, that once you begin reading it it's impossible to put it down...\\"caring , altruism, generosity and charity are all admirable qualities, but essentially unreliable. Greed, on the other hand, you can bank on. Appeal to a man's greed, feed it regularly, and his loyalty is assured\\"."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"First off, this book is a real surprise in terms of its forsight of the economic meltdown in this country. And, like many TV commercials we've seen in the past few years, the author succeeded at capturing the utter rediculousness of tech-industry jargon used during that time period - which made for some very sarcastic &quot;Guffman-style&quot; dialogue (this flew right over many readers heads, which was obviously the point). Besides being prophetic and funny (funny for those with an above-Grisham intelligence), another success comes from the way this book truly exposes the feverish frenzy of IPO's in the late nineties.The problem I have with this book is that it contains American characters that seem to have grown up in the U.K.. In virtually every conversation contained in this book, the characters use words and expressions that are in no way, shape, or form dialects from any part of the United States. I don't know where the author is from, but there is no doubt in my mind that his characters are 100% British. This problem has nothing to do with the industry jargon I mentioned before. I call this a problem because it really affected my reader's enjoyment - I wasn't able to fully escape into this otherwise clever, funny, suspensful, and amazingly fortelling piece of literature.

Now I simply show the three (3) pages in the book where it's VERY SIMPLY explained and my friends now have a vastly better understanding of how to short stocks.I commend Mr. Gruenfeld on this book. When it was printed he must have been viewing a crystal ball while writing it because the book absolutely nails the 2000-2002 market crash and burn. Sadly it's now out of print.

The author wends the reader through surprises, twists, and deceptions of his own until the book reaches its ultimately poor ending.The story begins with James Hanley, the aforementioned young man, working in a generic Wall Street brokerage where he tires of making millions for others and decides to form his own dot.com company. As he starts up his stunningly successful startup company with no product to sell, a parallel story follows Thurgren's skepticism and his efforts to shut Hanley down. Excitement follows.Gruenfeld obviously has done his research on the workings of Wall Street and the dot.com industry. Unfortunately, he spends so long impressing us with his depth of knowledge that I almost gave up on the book near the halfway point. At that point, however, the first surprise sends the plot into overdrive and the reader is taken on 100-some pages of adventure, suspense, and action that make the book exteremely difficult to set down.The book ends disappointingly with possibly the worst epilogue that I have ever read. It almost reads as though the epilogue were written a year or more after the novel was completed as an effort to tie up all loose ends.

A very suspenseful thriller on its own, but also containing many important and relevant insights."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"I'm not sure who Amazon picks to do these reviews but you have to be kidding by slamming this book.

He resents turning idiots with a dot-com mind and nothing else into billionaires while he earns $300,000 a year for the service.At the end of his patience with THE STREET, and having learned the ins and outs of the Internet economy, James decides it is time for him to launch his own company. He starts up Artemis-5, but cloaks it in mystery. No one knows anything about the company. Still TV gurus pick up the rumors and glorify Artemis-5 as a sure winner that has monster funding from super heavyweights and an incredible break through technology that will turn the industry upside down.This leads to the SEC becoming interested and wondering what the heck is going on. SEC Assistant Director of Enforcement Jubal Thurgen believes that Hanley has pulled off the greatest swindle in THE STREET's history. He investigates the new overnight giant, but Hanley expects him. As they play cat and mouse, the game turns personal.THE STREET is an exciting satirical look at recent Wall St. and related industry practices in which poor profit records and limited value mean a company sells for hundreds of dollars a share if it is a dot-com firm. The story line is exciting with two fabulous fighters behaving like Kimble and Gerard meeting in the financial district and a support cast that adds to the irony of a strong tale. Unlike his novel, which is filled with substance worth the value of the price, Lee Gruenfeld writes a thriller that unequivocally believes that value means little on Wall St. while rumors without substance denote everything. .Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Street","review":"This book is awful. No character development whatsoever, not that you would empathize with anyone in the book anyway. The situations regarding financing, market reactions, Board of Director experts, business model, etc. are so ridiculous that it was obviously written by someone with no industry knowledge and who didn't care to do any research, or who was attempting to parody the Dot Com explosion, but didn't have any insight to do so. What makes this book so bad though is that people do not act like people in this book. For instance, the main character uses the term &quot;paradigm&quot; over and over again, as noun, adverb, adjective, and speaks like a Scott Adams consultant caricature (only much worse), yet the people around him all act like the pointy haired manager, instead of mocking the fool.Fortunately, the publisher used a big font and the reading goes pretty quick so the pain of being stuck with this book on a weekend trip ended mercifully much sooner than the heft would have implied."},{"Title":"The Street","review":"James Hanley is a Wall Street worker, tired of the daily grind.

Charles himself strove repeatedly for conciliar agreement both in political as well as ecclesiastical matters, calling council after council throughout the different kingdoms of his European empire. Loathe to shed Christian blood, force of arms became the last resort. Yet his personal example to lash out at the Turks (he succeeded in dealing a temporary blow to the piracy of the Sultan's admiral, Barbarossa, in Tunis) was never given continued impetus by others.Again, unlike his power hungry contemporaries, Charles formally retired from his position of Emperor to live the last years of his life quietly in Spain. His vast inheritance bequeathed intact to his son, Phillip II.This superhuman achievement could not be done by Charles alone and Brandi brings into the narrative the Emperor's able advisors, and the resilience of other family members that helped hold together such a sprawling conglomerate of European lands. Why no full length biography exists in English of Margaret, regent of the Netherlands and Queen Mary, her successor (Charles' aunt and sister), is a mystery. Particularly when the Antonia Fraser School of female historians exult any heroine they can find; a dual biography of those two remarkable women whose back to back reigns covered many years is long over due!C.V. Wedgwood's translation from German into English makes reading such a substantial biography nothing but smooth sailing: Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"Stuart Woods is a great novelist for those who haven't read him, especially if you read his early books. Chiefs is one of the great crime novels of the last century, for instance, and some of the other stuff he did earlier is good, also. But he seems to have come to the point in his life where he can crank these things out with almost no effort, and so he doesn't bother to do anything more than that.This book is a departure for him in that (other than the abovementioned Chiefs) I don't think he's ever done a historical novel. The main character, Rick Barron, is a detective in the Beverly Hills Police Department who's been demoted for getting the boss's neice pregnant. When he sees a car accident involving a nameless woman who runs a red light and a drunken Hollywood star who's driving too fast, he sees his chance and sweeps the whole thing under the rug, saving the actor's career. This leads to a job with the studio that employs the actor, and that of course leads to other adventures, including dealing with a local punk mobster, taking Clark Gable and David Niven on a fishing trip, and squiring various starlets around Hollywood. The difficulty is that, as has been said in the other reviews, no one (even Clark Gable, for Pete's sake!) is a very well-defined character.The plot also meanders along, and the last 50 pages or so are one long epilogue. The author does use some of his trademark plot devices: the main character's from Delano (where Chiefs is set, and one of his main characters, Will Lee, is from there too) and the movie studio is Centurion (Stone Barrington's off-again on-again wife has worked there). These don't seem to liven the book up much, though, and so I'm only lukewarm about it. It *does* have the usual Woods virtue of being easy to read."},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"The plot and story, as far as I read, appear to be copied from a Toby Peters mystery written by Stuart Kaminsky quite some time ago. I don't recall which Toby Peter's Hollywood set mystery. I don't intend to finish reading this book, since the Toby Peters' novels aren't my favorite among Kaminsky's many fictioal characters, so why read what appears to be a knockoff. If I am wrong, I apologize to Mr. Woods whose previous novels I've enjoyed."},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"Stuart Woods is one of my favorite authors but boy was I disappointed in his latest book.

This book has all the elements of a sappy, romantic one, which includes a patriotic view of the war. It has the stilted language of a B movie script. The author even gets Clark Gable, David Niven and Hedda Hopper to do cameo roles. If that isn't enough he gets Bugsy Siegel to make a menacing appearance. Mr. Woods warps history to make the story work, well almost.Even with all this it is still an enjoyable ride in a cream convertible, with the top down."},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"Woods' leading characters seem to be the same person only in different clothing. They also tend to come into money and success repeatedly through pure accident. In most of his books, the story is sufficiently well done that I gloss over this and enjoy the ride. Unfortunately, The Prince of Beverly Hills carries forward the worse aspects of all Woods' plots, but with little plot or story; it meanders around, miraculous things happen to the main character (through little effort of his own) and then ends."},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"Set in the 1940s, \\"The Prince of Beverly Hills\\" follows a semi-disgraced policeman by the name of Rick Barron who, while sitting in his patrol car one night in Beverly Hills and contemplating his recent demotion, witnesses an accident that will change his life quite dramatically for the better. One of the accident victims is a Hollywood leading man, and based on the way that Barron handles the events of the evening, he soon finds himself in the employ of the actor's studio. The book chronicle's Barron progression from head of studio security to head of production over the course of about 3 years, right at the outbreak of World War II. Along the way, he's forced to deal with a number of organized crime figures, including the infamous Ben \\"Bugsy\\" Seigel of Las Vegas lore. The book features fictional characters, but also a large number of appearances by non-fictional characters. In addition to Seigel, Clark Gable, David Niven, Greta Garbo, and several other celebrities from that era have brief roles in the plot.It's a fun read...nothing remotely cerebral here...and harkens back to a simpler time when Big Band music ruled the airwaves and Churchill occupied the Prime Minister's office. It's the type of book you could get through in a weekend quite easily.

I thoroughly enjoyed it. There are pieces of truth in this saga of early Hollywood that are so enjoyable. The stories of Gable and David Niven having gone to war, the mob's desire to get into Hollywood, and the bygone era of making stars. This was a superb story. To really appreciate it, get David Niven's wonderful five star books, THE MOON'S A BALLOON and BRING ON THE EMPTY HORSES. Both are superb and will help set the pieces of these two actors who are mentioned in Woods' book. Unfortunately for me, I've now read every one of Woods' books and have to wait until he writes another. He's one my my all time favorite authors. The commentary from the British star regarding Neville Chamberlain and Churchill are enlightening as well as true. The Niven books will truly give you insight into David's chats with Churchill and how he went home to England to fight the war, leaving Hollywood for six years. You've got to read this book...it's star quality page turner...Oh, and the bad guy reminds me of Lana Turner's boyfriend who was allegedly killed by Lana's daughter Cheryl.

But there's room in popular fiction for fairy tales: Clancy did it in \\"Patriot Games,\\" Parker has inumerable ones featuring Prince Spenser; so why not join the exploit-your-reputation band wagon of prince-based stories where everything works out perfectly albeit incredibly?The quality of writing in this book is a disappointment for a well-known author, but an entertaining, mindless read."},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"Not having read a Stuart Woods book before, (and based on this experience, I'll be avoiding him in the future!)I didn't have any preconceptions of him as an author. Based on this one book, he should look for another line of work immediately - as should the editors who had the nerve to publish this.The book opens w/ an LA cop committing an immoral, unethical and illegal act. Figuring this was a lead-in to a story about corruption in the LA police in the 1930s, I was disgusted to discover he's the hero! He never reflects on what he did as being wrong - he never reflects on anything, we are scarcely shown a thought in his head. That opening act leads to a series of highly improbable benefits and opportunities to him as he enters the movie business, first basically as a thug and before you know it, he's a producer!It's just filled with ridiculous things like, his boss suggests investing in real estate, and our 'hero' is driving in the little town of Malibu and thinks, this might be a good place to buy. Just so - obvious, unlikely.The story has all the outlines of a great plot - colorful characters, time and place. Except that none of the colors are filled in - to say these are cardboard characters is insulting to cardboard - they are toilet-paper thin.The whole thing reads like an outline of a book - except they forgot to make the author fill it in. It's an unabashed attempt to make money off of this author's reputation, and all involved should be ashamed."},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"After years working as a Beverly Hills detective, Rick Barron is busted down to police officer because he got his captain's daughter pregnant. One night he witnesses a traffic accident and recognizes that famous movie star Clete Barrow caused it. He quickly removes the license plates and registration from the vehicle so that no one knows that Clete caused the accident while under the influence of alcohol. On Clete's instructions, Rick calls Eddie Harris, a Centurion Studios Executive, who knows the right people to make the mess go away.Eddie is so impressed with Rick's handling of the fiasco he offers him a job as head of security. Rick eagerly accepts the position. His first assignment is to baby sit Clete until the film is finished. In the course of his new job, he crosses paths with Rick Stampano who has connections with Bugsy Siegel and Lucky Luciano. Stampano has a habit of beating up and almost killing studio girls; Rick tries to intercede and makes a deadly enemy. In an act of revenge, Stampano beats up Rick's fianc&eacute;e; an incident that must not go unpunished.Stuart Woods has written a fantastic stand alone tale that captures the ambience of Hollywood just prior to World War II through tidbits and real notables like Hedda Hopper referring to Rick as THE PRINCE OF BEVERLY HILLS because of his fancy garbs. The antagonist is a nasty person whom today would be considered a stalker for his preying on starlets, but the law cannot touch him since none of the victims want the adverse publicity. This is a rich, complex thriller about Hollywood, home to extortion, blackmail, and murder.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"I'm a big Woods fan but this was ultimately disappointing. It starts out great, driving story line, painting a picture of hollywood in the '30's that is thrilling. But he gets bogged down in the middle with too much WWII and the ending is non-existent. Yet, I'm hooked on Woods and look forward to his next one."},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"You know the feeling of your eyes holding themselves wide, focused on printed words, when the novel you're reading has solidified your point of vision into a laser chewing up words at a prime pace, not too slow, not too fast, for total absorption? This is a rare and automatically induced process which I, of course, welcome when reading escape fiction. During the final chapters in PRINCE OF BEVERLY HILLS, that auto pilot had engaged itself to the max. That was what I was there for. Yes!My second novel by Stuart Woods had a mesmerizing opening of a policeman observing an auto accident and secreting an important actor from the site. Indications were clear that the officer was a \\"good guy\\" yet he was willingly altering the truth of vehicular death.How would that choice affect his life.How would the ripples from those few quick actions affect others around the stone cast into the pond.Since the character was pure, those questions were prime and had me settled securely into the plot for the long haul.What's more, the middle of the book owned every moment as well, as it slid me effortlessly into Hollywood in the 30's. I don't do history books well, though I'm fascinated with times past. I'd rather find a way to travel through time, forward and reverse, than wade through most history tomes or novels which call themselves historic. Though, I did read and enjoy the Oliver Wendell Holmes story (not recalling the title at the moment, since I read that one sometime in my years raining over a muddied collegiate career, ages, and one-youth-ago).Stuart Woods clips and flits facts and faces from that \\"All-Roads-Headed-to-Hitler\\" era into fictional scenes, themes, dreams, and schemes, \\"employing\\" as characters the creme of the crops of humanity's best and worst. The way this author accomplished this time-weld of history into fiction in crisp, simple elegance brought out for me a clear, unadulterated voice from that period.The rapid, easy style seemed to fly through that historic landmark era like a temporal kaleidoscope, periodically pausing to toss fast-speed tumbles of chaos into visual vignettes of celluloid crystal. This novel should be the breakthrough of Stuart Woods's prose into film.This one's a movie done in prose, poured on paper. What a short, quick step it would be to take THE PRINCE OF BEVERLY HILLS through the Gateway of Digital Art.The characters, plot, and setting had such an artistic edge of simplicity, the resultant style seemed to me to capture the rhythm and feel of the 30's more than most movies or books I've read. I believe that the way these characters viewed their immediate, living moments, their spits and splits of spontaneity which became our history; was very on target with reality as it was perceived and LIVED then, rather than reality as we have conjured and embellished it through a time-warped lense.People then weren't as personality complex/analytical as pop psychology has mutated We The People of the 20th and 21st centuries to be ... or like to think we are as we second, third, and fourth guess everything before we burst forth into a \\"split-second\\" decision which has stretched onto, around, and through a psychiatrist's Prozac-enhanced-sofa to ramble on-and-on, before-and-after any event-of-choice.It took me a while to adjust myself to this accurate \\"throw-back\\" of the characterizations in this novel, which were genius in their BEING in the 30's instead of acting like we would if we were to time travel there and try to \\"fit in.\\" For me, most historic novels have a difficult time (and few succeed) actually capturing the personal viewpoints, the ways-of-thinking in a true stream-of-consciousness, of people living in the present-time author's chosen time frames of \\"back then.\\" (That's a Time Tongue Twist.)The result of feeling this VERITY of living through a segment of the 30's in Hollywood came so close to actually having \\"been there\\" ... in another life, or what?I'm left with one question:Does Stuart Woods fly a Time Machine in addition to his airplanes? (See his web site, a to-the-point, no phony-flower-come-ons, for details on how dedicated a flier and writer he is.)The ambiance is so rich here, yet it's so pared down, so balsamic, especially compared to THE GODFATHER, or other early Hollywood based novels.What I kept flashing to while reading The Prince was Sidney Sheldon's memoirs, THE OTHER SIDE OF ME, which I've reviewed and which touched me on a level somewhere between heart and soul, linking the two.In an act which was depleting to me, that buying page for Sheldon's book was overwhelmed by a collection of readers who seemed justified to use a man's memoirs for target practice. My review was in-depth enough with raves (honestly, I'm not a lunatic) that it slipped right into the bulls-eye to receive 26 \\"No\\" darts, with most of those hitting within a few hours in a single afternoon. That's impressive negativity.After that hit-and-run blitzkrieg, Sidney's memoirs began falling dramatically in sales rank. The book didn't have a chance. I was powerless to do anything about it, other than work very hard to begin breathing again around a flattened heart. I wasn't hurting for me on that one, as much as for Sheldon and for the \\"in-your-face\\" view of how ugly people can be with seemingly honest righteousness and justification. Taste is taste? I wonder.Reading these two books, somewhat as two sides of the same Movie Industry Coin, might turn dollars to donuts and mint to creme. Add coffee and you have a life-fueling dream. In any case, this pair of reads gave me what felt like a true glimpse of that early Hollywood history which I believe I couldn't have received anywhere else, except through a died-in-the-wool Time Machine.If I had a choice between reading only one novel, either WINDS OF WAR or THE PRINCE OF BEVERLY HILLS, to get my only hint of that snatch of history, I'd choose The Prince to get a balsamic edge of the time, and feel I'd been there.This is not to discount the glorious achievement of Herman Wouk's work. The customer review collection on Amazon on the WINDS OF WAR buying page are excellent, worth taking your time to read, whether you have or have not read that masterpiece. I have, but that was another long ago event which I hope to repeat at some point. It will mean much more to me after having relished and digested the \\"preface\\" of THE PRINCE, which will linger in my mind for a long time. It was the lack of detail overwhelm which placed such a crisp vitality on the details included.Reading The Prince made me believe that true \\"Living History,\\" as horrifying as some of it absolutely was, was less heavy than NOW. Maybe it's the 21st century which has gained ungainly weight, so much so I'm wondering when gravity is going to get a set of concrete shoes, and Time will ... drop ... dead ... from not being able to take one ... more ... step ...Oops. Got carried away in my own drama there.I like living now.I also like being given an easy, juicy bite of a literal piece of history, for the price of a hardback novel, discounted, no less.Oh. And. One. More. Thing:Throughout the read, I continued to feel that this was the book in which Stuart Woods lived out a few of his highest fantasies, some of his alternate dreams. That feeling added warmth and endearment to the book's ability to take me for a ride. This was the type of engrossing intrigue I like. Beats the bruises out of extended grit and gore based on rush onward to, punch, punch, punch, and push, push, push.As the World Turns, it's a wonder we don't all fall off,Linda G.

I hope he pens another book on the main character here, Rick Barron, and his lovely actress-wife. Half the interest is because of the timing and the setting of the novel: 1930s and '40s Hollywood.

Thanks, Stuart, for another page-turner!"},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"Some of the editorial reviews mentioned that this book was a thriller - it wasn't, in my opinion. Have never read Woods before, but found his book to be pretty entertaining. Rick Bannon joins the elite Hollywood scene as security guard for a major studio. His position involves protecting movie stars from themselves, and we follow him through the course of some months at this job and the troubles he encounters. It was a bit like LA Confidential I guess.. very old Hollywood, and the feeling you get is the same.. old style. The only part I disliked was the ending (well, the last few chapters). The last few chapters dealt with the war, and it seemed very out of place and unnecessary."},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"When police detective Rick Barron sees film star Clete Barrow crash his car in a highway accident, he efficiently whisks the drunken actor away from the scene and wards off bad publicity for Centurion Pictures and their famous British star. In return, he is hired into the coveted position of the head of security for the film studio. When he probes into the mysterious death of his predecessor and the beatings of several actresses, his investigations lead to a murder cover-up and blackmail. He soon runs up against a cast of shady characters that threaten his own safety.In a departure from his Stone Barrington novels, Woods has produced a fast-paced and entertaining story of intrigue and organized crime against the backdrop of Hollywood in its heyday. This setting provides ample opportunity for Woods to mix a bit of history and glamour into the story. As the United States hovers on the brink of the Second World War, it touches the lives of the story's characters. Rick Barron meets Bugsy Siegel, Clark Gable, and Greta Garbo. He is dubbed \\"Prince of Beverly Hills\\" by Hedda Hopper. He listens to the big band sounds of Artie Shaw.

The movie studios are becoming big business in the heyday of Gable, Garbo, and Hopper; but war troubles loom in Europe as the Nazi machine is gearing up for conquest.Rick gets his job through handling big star Clete Barrow's auto accident, in which he squirrels the actor away before bad publicity sets in, to the ever grateful appreciation of the studio. Soon he has plenty of money, a glamorous convertible, and increasing pull with the top executives of the studio. Before long, he himself is an assistant producer and apparently latches on to the work quickly as he is successful right from the start. His careful covering of a rising female star's attempted suicide also endears him both to his bosses and to the lovely lady herself, and soon romance ensues! All is swell but for the interference of mob thug Chick Stampano who keeps rearing his ugly head, as part of a blackmailing scheme, throughout virtually the whole book. In the end, who will prevail?The plot meanders to a somewhat slow ending, but this novel is not exactly a thriller with a big hunt or whodunit that needs a flashy ending. Rather, it is more of a period piece that entertains with historical perspective, an amusing story set amid the glory of the movie capital, and characters with whom it is fun to spend an afternoon or so enjoying their tribulations and victories. Woods' writing is as always in fine form, and frankly we didn't miss the explicit sex so common in his Barrington tales. All in all, the new characters and early Americana (albeit Hollywood!) gave us a pleasurable few hours of light reading without overwhelming violence, sex, or intrigue.

I mean you don't read fiction as a means of actually furthering your education or anything. You read it because it is fun and enjoyable. You lose yourself it the book as a 3rd party observer and go for a literary ride for a while. Well this ride was fun for about 3/4 of the book. After that if feels like your are on a descent roller coaster of fiction going along with the story and then 3/4 of the way through the book Stuart Woods kind of hops the track and takes you on a path that has absolutely nothing to do with the previous 250 pages. I actually liked the beginning and middle and should have stopped there and then made up my own ending and I would have given it 3 stars. Don't waste your time or money on this one...or do if you want to chuckle at what a silly ending the books has. I really can't say enough at how it seems Stuart Woods just really got tired of writing this book and then just farmed out the ending to someone that hadn't actually read the first 3/4 of the book."},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"Although I've been disappointed with several of his last offerings, Stuart Woods is back in the game and has hit a home run with THE PRINCE OF BEVERLY HILLS, a lush tale about Hollywood in the late 1930's.Former Beverly Hills detective Rick Barron has been demoted - - due to a messy liaison with his boss' niece - - and just happens to be in the right place (Sunset Boulevard) at the right time (about 2 in the morning) when a major movie star wrecks his car and, if the press finds out about it, his brilliant career.Barron ends up on the movie studio payroll as the \\"clean up\\" guy and finds there is more to films that acting. He has to insure that the movie star finishes his picture. His predecessor has some pretty smarmy contacts, the remnants of which are left in the studio's safe. Even mobster Bugsy Seagal enters the scene.Toss in a bevy of beautiful starlets, a lot of interesting story lines and Woods has given his fans a great read.I look forward to more stories about Hollywood's Gilded Age and watching Woods develop Rick Barron into a movie mogul.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"Changing a character's name and the setting of the story doesn't make for a new character. Send Stone Barrington back 65 years, move him to California, and welcome to the world of Rick Barron.Rick, a beat cop, happens to witness a car accident, and scuttles the drunk movie actor back to his studio with no regard for the person he killed. For that, he's rewarded with a job as the studio's director of security and Stone's lifestyle -- a great job, new car, house and wardrobe, rich important friends, tons of money and all the beautiful women he can eyeball. Then, for some inexplicable reason, he's suddenly a movie producer, producing Hollywood blockbusters. Then, suddenly he's a Navy pilot. and we get rushed through the last 50 pages of Rick's war adventures.I guess Woods knows that his Stone Barrington series is down the toilet, so he decided to deceive readers into thinking he had a new character and storyline in order to get them to buy his latest piece of garbage, when in fact it was the same old, same old. Holly at least was different when she started out, and didn't fall into the trap until she inherited money and met up with Stone in New York. Now Woods can boast of having three lousy series going at the same time.Don't waste your money, particularly if you're a Stone Barrington reader...you've seen it all before."},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"I have read all of Wood's various books starting with the sailing book he wrote years ago. I have always enjoyed his writting and looked forward to every new book. Sorry to say this book was an extreme dissapointment. Very simple plot lines and a new character who was so much like Stone Barrington I don't know why he even created a new one. Every characteristic of this \\"new\\" character screamed Stone Barrington to me. This looks like a book that was just tossed out and it is an insult to all the fans of Woods for him to give us a book that he obviously didn't take pride in. I will be more careful with his next book and not just buy it because it is written by Woods."},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"This was my first Stuart Woods book, and I really enjoyed it. I'm not a big fan of mystery and murder, but since it took place in 1930's/1940's Hollywood, I had to read it.Rick Barron starts out as a demoted Beverly Hills cop, but after handling a 'situation' with one of Centurion Studios biggest stars, Eddie Harris (#2 man at the studio) offers Rick an offer he can't refuse as Head of Security for Centurion. All too happy to leave the BHPD, he takes the job, and is fast becoming the hot new man in town. While looking out for the well being of the studio's stars, Rick lands himself in some trouble with mobster Chick Stampano. Chick has a habit of beating up and blackmailing Hollywood's leading ladies, and Rick's not about to put up with it...so with the help of some friends, he sets out to take care of his little mob problem.Overall I really enjoyed the book. It was fast paced, and almost impossible to put down. My only issue with the book was the names. Mr. Woods would use the same name for different characters, and it got a bit confusing at times...especially since it just wasn't necessary, (i.e...the two studio exec's named Eddie, the two Ben's, the two Jacks, Barrow and Barron...why couldn't everyone have a different name?).In the end, I definitely recommend this. I don't know that I'll read many more of his books in the future seeing as how I don't care for detective stories...but the man is a great author. And should I ever feel the urge to read one, Mr. Woods will be at the top of my list."},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"There once was a time when Stuart Woods was a good writer. Nowadays, he seems to be little more than passable, and it often seem that the only reason I'm still reading his books are (a) the hope that he will return to previous form and (b) they remain quick reads. In his latest book, The Prince of Beverly Hills, we are treated to a new character and setting, but it is the same old Woods, aspiring to be little more than a simple beach read.In Prince, we are introduced to Rick Barron, a Beverly Hills cop in 1939 who happens upon a drunk driving accident involving A-list actor Clete Barrow. Barron covers up the crime and is rewarded with a high level studio security job, along with a new home and car. Not unlike Woods series character Stone Barrington, success just seems to come naturally to Barron. Although he needs to contend with a mid-level gangster named Chick Stampano (an obvious fictional version of real-life criminal Johnny Stompanato) and various real organized crime figures, this almost seems to be a distraction from Barron's life of glamor and girls.As usual, Woods tells a pretty straightforward story with minimal twists. The story is a minor diversion but far from great literature. Perhaps most annoying in this book is Woods's inability to create any real variety in names. Almost all his characters are similarly named, with many having double-r's, including Barrow, Barron (only one letter difference!), Harris, Morrison and Terry, with almost everyone else having some other double-letter combination. I suppose there could be some sort of joke behind this, but I'm missing it.Finally, Woods treats Barrow as a generally good guy and immediately dismisses the fact that this man killed an innocent woman due to his drunk driving; no guilt is ever felt by this character, not because he is some sort of sociopath, but merely because the woman is completely forgotten. Her death is a mere plot device to get Barron into his new career (and he never has any regrets over using this dead woman to get all his dreams to come true). There is something distasteful about the whole thing, and demonstrates Woods's inability to create a story with any sort of real depth.So even if this is a fast read and minimally entertaining, it once again shows that Woods either has fading talents or is not interested in quality writing. I may continue to check out his books - in hope of the good old days - or I may not; he has been trying my patience for too long. Even if you're just looking for that beach book to kill some idle hours, you can do better than this completely skippable book."},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"There was a time I looked forward to the latest Stuart Woods books. His books read faster than any other author's, the perfect beach read book. I particularly like his short chapters that leave a cliffhanger and won't let you stop until you've read just a little more. This book takes you back to some of his best work in the beginning and middle of his career like White Cargo, Swimming to Catalina and New York Dead.Woods returns to a period piece of a Los Angeles detective who quickly finds him working as a studio detective who must protect actors & actresses from their many vices and various bad guys. Obviously that provides plenty of love interests for his main character. What makes this book different is that he overlays the main characters with a few chosen stars. In addition, the main protagonist is clearly written after Johnny Stampato who died at the hands of Lana Turner's daughter.All of this makes the book interesting and extremely readable. Woods writes his books as personal fantasies. That's why the good guy, pseudo Woods, always gets the girl, always wins the fights, and always enjoys Woods' hobbies such as flying, sailing and in this case, fly fishing.I strongly recommend this book for anyone interested in a fast, enjoyable read on the beach without trying to tax your mind. Escape from the office in this book!"},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"I for one, have gotten slightly tired of Stone Barrington, and his exploits in and out of bed. (How many of us know anyone that, er, energetic???)Set in pre-WW II,the Prince of Beverly Hills deals with recently demoted cop Rick Barron being in the right spot at the right time, helping top star Clete Barron. The studio is so grateful that they make him head of security, or rather a very highly paid baby sitter to ensure Barron makes it on time to studio shoots, etc.They are likeable characters all, and there is the glamour of Hollywood, as well as the sex, drugs, and unsavory folks who enforce orders from even slimier folks.The real stars who mentioned mesh in with Woods' characters and story line.A welcome change to Stone and company...just once I wish he'd...have a headache........!!!"},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"In The Prince of Beverly Hills Woods has introduced a new main character, Rick Barron, who rises from being a demoted police detective to a big career in the movie industry. In his book, which takes place between the late 1930's-early 1940's, Woods weaves the right amount of interesting characters, history and excitement that results in a very enjoyable, entertaining and fast-paced story. The Prince of Beverly Hills is the perfect type of book for a plane ride, vacation or for when you just want something light 'escape' reading that will keep you turning the pages and engrossed. If you're looking for something heavier and thought-provoking to read, I'd suggest that you skip this book. My one criticism with The Prince of Beverly Hills -- and it's a minor one -- is the ease with which everything good falls into the leading character's lap. Nonetheless, I'm looking forward to the next book featuring Rick Barron."},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"This is a rollicking read - Woods is at the top of his game - a big improvement over his last book. But the unresolved hit-and-run at the very beginning of the book was unsettling."},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"I am an avid Stuart Woods reader and eagerly wait for his books.However, this is not up to his usually high standards.Don't get me wrong, it was an easy read but it lacked something. Whether it was the the wit of Barrington or the sensual nature of Holly, I don't know but it definitely was missing some key ingredient. For such an easy read as Woods books are, I didn't get into this book until around page 220 when it finally got some substance.The ending was just not Woods. And what was the fishing trip to Oregon all about?I look forward to reading another Stone Barrington adventure next"},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"Stuart Woods has a new character in his novel stable... Rick Barron is introduced in The Prince Of Beverly Hills.Set in the '30s, Barron is a cop in Beverly Hills that has been demoted from detective due to a run-in with the head of the department. While doing a late-night stint watching traffic, he witnesses a deadly accident involving a film star at Centurion Studios. When he gets the actor back to the studio without alerting officials, the head of the studio sees him as a replacement for the security head who recently was involved in a murder/suicide. Barron takes the job and fits in well, impressing everyone with his creativity and results. But when he runs into an associate of the Mafia, he ends up with a price on his head. Furthermore, it looks like this associate was also involved in his predecessor's demise. Barron has to figure out how this all ties together while keeping himself alive in the process.I didn't go into this book with many expectations, and soon found myself wrapped up in the story. The main character is a strange mix between someone who works around the rules and someone you can count on. The subplots of love and friendship set against the escalating war in Europe also lends a different slant on the story. I hope that Woods continues this character for a few novels, as I think this would be an interesting series to follow."},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"I loved this book. I hope Stuart Woods writes more books with these characters!"},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"What better setting for a noir thriller than 1930s Hollywood ? Think Greta Garbo in a slinky long charmeuse gown. Think Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. in navy blazer and impeccable white flannels. Think of all the power plays, machinations, and secret assignations.Who better to read this tale of a tawdry mess in tinseltown than voice actor Guerin Barry? Subtle yet suspenseful is his stock in trade which makes listeners not want to miss a syllable.Beverly Hills detective Rick Barron has smarts, gumption, and a healthy dose of self-esteem. Nonetheless, he's just been demoted. As luck would have it, he's on the scene when top box office draw Clete Barrow is involved in an auto accident. Barron, usually one to think on his feet, pulls Clete away from the scene thus avoiding some nasty publicity.The head of Centurion Pictures is so grateful to Barron that he offers him the job of studio security chief (his predecessor having gone to his eternal reward in a murder/suicide). One dream of a job thinks Barron. All he has to do is keep Barrow sober enough to emote, and look after some local lovelies.Romance blossoms with one of the lovelies and soon the pair are seen about town, and the press is calling Barron \\"The Prince of Beverly Hills.\\" But heavy, heavy is the princely crown when a couple of murders occur. (Even Bugsy Siegal is involved in the dirty deeds).Give a listen to an absorbing tale of crime that needs punishment in La La land.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"I think my title says it all, but I'll add a few reasons why. Bad writing, unappealing characters with no characterization at all (actually, that's a bit of a feat - how did Woods manage that?)trite dialogue, idiotic plot. Need I say more? I guess I'm especially bitter because I was trapped on a five hour flight, had already seen the movie being shown and all I had to read was this book. I wanted to parachute out of the plane. I see that used copies of this book are available for one cent. Save your penny."},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"I usually buy Stuart Woods books as soon as they come out, but somehow this one I missed. I got it recently when a bookstore had a buy 3 get one free sale. I'm glad I didn't actually spend any money on it. It's a fairly 'ho-hum' story, where the action just never seems to pick up. The ending of the book was also a big disappointment for me. I think there was so much more potential in the story, but Woods' just wasn't up to some of his better efforts. One of my personal favorites still is Imperfect Strangers. Some of his more recent books just haven't had the same level of suspense."},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"I really enjoyed this new character. While I miss Stone, Will and The lovely lady from Florida, this was a great book. I hope to see this character again. There are so many great characters out there, I wish we could read about them every year. But I will take quality over quantity every day."},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"I started reading Stuart Woods a couple of years ago. The first books I read were the Holly Barker novels. Then I got into the Stone Barrington books. \\"The Prince of Beverly Hills\\" is the first stand-alone novel I have read by Woods. This books intrigued me because it takes place in a time period that is shrouded in high glamour. Some of the mystique is rubbed away with this book but not all of it. Rick is one of Woods' best characters, a Stone Barrington of the past, almost. I can't wait till the next Barrington novel but this was a good break. Fast paced and exciting as always."},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"I am a long-time fan of Mr. Woods ever since my husband & listened to \\"The Run\\" as an audio book (and nothing beats the page-turning story of that book for me). And although I've been disappointed in the last few lackluster offerings in the Stone Barrington series, this latest story is an intriguing departure for Mr. Woods.I was initially drawn to the 1930s/1940s Hollywood setting as I am a huge fan of the movies of that era and was then sucked in by the story which took off and continued for most of the rest of the book in Woods' classic page-turning style. The story of Rick Barron's rise from Hollywood cop to Hollywood producer may seem impossibly fast and easy under the microscope of reality, but Woods has always had a knack for making the unlikely remarkably palusible and he doesn't disappoint here. Once you've been hooked into the story, you're off at a gallopping pace which doesn't slow or pause until nearly the end. (Remind yourself to take a breath once in a while!)The only real disappointment in the story was the last 15 pages or so. It felt as if once the climax of the book was reached, there was nothing more Woods wanted to say, so it seemed he just provided some basic facts from the next 10 years or so of everyone's lives to wrap things up and answer readers' potential questions about what happened to everyone later. It felt rushed and underdeveloped to me.Personally, I would have rather even seen the book end not long after the climax with a cliffhanger which would have had me panting to know what happened in the next episode of Rick Barron's life and clamoring for a sequel. Sadly, in light of the existing ending, it doesn't feel like that will happen. Too bad!! I would have enjoyed reading the exploits of a Stone Barrington-type in Old Hollywood for years to come! What potential for a series!A side note: I very much enjoyed the use of real, well-known people in this book (as well as in others). Whether as side characters or as more prominent ones, I think this makes things more fun and makes those people seem more real and human. Who knows if it could have happened or not? Even the most diehard fan of any person doesn't know every detail about every minute of their lives. And it's fun to imagine that maybe it did or that it could have happened.Thanks, Mr. Woods, for a very enjoyable book."},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"I am currently getting caught up on the works of Stuart Woods, and purchasing them here is proving to be an affordable way to do this."},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"If you love Hollywood and the old studio system; you will love this book.

I would prefer more Ed Eagle, etc. but Stone is probably the biggest money maker."},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"Stuart Woods has made a great novel about Hollywood in the 1930's and I can see this as a \\"film noir\\" but in a novel. The main character is a a policeman who quits the force before being fired man named Rick Barron. He sees a car accident and one of the drivers is a famous Hollywood actor named Clete Barrow who is a self-admitted alcoholic. Barron wisely decides to inform a big producer instead of his superiors and thus begins a career in Hollywood for former Policeman Barron. Barron is hired by \\"Centurion Studios\\" Vice President and is set up to be Chief of Security and later a producer. Along the way he makes enemies with a two bit Mafia Hood and falls in love with a small town girl who is now a famous actress. This is a great novel and Barrow throws in some famous Hollywood names from David Niven to Greta Garbo in the novel. This is yet another interesting read by one of the modern masters of detective mystery's. It is a departure for Woods not to have Stone Barrington in this novel...Wait! He is but not until the last pages and then a minor role for Mr. Barrington. A great novel that is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"I enjoyed this novel for a few reasons. First, it's a new character for Stuart Woods and not one that will spin off his other world of Stone Barrington and Holly Barker. Second is that the setting has changed. Now we are in 1939 Hollywood versus today New York. The mingling with movie stars, media moguls and mobsters was good. The story keeps moving and stays interesting though filled with some how-to-make-a-movie facts. The charater, as usual, continues to follow a string of good luck with wealth and women. And, as usual, is a pilot. Since this is a new character I go along with developing him, this time. Hopefully there will be less \\"development\\" in the future Rick Barron novels."},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"I enjoyed it at first, then realized the writer was taking it easy, coasting from success to success in the person of Rick Barron. Demoted from detective to car patrolman, late one night he witnesses a horrific car collision. The driver who died had not stopped at the STOP sign, certainly, and was technically at fault. The drunken driver who drove at 60 mpg down Sunset Blvd. survives and happens to be famous British actor Clete Barrow. Thinking quickly, Barron rescues him and carts him to his bungalow on the Centurion lot. Eddie Harris, Centurion's producer is grateful and makes sure the accident is kept out of the news. For that matter, the death of the woman driver disappears from everyone's consciousness. Eddie Harris brings Rick Barron into Centurion as head of security, a special kind of security intended to suppress and smooth over similar incidents. The most troublesome flea in Barron's and the studio's fur is a mobster named Stampano who beats up actresses and works for Lucky Luciano. Luciano happens to be serving prison time though that is a minor inconvenience in his operations. It is apparent to me that Stampano is modeled after the mobster Johnny Stompanato who is killed by actress Lana Turner's daughter Cheryl, who was protecting her mother. As Rick Barron proceeds from success to success in becoming the Prince of Beverly Hills, and Clete Barrow endears himself to all as a charming good fellow, everyone but perhaps the reader forgets about the killing of the woman driver in the start of the story. So do Barron and Barrow, although the latter may never have been aware of his guilt. The story -- what there is of it -- is devoid of a fictional structure -- no plot, no conflicts, no highs no lows. It is simply a narrative as though committed to a journal. A cheap and easy piece of nonwork."},{"Title":"The Prince of Beverly Hills","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I will be looking into any other works by Mr. Woods.

I enjoyed the refreshing immediacy of Yastrebtsev's first-hand accounts of his visits with Rimsky not only for the candid comments, but also for an intimate look into the composer's daily habits.

Prior to this book, the version of events promoted by the Comintern had been widely prevalent. This book was a real turning point on this issue in the historiography. It may be be best to simply cite what A.J.P. Taylor said in the introduction to the English edition of this book, alongside of other comments made by more recent historians.-----The case against the Nazis rested on two arguments or rather assumptions: the first that van der Lubbe was a physical degenerate who was incapable of starting the fires alone; the second that it was impossible, in any case, for the fires to have been started by a single man. Herr Tobias has shaken both these assumptions. He shows that van der Lubbe was quick-witted, ingenious, and physically active. His defective eyesight was balanced, as often happens, by sensitivity in other ways. He described precisely how he had set fire to the Reichstag; and his description tallied with the evidence. The police took him through the Reichstag with a stop-watch. He covered the ground at exactly the right times...The strongest point in Herr Tobias's book is perhaps the firm and final demonstration that neither the Nazis nor anyone else could have come through the famous 'tunnel' from Goering's house. Use of this tunnel by the Nazis was an ingenious Communist speculation, plausible only to those who knew nothing of the physical obstacles which the tunnel and its many locked doors provided. We are thus left with two conclusions. There is no firm evidence that the Nazis had anything to do with the fire. There is much evidence that van der Lubbe did it alone, as he claimed.------- From the introduction to the English edition by A.J.P. Taylor to Fritz Tobias, THE REICHSTAG FIRE, pp. 14-5.-----But the most likely fact is that van der Lubbe acted alone and was exactly what he seemed: a confused insignificant man, desperate for a place, any place, in a politics, indeed a world, from which he felt himself forever excluded... The whole case for a larger conspiracy responsible for torching the Reichstag rests on one dubious assumption: That it was a physical impossibility for one person alone to have set so many fires so quickly in such a very large building. This assumption dominated the claims of both Goebbels and Muenzenberg. Tobias refutes it decisively. The boy had stuffed his pockets with cheap phosphorous and paraffin fuses, very easily lit and long-lasting--the kind used every morning by Berlin housewives to start the coal in their kitchen stoves. He had dashed through the empty building tossing one after another of these at anything that looked like it would burn. Much would burn. The vast Sessions Chamber was lined with tinder-dry wood and dusty curtains, and the snaking fire took only minutes to suck them up into an inferno.------- Stephen Koch, DOUBLE LIVES: SPIES AND WRITERS IN THE SECRET SOVIET WAR OF IDEAS AGAINST THE WEST, pp. 102-3.-----Subsequently, the Communists attempted to prove that the Nazis had been behind the arson attempt, but the authenticity of van der Lubbe's statements and associated documentation seems beyond doubt. Moreover, numerous forgeries and falsifications have been found among the documentary evidence purporting to prove Nazi involvement... So far, the conclusion of Tobias and Mommsen that van der Lubbe acted alone has not been shaken.------- Richard Evans, THE COMING OF THE THIRD REICH, pp. 518-9.-----The fire had been intended as a protest against the new German government by the Dutch loner Marinus van der Lubbe, a former Communist.------- Nikolaus Wachsmann, HITLER'S PRISONS: LEGAL TERROR IN NAZI GERMANY, p. 72.-----It is by no means clear that the Nazis, as most of Hitler's contemporaries and and historians presumed for decades, were behind the fire...... neither Nazis nor Communists were able to produce a shred of credible evidence linking Lubbe with conspirators from the other party. Fifty years later, another \\"International Commission of Inquiry\\" unearthed \\"new\\" evidence and concluded that a Nazi team led by Reinhard Heydrich was probably behind the blaze--but this evidence turned out to have been just as flimsily constructed as that provided in the BROWN BOOK...The BROWN BOOK took pains to \\"prove\\" with Regler's photos of Wallot's 1889 plans that there was a secret underground passage leading from the Reichstag to the official residence of Hermann Goering as Reichstag president. In fact the \\"underground passage\\" was a narrow 450-foot long tunnel filled with steam pipes from the boiler room, which had been constructed at a distance from the Reichstag \\"in order that there should be no source of fire within Parliament itself.\\" The Speaker's residence, built after Wallot drew his plans, was then also connected to the boiler room, through its own steampipe tunnel. The entrance to this underground pipe network from the Reichstag was then further protected by an almost impenetrable \\"maze of corridors and [locked] doors,\\" in which a court investigator, sent to test the thesis of a team of incendiaries entering through the speaker's house, got lost and had to be rescued by a search team...------ Sean McMeekin, THE RED MILIONAIRE: A POLTICAL BIOGRAPHY OF WILLI MUENZENBERG, pp. 258, 268, 361.OK, I think that illustrates the point. Tobias reliably establishes that the most likely sequence of events was that Marinus van der Lubbe set the fire on his own initiative without any help from either the Nazis or Communists. Goering already had plans to begin arresting Left-wing political opponents and didn't need the fire for anything. Once the fire had been set, both the Nazis and Communists rushed to hurriedly accuse each other. The Nazis did such a bad job before the western public that many people subsequently assumed that the Comintern's version of events with the Nazis as culprits in the fire must be correct. In fact, there's no real evidence that anyone other than a lone individual ever planned the fire.In the last few years I've seen some (in my opinion) well-meaning people make the charge that \\"Bush needed a Reichstag fire!\\" What this book highlights very well is the need to be careful with accusations of this type, even when you may be hostile to the politician being accused. So many people at the time simply accepted the Comintern's distorted version of the Reichstag fire merely out of distaste for Hitler. Yet from Tobias we realize that this was not a historically reliable methodology. There are some worthwhile lessons in this book for a serious reader."},{"Title":"The Learning Paradigm College","review":"John Tagg's \\"The Learning Paradigm College\\" is one of the very greatest books on higher education that I have ever read, and I have read a lot of them.

Though I read other book from Ornestein, I was expecting to find deep research on brain assymetry, which this book is poor, there's nothing you can't find over Internet on related sites.

Conclusion: Ornstein book is not that bad at all. If you like Oliver Sacks and psychological views of brain, this is indeed a good choice. Wrong Title though, coz it doesn't have much about brain lateralization itself (by the way, the book enphasizes the importance of both hemispheres working together - which is quite obvious when you want a scientific approach - but many people forget on daily life)."},{"Title":"The Right Mind: Making Sense of the Hemispheres","review":"This book has lots of interesting information. The author has done his homework. However, it gets boring at times and also the entire first 1/3 of the book just assumes that you believe in the theory of evolution."},{"Title":"The Right Mind: Making Sense of the Hemispheres","review":"Ornstein's early writings on right brain/left brain differences led to a veritable explosion of research and writing on the subject. In this book he's written an excellent summary of the current state of our understanding: although it's clear that the halves of the brain have different areas of specialization, he emphasizes strongly that they need to work together to enable us to function fully as human beings. He's bemused (and sometimes annoyed) at the popular tendency to romanticize the right brain as the seat of creativity and denigrate the left brain as an unimaginative literalist; the facts show that both halves are involved in such complex human activities as listening to music and understanding jokes. His summary of the 19th-century debates on brain functioning was very useful and informative. And his conclusion that psychology needs to pay more attention to the various ways human beings have pursued spiritual development over the millennia is, I think, a very timely reminder: psychology has tended to dismiss this behavior as &quot;superstition,&quot; but, as other writers have pointed out (e.g., Epstein's &quot;Thoughts Without a Thinker&quot;), it has as much to do with developing the full power of your mind as with addressing something &quot;out there.&quot; Ornstein writes clearly and humorously, and the book packs an amazing amount of knowledge into its rather brief length."},{"Title":"The Right Mind: Making Sense of the Hemispheres","review":"This book is not simply a sterile collection of ideas about the right and left hemispheres of the brain. It is a superbly-paced, well thought out text, one that leads the reader not only to an understanding of how the halves of the brain may work, but to an idea of how the skills possessed within these parts of the brain might work together to produce the 'right' mind for a given situation. I loved the last sentence of this book-it puts it all together in a way that is just right. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the subject."},{"Title":"The Right Mind: Making Sense of the Hemispheres","review":"Partly as a result of Ornstein's earlier book on the divided brain 25 years ago, the terms left and right brain have become part of of daily vocabularly. Even adverts talk about developing the right brain. Not surprisingly there are a lot of confusions on the topic as well. That's why Ornstein's return to the topic should be welcomed by anyone with an interest in the brain and how the mind works. He shows how the simple idea that people are either left or right brained is simply wrong but that the two work together in fascinating ways that we are only just beginning to understand. For a fine example of entertaining yet easy to understand science writing, turn to his section describing what is involved in understanding a joke and the different way patients who have lost the use of parts of their left or right brain respond to jokes. Other topics like dreams and schizophrenia also can be seen in a new light when seen from this interaction between the hemispheres.

The author presents his view that, to summarize, the Left hemisphere is concerned more or less with the details of living and everyday affairs, while the Right hemisphere is more involved with the big picture. Toward this end he compares the duties of the left side with the processing of high-frequency, or rapidly changing information and that of the right side with low-frequency, or gradually changing information. It may be of interest to note that scientists developing machine-oriented visual systems have adopted the practice of breaking images into low-frequency, which presents the overall or general picture, and high-frequency, which provides detail, information."},{"Title":"The Right Mind: Making Sense of the Hemispheres","review":"It is rare for a researcher to admit he has changed his mind.

In &quot;Right Mind&quot; Dr. Ornstein summarizes events of the last 20 years relating to the expansion and exploitation of this knowledge and examines what remains of the promise and the deception arising from the beliefs that the differentiation in the cortex would lead to a new understanding of man. The concept of educating the respective sides of the brain is discussed in some detail, and Dr. Ornstein's conclusions are not always in accord with those who have made certain assumptions about what that training needs to be, (or even if it is training at all!)."},{"Title":"The Right Mind: Making Sense of the Hemispheres","review":"Readers with previous experience with Ornstein's books may find The Right Mind the most interesting he's written.

These are important views that won't get published in the professional journals. The chapters on trauma theories are less engaging, but largely cutting-edge.

The British being the true pioneers in the field of needless suffering, the book naturally emphasizes the British view of the polar expeditions. As a consequence, Amundsen is villified and Scott glorified, for example. Strangely, the book doesn't discuss the greatest, most heroic, polar expedition-Shackleton's attempt to cross Antarctica.All in all, this is a worthwhile read if you are a polar exploration buff."},{"Title":"Safe Return Doubtful","review":"To write a book which covers the expansive history of polar exploration is a large undertaking. This book does this that. With a sometimes dim view of successes, the author methodically covers the major polar explorations of both the North and the South Poles. Although Graham can sometimes miss the glory of what some people did, Shackelton's Endurance expedition and Amundsen's Northwest Passage voyage, he does give a great overview of some of the lesser known facts of Polar exploration.

This book filled in a lot of gaps, especially on early Arctic exploration.Unfortunately, the question about whether Peary actually reached the North Pole or not -- and if he didn't, was it sextant mismeasurements or fraud -- is only briefly and tangentially discussed. Many polar authors and experts claim he didn't, but last year an explorer duplicated his fast-paced feat.The contingencies of history are interesting, as this book shows. Amundsen had originally planned for the North Pole, but Peary's triumph led him to look south.British humanity excluded dogs for the Antarctic mush; British stupidity refused to use Norwegian horse snowshoes, which might have let Scott beat Amundsen and return alive. If not stupidity and stubbornness, stupidity and sentimentality, leading Scott to add a fifth to his original four-man party, doomed him. The psychology behind this and the Scott-Shackelton dustup was also tred just lightly.But, trying to reach the Arctic by ramming a ship into ice floes, or via ballooon?

The book is very good and I recieved my order in a quick manner. I would order them again"},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"This beautifully drawn storybook should have remained apicturebook. From its description, I expected the story to besomething of Auntie Mame's adventures in the North Pole. Instead the focus is on the bratty young narrator who is so self-absorbed that, by mid-story, she rarely even mentions the title character. The grammar is also awkwardly incorrect at times, which may be confusing to young readers. In the end, the narrator learns her lesson, but the story may not keep your or your child's interest long enough to find that out."},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"My daughter has loved this book since she was young - I think it's a little strange :-), but she loves it for some reason.

It's definitely missing something.While this book teaches children that it is better than to receive it doesn't do much else. We know certain things about Auntie Claus and her niece and nephew, but not enough. I think a lot more could have been added to this book, but wasn't out of a rush from the publisher.If you are looking for a book with beautiful illustrations this is for you, if you are looking for a great story, keep searching."},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"I read this to my 7 year old and she was having trouble following the story. Just very choppy and a strange story. She didn't even want me to finish it. Not very well written at all."},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"This was disturbing to my very bright daughter when she was 6-7. She asked me to get rid of it, which she never asks me to do. Auntie Claus is very strange and more than a little creepy. The pictures are gorgeous, but the story just didn't make a lot of sense. Another writer said that better, but then we dumped the book several years ago. However, the author is great and my daughter is now 10 and she adores this author's Secret Order of the Gumm Street Girls."},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"This story should have been a novel. The characters are not well developed. Sophie's new compassion for her brother is not grounded in anything that came before, and is not believable. Auntie Claus's role at the North Pole is never explained -- what does she do there?If she is Sophie's aunt, why don't Sophie's parents know what she does? Etc.etc.If Primavera had written a full length novel she would have had room to answer these questions, develop the characters more fully, and give her plot firmer foundations.This is a frustrating book because she had a good idea, but developed it so poorly."},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"Cute premise, but...this book just doesn't do it for me. I have been holding this book in my Amazon cart for a few weeks, waiting until I placed a large Christmas order. I'm glad I read short bits of this book in the bookstore before ordering it. The storyline is not entertaining in my opinion. Also, holidays such as Valentine's Day and Halloween are mentioned. My family and I do not celebrate Halloween, so this is another downfall of the book."},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"This book is a really good story. I like it because it is a really happy story about Sophie's aunt who she thinks is Santa Claus' sister. Sophie stoys away in one of her aunt's suitcases to discover that she arrives in the North Pole and is mistaken for an elf. The story is a great example that giving is better than receiving. Sophie learns that she likes herself better when she gives.I would recommend this book to any child 5+ - it has great pictures, creative story, and likable characters. I want to read the sequel."},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"Would you ever like to have a mysterious Aunt? Read Auntie Claus by Elise Primavera about two kids who have an aunt that Sophie thinks is Santa's sister. This story is about an aunt who loves Christmas more then anyone in her family but she is never home for the holidays. This is a great book because it is about two kids that always say no and one thinks their aunt is going to the North Pole for some reason. I like one page when an elf says, \\"oh dear.\\" It is really funny and I think the author is trying to tell us you should never say no to anyone if they ask you to do something. You should read this book to see if the kids will ever stop fighting or say no."},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"I like this book alot. I asked my mom to read this book because some words were too hard for me. It was funny when Sophie's little brother cried. Sophie's little brother looks like my brother. I can't wait to read her next book."},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"I thought that the book was great. The writing is fun, and the colors are playfully exciting.

Keeps peace until they get out school for the holiday! The sequels are great too. Would like to have cd's or tapes of all three so i can put in the listening corner. Even children in the older grades come back and tell the younger ones about the BB and G list."},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"This is a wonderful book to add to your Christmas library. Everyone wonders what Aunite Claus does between Halloween and Valentine's Day. Her niece deceides to hide out in her luggage to find out. She finds out about the B B And G list (bad boy and girl list), and is afraid her name is on it. When she finds someone else she loves name on it, she truly lives by Auntie Claus' first and last rule, it is better to give then to receive. Delightful pictures and easy flowing text makes this a delightful read-aloud for preschoolers to fifth graders. My third grade class loved it!"},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"Seeing mixed reviews, I read this book in the bookstore and I was glad I didn't order it. The plot is very weak and the morale of the story is a stretch. The story never shows or describes why it is better to give. It just throws the morale out in the end. Too bad. Because the drawings are delightful."},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"I bought a copy of this book to give to my niece and nephews - but couldn't give it up. By the time I decided that it was to be added to my own library, I had a hard time finding another copy! I love this story! It shows kids in a fun way that the true spirit of Christmas is not in the selfish &quot;What do I get&quot; stuff, but in the sharing and taking care of others part.The message is very clear - and it doesn't hurt that the illustrations are soooo wonderful!"},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"Auntie Claus is WONDERFUL. My fifth graders were mesmerized as well as my own young children. Hurray for Primavera....an up to date Christmas story with a message for all."},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"My daughter, age 9, and I read this book and loved it! Auntie Claus reminds us of my daughter's aunt who is slightly eccentric and carries christmas in her heart all year. The simple story and brightly drawn art work make it a wonderful addition to our christmas story collection."},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"Never has the lesson that it's more blessed to give than to receive been presented more endearingly than in this sophisticated Big Apple take on that moral truism. Auntie Claus is an elegant mix of Auntie Mame and Kris Kringle. When rich little Sophie Kringle stows away in her rather mysterious aunt's luggage, Sophie finds herself at the North Pole. The sight of her brother's name on the Bad-Boys-And-Girls list spurs Sophie to surprising action."},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"As a First Grade teacher, I found this book to be one of those that I will look forward to reading over and over again with my students. The artwork is stunning, and the story truly captures a child's imagination. It is a wonderful story about remembering what is really important during the holidays. My students can't wait for me to read it again!"},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"I love this book! The illustrations are fabu, dahling, and the story is top-notch. A cross between Eloise and Auntie Mame with a Christmas twist thrown in, this is the next Christmas classic. Auntie Claus has a mysterious job that keeps her away from home from Halloween until Valentine's Day. Little Sophie decides that it's time that she discover Auntie Claus' secret, and in the process learns the secret of giving as well. This story just couldn't be better. It is an original story that kids just love."},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"This was a wonderful book, especially in reading it with my 7-year-old. It actually taught the meaning of giving and receiving. It definitely is a book that a child, especially one full of greed and want should read."},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"My children (6,8 &amp;10) really liked the story and especially the illustrations. They each understood the primary message &quot;it's better to give&quot;. It is a picture book -- to criticize it for not being a novel or for not having the aspects of a novel seems absurd to me."},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"the books were as promisedthe delivery technically was within the deadlines promised, but when you pay for \\"expedited\\" delivery, you expect it soon not at the very end of a deadline; upon follow up, i learned that it did not SHIP as quickly as it should have; the delivery time was normal"},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"From its New York setting to its actual plot, Auntie Claus is a rip-off of William Joyce's SANTA CALLS. For the real thing, I suggest reading Joyce's book."},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"I bought 2 of these books for my nieces. (I'm known to them as &quot;Auntie Sue&quot;) Colorful &amp; fun to read. The main point of the story is thinking of others before yourself. We all can get caught up in &quot;What do I want for me&quot; at this time of year. It also shares a family secret that gets passed on to the next generation!"},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"A nice oversize book, good for reading aloud and showing the pictures to the kids as you go along. These pictures are gorgeous and exciting. But what am I missing here? The story is odd -- it seems to be missing a lot of pages. We know almost nothing about the aunt herself -- what is she like and what does she do, esp. between Christmas and Valentine's Day? It's a wonderful premise, and would make a good animated film, but somebody would have to do a lot of work developing a much more complete storyline. So many things are never explained -- even things in the pictures. For example, what is the smoking thing she's holding on the cover? I did like the &quot;salvation&quot; of Sophie, though. So don't pass it up, because the pictures are just glorious."},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"As an Auntie famous for being the \\"polite police\\" I absolutely fell in love with this book. I have a set, my niece & nephews have a set and I've given it to the children of friends and clients as gifts. At a time of year when kids are bombarded with messages that lead to \\"gimme, have you got, can I have, can I take\\" sentences, this book is a great opportunity to get the message of giving across to kids.It's a must read in our family every year."},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"Our family looks forward to reading this book all year. Right after Thanksgiving we pull it out of our library of Christmas books and it gets read over and over. We never get tired of the story and the artwork is beautiful and fun! It is a great way to help children realize the true spirit of giving."},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"A wonderful christmas gift for a 4 year old. The key was a hit. The CD was not. My daughter preferred to turn off the CD player and have us read to her. Now I know, its not worth buying the CD.The book is excellent. Elise Primavera's illustrations are magnificent, her text is enchanting, and her characters are marvelous.I will definitely be buying more of her books in the future."},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"This is fabulous book with a wonderful lesson.

They are 19 and 14 now and they still have their books. We created a tradition at Christmas time and we have an Auntie Claus evening. They receive a gift from their Auntie Claus! We have even read the books a few times now that they are grown just like when they were little. They say they will NEVER be to old for Auntie Claus!"},{"Title":"Auntie Claus","review":"Auntie Claus is such a sweet tale about the true meaning of Christmas. I had bought it several years ago for my niece & nephew, but this year had no luck finding it for my new little niece. I received my order quickly and the book was in perfect shape.

It introduces the notion that much of what we argue about is really not an argument about facts but one about definitions. It is fascinating also to note the players in the 1930s and to see what their predictions became. A wonderful introduction to semantics with the caution that if you let an enemy select the terms of the argument, he has already won it."},{"Title":"The tyranny of words (A Harvest book)","review":"Language or Words (if you will) may be the most significant distinction that the human species has. It has provided man with a creative medium almost beyond compare and at the same time in our innocence we have allowed our selves to assign words an importance or value that has become destructive, misleading, perverted, etc. This book could get you on the road to recovery. Mr. Chase is not nearly as philosophical about these issues as I tend to be but it may be to his credit. I loved the book anyhow...give it a try it may change how you think and speak."},{"Title":"The tyranny of words (A Harvest book)","review":"Still a useful book after all these years. It was first published in 1938. The author is strong on scientific method and objectivity.

It would be hard to convince me that any of her writings are not good readings. I love her books and enjoyed reading Maggie: Her Marriage."},{"Title":"Maggie-Her Marriage","review":"This book rocks! Reminds me of the V.C. Andrews type melodrama/scandal books. Well written, campy, and very trashy. Great for the housewife or soccer mom in your life. It's about a 19th century small town and this girl Maggie's marriage and the secret that haunts her all her life."},{"Title":"Maggie-Her Marriage","review":"This is a somewhat grim historical melodrama/romance. It's well-written and enjoyable and I personally did not find it depressing, but I imagine that others might. Not exactly a fluffy \\"beach read\\" nor a cute, happily-ever-after type of romance.This novel is far, FAR better-written than the type of crappy \\"romance novel\\" you'd find at the grocery store.But yeah, there's lots of tragic events, the overall tone is rather melancholy and it's not quite a frothy \\"guilty pleasure\\" type of book."},{"Title":"Machine manual for millers","review":"this is a \\"must have\\" book for anyone that calls himself mill's mechanic. very easy to read. Reachs every topic that you will find inside the mechanics of a mill factory."},{"Title":"The $100,000 Writer","review":"That's probably not really high praise, but this book just doesn't seem as useful as &quot;The Well Fed Writer&quot; or some of Bob Bly's books on the subject of freelance copywriting.To her credit, the author is sometimes strikingly blunt and honest, admtting that it will probably take years for most to reach a six figure income (if ever). But she also seems to spend a little too much time patting herself on the back and occassionally becoming to harsh. I don't know, maybe she was going for a brutally honest approach. It does work at times but it also is off putting at other times.She does offer some ideas that others don't really cover in their books. Still, I would recommend getting &quot;The Well Fed Writer&quot; first and then supplementing the information there with this book. It certainly can't hurt to include it in your arsenal if you are seeking to become a freelance writer."},{"Title":"The $100,000 Writer","review":"If you're a Type A personality, this is the book for you. If you're not, I suggest 'Secrets of a Freelance Writer' by Robert W. Bly or 'The Well-Fed Writer' by Peter Bowerman. Both authors deliver accurate, detailed and practical information; but, unlike Ms. Flynn, they do it with grace, style, humor and a modicum of humility. Both Bly and Bowerman lack hubris.I agree with the reviewer from Massachusetts: the overall tone of this book depresses me. Ms. Flynn is condescending at times. For example, she writes: &quot;Have a problem with networking? Get over it.&quot; She reminds us in almost every chapter how successful she is. While this may add validity to her ideas, the tone gets tedious. So does wringing every last dollar from a client.To be fair, Ms. Flynn's section on avoiding sexist language is useful. Buy Bowerman's or Bly's book. You'll be able to make a good living as a freelance writer and still look at yourself in the mirror. As Ms. Flynn writes: &quot;Making $100,000 as a freelance writer is not for everyone.&quot; Thank goodness, she is right."},{"Title":"The $100,000 Writer","review":"Before I read Nancy Flynn's book, I had contemplated doing freelance business writing work, however, I had no idea what types of projects there were, let alone what to charge. I thought that a few hundred dollars an issue was a good price to charge for a newsletter. Boy was I wrong, and I have Nancy to thank for expanding my vision.Not only does her book help the aspiring young (or old) writers develop fees for their projects, it helps the inexperienced writers broaden their business with supplemental products. That alone can double a writer's income. I didn't even know what a media list was before I read her book. Now, I not only know what it is, but I know how to use it to maximize my business writing income.Anybody who has even remotely considered freelance writing or starting their own business writing company needs to read this book. Not reading it could cost them a fortune."},{"Title":"The $100,000 Writer","review":"The title of Flynn's book makes a grand promise - and she delivers. As a person who's made a better than good living as a writer (and info entrepreneur) for the last 15 years, *this* is the one book I'd give to any of my writer friends who aspire to independence and a six figure income. Her material on how to find clients and how to manage them once you find them is priceless. I can't imagine a better introduction to the realities of this potentially lucrative business that is a mystery to so many."},{"Title":"The $100,000 Writer","review":"I started reading this book, and while it seems to have some good points, the writing is pretty bad (strange for a book on writing to be poorly written). She keeps repeating herself over and over, about how successful she is. While trying to inspire, she is also depressing, that it may take years or decades to get yourself established. I don't think so...sounds like she's just trying to make money from this book, yet wants to discourage any new competition! Take my advice and buy the \\"Well Fed Writer\\" by Peter Bowerman. His advice is better, his writing is funny and very readable, and he doesn't speak to the reader like they're a moron. Which Flynn does, by the way."},{"Title":"The $100,000 Writer","review":"The $100,000 Writer is full of common sense advice and suggestions as well as useful examples from the writer's own career.

Though not as indepth as Robert Bly's book on freelance writing, it is more than adequate for those just starting out.

Still, I found Flynn's book to be an extended pep talk, backed up with facts and figures that could pay off in a big way for anyone willing to commit to this field. I especially liked her showing that it's possible to love what you're doing without taking a vow of poverty."},{"Title":"The $100,000 Writer","review":"Wow! This book is incredible.

And frankly, I appreciated Nancy's honesty that earning a six-figure income from writing takes time - sometimes 10 years or more. Personally, I'm weary of reading authors who promise overnight success. Nancy's views on long-standing hard-work to success seems to be more in keeping with my experience..."},{"Title":"The $100,000 Writer","review":"On one hand this book has lots of excellent information: for example, there are plenty of insider tips that can only come from experience, such as the advice never to let on when a project only takes an afternoon to do, since the customer will then undervalue your services. It also has a lot of ideas on expanding the list of services you can offer customers, for example with media lists. But there are some pieces of advice that are just plain terrible: the author suggests that writers new to freelancing take on an apprenticeship position with an established freelancer, working for a pittance or even for nothing. That is very bad advice--it's hard to imagine a better recipe for ill feelings when the newbie decides to go off on his or her own. Who gets the customers? Far better for a newbie to get work at nonprofits or small local businesses as a way to break in. Besides, would a lawyer fresh out of law school give away her services at an established law firm? Hardly. Writers have a hard enough time taking themselves seriously without this kind of bad advice. Also, there are several other books out there on the same topic but none of them comes across as being quite so crassly interested in squeezing every possible dime out of the customers as this one. If we want corporate customers to respect us, we have to respect them. I appreciate the information in this book a lot but I get depressed at the tone in which it is delivered."},{"Title":"An English-Chinese Glossary of American Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure Law (C&T; Asian Languages Series)","review":"Bought this as a reference book for a class I was taking, like most of my reference books, it didn't get to be used at all."},{"Title":"Naturalness: A Classic of Shin Buddhism","review":"Kanamatsu's work here isn't that big a volume, to be sure. But to just skim it would be wrong, since the depth of thought that this slim volume can provoke is very great.In a sense, this is an introductory text to Jodo Shinshu, the True Pure Land School of Mahayana Buddhism. But at the same time, the author focusses this introduction through the critical Shin concept of 'naturalness'. As such, this is no easy concept to digest on a rational, Western level, especially for beginners who might encounter this book. But somehow, Kanamatsu actually manages to pull off an exegesis of this central precept in such a way that it IS accessible...provided one reads carefully and thoughtfully, as such a topic requires. Approached in mindfulness, this is one of those little books that has the potential to be a life-changer! I wouldn't say that this is the best place to start in ones' readings in Shin Buddhism...I would peg that as either Dr. Tanaka's &quot;Ocean&quot; or Dr. Unno's &quot;River of Fire...&quot;...but this is definitely one of the ones to pick up after the very first intro works."},{"Title":"Naturalness: A Classic of Shin Buddhism","review":"This little volume by Kenryo Kanamatsu is informative and \\"transformative.\\" It does not only describe the faith underlying Shin Buddhism, perhaps it will also open your heart to an awareness and acceptance of Shin's trust in creation's goodness. The book will lay before you that (often neglected) side of Buddhism that speaks to the heart's yearning to surrender to something great, to our natural impulse and need for devotion. There are more scholarly works on Shin Budhism. This book is more like the poetic expression of a man who has touched Heaven. It is beautiful and true, like the truth it seeks to convey, and it will call you to read its words again and again."},{"Title":"Naturalness: A Classic of Shin Buddhism","review":"The concept of \\"jinen\\" or \\"naturalness\\" is an important part of Shin Buddhism, and so I was expecting this book to cover this concept. Instead, this book was more of an introduction to Shin Buddhism, with the focus being the sentimental side to Shin Buddhism, not the analytical side.There are plenty of books around that explain in theory how Shin Buddhism works, but not many explain what it all means to the average person, so I think this book fills a special niche.The problem is in the writing. The book is somewhat dated, and its translations of some terms are equally dated. As with earlier Buddhist writings, this book tries to use Christian terminology rather than more establish modern Buddhist terms, so a new reader may get the wrong impression in thinking that Shin Buddhism is like Christianity for Buddhists.Also, the author tends to use more literal interpretations of Shin concepts. The term Jodo Shinshu gets translated as \\"The True Teaching\\" which it really means \\"The True Pure Land Sect\\" in more modern translations. The author takes the Pure Land sutras at face value, which I am not all that comfortable with. Western interpretations tend to see them as symbolic, not literal.One thing I really liked about this book is explaining the importance and meaning behind the Nembutsu. A lot of people misunderstand the purpose of the nembutsu and treat it like a mantra.The other problem with this book is the flow. The book spends a lot of time covering what the Pure Land is like, which again is taken from a literal perspective, and lot of time praising Amida. Toward the end, it finally explains why this matters, but I felt that the praise was unnecessary (let the reader decide that) and detracted from the more important message at the end.All in all, I think this book is a useful addition for the Shin Buddhist library, but I hope someone can edit this book, or at least add footnotes to explain some of the phrases chosen. This book is well-intentioned, and has some useful points, but I wouldn't call it the definitive book on Shin Buddhism."},{"Title":"Evolution of the Synagogue: Problems and Progress","review":"This book is a set of scholarly essays, all of which relate in some way to Jews (mostly Greek-speaking Jews) in the (mostly) late Roman Empire. Essays deal with the etymology of the word \\"synagogue\\" (which in Roman times mostly meant \\"gathering\\" rather than a religious congregation), when synagogues in the modern sense started to appear in Israel (unclear, but possibly as late as 200 CE), the Jewish communities of a few Asian and Eastern European towns, the relationship between early rabbis and synagogues (unclear but probably weak, since rabbis were centered in a few towns with religious academies), and an anti-Semitic sermon by someone named Melito.Generally, this book is not useful for anyone who isn't already an expert, because many of the essays provide too little context to make them accessible for non-experts. For example, the Melito essay doesn't quote the sermon at issue to any significant extent.The most interesting essay was the one on the synagogue at Dura, built in the 3rd century on the Roman/Parthian frontier. While many synagogues have very little visual art, this synagogue included paintings of David, Moses and other Jewish heroes. However, the essay overstates the potential conflict between the Second Commandment and visual art: though pictures of humans are rare in synagogues, portraits of animals (e.g. those representing Jewish tribes) are quite common."},{"Title":"Evolution of the Synagogue: Problems and Progress","review":"This text should be read by all those who study the book of Romans. Nicely elaborates the Jewish-Christian context in first century Rome."},{"Title":"Paper Angels: Christmas Stories","review":"Paper Angels is a thought-provoking, enlightening collection of holiday-themed stories. The stories, all of which are well written transport you at once to their varying locales. Through various themes and story lines, the author is able to convey heart-warming tales that are well suited to the holiday season.Throughout the book, the author employs illustrative techniques which enable the reader to immediately identify and empathize with his characters. I have never read short stories that enveloped me so quickly within the first few sentences - usually it takes a couple of paragraphs or pages to engage this reader. This book is unusual in its scope and is well worth the price.This book contains at least ten short stories of varying length, that could easily read out loud to children, but can also be enjoyed and appreciated by adults.My favorite tales, (so far)are &quot;Strings&quot;, which to summarize it rather unfairly, is about a girl and a sought after violin; &quot;A Doll for Christmas&quot;, which is set in San Francisco and &quot;To Hear the Angels Sing&quot; which is set in Dublin. What makes the latter two tales so intriquing is that the author is able to quite naturally and unassumingly describe these two cities in such a way that we are there - on their streets and at home with the characters.I highly recommend this book and look forward to more collections from this author."},{"Title":"Paper Angels: Christmas Stories","review":"Inside this wonderful little book you will find these kinds of stories... A boy finds a magical feather in Frankfurt, Germany. A homeless woman sings a carol to an Irish girl on Christmas Eve (see the &quot;read an excerpt&quot; link here on Amazon). Two angels turn the Golden Gate Bridge into a cathedral. An older woman tells a story to her great granddaughter about a man who tried to capture angels on film with his camera. And a whole gaggle of silly goblins spread Christmas joy. If you want to put something a bit different under a friend's Christmas tree you should check out Paper Angels."},{"Title":"The Tragedy of the Korosko (Collected Works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle)","review":"An excellent read! Published in 1898 this novel tells the story of a small group of western tourists on holiday in northern africa. Taken hostage by a nomadic tribe of arab muslims, these westerners are faced with the stark choice of conversion to Islam or death. A facinating commentary on the cultural divide between western Christianity and eastern Islam with an insightful dialouge around the \\"white man's burden\\" as only the English could tell it."},{"Title":"The Tragedy of the Korosko (Collected Works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle)","review":"Light stuff but worth reading. I'm happy I spent my time with this (I read the free Kindle version) rather than anything I might have picked up from the paperback bestseller rack at the grocery store. I don't suffer from Western self-loathing, nor do I have any trouble recognizing the good side of Victoria's British Empire, so I enjoyed the action, the dialog, and the satisfying finish you expect in this sort of thing. This is a standard-model Victorian adventure melodrama. That's not a bad thing, especially in the hands of a writer like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who knew his trade.The plot won't surprise you: a group of European tourists (inexplicably) take a boat trip up the Nile and are taken prisoner by Muslim raiders of the Khalifa's army in the Sudan. Will the jihadis kill them if they refuse to convert to Islam? Will the jihadis kill them regardless? What will happen to the women? Can a rescue force reach them before they get to Khartoum and will it even be strong enough if it does catch up? The tension just keeps building! Lots of fun.Doyle doesn't specify the year the action takes place but he first published the story in serialized form for the Strand Magazine in 1897. The British were still fighting the Sudan Campaign so this would have seemed like an adventure \`ripped from the headlines'. The characters are the usual. There's the retired British colonel, the parson, the lawyer, the Irish couple, a spinster from Boston travelling with her beautiful young niece, etc. There's even a Frenchman around to bitch about British imperialism. The Frenchman sounds like your average Western academic of today, and probably the only difference between the jihadis in this story and the modern ones in the Sudan is that today's jihadis have automatic rifles. It's a shame the one thing that's changed is that today they don't seem to make Englishmen like they used to.If Sherlock Holmes is the only thing you've read by Doyle, spend a couple hours with this."},{"Title":"The Tragedy of the Korosko (Collected Works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle)","review":"[This review notes a problem with the Hesperus Press Kindle edition. It is not a review of the book itself.]Hesperus Press offers the most expensive Kindle edition of \\"The Tragedy of Korosko\\". Unfortunately, the work delivered is \\"Through the Magic Door\\", a long essay in which Conan Doyle ruminates about his favorite writers. The substitution is surely inadvertent. A review seemed like the best way to call it to the publisher's attention and in the meantime warn prospective buyers."},{"Title":"The Tragedy of the Korosko (Collected Works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle)","review":"Conan Doyle displays excellent craftsmanship in developing this story. If you ever wanted to understand what true craftsmanship looks like on the written page you could search far and wide and be unlikely to discover a better example than The Tragedy of the Korosko. Conan Doyle tells his story in clear, basic English prose, he has his characters say interesting things to move the plot along and describe events as they unfold. Never losing sight of the reader's mind's-eye he is always able to keep the story sharply in focus. There is rare skill at work here. Anyone wishing to understand how it is that a great writer can take a simple tale and expand it into a full-fledged adventure yarn should take the time to read this book. No literature course good provide a better example of the \\"writer's touch\\" in telling a story than this book. Conan Doyle doesn't distract his readers with partially developed, two dimensional characters, he breathes full life into every character in the story. Giving each and every character a presence and texture that fills the story out with detail no matter how minor a role they have. This is an extremely well written story.Now, as to the plot; Band of fanatic islamic extremists kidnap foreign travelers; where have I heard that tale before? Written in 1898 this story probably read like it came from the newspaper headlines of the day. For that matter, it reads in many respects like it was drawn from current events. On the other hand, anyone reading this story 40 or 50 years ago would probably scoff at the idea of a band of radical islamic extremists willing to risk their lives to take hostage a party of Western tourists. In today's World, no one would think anything unusual about it. Strange how history seems to keep repeating itself.Then there is the substance of the story itself. At it's heart this is a study of individual and collective character in crisis. Each character's personality is defined, and redefined, in the course of this tale. Making the interaction between the characters, and, the impact of events on each individual's personality, and of the group collectively, the defining theme of this story. Will they be rescued? Who will live and who will die? Will they succumb to the pressure to convert to Islam to save their lives? These and many other questions are raised in the course of this story, how they are resolved is in the telling of the tale.No need to worry about ransoming your copy, it is available for free on Kindle."},{"Title":"The Tragedy of the Korosko (Collected Works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle)","review":"It's hard to believe that a story about western tourists being kidnapped by Muslim terrorists could have been written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle almost 125 years ago. The story, however, is quite revealing about how the world got this way and why it hasn't significantly changed. I think this is a wonderful find, and how can you go wrong for free?"},{"Title":"The Tragedy of the Korosko (Collected Works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle)","review":"This is a very significant book about the general opinons of Western people about middle eastern-arabs at the end of 19th century. The tale is about how tourists on a steamer have been taken hostage by a gang of arabs, and how &quot;the heroic&quot; british army saved them. What is behind the tale is what has been codified by kipling: &quot;the burden of the white man&quot;. The superior civilized Anglo saxons and their mission toward uncivilised barabarians. The depiction of natives in mild racists words is what, unfortunately, has not changed so much in western opinions (even if hidden behind layers of politically correct). Very instructive for whoever is interested in the root of racisms, as described by E. Said in &quot;orientalism&quot;. A very funny part of the book is the contrast between the arrogant french tourist who at the begining criticizes the wise brits, but by the end is grateful and convinced. Replace brits with americans, and the book could have been written in 2001."},{"Title":"Primitive Hearths in the Pyrenees","review":"I bought \\"Primitive Hearths in the Pyren&eacute;es\\" because I was born and live in the area studied by this book and because Paul Vaillant Couturier , Ida Treat husband , was raised in my village.The places and people described in it are familiar to me and it was then an opportunity to me to have an insight in their way of life in the twenties.

I was filled with anticipation thinking it would be a true 'inside scoop' on the film and literary history of Zorro. While it did have good information, very little of it was new and unique. Most was reprinted from various books, articles, or tv specials. While it was nice having it all in book form, I was rather disappointed there was not that much 'New' information. I thought Bill Yenne's book was better, and had much better photographs, although admittedly he did have the advantage of a Zorro series being in production at the time he wrote it. As a previous reviewer wrote, there were many innaccuracies in the book, and while it would not serve anything to list them, they are there. In any other book we would just shrug and go on, as no one can get everything right. But in a book put out by the wife of the owner of 'Zorro,' we do expect a bit better. I certainly didn't expect to see the tacky, mean-spirited (and untrue) comments about Duncan Regehr. It was quite a jarring chapter in the midst of an otherwise enjoyable book. (I felt that I had opened a supermarket tabloid by mistake)One should never forget the Zorro fandom spans the globe, and we all share information and experiences. Many people had opportunities to visit the set, and become friends with the actors and crew. All of them were generous with their time, and were very enthusiastic about the program and the Zorro legacy. Even now they are all delighted to talk about their experiences and autograph 'Zorro' photos. (Especially John Hertzler and Duncan Regehr) I guess my final word on the book would be, nice information that is mostly accurate, but take the personal comments with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"Zorro Unmasked: The Official History","review":"This book is informative when it comes to the history of Spanish California and Zorro.

It is the perfect starting point for new fans and a treasure trove of detail for long time admirers of The Fox. I really enjoyed the chapter devoted to the real history of Spanish Californa. It made me appreciate the swashbuckling romance of Zorro even more. I also loved the section devoted to the definitive Zorro: Guy Williams. This book belongs in the library of every lover of multi-media adventure fiction. The author does a wonderful job and I will treasure this book for years to come."},{"Title":"Zorro Unmasked: The Official History","review":"I've been a fan of Zorro's since I first saw Guy Williams cross the screen in the Disney version. I look back now and see why he appealed so much to me back then and why to this day he still does. What he stood for is something that means so much to me, fighting against those that dare take advantage of others etc.This book just filled me in more on things that I didn't really know, but only sort of knew. The connection between Zorro and Batman, well I sort of always thought there was something there. I guess my re-interest in Zorro was brought back to me because of the Mask of Zorro, which I loved. So now I'm re-discovering it all again because my company is working with Zorro Productions on making Zorro even more visible on the internet and so it has been an honor to speak with Sandra Curtis on these new ventures. She did a great job on the book, and she has so much to draw from and because of all that, it just made the book even more special. I'd like to thank you for doing this book. Sometimes I feel everyone gets caught up in the &quot;super heroes&quot; of today with all their super powers. And really all we need to do is look at the heroes that are like Zorro. A man who just used his skill and brains to help right the wrongs. Thanks again Sandra for the book and your helping with what my company is trying to do to keep Zorro in the forefront of everyone's mind.This is a must read for any Zorro fan, or anyone who just wants to know about the character and how he came about."},{"Title":"Zorro Unmasked: The Official History","review":"I was always a Zorro fan ever since I saw Guy Willums in the Disney Version.I just couldn't get enough of this masked avenger.I always wanted to be as fast and quick and smart as he was.

I might not be as quick as he is, But I know one thing he will always be No# 1 in my book."},{"Title":"Zorro Unmasked: The Official History","review":"This \\"inside\\" history of Zorro, written by the wife of one of the franchise's current owners, is, overall, an interesting and entertaining read. It contains several delightful stories and gives lots of production information about various film and television interpretations. The book covers the original Zorro stories and compares the films and TV programs based on them, and also discusses the history of California and real-life bandits who may have served as an inspiration to Johnston McCulley. It contains snippets of interviews and mini-biographies of many of those who were involved in Zorro productions over the past century.Unfortunately, this book is not the be-all and end-all of Zorro history, having noticeable gaps in the coverage. There were one or two items that I, as a longtime fan of Zorro, knew that were not discussed in the book. The importance of some of the \\"history\\" seemed arbitrary; some versions were barely mentioned, while others had scores of pages dedicated to them. Others were missing from the text, except for a reference listing in the appendix. At least one version was completely absent. A few long-standing legends and rumors were never addressed. As seen in other reviews, the book has also incited wrath among some fans for its opinionated claims about various actors who have portrayed Zorro -- for example, Curtis strongly criticizes Duncan Regehr's interpersonal skills, but has only glowing reports of Antonio Banderas' personality, kindness and enthusiasm. This presentation comes across as biased and petty for a book claiming to be an \\"official history\\" of the franchise, even if this was the author's true perception of the actors; it gives the impression that Zorro Enterprises' official opinion is that one actor is nicer than another.On a note less analytical and more editorial, the book is riddled with typos and misspellings. I find this irritating in any publication, but imagine how distracting it is when an actor's name changes spellings twice on the same page, or when, in a paragraph about the history of the California territory, the date suddenly switches from the mid-1800s to the 1900s and back.I would definitely recommend this book to fans of any version of Zorro; it is interesting, and you're likely to learn something new, even if the volume is somewhat disappointing as a complete history of Zorro. However, I would also suggest reading some of the other Zorro histories or cast biographies for a more complete picture. (I'll add Britt Lomond'sChasing After Zorroto the titles already suggested by other reviewers.)"},{"Title":"Zorro Unmasked: The Official History","review":"\\"Zorro unmasked: The Oficial Hisotry\\" by Sandra R. Curtis is the history of the Zorro character from the conception of of the character by Johnston McKulla who created and first introduced the character in a pulp fiction magazine in a story title\\"The Curse of Capastrano.\\"The author also talks of who the Zorro character was based on. In the 1800's, there was a bandit who once was a land owner, but lost his land when California came under the rule of the United States. He moved into the hills where he lived and hid away ina hidden cave int eh mountains.The U.S. Army sent an officer by the name of Captain Love (in which the Speilberg movie \\"The Mask of \\"Zorro\\" was loosely based on). Love captured the bandit and killed the bandit, and to make an example of him, Captain Love had the head of the bandit cut off and put in a jar to be preserved, which is what ended up happening to one of the characters in Speilberg's movie.Hollywood actor Douglas Fairbanks had piccked up the pulp fiction magazine that the story \\"The Curse of Capastrano\\" was published in along with a number of other magazines to read on a trip he was going on.Douglas Fairbanks became interesteed int he Zorro character in the story of \\"The Curse of Capastrano\\" and felt that the character had possibilities and wanted to have a movie based on the character made with him playing the part of Zorro.And so the first Zorro movie was made in the silent era, which wa a success.The author then progresses along the history of the Zorro chaacter in movies like the first talkie version which stared Tyrone Power as Zorro. The author goes into the theatrical cliffhanger movies serials based on Zorro made by Republic in the 1940's and early 1950's. Then going into the popular Walt Disney TV series from the late 1950's taht stared Guy Williams as Zorro.The author goes on to cover other Zorro movies and TV series and even cartoon series. The author talks of the TV movie that aired on ABC in the 1970's in which Ricardo Montalban played the villainous Commandante.The 1980's Zorro TV series taht aired on the Family Network in the 1980's is covered. Along with the Filmation Zorro Saturday morning cartoon series.This book was written after the Stephen Speilberg movie \\"The Mask of Zorro\\" came out, which was successful making Catherine Zeta Jones a known name.So this book goes up onto that period in time after the Speilberg Zorro movie came out and was a hit in the box office. So whatever comaes afterwards like the sequel to \\"The Mask of Zorro\\" and the most current Spanish Zorro TV series is not mentioned in the book.An update of this book would definitely be great. I'm all ready to pick up a copy should it be published."},{"Title":"Zorro Unmasked: The Official History","review":"Questions: I would love to know if the book displays pictures of Guy Williams and has a consequent part about the disney Zorro.

I felt that Curtis had collected an amazingly great amount of information. However, once I inspected it more closely, I found that the Curtis book has at least seventeen errors. What good is a book in which you have to take everything written with a grain of salt?Worse, the person that wrote it is the vice-president of Zorro Productions. The entire thing could have been *much* more carefully researched, but it was like she merely slapped together a bunch of stale information. She even neglects to mention the now out-of-print &quot;Legend of Zorro&quot; by Bill Yenne, which she probably used as a source of information. (&quot;Legend&quot; was the first *real* authority on Zorro in over seventy years.)Curtis spends much time merely talking about &quot;Gertz&quot; (as she calls her husband, the president and owner of Zorro Productions) and whether or not he liked certain things about more recent productions. Who really cares? She is supposed to be unbiased in her opinions, but Curtis most certainly is NOT.That's not to mention Unmasked's choppy, spoiler-filled synopsis' of movies, or the second-rate photos.The book is also filled with many untruths about Duncan Regehr, and Curtis made an effort only to interview one of the cast members of the 1990-93 series. The other New Zorro interviews were sent to her by A&amp;E productions, a fact she freely admits to in the introduction of her book.All in all, &quot;Unmasked&quot; is a sad lot of hastily collected, predujiced information. I'd give it lower rating, if not for the important information on the original New World Zorro pilot. That is, if we can believe it.If you really want an authority on Zorro, don't go to Zorro Productions. Find a knowledgeable fan."},{"Title":"Zorro Unmasked: The Official History","review":"I've read the book, and Bill Yenne's too. Both books offer up different points of view and are both valid.

I mean belittling someone the way this person did in their review of the book just shows that the person has no valid points on the book because anything the person has said seems to be colored by some other issue not known to those who have come to maybe purchase the book.For those of you out there looking for information on Zorro. This book does give you some of the information and is quite good. Disregard the person with the personal problem and their review.

More importantly, Robinson wrote about \\"the other half\\" -- drunks, dreamers, women-chasers, narcissistic suicides, jettisoned lover-boys, devastated widows, brutal misers. By doing so, he paved the way for the modernist obsesssion with the \\"common man\\". (In fact, he is still best known for his biting characterizations of Luke Havergal, Richard Cory, and Cliff Klingenhagen). A tense but satirical electricity runs through all of his work. As Frost said, \\"Robinson's theme was unhappiness itself, but his skill was as happy as it was playful... His life was a revel in the felicities of language.\\"The earlier poetry is predominately concerned with failure and misery, \\"the withered souls of men\\", as Robinson put it. (Robinson wrote much this poetry while working as a ticket collector on the New York subway, not long out of Harvard). Men have paid a price for their innocence and are unable, like Zola (whom he praises in a poem) to look squarely at the \\"compromising chart of hell\\" they have created. Great democratic mobs judge each others' grief, a grief they can seldom comprehend. Writers worship \\"the flicker and not the flame\\". Misery and the passing of things toll like a villanelle in most of Robinson's early work: \\"There is ruin and decay,\\" \\"long centuries have come and gone,\\" the world seems to be churning toward the \\"western gate\\" of darkness, death's portal.By contrast, the more mature Robinson is more interested in light and voices and spiritual illumination. He sees great value in our intellectual and spiritual struggles, our so-called \\"modern\\" ideas, even though they may be \\"some day be quaint as any [tale] told / In almagest or chronicle of old.\\" The older Robinson does not fight against the ultimately unknowable realities. He is not a disjointed Romantic raging against the misnamed \\"encroachments\\" of time. He is glad that reality remains a mystery in the end, a great and indecipherable code of silent stars and sheaves of girl-like, golden wheat that speak love in their very silence. The world, like true poetry, has \\"a mighty meaning of a kind / That tells the more the more it is not told.\\"I bought this book several years ago in Malta during a bout of homesickness and it has been blowing my mind ever since. Check it out!"},{"Title":"Selected poems","review":"I first read the poems of Edwin Arlington Robinson in school. They were quite surprising then and somewhat menacing. For they told of things happening to people which were not supposed to happen to them. They told of great unhappiness, often disguised. \\"Miniver Cheevy child of scorn, cursed the day that he was born\\" And Miniver of course lived for the great past which never was. Another of these characters the imperially correct Richard Cory \\" went home one day and put a bullet in his head.\\"Robinson is I believe considered best as a poet when he writes these character- stories, and portraits of failure. And this when he had a whole other world of poetic works, including 'romantic poems' on Arthurian times.He was a rarity in that he considered himself a poet by vocation and dedicated himself wholly to this, despite years of poverty and frustration. He had come from a wealthy family which had in losing its fortune known many personal disasters.He was in late- career adopted by President Roosevelt who secured him a nice Melville-like customs job where he could better devote himself to writing. He chose 'Poetry' as his life even desisting from family life on the grounds that it might hurt his poetry.The poetic character sketches which tell life- stories in a few stanzas are still today powerful reading.In an analysis of his verse David Perkins writes,\\"If a formula could be given for a typical poem of Robinson, it would include the following elements: characterization; indirect and allusive narration; contemporary setting and recognition of the impingement of setting on individual lives; psychological realism and interest in exploring the tangles of human feelings and relationships; an onlooker or observer as speaker, making the poems impersonal and objective with respect to Robinson himself; a penchant for the humorous point of view combined with an awareness that life is more essentially tragic; a language that is colloquial, sinewy, and subtle as it conveys twists of implication in continually active thinking; a mindfulness of the difficulty of moral judgment but also a concern for it.\\""},{"Title":"Selected poems","review":"Robinson was a creator of trenchant mini-biographies in verse, many of which became instant classics and familiar to every schoolchild, such as \\"Miniver Cheevy\\" and \\"Richard Cory\\"--which was even referred to in a Simon and Garkunkel song in their landmark Bookends album. Sadly, such education seems to have vanished from our schools and the experience of generation X'ers in favor of MTV and video games, and their mental development is the poorer for it. But Robinson's gifts for insightful and penetrating observations of people's character, and his unique poetic style, which avoided classical norms as well as free verse, was unique and has remained unequalled. Truly a great American of letters who should be better known today. Despite our greater scientific and technological achievements, we live in a more ignorant, barbaric, and less literate age than Robinson did."},{"Title":"Selected poems","review":"I want to read poetry, I really do.

The Enlish translation was only taken up again by the People' Publication House in Peking in 1964.A collection of lectures delivered at Sverdlov Univeristy by Joseph Stalin in 1924, this book is important in the present day as a early presentation of the problems facing the young Soviet Union. The book outlines the first tenets of the theory of &quot;socialism in one counrty&quot; which aould have the Soviet people save their nation from world-wide forces of reaction by building a strong independent socialist state. This was a break from the previous Soviet dogma of world-wide revolution which alleged that the Soviet Union could only save itself by encouraging proletatrian revolutions in other countries. Because Leon Trotsky adhered closely to the world-wide revolution theory, this book can be seen as the opening shot in the epic battle within the Communist party of the Soviet Union between the Trotsky and Stalin wings of the party."},{"Title":"Foundations of Leninism","review":"\\"The foundations of Leninism\\" from 1924 is a quintessentially boring, dry and relatively uninteresting work, dealing with some basic tenets of the Communist message. It has been translated and reprinted for one reason only. \\"The foundations of Leninism\\" was written by Joseph Stalin.Yes, *that* Joseph Stalin.Stalin apparently held a series of lectures at the Sverdlov university in Moscow dedicated to the Lenin levy, the massive Bolshevik recruitment campaign after the death of Lenin. \\"The foundations of Leninism\\" is based on these lectures.Most of the text is Communism 101. Stalin explains why the socialist revolution took place in Russia rather than in the advanced Western nations, attacks the reformists of the Second International (the Social Democrats) and emphasizes the need for a dictatorship of the proletariat led by a Communist vanguard party. The author expresses strong support for the prohibition of factions within the Communist Party. Stalin never mentions the existence of other parties within a socialist republic, thereby implying one party rule (surprise!).The text also contains explicit and implicit attacks on Trotsky and his supporters. Stalin condemns the theory of permanent revolution (associated with Trotsky but probably not upheld by him in 1924), and explains the difference between this theory and Marx' talk about permanent or uninterrupted revolution.A large part of the book is devoted to the peasant question. Stalin has a relatively positive view of the peasantry as an ally of the proletariat and the socialist revolution. This reflects the political situation in 1924, when the Bolsheviks had stabilized the situation in the Soviet Union through concessions to the peasantry in the form of the New Economic Policy (NEP). Internationally, the Communist International was wooing peasant support through the Red Peasant International or Krestintern. This policy had a brief success in Croatia, Poland and even the United States. Of course, around 1929 Stalin had begun to sound a very different note, since the NEP had strengthened kulaks and proto-capitalists, thereby undermining Soviet power. The liquidation of the kulaks as a class and forced collectivization of the entire peasantry was to follow. But in 1924, this was still in the future. In \\"The foundations of Leninism\\", Stalin sounds the more familiar note of accusing certain unnamed opponents (probably Trotsky & Co) of underestimating the peasantry.Stalin's book also contain a very positive appraisal of national liberation movements in the colonies. They are said to be objectively revolutionary, even if led and dominated by reactionary elements such as the emir of Afghanistan or the Egyptian merchant class. On this point too, Trotsky would later deviate in a more \\"leftist\\" direction.The theory of \\"Socialism in one country\\" is mentioned only in passing in this book, or perhaps not at all. (I'm not sure where the other reviewer spotted it.)On a more humorous note, Stalin says that American efficiency is part of the Leninist style of party work! (Lenin was more into the German post office...)\\"The foundations of Leninism\\" isn't a particularly exciting document. However, it may be of some interest to very advanced students of Soviet history, since it's Stalin's first important work after the death of Lenin, and one of the first shots in the intra-party struggles following it."},{"Title":"Foundations of Leninism","review":"Read this book as you would read the warning label on a bottle of poison.Read every word remembering all the victims of stalin.Read this and try to make sense of it. How in God's name did this monster ever convince an entire nation to follow him, based on this convoluted nonsense? Then remember, he won all arguments by killing the opposition.If you ever encounter some golden-tongued person in power who speaks eloquently in circles, whose plans make no sense, who tells you the public simply does not have the capacity to understand political-business-religious decisions, BEWARE.We have the benefit of the historical record to forewarn us of someone following in stalin's footsteps, but if stalin is hidden from sight and never mentioned, we lose the historical record.We have the responsibility of informing ourselves and our children.stalin should never happen again."},{"Title":"The Soul of the Wolf: A Meditation on Wolves and Man","review":"THE SOUL OF THE WOLF : A Meditation on Wolves and Man. By Michael W. Fox. 131 pp. New York : Lyons &amp; Burford, 1992 (1980). ISBN 1-55821-150-0 (pbk.)A few years ago I read a whole shelf of books on animals - Animal Rights, Animal Theology, Animal Experimentation, Ranching and the Meat-Packing Industry, and books on individual animals such as elephants, whales, gorillas, chimpanzees, pigs, sea otters, hamsters, and so on. Although all of the books were extremely informative, and left me with a considerably heightened respect for the many wonderful qualities and powers of our animal kin, one book seemed somehow different and more inspiring than the others : Michael W. Fox's 'The Soul of the Wolf.'Although all of the books are still sitting on my shelves, I never open them anymore. I don't even like to be reminded of them. They're just too depressing. For what all of them have in common is that they bring home forcefully the enormity of the crime that we daily and unconsciously perpetrate against animals all across the globe. Tens of millions of animals are daily tortured to death in laboratories dedicated to the worship of Mammon. Tens of millions of others are cruelly slaughtered to provide some of the unhealthiest food that humans have ever eaten.In contrast to the average unthinking selfish denizen of the modern world, who tacitly agrees to the prevailing evil, and who seemingly couldn't care less about the sufferings of animals, Michael W. Fox comes over not merely as a concerned and compassionate figure, but as a truly saintly person.He has lived with wolves. He has seen very deeply into their nature. He respects them as fellow creatures with whom we have many things in common, but who at the same time are vastly superior to us in many respects. And he has understood, of course, that they too have a soul.His book is at one and the same time both inspiring and profoundly saddening. We are inspired by the marvel that is the wolf; we are sickened at modern man's treatment of this fellow creature.In the Buddhist Prajnaparamita literature there is a wonderful verse:&quot;For all creatures, O Lord, desire happiness; all creatures desire happiness and are averse to suffering....&quot;Most of us, presumably, are aware of this, but if you read Fox you will also become aware that wolves too are every bit as deserving of happiness, if not moreso, as the humans who are involved in a cosmic crime, not only against wolves, but against the whole of nature, for wolves too have souls."},{"Title":"The Soul of the Wolf: A Meditation on Wolves and Man","review":"Michael Fox has an amazing and refreshing understanding of wolves and their world. Not your typical coldly scientific wolf biology book. I highly recommend this to anyone who has even a bit of an interest in wolves or canines in general."},{"Title":"The Soul of the Wolf: A Meditation on Wolves and Man","review":"I was inspired by the movie The Grey to seek more info about the magnificent wolf.

The protagonist in &quot;The Guardian of the Fields&quot; finds brief happiness with a foreign woman yet cannot transcend the traumas of his East European childhood and Israel combat youth. The principal figure in &quot;The Farming Instructor&quot; struggles to keep both his wife and his land. And &quot;the aging poet&quot; in the story of that same title behaves, alas, as so many of us do, and must reconsider and accept the realities.In sum, brevitatis causa, Porat's collection of stories is engaging, poignant, sensitive, thought-provoking writing."},{"Title":"Messiah of Laguardia, The","review":"Elisha Porat is one of the best kept secrets of Israeli literature. He is one of its best poets, dealing with the attrocities of war and the despair and agony of memory, and a very fine storyteller. I hope a publisher will decide to publish his poems in English, so that english readers will be able to read them (in the meantime you can find him all over the web, in ezines and other sites, worth searching). This book is a very good translation of some of his best stories. Read it and spread the word..."},{"Title":"Messiah of Laguardia, The","review":"Elisha Porat's collection of stories, The Major of LaGuardia, is a bit uneven, but the very accomplished stories tend to redeem those which work less effectively. By far the most powerful story is \\"At the Little Bridge Below Ufana.\\" There, Porat seems to marshal most of his literary talents, creating a story about memory, loss, love and hope that is both gripping and a compelling. The Farming Instructor is also powerful; Porat renders the main character in stunning detail. His life and lack of love is a sad contrast the moving and vibrant world around him. The rest of the collection is a bit flat. Porat does not end his stories effectively or evenly, and this often scuttles an otherwise well crafted piece."},{"Title":"Messiah of Laguardia, The","review":"Over the last three years I have read over a dozen of Elisha Porat's stories. The depth of his Realism is akin to that of American novelist Henry James. Porat shows James' concerns for what lies beneath the human surface, through an intense interaction with character behavior and its underlying motivations. Yet what Porat contributes through his own particular style is a certain freshness and pungency, offsetting much that is plainly languid in today's market of so-called 'literature'.Moreover, the complexity of his stories with their psychologically compelling narratives make Porat's fiction eminently viable to our dangerous modern age. Running the gamut from soldiers to deceivers, false messiahs to ghosts, Porat is more than suited to the intricate themes he handles, bringing readers into unseen worlds, allowing them to view life from expanded parameters. There is nothing predictable in his plots.Elisha Porat is an enthralling writer, and the haunting portrayals one finds in his fiction also run throughout his equally excellent poetry. He deserves a much wider reading, to be on the forefront of literature, not relegated to the background, underground, or some musty bookshelf in a university. His literature is the kind that will endure. Alan Sacks has done English readers a great service through this high-quality translation. Porat comes with my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Messiah of Laguardia, The","review":"In The Messiah of LaGuardia, the first collection of short stories by Israeli writer Elisha Porat to be translaed into English, we see men whose lives have been fractured, who have found - in a manner often surprising to themselves - little spiritual fulfillment in helping to build the State of Israel, and little pleasure or comfort in sex, love, or friendship."},{"Title":"Stand Up, Speak Out, Talk Back!","review":"This book is great for understanding calm assertive behavior with plenty of examples.

Can't recommend it enough...Absolutely sinful; will make you wanna make sweet, sweet love to his wife..."},{"Title":"Edgewater Angels: A Novel","review":"When I was first assigned to read Edgewater Angels I was disappointed. I suspected the sole reason was because the author grew up in San Pedro (since I attend San Pedro High School). I slowly read this novel page by page, having an initial mindset that it would ultimately be boring and a complete waste of time. Although I feel like I cannot relate firsthand to the true stories and situations expressed in Edgewater Angels, I still enjoyed it for the most part. When reading this novel, I was able to get a different perspective of life in the projects of San Pedro. As I continued on with the story, I found I was no longer protected by the securities and comforts of the more wealthy parts of San Pedro. With each chapter, I would get mental pictures produced from the author's descriptive words. Although grotesque and primarily uncomfortable, the realistic atmosphere urged me to read further. The luxuries that surround me everyday didn't exist for Sunny Toomer. The support and parental guidance I receive constantly wasn't offered to this young man. Instead of a nonrealistic story that allowed me to escape the harsh realities of life, like plenty of other novels I have previously read, Edgewater Angles gave a dose of truth. It forced me to see a different side of life that wasn't buttered up with \\"happily ever after\\" endings or unrealistic stories. Sandro Meallet told the blunt truth about the kind of life many people have to go through everyday, which is the style of writing everyone should get a taste of."},{"Title":"Edgewater Angels: A Novel","review":"Meallet's dialect of the early 90's is accurate as well as the locations. I felt a connection towards Toomer as if I knew him as he was living a typical San Pedroish life, in the ghetto that is. Meallet's-style-that-I'm-currently-using tends to get annoying as if he didn't know what to replace with a single word. Overall, the experience was a great one that lasted under 24 hours (Meallets fictional novel is so captivating, it was read in a day). Other-than-this-style-that-is-constantly-used, I only had one other grudge towards the story. Center Street; it is actually Centre Street, but pronounced Center Street. Why the grudge? Because I live on Centre St. :PRevisedEdgewater Angel is simply one of the few fictional novels that can truly engage a connection with its readers, depending on who that reader is. Because I live in the city Meallets protagonist did, and actually quite near it too, I felt aquainted towards Toomers personality, and his slang dialect. But even with all the rich details this fictional novel provides of the crack-ridden slums of crime and gangs, Meallets continuous usage of a technique I-can't-fully-label-as-it-is-one-of-a-kind tends to get tedious and hampers the reading experience. Edgewater has a backbone story and several interruptions that can either annoy a reader due to its irrelevancy, or can increase the experience by offering a bit of history through flashbacks (Toomers father on the island of Little Inagua). Of a possible 5, this novel deserves a 4.5."},{"Title":"Edgewater Angels: A Novel","review":"I would give this a 4.5 because hardly anything is a &quot;5&quot; for me. Almost every page was engrossing. There were only a few sections that I skimmed through fast - but that's probably because I have a 3 year old with little time to read. I very much enjoyed the writing style. You really feel part of what is happening in the book. It's gritty stuff, but very engrossing and enlightening. I am looking forward to the sequel. I understand there will be 3 total."},{"Title":"Edgewater Angels: A Novel","review":"Less of a novel that a series of coming of age vignettes, Meallet's debut is an instant classic. The book follows narrator &quot;Toomer&quot; as he makes his way though life in the tough streets of LA's San Pedro neighborhood. Like his friends, Toomer's father is an absent abstraction, and the only men around are the neighborhood thugs, cops, cowards, and those who pass through his mother's bedroom. Even though his environment is a constant menace and a breeding ground for crime, there is some odd sense of community in many ways. And although he is no saint, Toomer is a highly appealing and sympathetic presence, very much like the kid in the 1994 film &quot;Fresh.&quot;Meallet's writing is clean and vivid, with a real writer's ear for dialogue and slang. Toomer's narration carries a number of inventively strung together words which form new descriptive phrases. The only off note is a slightly fantastical section in the middle which attempts to portray his father's life, and doesn't really fit with the rest of the book, but other than that, every note is pitch perfect. Even though the different vignettes aren't directly linked-they read more like someone telling stories-they blend to form an unforgettable portrait of a young man struggling to grow up in the ghetto."},{"Title":"Edgewater Angels: A Novel","review":"I really loved this book. I grew up near San Pedro and so the details and the places were captivating and refreshing of my childhood experiences in Pedro. A very raw slice of what life was like especially back in those days, the gangs, the fear, the &quot;park&quot;, the cops, the night sounds. The &quot;Colors&quot; thing was a real deal and as Sandro expresses; the type of gangs in the South Bay was an especially valid sentiment in the day to day of the surroundings. This is the first book I have read about the area that wasn't very far from the truth, I found myself fearing what truths he did write but at the same time I felt freed by his documentation. I highly recommend this book for readers interested in a small history of Los Angeles."},{"Title":"Edgewater Angels: A Novel","review":"Sandro Meallet's Edgewater Angles is episodic storytelling at its best.

Good Novel."},{"Title":"Edgewater Angels: A Novel","review":"Sandro Meallet's Edgewater Angels deals with a young boy, Sunny Toomer, and his life growing up in the projects of San Pedro, California. The novel being Sandro's first effort comes across as ambitious in his attempt to depict the rundown and gang ridden streets of &quot;low&quot; San Pedro. Initially, the idea of reading a book transpiring in my hometown aroused a certain amount of interest in me. However, as I progressed through the novel, the location factor deteriorated and the story itself became the main focal point. The book itself is composed of many stories of Toomer's day to day life some of which concern gang violence, parental problems, and crime. Through it all, I never felt a strong connection with the character. At one point, a portion of the novel is dedicated to Sunny's father which has no importance whatsoever to the story at hand. The main problem with this section is that it pushes the main story aside and derails to a new story line and back again. Also, upon completing the novel I felt as neutral as when I began reading the novel. Edgewater Angels gets 3 stars ( B-/C+ ) out of 5. Hopefully, Meallet's sophomore release is more developed."},{"Title":"Edgewater Angels: A Novel","review":"I read Edgewater Angels for my college english class and was surprised by how good it was.

In the end, he learns the true meaning of life.I highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Edgewater Angels: A Novel","review":"I read this book because the author is a friend of a friend, etc. In such cases I usually expect to be impressed, inspired to write my own stuff, heartened to know a published young writer with lots of potential. But to my surprise, I was immediately sucked into this book. The language is fresh and exciting, the characters and conflicts extremely believeable, but most importantly, the author has some great stories to tell. I have passed the book along to several friends who are now anxiously sucked in as I was a week ago. And I find myself running words together and inventing new ones in both writing and speech (in the style of the author, certainly not on account of a drinking problem). My only criticisms are that the prose is clunky in a few places (like, two times, so who cares?) and I was left at the end wanting a little more resolution, perhaps more a sense of how the many anecdotes hang together as a book. Neither is a major issue, though, and I expect any kinks in the author's execution to be long-since worked out by the time I get my paws on his next novel. I am looking forward to it."},{"Title":"Edgewater Angels: A Novel","review":"It starts off good then gets even more engrossing as you get to know Toomer better. I couldn't put it down and can't wait to meet the author at the local bookstore and coffee shop in San Pedro when he visits in November to find out how much is based on fact. The style is such that you really feel like Toomer is actually writing the story. The slang that he uses and problems that he comes up against are so real. It was sad to turn the page and get to the end."},{"Title":"Edgewater Angels: A Novel","review":"I was very excited to read Edgewater Angels because I enjoy reading fiction novels that relate to kids my age. I was also excited because the story took place in Pedro. I recommend Edgewater Angels to all high school students because it will give them a chance to see how hard life was growing up in Pedro. Before I read this book, I really didn't care about what happens or goes on in Pedro. I just thought half of it was a very wealthy neighborhood where I attended school. Edgewater Angels made me see how hard life can be as a child growing up in a bad neighborhood. And it made me realize that my life compared to Sonny's isn't that hard. I now appreciate my surroundings more because now I see how it is to not have them."},{"Title":"Edgewater Angels: A Novel","review":"Edgewater Angels appealed to me through the real context life's hardships. Moving ahead into the book I felt that I actually knew Toomer and who he was going to become. Growing up in Wilmington, the sister city of San Pedro, both towns are similar within the history and culture of the people of the port. Attending school in San Pedro all my life, I consider it a second home. To finally experience such neighborhoods of the city placed a new outlook and respect for the underprivileged communities. I began to understand the daily struggle of a boy who accepted his place in society. The novel reveals how a poverty stricken child grows up to be a man. Even though he has experienced a world of violence and difficult situations, a collection of truths are exposed. Meallet illustrates the veracity in life from a-not-so-perfect family, childhood friends, and the birth of a child. The short stories are written as if you were almost experiencing it with him. The dialect and use of slang made me want to read it more aside from proper grammar books. Reading this book has given me a reality check in the suburb surroundings of San Pedro.

The nly character that you really do root for, and become emotionally attached to, is Monet, and his ambitons are cut short by gang violence. If the author had given sunny some of these aspiring feelings, the story would have been much more involving for the reader. All of his i could stand, though. The main thing that keeps this in a totally different genre as catcher in the rye is that sunny has a limited amount, if any, personal evolution. He starts off as an immature elementary student, and ends up as an immature adolescent who has a fair amount of blood on his hands.

Issues such as how patients and their families deal with their problems and how society views these issues were not mentioned in the text. As I think this is a significant aspect of abnormal psychology, this book missed out a lot on that. Also, there are some parts in the book where the author writes about &quot;his&quot; way of thinking about things. He warns about this in his introduction, and as this is not a textbook, giving opinions can be justified.

I was expecting something like Sach's The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, containing personal stories about people who experience \\"extraordinary states of mind.\\" Although there are some personal stories scattered about, a large portion of the text is composed of probable explanations for the reasons someone may be experiencing these \\"extraordinary\\" states.Notice above that I said probable explanations; this is due to the fact that Dr. Youngman (He is an M.D. I looked him up.) tends to just throw in statements that apparently are to be accepted as fact. For example, if you tell me that, \\"Recent polls have indicated that about half of the population of the United States and Canada reject the scientific account of evolution and accept the biblical story of creation,\\" you better give me a citation. U.S.... now with the influence of the Tea Party...yeah maybe, but Canada? Come on! It's statements like this that prompted me to do what I know that you should always do first, go back and read the Preface. Yep, there it is, right there first sentence, \\"The purpose of this book is to entertain and amuse--and perhaps stimulate and surprise--those who share my particular, slightly cynical view of the world...\\" Oh, OK, now I got it. Yes, and the good doctor is British after all.A lot of the states of mind I'm not certain that I would even consider \\"states of mind,\\" like the mind of a talented musician or gifted mathematician. Perhaps I just expected, due to the title, that all would be associated with some type of madness. Having said that, a lot of the chapters are about a state of mind that most of us cannot fathom--pedophilia, autism, hypochondriasis and Munchausen syndrome, multiple personality disorder, etc. I'm just not certain that I can agree with suggestions like the one that implies that schizophrenia may be a state of mind chosen by the \\"sufferer\\" to make her life more bearable? Hey, from the schizophrenics that I know, that must have been a really crappy previous life!One of the most surprising chapters for me was \\"The celebrated Hahnemann delusion: homeopathy,\\" because I immediately recognized the name Hahnemann as the respected teaching hospital of my alma mater, Drexel University here in Philadelphia. Great, research, I love research. It seems that Drexel's Hahnemann Hospital, established in 1885 forty-two years after Samuel Hahnemann's death, was actually named after this guy. In a search on Hahnemann's Web page for \\"homeopathy\\" you get \\"The key concepts of homeopathy are not consistent with the current understanding of science, particularly chemistry and physics.\\" Hmmm... Denying their namesake, interesting...The chapter on transsexuals is interesting although I think I might wonder exactly who these \\"experts\\" are that consider \\"the way the child is treated during the early months and years of life...\\" the principal cause of a person being a transsexual. I was also surprised to hear that \\"...millions of people have devoted a substantial proportion of their time (and money) to the psychoanalytic process, mostly with no discernible effect,\\" and which the doctor considers a bunch of bunk. My ex-husband would love this guy!As you can tell by my 4-star rating I enjoyed reading this book. It lives up, or down whichever, to the first sentence in the Preface, which is more than I can say for most books."},{"Title":"The Madness of Prince Hamlet","review":"Though I might not agre with all the theories put forth in this book I enjoyed reading it and thought it was very informative without going too much in depth. a wonderful read."},{"Title":"Sword Song","review":"Rosemary Sutcliff's fleshing out of Kipling's fictional treatment of British history (Puck of Pook's Hill), concludes with Sword Song. Chronologically, her stories range from the Iron Age just before the Romans came, to the English Civil War, although it appears she did not write them in that order.Her books are called \\"young adult\\" novels because the themes are simple and the good guys are generally good, while the bad guys have little to recommend them. There is violence--she writes of dark times--but no sex.The bulk of her stories are on the edge of the Roman Empire, either geographically, taking place on the fringes of Britain, or in time, as the Empire disintegrates. In either case, individuals have to take care of their own business.Most young adult novels have as their primary theme the change from child to adult through danger and difficulty.Sutcliff's characters face dangers, and, most importantly, do so voluntarily. There are any number of times when they could choose to retreat, but go forward, for honor, for their friends, or for an ideal.This, I would submit, is a terrifically important lesson to teach. Current pop literature for children seems to be trying to emulate Catcher in The Rye, where a perpetual loser is....a loser. Losers seem to be heroes.In Sword Song, the young man leaves home due to having accidentally killed a man. It's clear that Bjarni has a good deal too much energy, not enough judgment, and perhaps doesn't even know enough to be afraid. Not surprisingly, he finds work as a hired sword, although he begins to give his loyalty to one of his employers, and gets loyalty back.Later in the book, he is trying by himself, with no friends at his back, to facilitate the escape of a woman, herself an outcast, from danger. To do so, he has to back off from an encounter, to keep from being discovered. He informs the woman that for her he has, for the first time in his life, run from a fight. We all make sacrifices in our way and Bjarni is now growing up. He will fight, in the future, we don't doubt, but with somewhat more discernment.The scope of the book is around the littoral of the British Isles, as Bjarni is a fighting man on the ships of various Isles warlords.I would strongly, highly, unreservedly recommend any parent to supply Sutcliff's books to any child from about age fourteen on. The inevitable difficulty is that the parent is going to have to teach a history course in order to place the story in our own world. Given the state of education these days, without that primer, Sutcliff's stories might as well be fantasy or science fiction.It is too bad. Sutcliff's stories tell important lessons about how we came to be who we are; through the stubborn courage of ordinary people facing extraordinary circumstances.We are not through needing such people,and, although a number of Sutcliff's people are military, many are not. She tells us that we have to look to ourselves as we are, and not necessarily to depend on others who, as when the Empire fell, are no longer available.In addition to the lessons which I, at an advanced age think are important, I can also say the stories are terrific reads. Sutcliff is particularly good on the seemingly unimportant detail which sets a scene and draws the reader into her world."},{"Title":"Sword Song","review":"I helped my twelve year old choose this book to read. He found it humorous when I started reading it. \\"It's a book for Young Adults\\", he said. That was funny for several reasons, including the fact that he considers himself a young adult.The book really is not just for kids. This is the first exposure I've had to Sutcliff. I was very pleasantly surprised to find the high quality of her writing to be focussed on kids.This tale, wonderfully written, tells of a young man and a bad decision. It is a terrible decision in which some one dies. The treatment of the murder is very light. That may be the one criticism that I have for the story. Today, of all days, our kids need to know the very serious consequences of their actions. The setting of this story is far removed from our own, and is probably the way it would have been.Through the life events and challenges resulting from the accident, Bjarni becomes a man. He learns the hard way how to do just about everything. This forging process helps him to grow physically and mentally.This is a good story. There is a little death, a little love, and a lot of life."},{"Title":"Sword Song","review":"Rosemary Sutcliff will always be one of my favorites. I am seventeen and been reading them for around seven years. (The first year may have been more like listening :>) This story is great. I love how her books aren't a series, yet some of them are connected. This one is connected to The Ninth Eagle and The Silver Branch and The Lantern Bearers. Her books are not about the romance though they usually have a girl. This one I think is especially sweet in \\"the girl\\" area. I started to read these not to long after Chronicles of Narnia. I will always love the Chronicles , and they have some amazing truths in them that you understand more as you grow older, but they are directed to a younger adience. Don't get me wrong, I love the Chronicles, but I don't think I'll ever get too 'old' for Sutcliff's 'young adult' books. I am a Christian and read few non-Chritian books outside of school reading unless I deem them Appropriate. :) I reccomend these books to everyone. they are such a good read."},{"Title":"Sword Song","review":"I bought this book as part of a home schooling curriculum for my ten-year-old son. Although the book is recommended for young adults, my son reads on a much higher grade level than most of his age group. That being said, he still wanted this to be a duet read;I would read for a while, then he would. It's a challenging read, but well worth the effort. We had been studying Vikings in our history lessons, and I chose this book as the companion reading for these lessons. It really brought home the tumultuous, often violent, and complex times of the Viking world. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Sword Song","review":"It has been seven years since I first read a Rosemary Sutcliff novel,The Eagle, and that book has remained one of my favorites to this day. I've always meant to read her other works, and at times in the past I would pick one up, only to read a chapter or two and then set it aside when school projects overtook me. I found this book by chance in the school library, checked it out, and read it in under a week. Sutcliff's writing has the ability to engage the reader from the first page.Sword Song is about Bjarni's life as a mercenary and his internal conflict of loyalty versus freedom. He is often unsure of where to go, and many times he was torn between the desire to stay and the call to adventure. It is not difficult to spot the elements indicating the book was mid-revision: there are portions that needed polishing and a few loose ends not neatly tied. However, these flaws are overshadowed by wonderful vivid descriptions, timely pacing (in comparison to the slow beginning of The Eagle), and a satisfying end to a good adventure.Sutcliff is particularly adept at incorporating vocabulary suitable to the setting of her novels. Many times I had to look up lingo (keep a dictionary at hand) and then discover the etymology is Scottish or British of Scandinavian origin. Some examples: garth, dreich, sark, wadmal, haar, among others. As an avid enthusiast of linguistics, I appreciate her command of diction. And as an aspiring novelist writing a historical fiction in a similar setting, I was interested to see how Sutcliff approached the Viking world of the British Isles. It's clear Sutcliff researched her material and knew it well; her description immersed me in the world of the Vikings and other peoples inhabiting the Isles, and I felt as though I were actually trudging along beside the main character.This book is not perfect, and probably not the best of Sutcliff, unfortunately due to the timing of her death--I will need to read more of Sutcliff's works to see how they compare. But in the array of Viking adventure novels on the market, this book stands out as a well-researched and (overall) well-developed story. Recommended for any fan of Vikings, action adventure, historical fiction, well-written books, or just a good story."},{"Title":"Fatima from the beginning","review":"Eleventh Edition 2000 Jubileaum Edition SoftcoverEdicoes: Missoes Consolata Fatima (Portugal)Quotation from back cover: \\"If the church has accepted the message of Fatima, it is above all because that message contains a truth and a call whose basic content is the truth and the call of the Gospel itself.\\" - John Paul IIInformation about the author from the inside cover flaps:The author of this book, Fr. John De Marchi, was born in Belluno (Italy) in 1914. He belongs to that group of talented personages possessing charismatic gifts, outstanding for his apostolic zeal and the multiplicity of his achievements. He introduced the Consolata Missionary Institute into Portugal and the United States, being the founder of the review \\"The Rainbow\\" with the purpose of spreading devotion to the Immaculate Heart of Mary and promoting missionary vocations in the United States. In Kenya, he organized missionary activity on a vast scale by means of an intelligent promotion of the laity, and in Ethiopia he opened up new mission fields in regions long abandoned. He is a truly great missionary, writer, and cineast. This book about the happenings at Fatima is a classic example of his exceptional work. Sent to Portugal when the Second World War was in progress, he fulfilled the mission entrusted to him, while at the same time, though alone, he ventured to write an account of Fatima which was to be different from others. He made a thorough investigation into the matter, conversed with Lucia, interviewed the witnesses, visited the places and acquainted himself with the intimate life of the people, so that his book merits to be classified as an authentic historical document."},{"Title":"Classic Stoneware of Japan: Shino and Oribe","review":"Say \\"stoneware\\" to anyone fond of traditional Japanese culture and most will respond \\"raku.\\" Indeed, those loosely-shapen dark wonders of the low-fire kiln are the supercondensed span of an entire culture in an object you can hold. Yet in an almost artless preoccupation with doing just the opposite, two traditions expressing the same qualities of the tea ceremony using entirely materials and effect came into existence and rapidly became popular: Shino and Oribe ware. Both originated during Japan's artistic renaissance of the late sixteenth century (which interestingly was coterminus with the Europeam Renaissance beyond Italy, and just as tumultuous).The tea ceremony's origins came in a gentler time, the Muromachi. It was as if the mix of vigor and experience hung in the air like a dust mote after a peaceful zephyr, the same way that war is in the air when come the winds of change. Though several theories claim to be the actual inspiration, the era is more definite. A 1932 chronicle relates, \\"In the first month of 1574, Kagemitsu, third son of Kageharu of the thirteenth generation after the first Seto potter Kato Kagemasa, moved to Akatsu. By virtue of a tea jar that he presented to Lord Oda Nobunaga, the latter formally recognized him as a retainer. Kakemitsu subsequently left Seto and moved to Kujiri, in Mino, in 1583. There . . . he continued working as a potter.\\"To diehard raku buffs, Shino ware must have seemed a bit overadorned, fussy perhaps. There are geometrics, abstracts, and representations of familiar fare such as birds, grasses, plus the occasional poem such as:The inner essenceOf the fence of deutzia flowersIn a mountain village:The feeling of treading a roadCovered with freshly fallen snow.The authors convey all this with a mix of the poet and the historian. Here is an extended passage that carries the aroma of the whole text:\\"To me [Shino ware's] charm lies in the feel of its surface and the mellow luster that accords so well with that surface. And there is the straightforward beauty of the pictures decorating Shino ware. The overall effect is intoxicating.\\"Shino pictures are drawn with lively lines depicting the everyday scenery surrounding the potters-the bridges over the streams at Kuguri, a cypress fence and dew-covered path leading to its brushwood gate, a grove of trees in flower, the trees and grasses just outside the window, even the mountain road they traveled day after day.\\"Such was the aesthetic of the Momoyama period in general. But the single tree, the few blades of grass these artists sketched are somehow pleasing because the designs pulse with life, the brushwork is clean and bold.\\"The white of Shino can be compared to the first snow of the season, or to the last traces of the winter snow, which the warm spring winds are erasing as the bush warbler's first song rings out. Shino's white surface is soft like a mother's breast; it brings back memories of childhood.\\"Shino white is tidiness itself. And on that white the potters painted designs with an iron glaze made of oni-ita, a red clay rich in iron and manganese and abundant in the Seto region. The effect of flame in the kiln added distinctive fire marks. Shino is an elusive ware, capable of infinite transformations.\\"The Shino potters thickly applied their glaze, which they made by carefully grinding feldspar and refining it in water. To this they added their own secret proportion of ash. Then, after offering sake and prayers to the gods of the kiln, and ritually scattering salt to purify the area, they entrusted their pieces to the fire.\\"In the depths of the heartFrom which pottery springsFlows a crystal clear streamReflecting nearby mountains.-- Rosanjin KitaojiThe above is but the glaze. To get the pot you must get the book. Be sure to look at pictures 2 and 3 on page 54: This seemingly unassuming Shino teabowl is considered the finest teabowl in existence.Alas, or perhaps huzzah, styles last not long. The next innovation in Japanese teaware can be directly traced to a single man, Furuta Oribe, and as changes in teacups go, his was a doozy.Japan in Oribe's time was a chessboard of warlords incessantly raiding each other for fun and profit. Oribe, among other things, also was a distinguished general. His tastes ran to the \\"robust, generous, vigorous, and distorted in shape.\\" He introduce these qualities to the entire tea ceremony-most notably by making it part of a dinner event with a large number of others, all lubricated as much by sak&eacute; as by tea. Hence Oribe commissioned not only tea ware but serving and dining dishes, sak&eacute; ware, unusual geometrics, and heavy, dripping glazes the tea ceremony's predecessors would have deemed ghastly. This was not very Zen. On the other hand, Oribe's shaking up the establishment led directly to a great flowering of ceramics. Eventually more subtle tastes tamed down the founder's style-a process that can be seen vividly in the many illustrations of Oribe ware-and Oribe's great-great-great grandchildren's great grandchildren still being made today.Alas, this review is all too brief. To sum the book in PR blurb terms, \\"Classic Stoneware of Japan: Shino and Oribe\\" is a comprehensive visual survey and text explication of the two traditions' glazes, processes, shapes, and decoration. You come away with a clear idea of the essence of these wares and with half an eye you can come to expertly recognize either. The detail is exhaustive given its scant 42 pages of text. Potters will celebrate it. Everyone else will learn from it. No one is likely to forget it."},{"Title":"Classic Stoneware of Japan: Shino and Oribe","review":"I enjoy looking at the photos of this book.

It is out of print but nonetheless very useful for students of the Bible in professional studies in preparation for ministry or for individuals who wish to enlarge their understanding of the subject to enhance their own Bible study. It is full and technical in the late 1800's meaning of those worlds.The study is itself is \\"replete and compleat\\" with historical, intra-Biblical, and interdepartmental evaluations of TYPOLOGY.

It is well bound and easily handled, with a great binding that allows it lie flat in the lap or on a desk.Fairbairn does a very fine job of presenting the material and discussing it. I particularly enjoyed and learned a great deal from his discussion of Cherubim, for example. He deals with them from Genesis to Revelation and examines the historical process of their development, meaning and usage in the contexts of each biblical book in which they are mentioned. He discusses the Cherubim as symbol and the elevation of that symbolism in thought-provoking detail. Frankly, he presented for consideration many concepts associated with Cherubim of which I found myself woefully ignorant. Similar enlightenment was found for the various discussions of types, their meanings and development over time, and the reality that an Old Testament type fulfilled in the New Testament yet functions as a type pointing onward into the Eschaton, just as does the NT antitype. This is heady stuff.This work has greatly enlarged my apprehension in many ways. It is one of the best purchases I have made in the field of biblical studies.

So Paisley tells us the tale. I love all the details--every animal at the shop where Paisley's story begins has personality. A green whale with white polka dots, a snail with a colorful shell, some gingham/seersucker cats, a dinosaur with a pattern of flowers or cogs, a swirly octopus, a plaid giraffe, and flowered farm animals are just some of the many characters in the store. Each animal is meant for a particular child, but Paisley's destiny involves an exciting journey through streets and a laundromat. We see the swing tag go flying from the plastic hanger on the elephant's ear, and we can witness the dizzying/sickening effects washers and dryers can have on a stuffed animal. Paisley despairs of ever finding the right child, but the end of the book represents a new beginning for our charming protagonist."},{"Title":"Paisley","review":"I ordered this book for my granddaughter after checking it out from the library several times.

The story opens with the death of family patriarch, Nick Cantini, who is the piece of fabric that adds the color, warmth and strength to the family quilt.Johnny Cantini, Nick's oldest son, is left holding the needle and thread that stitches the family together. Johnny must continue with the small business his father built while trying to fill his father's shoes as the family's head.To complicate things more, just before his death, Nick makes confession and a last request to Johnny. Little did anyone - least of all Johnny - know what fulfilling that last request would entail. Little did Johnny know that his father's confession wasn't the secret Johnny thought it should be.Set in Providence, Rhode Island, the story has a 1950s feel to it. It is reminiscent of a time when families sat down, ate together and solved all their problems together. A time of good-humored kidding amongst people who really care about each other and when family values counted. It is a story about the warmth of knowing people love and need you. About and honor and taking responsibility.What makes this story most intriguing and humorous is that the deceased Cantini watches the family's happenings and comments to readers about the activities. (His family members don't hear or see him.) And to keep things interesting, there is surprise twist at the story's end.Don't let my referral to the 1950s scare you off from reading this enjoyable novel. The problems the Cantini family face are as current as tomorrow's stock report, as old as time itself. If you are fortunate, you will soon start to see your family members in the Cantini family. If you are not lucky enough to have a squabbling, loving, extended family I'm sure the Cantini's will have you over for dinner and make you feel right at home."},{"Title":"Every Sunday","review":"Every Sunday is a light enjoyable read that talks about issues that many families deal with every day. Family secrets and conflicts within relationships are something that we can all relate to. The dynamics behind being part of a family are so intricate and fragile that sometimes people get confused and find themselves in strange situatuions much like Johnny Catini.As a Providence native, all the talk about the city in this book really hit home. Landmarks like Haven Brothers (anyone traveling to the city should go at least once during thier stay) and even the fictious hardware store brought back great memories of my youth and my old neighborhood. There were a great deal of these \\"mom and pop\\" stores just around the corner were the proprietors knew you by name.For an enjoyable read that brings family relationships to life, read this book."},{"Title":"Every Sunday","review":"I bought this book for my daughter who read it and highly recommended it, so I borrowed it and must agree it is one of the best novels I've read.

I did not do that in the case of Every Sunday. This book was horrible from every angle. The characters were stereotypical, one dimensional at best, the dialogue was childish and the plot a complete and utter joke. To be brief: Before the older father dies, he tells his son to say goodbye to his long time mistress. Turns out the son meets and falls for the mistress after they meet. The mistress is a professor at Brown University. The son is an uneducated goombah with gold chains around his neck who runs his dead father's hardware store. The son's big claim to fame is he knows someone at the parking violations bureau to get your parking tickets expunged. You couldn't make up a dumber plot.

The story focuses on the youngest member of the Cantini family, Johnny, as he faces the future after the death of his father, Nick. The story is narrated by Nick himself, who watches the action from \\"the other side\\" and sprinkles his narrative with witty observations and humorous asides. When he was alive, Nick was the kind of guy you'd go to whenever you needed anything, whether it be tickets to a sold-out concert or a hard-to-find hardware part. He built his reputation, family and his store with a lot of hard work and love and now the burdens of those things have fallen on Johnny's shoulders, which have been relatively idle for the first thirty years of his life. Can Johnny rise to the occasion? To complicate matters immensely, Nick burdened Johnny with a deep secret right before his death and asked a huge favor of his son: to comfort his mistress after his death. That task leads Johnny into a relationship he never expected to find and lays an even greater burden on his shoulders, forcing him to make some difficult decisions about his life and his family's legacy. Throughout the book, Pezzelli's underlying message is clear: families are one of the most important things we have and we should treasure them each and every day. It's a wonderful read, rich with descriptions of the New England landscape as well as of the characters themselves. Liberally dosed with humor, it's also full of lovely little observations, like the way that the littlest things - like the aroma of baking bread or a snowflake on a windowsill - can make even the dreariest days beautiful. An easy read, I think that this book is sure to warm your heart as it did mine"},{"Title":"Every Sunday","review":"OK.

For example:While talking to Vicki after doing something he didn't think he should have done, and I won't spoil the scene for you, a shocked Johnny Catini asks, \\"Does this make me have like-what do they call it-an edible complex?\\"\\"A what?\\" Vicki exclaims.\\"You know, like the guy I read about in high school. Edible rex or whatever the hell his name was.\\"\\"Oedipus!\\" cries Vicki. \\"Not edible!\\"Or this bit of dialog between them, \\"Where are we goin' tonight? he says as they stroll along the sidewalk.\\"You mean, go-ing?\\" says Vicki.\\"Huh?\\"\\"I-N-G ing,\\" she says good-naturedly. \\"You know, sounds like eeen-guh.\\"\\"I don't get it,\\" says Johnny.\\"You always say doin', goin', havin', bein'. What is it you have against the letter g?\\"\\"Nothin',\\" he replies.See what I mean? And there are many more examples of conversations like this between them in the book. Like, ya know, Johnny woulda said, \\"I don't get it.\\"I was disappointed in this novel by Peter Pezzelli, especially since I enjoyed reading the four other novels he wrote set in Providence, RI all having Italian-American characters. 3 Stars"},{"Title":"Every Sunday","review":"On the premise, this sounded like a great easy read.

A must read!"},{"Title":"Maggie Craig","review":"Maggie's neck is sore from holding her head high all the time, but still she bravely carries on, pride outweighing neck pain. Her life is one of tragedy, resignation and correct posture. Mam parted this world when Maggie was but six years old, leaving her with a da so devestated he spent the remainder of his life staring at a wall. Poor Maggie, still a child, was forced to go off to work in a mill -- it was that or the poorhouse. Then there was the unplanned pregnancy, the unplanned attempted murder, and the unplanned marriage to a gay man. What a strong lady is our Maggie. That head, weighed down with sorrow, must be a heavy burden to bear, though you won't hear her complaining! Nor will she seek release by repeatedly banging it against the wall. Never that.If you can't guess already, this is your standard woe is me, but so is DIGNITY and SELF-SACRIFICE type of story. Being of a kind doesn't automatically make it bad-- and it isn't bad at all. What stops this from being awesome is that it doesn't feel unique. Good because Joseph is a good writer, while at the same time nothing new or memorable is brought in to distinguish it from a million others like it. Don't expect to be blown away and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Elusive Victory: The Arab-Israeli Wars, 1947-1974","review":"This book is remarkable for what it is not: it is not a diatribe, it is not political, and it is not biased. It is a steadfastly-neutral account of the Arab-Israeli wars of the past sixty years and reflects the integrity and professionalism of the author. He is absolutely dedicated to presenting the perspectives of both sides of the conflict. It is meticulously researched and contains extraordinary detail about all military aspects of the conflicts. The book does not stray far into the political or diplomatic realms, and anyone interested in the personalities of the conflicts should look elsewhere. This is a professional military history that, while intended for a professional military audience, is accessible by most any reader with at least some basic knowledge of the conflict. Finally, at the risk of being repetetive, it is fair and unbiased, which is truly extraordinary, given the nature of the conflict. If you can find a copy, get it, and if you are the publisher, re-print it. Please."},{"Title":"Elusive Victory: The Arab-Israeli Wars, 1947-1974","review":"This book is a great reference for the Arab-Israeli wars.

I'm not a professional reviewer like so many others here, but I am a mom who has read countless books with her kids. And this one is outstanding. What I love about this book is that it covertly introduces poetry to kids. And it hooks them by introducing them to what I'm going to call \\"mind benders\\" like \\"The Red Wheelbarrow.\\" It's also written like a response journal. I'm so thrilled that the dots are not connected here, that you have to think and infer and create the missing parts of the narrative. I also love that it introduces poetry to kids in a non-threatening way. (The main character doesn't understand some poems and writes \\"honestly\\" about that in his journal.) I found my child completely agreeing -- what DOES the poem about the red wheelbarrow and the white chickens mean??? The author brilliantly includes the poems she references (the back of the book) so you can read them while/after reading the book itself.

The book arrived bundled in a very reasonable time and in the stated condition."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"Delightful! Enchanting! - Not words I often use to describe boy's preteen literature, but I actually used those very words to describe this book to a friend.Disclaimer: I love poetry. I love, love, love poetry. I didn't always love it, but I blame that on the \\"poetry\\" (hardly worth bearing the name poetry) that is often taught in schools. I don't know why textbook companies insist on anthologizing the ones they do when there are so many others students of all ages would love.My love of poetry runs so deeply that for my son's first Christmas I bought him A Family of Poems (Introduction by Caroline Kennedy) and inscribed these words on the end sheet: \\"English is not a romance language like French or Italian; however, throughout the centuries, talented poets have managed to capture its beauty and depth of thought. May you hear the music words can bring - always.\\" Over the last 6 years, this book has been well-loved and become well-worn.When my son marched through the house shouting, \\"Upstains, downstairs, all-around stairs,\\" I squealed in delight, \\"That's iambic pentameter!\\" When he began reciting the first stanza of \\"Hope is the Thing with Feathers\\" and \\"The Tyger,\\" I proudly prompted him to \\"do it again\\" to anyone who would listen. So it is no surprise that upon opening Love that Dog and seeing that it was written in free-verse form, I audibly gasped in delight; it is a somewhat rare form in literature, especially pre-teen literature. I crossed my legs and sat down, Indian-style right there in the middle of the bookstore aisle and proceeded to read the first page:JACKR00M 105 - MISS STRETCHBERRYSEPTEMBER 13I don't want tobecause boysdon't write poetry.Girls do.Not only did I hold in a my hands a book written in free verse, but a book with a male narrator, who like many boys consider poetry \\"girl's stuff.\\" The combination of title (Love That Dog ), form (free verse), and narrator (preteen male) had me plunking down the $5.99 without reading any further.I couldn't wait to read it cover to cover with my son, and I didn't have to wait long. The next stop was an oil change, and we certainly brought a bit of culture to the waiting room. If I was enchanted before, I quickly became utterly delighted. Creech not only writes the story of a dynamic narrator who learns the beauty of language and the joys of its manipulation, but also seamlessly incorporates famous poems by William Carlos Williams, Robert Frost and William Blake. The only allusions my son recognized were the ones to \\"The Tyger,\\" but thanks to Creech's foresight copies of all the poems referenced are included at the end.The narrator was charming; the story, endearing and the poems, quality. My only criticism is that the end appeared a bit hurried, yet perhaps it was intentional, recognizing the attention span of her audience. Still, Love that Dog has quickly become one of my favorites and Hate that Cat will surely be our next book purchase."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"This book is wonderful.

Jack starts saying how he does not understand a poem Ms. Strechberry read to his class and realize that it is a poem. Jack starts to write some poetry which ms. Strechberry posts on the blackboard but Jack tells Ms. Strechberry that he does not want his name on it. Jack ends up liking to write poetry. Ms. Strechberry asks Jack if he had any kind of a pet, and Jack said that he used to have a dog named Sky. He wrote a poem that told how he got Sky and how happy Sky was when he picked him instead of the other dogs. Later Jack wrote a very sad poem about how Sky was hit by a car and died. All of the poems that Jack wrote that were put on the black board he had typed up and put on yellow paper. Jack's classmates were very impressed with all of the poems that he wrote and they wanted to know who wrote them. One day Jack sent Mr. Walter Dean Myers a letter asking him to come to his school and visit his class. So Mr. Walter Dean Myers came to Jack's school and his class and was impressed with Jack's poems. A few days later, Jack sent Mr. Walter Dean Myers a letter with a new poem that he wrote:Love that dogLike a bird loves to flyI said I love that dogLike a bird loves to flyLove to call him in the morningLove to call him\\"Hey there Sky\\"Jack let his teacher put his name on that poem. That is where the book, Love That Dog, ends.Review: Love that Dog is a very good book. Love that Dog has 86 pages and the average page is 70-90 words long. At first you would think that it is a kinder garden book. Well, it sort of is, but it is a good book to read no matter what your age is. I would recommend this book to animal lovers, especially dog lovers. Love that Dog makes you realize how easily something you love can be taken away. Also, if you have a book report due soon and you haven't started a book this is also a good book, because you can read the whole thing in 20 minutes. I would highly recommend this book to anyone because it is very good!"},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"Our class really loved Love That Dog. We liked the way it was written in short sentences making the book quick and easy to read. We liked the funny way that Jack talked, because he made word pictures in our minds, and he asked strange questions. Even though Jack didn't think he liked poetry and that it was just for girls, he became a pretty good poet by writing poems in his journal to his teacher. A few of our boys thought that there wasn't enough excitement or action, but then it wasn't really that kind of a book. We give Love That Dog five stars."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"I bought this book for my 10 year old son about 6 months ago. I just grabbed it tonight to read during a quick break and fell in love. At 90+ pages written in prose it's a quick and easy read and wonderfully entertaining. I think there's a little bit of Jack (the main character) in all of us, wondering if what we are is good enough not only to share with the world but to fess up to ownership of it. His teacher, through gentle guidance, teaches him to believe in himself. I think this book is appropriate for people of any age and I plan on getting it for my 20 something sister for her birthday next month!"},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"This is a fantastic book and a great way to get kids interested in poetry.

Thank you Sharon Creech for such a wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"(...)I loved this book and particularly the book on tape with the special surprise at the end.The book is not about a boy who hates poetry. It's about a boy who is awkward about expressing his creativity and his sadness. He finds, through journaling to his teacher, his own poetic yearnings. And also that personal expression is not about cadence and rationlism, but about making soul sense of our lived lives. No, the poetry is not \\"Hiawatha,\\" but it is convincingly the poetry of a young male child.It's about inspiration. I'm inspired!And yes, authors often visit schools at the request of their young fans."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"Love that book! I said I love that book.

She introduced me to who now is one of my favorite authors, Sharon Creech. Sharon Creech writes books that are quick reads but they have a lot of content to them. Love That Dog is 180pg. and is a 4.5 reading level. I enjoy reading her books a lot.To listen and have respect to others is definitely one of the major themes in this book. Jack, the main character, struggles with writing poetry. Afraid of what kids will say, Jack will not let his teacher put his name on his poems. Later on, Jack realizes that anyone can write poetry. Jack starts to grow on liking poetry, he even wrote a letter to a famous poet to come to his school and present for the class. Jack shows that when he listens and respects others he can start gaining confidence.Sharon Creech writes many different types of books. She has written children's books and even some books for kids who are just starting reading. I have read 4 of her many wonderful books. Sharon Creech has a full potential to be a writer. She has wanted to be many other things such as, a painter and even an ice skater. But writing was something that stuck on her. Sharon was born in a suburb near Cleveland. She enjoys being with her family the most. Sharon writes books about regular kids with big ideas and dreams. Her books have touched me in many different ways.This book had parts where I just wanted to cry. When a book does that to me I know it was a good book. This book has been one of her best books that I have read so far. I plan on reading more and more of her books. Including exact details must be one of her strengths. Knowing the exact color or smell of something attracts me to keep on reading. Just the littlest details can make the difference. The book had some parts where it repeated itself. Other then that, the book was great. I am looking forward on reading her other books.Love That Dog would fall under the realistic fiction section. It has to do with real places and real people (some are real not all). The author Walter Dean Myers, is Jacks inspiration. The setting is described like a small suburb almost like where she grew up."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"I think this book was a great book to read for kids like me.

I recommend this feel-good book highly."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"Love That MuttI thought the novel was a boring book. The poem that Jack wrote about only \\"girls just write poems and boys don't\\" is not true, because I write poems once in a while. I think that the \\"Red Wheelbarrow\\" is a very confusing poem. It took me a couple of minutes to get it.Then there's the story with the blue car splashed with mud. Jack talks about it throughout the whole book. Jack gives hints so you could find out what happened. As you read more into the story, you start to find out what happens.As I told you in the paragraph before, this story is about the blue car. It ends up the reason why Jack talks about the blue car so much is because the blue car hit his yellow dog named Sky.At the beginning of he story Jack is very shy about showing people his poems. His teacher wants to put one of his poems about his dog on the board, but he refuses. But as you read more of the story, he becomes more sure of his poems and lets his teacher put his poems on the board. He learned that not only girls write poems, boys can, too.Christopher"},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"The first time I read this book I cried, and I don't cry with most books I read. But when I read it for the second time it didn't seem so sad and it actually seemed sweet, touching, and uplifting. The boy's innocent and sensitive spirit really touched me. The author is truly a genious. The poems are so simple it seems very realistic that a boy named Jack really did write them all for class, but they are also very emotional. I couldn't help but to love Jack and his dog and gain a greater appreciation of poetry. The author also uses colors and phrases that repeat throughout the story, and has a way of placing a line in just the right spot so that it catches you by surprise and makes you stop and think, or smile, or cry.

He also discovers that he has been using his poetry journal to explore his feelings about his dog who died.This is a quick and very moving book that can be read by kids who are ages 8 and up.

It's wonderful, and anyone - young or old - will benefit emmensely from this sweet, well-thought-out book about a boy and his yellow dog."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"The popularity of &quot;Love That Dog&quot; cannot be denied. What is it about this cute little story told through poems about a boy coming to terms with poetry and his dead dog that so many people adore? Is it the touching tale of a kid who misses his pet? Is it the first page, which sports the phrase, &quot;I don't want to because boys don't write poetry. Girls do&quot;? Or is it the fact that the book is approximately 86 pages in length (not including the eight short poems in the back) and can be read in approximately twenty minutes? I suspect the last. After all, this book is on many a summer reading list. Kids aren't fools and they'll grab the nearest shortest book that they can (if they get a chance). The lucky thing is, the book's pretty okay.I've already quoted to you the first line in the story. From what the reader can gather, a teacher by the name of Mrs. Stretchberry has told her class that they are required to write one poem a day and hand it in to her. Jack, our protagonist in this tale, is not pleased. He doesn't want to write poetry and he doesn't much care for some of the poems Mrs. Stretchberry reads. His response to Robert Frost's, &quot;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening&quot; is a concise, &quot;Why doesn't the person just keep going if he's got so many miles to go before he sleeps?&quot; Good question. But as the class progresses and Jack begins to understand more and more about what makes a poem good (he has some insightful comments on that topic). He begins to write poems in earnest and he becomes fascinated with the author/poet Walter Dean Myers. Suddenly Jack is desirous of nothing but getting Mr. Myers into his school to speak. To his delight, the man agrees and Jack is in heaven. Throughout this story he has also been slowly writing about his yellow dog Sky who was hit by a car. The final poem by Jack is a kind of ode to his dear departed pet, at last coming to terms with Sky's death.This is an excellent way of introducing kids to poetry. I liked that Jack assumed most of poetry consisted of how one breaks up sentences. He suspects at one point that perhaps poets like Robert Frost just wrote out their poems and then someone (possibly their teachers) broke them up and posted them for everyone to see (just as Mrs. Stretchberry does). The book works hard to make it clear that poetry is not restricted to women, either as readers or as writers. The arrival of Walter Dean Myers makes this very clear as well. I was admittedly a little shocked that author Sharon Creech chose that particular poet as her visiting maestro. I mean, I like Myers, don't get me wrong. I've admittedly only ever read his young adult books (&quot;Monster&quot; and such) and they were fine, but this book doesn't just put him on a pedestal. It flatters, praises, lauds, and sings the praises of him. He becomes the ultimate poet extraordinaire, as funny as he is nice. Which is great I guess... but why Walter Dean Myers specifically? The world may never know.If I could change anything about this book, I guess I'd make it clear from the start that the poems that Jack comments on throughout the story appears in the back of the text. As it is, the reader only happens upon them accidentally by the tale's end. &quot;Love That Dog&quot; isn't as strong as Creech's, &quot;Walk Two Moons&quot;, but to be fair, it's written for an entirely different audience. Forget reluctant readers. This book is written for reluctant poets. Those kids that will pick it up hoping to read through something easy may find themselves enticed to write their own poetry after a couple pages. I know I was, and I'm 26. Strong praise indeed."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"This book made this tough fifth grade teacher cry like a baby. As an animal and kid lover, I couldn't put it down.

But what happens...\\""},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"Let me guess, I have to pretend I still have this pet right? Well this book is about a boy named Jack, his teacher and also his dog Sky. Jack is an average boy who hates writing poetry and would do anything to get out of it, but dose he! This story takes place all over like at school, home, and outside. This story is during the school year, Jack finally gets in to it and it is such a good ending! I think that this book was defiantly a page turner; once you start you can't put it down. This book was not at all hard to consternate on and you just have to keep going. I did connect to a character because I don't like to write poetry either. I did like the genre in the story, and it fit the book great. I also liked the style of writing with the different fonts and pictures. I the story it held my interest all the way through out the story, and surprises came out everywhere. \\"Why do I have to pretend, why can't I just make up my own pet\\" Every character left you with a cliff hanger and you did not know what they were going to say next. This book was not at all boring. During the book I had to stop and think why, what is going to happen next?

I'm a big fan of Sharon Creech, and I knew this book would be great like her other novels, like Bloomability, Walk Two Moons, Chasing Redbird, and Absolutely Normal Chaos. I loved Jack, and I really liked the way the book started out. Actually, it motivated me to try things I've never tried before. I think I'm a lot like Jack. In the beginning of 7th grade, I hated Economics class, but I grew to like it. Sharon Creech really uses words with such feeling, such expression, I awarded this book 5 stars. I'd award it more, but there's only 5 stars maximum in the rating chart. I suggest this book to anyone, even if they hate reading.

It can appeal to poetry lovers, since it is written in poems and there are several famous examples at the back. It can appeal to poetry haters, because that is exactly what the \\"author\\" of the poems, Jack, is- a boy who considers poetry for sissies. It can appeal to teachers, because it gives you some great ideas for classroom studies of poetry. It can appeal to people who are looking for a humorous, touching book that's a quick read.I have read it many times simply because it is so immensely enjoyable.Buy this now- It's cheap, and I really don't think you'll ever regret it!"},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"Love That Dog By Sharon CreechLove That Dog is an inspirational book for poetry lovers.

Intrigued by the recommendation, I picked it up at the library expecting a looooong drawn-out attempt to attract kids with poetry. Boy, was I wrong! I loved this book from the very first page. As I read, I relived all my own poetry experiences. If you were ever forced to memorize Frost as a child, I am sure you will enjoy the light-hearted commentary on the familiar \\"You come too!\\" and \\"miles to go before I sleep\\". The free verse Creech uses is charming and especially draws the reader into the book. I will definitely be using this book in my own classroom. Oh, and do not feel guilty to enjoy this book yourself.

It is about a wonderful dog, a wonderful teacher, a wonderful poet, and above all, a wonderful boy who is coping with a tragedy. Be forewarned--this one is a tearjerker.I loved the poems selected by the teacher to share with her class. I was an English major in college, and I am familiar with all of the poems. Yet I loved reading an elementary student's reaction to them. It's true: why does so much depend on the red wheelbarrow? So much more depends on the blue car splattered with mud racing down the road with miles to go before he sleeps, in such a hurry. At least to Sky, and to Jack.My dog was hit and killed by a car last year. I was reading this book out loud to my husband and had to stop in a few places. Jack's description of the day that Sky got killed made my heart ache. But the poetry helps Jack remember the good times he had with Sky, and ease the pain of Sky's death.

I don't want to spoil much more than that, but the deceptively simple language and free-verse slowly reveals the secrets behind this child's own poetry. It's like slowly unwrapping one present to only find another present within, and just keep unwrapping layers and layers of exciting and hidden meanings.Children of all ages will enjoy this book, although it will take some maturity to fully comprehend what is going on. I'd say 6-8 (depending on the child) and up. It's really powerful and even the older ones will like it, too. A Good introduction to poetry.The only bad thing about this book is it's length. It's a tad short (less than a hundred pages, and none of them are filled with words). It can easily be read within an hour, a nice afternoon read.

I've been reading this book to elementary school kids since it was first published in 2001 for that very reason. Powerful because with each passing day recorded by Jack, you experience the power of descriptive prose at it's simplest, yet emotional best. It draws you in slowly and surely through the hesitant unintentional prose of young Jack. Encouraged by his teacher Mrs. Stretchberry (surely a metaphor for stretching one's mind and talents), Jack begins to apply lessons learned from the famous works of Robert Frost, William Blake, and Valerie Worth to his own writings.As Jack grows in confidence and skill, our own understanding of poetry as story telling is enhanced. \`Love That Dog' is an excellent read aloud book, and is most successful if it's read by an adult aloud on the first reading. That way the suspense and poetic format is handled in a meaningful way. This isn't a book to read quickly through like a typical picture book. It is a short story written in prose that grows in feeling, and urgency with each page. It's a journey for Jack and for all who read and reflect upon it."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"A copy of Love the Dog used to sit on my bedside table when I was younger. It was beaten and ratty from being read so many times. I literally used to read this book under my blanket with a flashlight. It was a fantastic read when I was 8 and it's a fantastic, nostalgic read now over nine years later. This was the first book that I ever cried while reading. This was the first book of poems that I owned. This was one of the first books that opened me up to the fantastic world of books and reading and poetry and writing. Written in the point of view of Jack, a young boy forced to write in a poetry journal by his teacher, Love that Dog is an amazing tale of a child leaning to find his voice and overcoming stereotypes, such as only girls write poems. I absolutely encourage all people, young and old, to read this book. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"This is a simple, short book that is mostly composed of correspondence between a boy and his poetry teacher. It would probably help to know in advance that the referenced poems: The Red Wheelbarrow by Carlos Williams, Stopping by the Woods on a Snowy Evening by Robert Frost, (the first stanza of) The Tiger by William Blake, Dog by Valerie Worth, Pasture by Robert Frost, Street Music by Arnold Adoff, The Apple by S.C. Rigg, and (the first stanza of) Love That Boy by Walter Dean Myers are included in the back.As the boy experiments with poetry writing and is exposed to a variety of poems (specifically those listed above), he gains confidence in his own abilities and ultimately is able to compose a poem about his dog's demise. Additionally, he writes another, inspired by Water Dean Myers, which shares its title with the book. Love That Dog is a cute, clever book that takes a unique approach to poetry. Also good: Polkabats and Octopus Slacks by Calef Brown, and pretty much anything by Jack Prelutsky."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"Love That Dog\\" written by Sharon Creech takes place in Room 105- Miss.Stretchberry's class.

When I read this part I was so happy that he actually wrote it.From this book I realize writers do have time to visit people and they are never to busy that they cant make time to ever see you.

At first the works his teacher, Miss Stretchberry, introduces make little sense to him. &quot;Why doesn't the person just/keep going if he's got/so many miles to go/before he sleeps?&quot; Eventually, the poetry seductively captures him, and he writes about William Blake's, The Tiger: &quot;I am sorry to say/I did not really understand/the tiger tiger burning bright poem/but at least it sounded good/in my ears./Some of the tiger sounds/are still in my ears/like drums/beat-beat-beating.&quot; When Miss Stretchberry reads Walter Dean Myers', Love That Boy, it all comes together, and Jack is finally hooked, &quot;I copied that BEST poem/and hung it on my/bedroom wall/right over my bed/where I can/see it when I'm/lying/down.&quot; As the story continues, he begins to open up, write his own verse, and with the guidance of his teacher and inspiration of his new favorite poet, finally puts down on paper the poem that's been inside of him all along just waiting to come out; the story of his beloved dog, Sky, who was hit by a car..... Newberry Award Winner, Sharon Creech, has outdone herself with this marvelously sensitive, sometimes poignant, often amusing little masterpiece.

Young and old, alike will be entranced as they begin this wonderful journey with Jack on his lifelong adventure with the love of words.

In September, Jack, the child narrator in Miss Stretchberry's Room 105, can't understand an unnamed \\"poem about/the red wheelbarrow/and the white chickens\\" (William Carlos Williams). In October, a few pages later, he fails to grasp \\"the tiger tiger burning bright poem/but at least it sounded good in my ears\\" (William Blake). By January, he's concluded that \\"Mr. Robert Frost/ who wrote/about the pasture/ was also the one/ who wrote about/ those snowy woods/ and the miles to go/ before he sleeps---well!\\"That is also the month Jack writes a poem about his family's trip to the dog pound. There, he chose from among \\"big and small/ fat and skinny/ some of them/ hiding in the corner/ but most of them bark-bark-barking and/ jumping up against the wire cage\\" a yellow dog standing \\"with his paws curled around the wire/and his long red tongue/ hanging out\\".By March, Jack has waxed enthusiastic about a poem by \\"Mr. Walter Dean Myers/ the best best BEST/ poem/ever.\\" He has even related it to his experience with the yellow dog, whom he named Sky. In April, Jack writes to Mr. Walter Dean Myers. And in May the poet agrees to visit the school. As Mr. Walter Dean Myers reads poems to the class on June 1, Jack finds \\"All of my blood/in my veins/ was bubbling/and all of the thoughts/ in my head/ were buzzing.\\" That's about how it feels to love a poem.Several other important details make this book a keeper--not least, what happened to Jack's dog, and his closing poem.At the end, Creech shares the eight poems to which she refers throughout: William Carlos Williams' \\"Red Wheelbarrow,\\" Robert Frost's \\"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\\" and \\"The Pasture,\\" William Blake's \\"Tiger,\\" Valerie Worth's \\"dog,\\" Arnold Adoff's \\"Street Music,\\" S.C. Rigg's \\"The Apple,\\" and Walter Dean Myers' \\"Love That Boy.\\"If you want children to love poems, just give them this one. Alyssa A. Lappen"},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"A wonderful story told in free verse and in journal format. As a teacher, I cannot think of a more valuable tool for modeling how to write poetry, a response journal, and elements of a story. The story evolves in a series of short, pithy poems written by Jake as he responds to his teacher's attempts to introduce a love of poetry and elicit more information in his responses. It is told completely in Jake's words, although you can easily infer the teacher's comments. I have to admit this is my favorite book that I have read this summer (over 75) and can't wait to use it in class. An extra treat is the inclusion of an appendix containing most of the poems mentioned in the story."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"I fell hard for this book. I love poetry, I love my dogs, I love my kids, who, like Jack in this book, are developing a sensitivity to language. I'm also a huge fan of Karen Hesse's _Out of the Dust_, not only because it tells a meaningful, heartfelt story, but also because it's told in blank verse. If children are read and fall as hard as I did for _Love That Dog_, I and my fellow college and university English teachers will not have a problem once the kids make it to higher education. They'll already love poetry."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"I was delighted to discover this book and have thoroughly enjoyed sharing it with my students as well as my own children. LOVE THAT DOG is a delicious way to introduce young readers to free verse poetry...However, in reading this book we are to believe that the poems are written by a young elementary student. In all honesty, Jack's attempts read very much like prose that is simply rearranged on the page with poetry-like line breaks. Students I have worked with through the years are capable of so much more!So, while I LOVE this book and will continue to use it in my classroom, I certainly don't intend to neglect other poetry books that have delighted and inspired my young creative writers such as: ALL THE SMALL POEMS by Valerie Worth and LITTLE DOG POEMS by Kristine O'Connell George. LITTLE DOG POEMS, in combination with LOVE THAT DOG, is particularly powerful since these short poems are not only about a much-loved dog, but are also written in a first-person child's voice.Worth, George, and other many other poets are needed in the &quot;mix&quot; to help young writers and readers understand that poetry is not *just* short lines and a lot of white space -- but that poetry is also about metaphor, imagery, and some of the amazing and surprising connections that can be made through lanaguage when we write poetry."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"Sharon Creech, a well known and amazing author, who's written many books. Love That Dog, I believe is one of her best! A touching book about a boy who rebels on poems for school. When I saw the book it was only made up of poems and I was not interested, but reading other Sharon Creech books, Chasing Redbird, Bloomability (etc.) I thought I should give it a try. What a good choice! The book is a heat-warming story of a boy and his love of his dog. I believe it to be one of Mrs. Creech's best!"},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"Love that Dog is about a boy named Jack who had a dog that died, and now he is writing in his poem journal, but he believes that poetry is not for boys. Yeah, right. He writes some beginner's poetry but they are inspired by other professional poetry, and he gets better and more confident at writing poetry throughout the book. He writes poems inspired by the works of Robert Frost, Arnold Adoff and many more.This is a book of humor and poetry, similar to Amelia's Notebook and a Shel Silverstein book combined. The author writes this way because emotions are better expressed in poetry than in prose. It shows young writers how to get ideas inspired by another author. It is a good book for people who like letter books where the whole book is letters. It is for young readers who like poetry. This is a very good book by a very good author."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"A must have to share with kids! It is about a fifth grade boy who detests writing, mostly poems. Creech does an amazing job of taking you through a diary of the boys writing journal and his thoughts that coincidently turn into superb poetry. He thinks poetry is for girls but realizes that poetry doesn't have to rhyme and more importantly need not be only for girls. Very inspirational for students' writing and heart felt as the boy deals with his feelings about a dog he sees at the pound."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"If you are like me and you don't like to write you will like to write after you read this book. Love That Dog is a good book because I could relate to a boy named Jack didn't like to write and I didn't either. After he found an inspiration and I did too. He wrote a poem about his dog and I wrote a long story about my dogs. That's why I think this a good book!"},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"When I first looked at this book I thought it was not going to be a book that's fun but I was wrong.

It refers to classic poems I have studied, and is humorous about poetry in general. I became rather attached to the main character and his dog, and was amazed at the pefect balance of emotion, humor, and excellent writing in this short book. I would recommend it to anyone, any day."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"I purchased this book for my 3rd-grade struggling reader. It's a great read aloud book for her -- few words to a page and lovely rythmic prose. The format allows her to feel like she's making progress (in progresssing quickly through the book) and encourages her to stop if she comes across something she doesn't understand. She is completely engaged in the story and has a budding interest in poetry. I can't recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"LOVE THAT DOG By Sharon Creech is a touching story of a boy who doesn't like poetry. \\"I don't want to because boys don't write poetry. Girls do.\\" This book is written in a diary form and shows how Jack grows and learns to like poetry. He is inspired by his teacher, famous authors/poets and the love he has for his dog. As he begins to write poetry he is not too sure of himself because his words don't rhyme. After reading poems by famous authors he realizes they don't have to rhyme and becomes more confident and allows the teacher to post his poems on the bulletin board. At first his poems are anonymous then as he becomes more confident he adds his name and recieves many compliments from his classmates. Jack is particulary inspired by Walter Dean Myers and writes him a letter asking him to visit his school. Can someone that famous take the time to visit Jack's school?"},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"Love That DogLove that dog is a book all about poems. Well, to be honest this book wasn't that a great book. Every poem doesn't go together like a regular chapter/story book.

I really recommend you not read this book unless you like mixed up poems.

I was transfixed, and read it myself. A wonderful introduction to poetry, told in a unique way that teaches the essence of poetry through the attempts of a kid to write some as part of a class assignment.

I don't really like poetry. But after only two or three pages I was hooked. This isn't like your ordinary poetry book.

I also wanted to tell you that I will think that you be sad in the end of the boook.

Brain's empty\\". It's also funny because Jack didn't want to write poems because he said, \\"Boys don't write poems. Girls do!\\" Then when his class read \\"The Red Wheelbarrow\\" by William Carlos Williams, he wrote a poem and he didn't like it. It was about a blue car. After awhile, when he writes more and more poems, he starts getting confidence in his poems. He starts putting his name on the poems he liked. Before, he would always put \\"anonymous\\" on his poems because he didn't want to be teased by the other kids. When Jack wrote a poem about a blue car, it goes like this:So much dependsUponA blue carSplattered with mudSpeeding down the road.Then his teacher asked if she could put the two Blue car poems on the board, but he said not to put his name on them. So his teacher put anonymous, \\"What does anonymous mean?\\" said Jack confused. After awhile he wrote a poem about his dog named Sky. Unfortunately his dog died because of the blue car splattered with mud hit Jack's dog, Sky. Sky was lying on the floor, he closed his eyes, and he never opened them again. So that's why Jack didn't want to write about a pet (Sky) because he still didn't accept that he was dead.When Jack wrote the poem about his dog Sky, the teacher asked if she could put the poem on the board. Jack said it might make the class sad. Jack said, \\"to cheer them up you can bring some of those brownies you make, the chocolate ones that are so good\\". When his class read LOVE THAT BOY by Walter Dean Myers he was saying that the poem is the best poem ever. Jack decides to write a letter to the author of LOVE THAT BOY. After a couple of days Mr. Walter Dean Myers went to visit his buddy in Jack's town. He decides to go to Jack's school. Jack starts to say that he has never seen someone speak that way like the author did. A few days later he was inspired by Walter Dean Myers to write LOVE THAT DOG. It went like this:Love that dogLike a bird loves to flyI said I love that dogLike a bird loves to flyLove to call him in the morningLove to call him\\"Hey there, Sky!\\""},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"I think this book is great.

The main idea was how the dog was and the boy Jack the book described them about how they look and how the boy took care of Sky.I think this book was interesting because what it talk about a blue car and a yellow dog.

Normally I would enjoy that type of story, but the poetry was a little dry. The reason I think that is because when I was reading the book I constontly thought of ways to say things that would make the story more interesting without changeing the plotline. If you were to read this book, the story is about a boy who hates poetry. Later his teacher teaches him to enjoy poetry. If you would like to read a book in the format in poetry I would reccomend Witness, by Walter Dean Myers."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"~*LOVE THAT DOG*~Love that dog is about poems, and only poems.

I think that if the poems were about dogs then I might have read it?Another things that I thought was that it is are easy to read because it only had 100 pages. Some other things I know about the book is that it switches from poems to poems. I am just trying to let you know that this book is about poems.

The author ruins the fun of the book because the dog dies. OK, I know loss is part of life, but there is such a trend today to make everything so \\"realistic\\" that warm stories are not warm any more and peaceful thoughts (especially if reading at beadtime) are ruined, that readers should be aware that this book may be disappointing to young children. I loved the idea that it is written very much in poem - good poem. But won't share it. What a shame the author did not think more about this, or if she did, that she decided she needed to include a grisly accident, sadness, and the dog's death in the mix."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"The title made us curious about when a dog would appear in the story, because Jack seems to write about nothing but poetry. He even wrote in his journal to his teacher like he was writing poems. He really didn't like poetry, because he thought it was too hard to understand, and it was just for girls, but the teacher made him write poetry anyway. He didn't want the teacher to tell who he was, because he wrote about his feelings. We liked the way he sometimes wrote poems in a certain shape. Some of our boys didn't like the book, because like Jack, they think they don't like poetry. Because the majority of us loved it, we decided to give Love That Dog five stars."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"Jack did not like poetry, because he thought it was for girls, and he didn't understand it. When the teacher made him write poetry, he wanted to be anonymous. Will writing more poems make Jack learn to like poetry? We liked the way Jack wrote his journal entries like they were poems. Sometimes he made the poems in different shapes. The short lines made it easy to read. Jack said things in a funny way, but sometimes he made us sad. We are giving the book five stars, because it made us feel happy and sad all at the same time."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"In the beginning Jack didn't like poetry, and he didn't want to write poetry, because he thought poetry was for girls. You may wonder if he ever learned to like poetry! This book is written to look like poetry, but the words are actually written in a journal to Jack's teacher.

Though reluctant at first to learn, he slowly begins to realize how much he enjoys writing in prose poem.I was truly touched by this book. It made laugh, it made me cry, it made me think a little differently. Everyone in my family has now read it (or had it read to them), and they all have had the same reaction. It may say for ages 8-12, but it's the type of book everyone will enjoy.Jack has a little bit of everyone in him, making his feelings easy to understand and laugh with and symphasize with.

As the year progresses, Jack learns to write poetry, to love other authors' poetry, to accept his feelings and memories and to open his heart to people who care about him.I strongly advise you to read this book twice: yes, finish it, then go right back to the beginning and read it again immediately.

But he is inspired by various poets especially Walter Dean Myers. Jack asked Mr. Myers to show the school his remarkable talent as a poet. So, throughout the story jack is preparing for this special visit.During this tale you learn about poetry along with jack.

His teacher reads many poems by different poets throughout the year; eventually, Jack reads a poem by Mr. Walter Dean Myers that inspires him, and he learns to express his feelings about his beloved dog Sky.Love That Dog is an inspirational book because it teaches you that it's okay to write poetry about how you feel. Young adults who want to explain their emotions and thoughts can read this book and be inspired, just like Jack. Don't tell yourself that you can't do something (like write a poem) until you actually try.This poetry book is better than The Dream Keeper by Langston Hughes and is as good as Whisper and Shout edited by Patrice Vecchione.

Reluctant readers will gladly pick it up to read. (It's short, but it's jam-packed with good stuff!) Second, the main character, who feels he's incapable of writing poetry, uses poetry to journal his learning of poetry! (The irony!) Kids who don't think they can write poetry can be encouraged from this. Teachers can use this book as a springboard to poetry. And finally, Love That Dog is simply a touching story. It made me cry. I think I might go read it again."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"This is a wonderful introduction to writing poetry for children, especially those who feel reluctant. The poems Jack responds to in his journal are included in the back of the book, which makes this an excellent teaching tool."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"This book, told entirely in free verse, from the point of view of a grade-school boy named Jack, is on the surface about how his teacher, Miss Stretchberry, introduces the whole class to poetry and asks them to write a poem. Each day, it seems. Jack resists, at first saying that poetry is for girls, not boys. Jack's voice is wonderful: he asks, he questions, he points out contradictions, and, slowly, he reveals his feelings. All in wonderful, simple yet deep free verse. When the class is asked to write a poem about a pet they've had, Jack resists writing about his dog. It's too painful. But slowly, through poetry, he reveals how much he loved his dog and what happened to it. And doing so helps Jack cope with his loss.This is a book to be read and enjoyed again and again: you'll see and appreciate different things with each reading. And, you will especially appreciate teachers who introduce children to poetry."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"i think that it was an amazing book. i like how it was written as a poem. it was happy and sad. and the chapter /poem My Sky was just sooooooo sad. =) it would make me feel so sad if that was my dog.i am 8 years old."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"I read this once before, loved it then, love it now. It's definitely not the best of Sharon Creech (and if you're interested in that, definitely check out Absolutely Normal Chaos), but it's really good writing. The one thing that bothers me though is the boy's voice. His actions are those of a little boy, as are his emotions, but his words...they make me wonder. Is there any chance he has a mental disorder? I don't know any children who think/speak like that. They're enthusiastic, sure, but this is a bit...odd. I wish I knew this for sure, it'd help me understand the story more (and wow, how cool would it be if he did?!) but still, great idea. It's just, I don't think a child would be so...blase about the death of the dog. He's a bit obsessed, but at the same time, it's just like he's casually telling a story. I'm not sure what to think. It almost feels like the dog part is an story she added in upon realizing the book wasn't long enough. I don't see it connecting to anything else, it just floats out there awkwardly. The poetry reminds me of things written by Ellen Hopkins (not nearly as depressing, but the style is nearly identical). I love the unintentional (on Jack's part, probably intentional on Sharon's part) repetition of all those great classic poems, and Jack's childish take on them. Yes, that's EXACTLY how a child thinks of poetry. [And hey, maybe not even a child. I mean, what the heck is the DEAL with that stupid red wheelbarrow, right?!] Absolutely BRILLIANT."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"It's a charming, delightful, true book about 10 yo boys and poetry.

It's so loving and light filled. It's a delightful book and a real treasure. We're keeping it!"},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"The book that I read was, Love That Dog, by Sharon Creech. This book is about a school class that is learning about poems. There is a student named jack, and he loves to write poetry. But gets embarrassed about it, so he never puts his name on any of his papers. But then Jack realizes that his writing is actually neatly organized poetry and that best poems come from the heart and soul. A wonderful poetic author, Dr. Walter Dean Myers, fascinates Jack. Jack becomes a fan, and eventually meets Walter Dean Myers and becomes inspired. Love That Dog was not my favorite book, but still was neatly written. It was thought out and was appropriate for the age group. In Love That Dog there was only one main character, which made it easier to follow through the story. In my opinion that is one of the main criteria I look for in a book. The book had easy to follow vocabulary, which also made it easier to read. It also made sense as the book went on, not confusing at all. I felt that I understood the book, which was needed when I read the book."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"love that dog is about a boy that says he can't write poems, but when his writing is in his jounel and his teacher is writing back.

Surprising and lovely and sad. She awes me."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"Love That Dog is a powerful story about a young boy named Jack. The format of the story was relatively unusual; it was a journal-type book. It begins with Jack explaining how he believes that boys do not write poetry, only girls do. \\"I tried. Can't do it. Brain's empty.\\" In the following few days, his teacher shares poetry with the class. In his journal, Jack expresses his confusion with the meaning of these poems. Using inner feelings and past experiences, Jack \\"reads between the lines\\" and finds the deeper meanings within the poems. He then applies his experiences to these meanings and derives his own, unique values. Over time, he uses his inner feelings and personal connections to make the poems have their own unique meaning to himself. His teacher, Ms. Stretchberry, encourages him to compose his own poetry. He gives it to her, asking not to put his name on it and not to put it on the class bulletin board. He began to write more and more poems. The more comfortable he becomes with his writing, the less timid he becomes with the exposure of his poetry to his classmates.One of the poems Jack composes was inspired by a poem written by Walter Dean Myers, which his teacher read in class. It was a poem that used many of Walter Dean Myers' words, which Jack thought would make Mr. Myers upset. Therefore, he asked his teacher to hide it so no one, including Walter Dean Myers, would be able to see it. This poem sparked Jack's strong ability, talent, and true love for poetry. Jack became so interested in Walter Dean Myers and his works that he wrote a letter to Mr. Myers articulating Jack's admiration and invited Mr. Myers to visit his school. Ms. Stretchberry warns Jack that it may take months for Walter Dean Myers to respond, if he ever responds at all. With Jack's great patience, his much-anticipated response arrived in the mail. Walter Dean Myers was coming \\"to our city, to our school, to our class.\\" Jack was so excited to see Walter Dean Myers, and the book's powerful ending was the icing on the cake!If you are one who enjoys finding the deeper meaning in things, you must read this book. This boy's love, creativity, graciousness, and inspiration truly drove the emotions. I highly recommend this book to readers who appreciate powerful words and deep meanings. I also recommend it to those who appreciate poetry or who want inspiration or the sudden desire to write poetry. This book delivered a meaningful message and I strongly recommend it to readers of any age. After reading it, one will \\"love poetry like a bird loves to fly!\\""},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"Just a few days ago, I went to school to listen to the second-graders read. My son had picked up \\"Love that Dog\\" on the recommendation of a friend. As he read the book aloud, I became intrigued. That afternoon, as I drove my son home from school, he shared a passage from the book that was particularly poignant. I was hooked. After he finished, I asked him if I could borrow the book myself. He graciously allowed me the chance to read it despite his misgivings that I would not return the book before the library due date.This is a beautiful book. It's about poetry and love. It's written like a journal for an elementary school class. It is told from the perspective of a boy struggling with writing, poetry and his love for his dog. As the book continues, the boy finds his voice through the poetry that the teacher assigns. Ultimately, the book is about the power of poetry. Reflecting upon the language and imagery of William Blake, Robert Frost, or Walter Dean Myers, the young boy shares his own imagery and his own life. Good poetry (especially divine poetry) reads us rather than we read it. It frees us to live and to love.I highly recommend this book for all ages."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"Love That Dog is a lighthearted book about a boy learning to write poetry. THe boy is very timid about his poems. He writes them anonymously. His teacher posts them on the board which then encourages other students to start writing poems. The boy loves the poet Walter Dean Myers. He writes a poem that is similar to the poem by Mr. Myers. His poem is about his dog Sky who got run over. He then writes a letter to the poet to see if he will come to their school. The poet agrees to come. He spends the day with the boy's class. At the end of the day the boy gives his poem that was inspired by Mr. Walter Dean Myers to Mr. Myers.This book is something special. I read it in about 45 minutes. But it left an impression on my heart. It's one of those books that makes you want to cry but you don't exactly know why. It touches the timid child within all of us. The book really made me think about my teachers who pushed me to try something new. This young boy found a place for his grief in his poetry. I would suggest all adults read this, and all students. It makes poetry come alive and mean something for children. If I teach fourth grade I will definitely use this book in my classroom."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"This book is for anyone not just kids - I picked it up to gauge the reading level for my daughter (she likes everything about dogs) and I just couldn't put it down.Its hard to describe without giving the story away but I love the device of having the child's response to a comment from his teacher - it really left a lasting impact on me."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"If you think poems are for girls? Well think again! You should read Love that dog by Sharon Creech of a fiction fable story about Jack. He thinks poems are for girls. So Miss. Strechberry is on a mission to explain Jack that poems are for everybody.This book is a bit funny, but that's my opinion. I choose this book because I \\"had\\" a dog. His name is the same as Jacks dog, sky.Do you know any poets? Well, you will meet more than 5 poets in this book. They are real poets. One of them, Jack meets and became his favorite poet. His name is Mr. Walter dean Myers.I feel bad that Jack lives at the edge of a BIG city. Nobody cares about each and other. Except the people who lives there. Mostly the drivers who live around the middle of the city.When I read this book, I found a connection from Love that dog to heartbeat by the same author, Sharon Creech. I don't really understand poems.Every time it mentions a new poet, you should read the last 10 page.This is a great book to read! It teaches you a lesson. If you have problems with poems, read LOVE THAT DOG!"},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"Jack has a really hard time with poetry.

Readers will be reminded of the poems they learned to love in elementary school."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"Jack said, \\"I don't want to because boys don't write poetry. Girls do. I tried. Can't do it. Brain's empty.\\" The story was mostly about Jack and his dog. His dog got killed but he did not tell us that. My classmates and I had to figure it out. Jack was talking about a blue car and a dog that died, but when we were reading it, it sounded like his dog was alive and that was Jack's favorite dog.\\"Love that dog,Like a bird loves to flyI said I love that flyLike a rabbit loves to flyLove to call him in the morningLove to call him\`Hey there, Sky!'That's the dog that died from the blue car. When my classmates and I read it, it sounded like his dog was dead, but no, that didn't happen. His dog got killed from the muddy blue car on the road. That's what Jack's dog got killed from. There's a poem in the book and it starts like this:Blue car, blue car shining brightIn the darkness of the night:Who could see you speeding byLike a comet in the sky.I could see you in the night,Blue car, blue car, shining bright.I could see you speeding byLike a comet in the skyWhen it was Mr. Walter Dean Myers's day at the school Jack said, \\"Don't put my name on the board yet because I don't want Mr. Walter Dean Myers to know that I copied some of his words.\\" The little boy liked some of his words; that's why he copied. Mr. Walter Dean Myers wouldn't get mad because he copied. He would feel happy that somebody likes his poem."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"I thought this book was boring but at the same time funny, too. It was boring to me because Jack kept saying the same thing over and over, like he would read a poem and copy it from the same words. Well, I know it's not bad copying and writing the same words with different meanings, but still it gets annoying hearing the same thing over. Another thing that I didn't understand was the poem about \\"The Red Wheelbarrow.\\" That sure confused me until my teacher explained it to me. The funny part was when he was worrying too much and saying all this stuff about what if author Walter Dean Myers doesn't come to his school and visit him. But he did come to visit him. That was funny when he said in a poem,\\"I tried.Can't do it.Brain's empty.\\"because he did not even try to do it. The sad part that sure got to me was when he talked about how the car killed his dog Sky and what he was like \\"when he was still alive in his poems\\". Another thing was that Jack sure was crazy because he didn't want to recognize that boys also write poems as well as girls do. Jack also didn't recognize how talented his poems were until his friends told him that they were great. So from then on he wrote his name on his poems. It was very clever of Sharon Creech putting famous poems that other people wrote in her book. I think the book was okay to read."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"LOVETHATBOOKSharon CreechisanamazingauthorI L O V ET H EM A N YD I F F E R E N TS T Y L E SO FP O E T R YS H EI L L U S T R A T E SwithherwordsReading, reading this great bookoh, my eyes just have to look- this poem inspired by Sharon Creech(if you read the book you will \\"get\\" my review - it makes PERFECT sense)"},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"In poetry form this book explores what happenswhen a teacher introduces poetry to a young boyin her class.

Love That Dog is a delightful and unusual book about a boy and his dog. An incident with the dog inspires his owner to unwittingly create poems. How does that happen? That is the story.Sharon Creech, the author of this book, as well as the Newbery Medal winner Walk Two Moons, The Wanderer, and Chasing Redbird, was a high school English and writing teacher for fifteen years. Creech decided to write Love That Dog when a high school writing class arrived with a built-in dread of poetry. This story is based on the reactions of her students to writing poetry. Creech became mesmerized with the rhythms and the way a poet could put so much feeling into so few words when she had a teacher who made poetry exciting. She wrote Love That Dog to demonstrate how enjoyable poetry can be.The idea for her first book evolved from a made up story for a class. \\"I started by telling my class a short story that just kept getting longer and longer, until I realized I was hooked on it, and I continued to write novels thereafter,\\" said Creech at an interview with Bookwire. \\"I have written stories for as long as I can remember.\\"This novel has no illustrations, but the shape of the paragraphs and the creative placement of the poemson the page substitute for even the most detailed drawings.Why do you wantto type up what I wroteabout readingthe small poems?The reader must observe the inter-esting shapes to really savor the story.Jack, who despises poetry, even-tually makes a turnabout as he slowly reveals the story of his dog Sky, through his poems.If you are a dog lover, like po-etry, or even if you don't, this is the book for you! A fast, delightful read. A book you don't want to pass by!"},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"Many students are leery of poetry. They often don't \\"get\\" the meaning the teacher thinks is obvious. They don't understand why it doesn't all rhyme. They are unsure of how to read it and struggle to find the cadence of the poem. Jack, the narrator of Love that Dog, feels all of these emotions and relates them to the reader in a way only straight-shooting boys can do. He begins the novel by writing \\"I don't want to/ because boys/ don't write poetry./ Girls do.\\" (Creech 1) in what appears to be a reading/writing journal for class. Through the book, Jack grows as a reader and a write, often sharing insightful reflection to the poems his teacher Miss. Stretchberry reads to the class.The beauty of this capturing tale of free verse is the honest, reflective voice of a boy who is hurting from the loss of his dog, Sky. From the first page, the reader feels for Jack, who is reluctant to even attempt to write a poem. His honesty epitomizes how many students feel about writing poetry when he says, \\"Then any words/ can be a poem./ You've just got to/ make/ short/ lines\\" (Creech 3). Jack's simple words at the beginning grow to elaborate poems, including one shaped to look like his dog, that the teacher is able to share with the class. (Jack insists that they be kept anonymous.) By the middle of the of the book, the boy who at first thought he couldn't write a poem and that poems didn't make sense later shares that his brain was \\"pop-pop-popping\\" (Creech 35) as he read poems and began to write his own. At the end of the book, Jack shares what he couldn't before: the story of his own dog's death. Poetry opened a world up for Jack, and it can for other students.This gripping tale shares a lesson for many people. For students, it shows how poetry should be written to the beat of the writer's heart, no matter what form that may be. For teachers, it shows how poetry should be shared and celebrated as Jack's teacher hung up poems by her students and encouraged Jack to write Walter Dean Myers. (Also, the book is set up as an interactive journal that the teacher read regularly, which fosters a sense of security for the students to write openly.) And for the pleasure reader, it is a heartwarming reminder of the loss of a pet and those emotions that come with it.The first poem (quoted above) is a terrific way to start this book although I believe the whole book is one to be shared with students. This book would serve well as a book club book or a literature circle book. It's a book to be shared, discussed, and used as a springboard for writing. One poem taken and read alone doesn't do this wonderful book justice.Although I read this book with the intention of reviewing it for class, this book gripped my heart. As I type this review, I am sitting near my father as he fights his last battle with cancer. This book reminds us of the loss of ones we love. The poem by Walter Dean Myers and then by Jack make me think of my dad, and I could replace it with \\"Love that Dad.\\"Love that BoyBy Walter Dean MyersLove that Boy,Like a rabbit loves to runI said I love that boyLike a rabbit loves to runLove to call him in the morningLove to call him\\"Hey there, son!\\"Love that DogInspired by Walter Dean MyersBy JackLove that dog,Like a bird loves to flyI said I love that dogLike a bird loves to flyLove to call him in the morningLove to call him\\"Hey there, Sky!\\"Love that DadInspired by Walter Dean Myers and JackBy LauraLove that Dad,Like a book loves wordsI said I love that DadLike a book loves wordsLove to call him in the morningLove to call him\\"Hey there, Dad!\\""},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"This has a poem for a book .

In the end, his feelings for poetry are changed, but you'll have to read the book to find out what happens!!Hannah age 8"},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"this little book by sharon creech fascinated me since i first saw it on barbara's kitchen table over a month ago. it turns out, it was a breakfast book club selection for country club elementary school and their innovative literacy program. i couldn't take it with me then, but today she relented.she leads the third grade section of the early morning book club, and told me how the session had gone. kids sitting in a circle, she started the morning by asking them to simply say \\"liked it/didn't like it\\" as a kind of vote to kick things off. they got all the way around the circle with kids saying \\"didn't like it\\" \`til they got to barbara and carlie who made it clear how much they LOVED it. and then they told the kids why. and their why, of course, related to the pure joy of the slow awakening of the protagonist as he learned to let himself write. once this story was told, all the former \\"didn't like it\\"s were able to say, \\"oh, now i understand it. when you put it like that, i like it too\\" and barbara was able to say, \\"that's the miracle of a good book club.\\" and the kids were able to go back to school a bit more in love with reading and the community of each other and the possibilities brought to light by talking about the book.and this little book treasure is a spectacular bit of inspiration for teachers, writers, poets, students of poetry and lovers of dogs everywhere. the moving construction of the story, with creech sharing only the student's one sided series of responses to an imagined teacher's encouragement, is a brilliant and gentle opening for reader and protagonist. the student poet's reluctance to write poetry, admit his writing was poetry, acknowledge his authorship, allow himself the inspiration of his predecessors, and finally tell his whole, painful, beautiful truth is such a profoundly moving journey that it brought tears to my eyes half a dozen times through the quick read of the book.i was especially moved by the young poet's letter to the published one. i imagined what it must feel like to receive such a letter and respond to such a heartfelt request. i imagined the joy of receiving the gift of having the author show up at the kind invitation of a young student who, so obviously, loved him. i thought of the radical act of transformation that happens accidently when the poet shows up, speaks his moving words in his own voice, with the precision of meaning conveyed through his own inflection, and the student hearing his reader's joy from the mouth of it's maker. i remember being in the audience when nzotke shange, alice walker, rachel rosenthal, maya angelou, deena metzger, and other lesser known goddesses spoke their poetry magic to my reader's ears in front of my devoted reader's eyes. this radical act of showing up is always a miracle with the power to alter life trajectories for those heaven has sent to their listening crowd. i felt this miracle happen for jack, in miss stretchberry's classroom, where mr. walter dean myers appeared one immortal day.of course the unsung, unspoken hero of the story is miss stretchberry--for her innovative approach to teaching poetry, inspiring young writers and making generous and effective use of her typing skills, bulletin board and various colored construction paper. as always, i am captivated by the profound impact of the least well paid professionals among us, and count their work as the work of angels on this earth. certainly, jack is invited into a wider world of self expression, with a little side dish of healing, offered by his relationship to the poetic pieces introduced by his teacher and the kind way he is encouraged. jack, who seems to be a clear minded and definite child, is certainly not shy to say how he wants things. he stands up to his teacher and takes her suggestions head on. he decides if and when he will follow her lead. oh, to have such a student--what a dream! and to know what to do with a child like this--to guide him out of his anonymity and fear and into the bright light of his truest truth telling--to be a teacher of this caliber, with this effect on a single student, wouldn't this be the most rewarding professional endeavor imaginable?and so, this book gets all the thumbs up of an overcrowded classroom full of the future. this book is a keeper, a great gift, a joy filled and moving read."},{"Title":"Love That Dog","review":"I almost died of boredom.

She is recovering from a nervous breakdown. Four years earlier, her husband and daughter were killed by a drunk driver. She has still not recovered.Grant Wilcox is a forester. He has just settled in Lane, Texas, bought timber land, and when he and Kelly meet they are instantly attracted. Neither one wants a commitment. She has every intention of going back to Houston and he plans on staying in Lane.At first, Kelly is a bit hard to like and this is because she is almost condescending to Grant, she views him as one of the local yokels. As she spends time with him, her ideas about small town life change, however she misses her life in Houston.Grant is at times macho but knows how to be sensitive too. He is not afraid to say he is sorry. Kelly seems afraid to embrace life to its fullest.I wish I could give this more than 2 stars. The ingredients were there for a satisfying story but somehow the characters never really brought their A game. Neither one communicates their feelings well. Grant is better at it than Kelly who is terrible at reading between the lines. Furthermore Kelly can be snippy, she is quick to put Grant in his place even when he doesn't deserve it. I would have liked to see more emotional depth to Kelly, especially her feelings over the loss of her family.Grant was a loner. He had a romantic relationship in his past but the reader never really knows what went wrong. How did it affect him? What was this mystery woman like?

In line with the liturgical calendar, each day's listings offer the readings for that day, a brief kid-friendly prayer, and a reference point to the Catchism of the Catholic Church. There is a one word theme for each day and the brief prayers are perfect for school or home use. One word of note - the Catechetical references are not written out in the book. Readers are given a reference number and invited to do further research in the actual Catechism.In my family, we pray each day on the way to school.

It started off slow...I almost put it aside. But boy does the story begin to build. As I read it, I started to actually feel the sense of panic that was overtaking everyone in Saigon and South Vietnam as the collapse of the government appeared suddenly to be around the corner. The love interests of the the 3 main characters seemed almost prescripted...somehwat unecessary...but otherwise, I couldn't help but be fascinated by the character of the Ambassador.

Butterfield was the source of many of the myths and legends surrounding one of the most feared and reviled families in American history. It tells the story of the Girty brothers: Simon, Thomas, George, James, and John Turner. While each of these men have their own place in the history of the eastern frontier, one in particular stands out among them.Simon Girty has long been regarded by historians as a monsterous butcher and murderer. Captured by Indians with his brothers in Pennsylvania in 1756 during the French and Indian War, Simon was adopted by the Seneca tribe and learned the ways of the warrior. After being returned to the white world after the war, Girty became a scout at Fort Pitt, took part in the little known Lord Dunmore's War in 1774 with Simon Kenton, with whom he developed a great friendship, and eventually sided with the Americans during the early years of the Revolution. But in 1778, some say after witnessing one too many cruleties against the native tribes by the whites, Girty defected to the British and began a long and bloody career on the Ohio frontier, and gave birth to a black legend that would last until the present day. Girty personally inspired and led many war parties against the white settlments in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Kentucky, leading warriors into battle at Fort Henry, Blue Licks, Sandusky, St. Clair's Defeat, and Fallen Timbers. Today, he is best remembered for his part in the torture and murder of Col. William Crawford at the stake in 1782 following the Battle of the Sandusky near what is today Upper Sandusky, OH.Simon Girty, as well as his brothers, are complex and mysterious characters that have only recently been given more sympathetic views by modern historians. While it is undeniable that Simon was a cold-blooded killer, his motivations and his loyalties to a people who were being driven from their homeland bares further research. Despite being remembered as a horrible blackguard in the 19th century, he is little-known today. He is, without a doubt, one of the most important forgotten characters of early American history."},{"Title":"The Letter of Marque (Aubrey-Maturin)","review":"I don't have time for a long analysis, but these books are fantastic. I am on my second read-through of the series, and this time I am buying them as I read them. I have never been interested in the sea or ships or the military, (I used to wonder why anyone would have a painting of a ship in their house, waste of wall space), but now I have a whole new respect and admiration. Patrick O'Brien brings the English navy to life in a way that evokes feelings of pride, sympathy, horror, elation and pure heart-pounding anticipation. The contrast of the main characters, Aubrey and Maturin, is amusing sometimes, often heart-warming. The galaxy of supporting characters is rich with personalities and details. The only character I really don't like is Diana, but she does lend another facet to Stephen's persona. All in all, I highly recommend this series, they are the best historical novels I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Letter of Marque (Aubrey-Maturin)","review":"After being deprived of his rank as post captain in \\"The reverse of the medal\\" Aubrey starts a new career as a \\"letter of marque\\" (private man-of-war) is started in this book. It's the characteristic seal of the series, it's a story of efforts and success, it enforces you to have read \\"The reverse\\", and to continue with \\"The thirteen -gun salute\\". If it will be your first book in the series it won't be the last. Save you don\`t like this kinda book, then better don\`t step through its board, and keep away of such a seizing."},{"Title":"The Letter of Marque (Aubrey-Maturin)","review":"It is a bit unfair of me to say that Patrick O'Brian's \\"The Letter of Marque\\" is a \\"character-driven\\" novel. Indeed, one of the many joys of O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series is his ability to sustain and develop such compelling characters over a long series (\\"LoM\\" is the twelfth book).But while there is a fair amount of action in this novel, what distinguishes \\"LoM\\" is O'Brian's further exploration of his two heroes, Captain \\"Lucky Jack\\" Aubrey and Dr. Stephen Maturin.The novel opens with Aubrey bereft after being unfairly stripped from the lists in the Royal Navy. Unfairly charged and convicted of a financial scheme in which he played an entirely unwitting part, Aubrey has had his lifeline to the Navy cut as harshly as with a boarding axe. Now this merry captain, who used to delight in dreadful puns and baroque music, has been reduced to a cold, frightening visage. Remote, distant, joyless, Aubrey is at his lowest ebb.Thankfully, Aubrey's boon companion, Dr. Maturin, has a lifeline. Thanks to a prodigious inheritance, Maturin buys Aubrey's beloved H.M.S. Surprise and outfits her as a privateer - with the titular letter of marque. This letter essentially authorizes the Surprise to be a pirate for the British Navy. While this offers Aubrey a chance to go to sea in his favorite ship, this joy is tempered by the shame that is attached to the word \\"privateer\\" by the serving sailors of the Royal Navy. Aubrey feels this acutely.But privateer or no, the command of the Surprise offers Aubrey the chance at redemption through a heroic action . . . possibly even reinstatement to the lists! And so Aubrey leads the Surprise into various actions, including a complicated night-time raid on a French-held port to steal a ship from under French noses. O'Brian writes these scenes as only he can.But this novel is not only about Aubrey. Dr. Maturin continues to ply his intelligence trade. He also continues to struggle with his two demons - an addiction to opium and an addition to Diane Villiers, his estranged wife. Maturin has heard that Diane has fled to Sweden with the attractive Swedish colonel Jagiello after she heard (incorrectly) that Maturin was having an affair in Malta. And so Maturin heads north to confront her, and possibly Jagiello, with the truth.All of these plots allow O'Brian to explore both Aubrey's and Maturin's characters in new ways. Aubrey has had his troubles before with the law, but those were always civil matters involving nothing more than unsavory characters. Here, Aubrey is confronted with shame for the first time. Maturin also must confront his own nature, for as a man of intellect and science, he is not proud to be addicted to either a drug or a woman. And yet he is.\\"The Letter of Marque\\" may be the shortest of the Aubrey-Maturin novels so far, but there is a lot of meat on this small bone. Do not read this novel unless you have read those that come before - the characters won't make nearly as much sense. But you will be thankful once you get to this novel - it is well worth the wait."},{"Title":"The Letter of Marque (Aubrey-Maturin)","review":"Historically accurate as usual, characters come alive on the page- my knees are sore from holystoneing the deck!&#34;The letter of Marque"},{"Title":"The Letter of Marque (Aubrey-Maturin)","review":"As are the others, in this series of 21, a very well written book, interesting storyline, and melds well with the others.

So, listening to a read version is a supplementary pleasure that can follow a great read. My rating here has nothing to do with the literary quality of the work in question. The whole Aubrey-Maturin series is superb. But if you want to listen to them I recommend that youy stay away from any read by Simon Vance. He is unable to sufficiently differentiate the characters, with their diverse accents from around the world. For example, Maturin grew up in Ireland, and should therefore have a bit of an Irish accent. Vance can't do it, and offers stuffy readings that makes Jack sound like a bombastic jerk, and Stephen like a mincing prig. And in his hands, Diana sounds like a silly simpering ninny. An actor, not just a reader is required.

However, Stephen Maturin, now rich by inheritance, purchases the frigate \\"Surprise\\" and a \\"letter of Marque\\", i.e., an authorization to operate as a privateer. However, Stephen is still in the intelligence service, and the resulting missions are a mixture of intelligence collecting and profit making. The privateering goes well making Jack wealthy and popular. Later Stephen journeys to Sweden and is reconciled with his wife, Diana. In the meantime, partly as a result of the death of Jack's father, Jack acquires a seat in Parliament, and sufficient influence to be given assurance that he will soon be reinstated in the Royal Navy.COMMENTS\\"Letter of Marque\\" is a typical installment in the saga, filled with fascinating characters, battles, sea lore, and insights into early. There is virtually no mystery or suspense, but rather high adventure. Many men will wish that Stephen simply divorce and forget Diane, but of course, that's easier said than done.THE VERDICTI have lost track of how many times I have read the entire series start to finish-- somewhere between six and ten times, and I look forward to re-reading the series again and again.

His two protagonists, naval officer Jack Aubrey and surgeon/naturalist/spy Dr. Stephen Maturin, form a friendship that endures over years even though they are opposites in many ways. As they age, they mellow a little as well as advancing steadily in their respective professions.But in this story Capt. Jack has received a serious setback. He has been convicted (unjustly) of rigging a financial market and removed from the Navy List, yet Dr. Maturin buys his favorite ship, the frigate SURPRISE, which also has been rejected from the service, because she's too old and small. With semi-official help from the intelligence service run by Maturin's fellow naturalist Sir Joseph Blaine, Aubrey and Maturin set off on a mission that is also a privateering voyage in search of profitable prizes. Many of their old shipmates elect to come with them, although some of them had to desert to do so, risking hanging if caught, because they know \\"Lucky Jack Aubrey\\" will make them rich if they live to see England again."},{"Title":"The Letter of Marque (Aubrey-Maturin)","review":"A fairy tale, an elegant and fantastic posey offered to the reader after the tribulations and upheavals of \\"The Reverse of the Medal,\\" a grand apotheosis, this installment in the Aubrey/Maturin series is my very favorite.

Doctor Stephen Maturin, while still flirting with disaster with his laudanum addiction, reconciles some of his personal problems and resolves a confusing, multi-book story arc with a bang.The Letter of Marque is a fun and exciting read, though the story was not especially emotionally involving, so did not stick with me as much as thought it would.

Any fan of these books will be very pleased with this episode.However, what I like best about these novels is the friendship between the characters.

Patrick O'Brian puts you right into the minds of his curators like no other books I have read, I will have a hard time going back to read Tom Clancey and Clive Cussler, sorry guys. This is truly an action book, both on the sea and with politics."},{"Title":"The Letter of Marque (Aubrey-Maturin)","review":"Some critics have referred to the Aubrey/Maturin books as one long novel united not only by their historical setting but also by the central plot element of the Aubrey/Maturin friendship. Having read these fine books over a period of several years, I decided to evaluate their cumulative integrity by reading them consecutively in order of publication over a period of a few weeks. This turned out to be a rewarding enterprise. For readers unfamiliar with these books, they describe the experiences of a Royal Navy officer and his close friend and traveling companion, a naval surgeon. The experiences cover a broad swath of the Napoleonic Wars and virtually the whole globe.Rereading all the books confirmed that O'Brian is a superb writer and that his ability to evoke the past is outstanding. O'Brian has numerous gifts as a writer. He is the master of the long, careful description, and the short, telling episode. His ability to construct ingenious but creditable plots is first-rate, probably because he based much of the action of his books on actual events. For example, some of the episodes of Jack Aubrey's career are based on the life of the famous frigate captain, Lord Cochrane. O'Brian excels also in his depiction of characters. His ability to develop psychologically creditable characters through a combination of dialogue, comments by other characters, and description is tremendous. O'Brien's interest in psychology went well beyond normal character development, some books contain excellent case studies of anxiety, depression, and mania.Reading O'Brien gives vivid view of the early 19th century. The historian Bernard Bailyn, writing of colonial America, stated once that the 18th century world was not only pre-industrial but also pre-humanitarian (paraphrase). This is true as well for the early 19th century depicted by O'Brien. The casual and invariable presence of violence, brutality, and death is a theme running through all the books. The constant threats to life are the product not only of natural forces beyond human control, particularly the weather and disease, but also of relative human indifference to suffering. There is nothing particularly romantic about the world O'Brien describes but it also a certain grim grandeur. O'Brien also shows the somewhat transitional nature of the early 19th century. The British Navy and its vessals were the apogee of what could be achieved by pre-industrial technology. This is true both of the technology itself and the social organization needed to produce and use the massive sailing vessals. Aubrey's navy is an organization reflecting its society; an order based on deference, rigid hierarchy, primitive notions of honor, favoritism, and very, very corrupt. At the same time, it was one of the largest and most effective bureaucracies in human history to that time. The nature of service exacted great penalities for failure in a particularly environment, and great success was rewarded greatly. In some ways, it was a ruthless meritocracy whose structure and success anticipates the great expansion of government power and capacity seen in the rest of the 19th century.O'Brian is also the great writer about male friendship. There are important female characters in these books but since most of the action takes place at sea, male characters predominate. The friendship between Aubrey and Maturin is the central armature of the books and is a brilliant creation. The position of women in these books is ambiguous. There are sympathetic characters, notably Aubrey's long suffering wife. Other women figures, notably Maturin's wife, leave a less positive impression. On board ship, women tend to have a disruptive, even malign influence.How did O'Brian manage to sustain his achievement over 20 books? Beyond his technical abilities as a writer and the instrinsic interest of the subject, O'Brien made a series of very intelligent choices. He has not one but two major protagonists. The contrasting but equally interesting figures of Aubrey and Maturin allowed O'Brien to a particularly rich opportunity to expose different facets of character development and to vary plots carefully. This is quite difficult and I'm not aware of any other writer who has been able to accomplish such sustained development of two major protagonists for such a prolonged period. O'Brian's use of his historical setting is very creative. The scenes and events in the books literally span the whole globe as Aubrey and Maturin encounter numerous cultures and societies. The naval setting allowed him also to introduce numerous new and interesting characters. O'Brian was able to make his stories attractive to many audiences. Several of these stories can be enjoyed as psychological novels, as adventure stories, as suspense novels, and even one as a legal thriller. O'Brian was also a very funny writer, successful at both broad, low humor, and sophisticated wit. Finally, O'Brian made efforts to link some of the books together. While a number are complete in themselves, others form components of extended, multi-book narratives. Desolation Island, Fortune of War, and The Surgeon's Mate are one such grouping. Treason's Harbor, The Far Side of the World, and The Reverse of the Medal are another. The Letter of Marque and the ensuing 4 books, centered around a circumnavigation, are another.Though the average quality of the books is remarkably high, some are better than others. I suspect that different readers will have different favorites. I personally prefer some of the books with greater psychological elements. The first book, Master and Commander, is one of my favorites. The last 2 or 3, while good, are not as strong as earlier books. I suspect O'Brian's stream of invention was beginning to diminish. All can be read profitably as stand alone works though there is definitely something to be gained by reading in consecutive order."},{"Title":"The Letter of Marque (Aubrey-Maturin)","review":"Stephen Maturin once noted that Aristotle's definition of tragedy encompassed not only a great man being brought down but also the redemption and raising up of a man who had been laid low. Fortunes can reverse in many ways, and Aristotle recognized the literary and moral value of each.In the twelfth of Patrick O'Brian's wonderful series of twenty naval adventures, a combination of luck, adherence to honor, and determination turn Jack Aubrey's fortunes. The HMS Surprise is sold out of the service - to Maturin, whose intelligence activities continue in Britain and promise a voyage to South America. First, though, Aubrey undertakes two voyages as a privateer, under a \\"letter of marque\\", which combined with Maturin's unmasking of a spy, restore his reputation. Maturin's private reputation has similarly suffered from false gossip about his doings in Malta (in \\"Treason's Harbour\\"), and he must similarly seek redemption in a typically private way. So, Maturin travels to Sweden to reconcile with his wife. This gives occasion for the reappearance of the Blue Peter diamond, and further exploration of Maturin's complicated relationship with Diana.\\"The Letter of Marque\\" closes the book on many of setbacks that Aubrey and Maturin suffered recently, leaving them reunited, restored, and with their decks otherwise cleared for action in succeeding volumes. As always, O'Brian's writing is intelligent, informed, and full of wonderful historical nuance."},{"Title":"The Letter of Marque (Aubrey-Maturin)","review":"Frankly, I didn't have very high expectations for this twelfth installment in the saga of Capt. Jack Aubrey and Dr. Stephen Maturin; turning the Surprise into a privateer seemed to be merely scrambling for a plot twist. But, however (as they say), I was mistaken. O'Brian takes the opportunity to point up the significant social and operational differences between the national and private man-of-war, the superior attitudes of the &quot;real&quot; navy toward those not in blue and gold uniform, and the real advantages sometimes enjoyed by the privately financed operation. And he sensitively explores Jack's deep depression at being separated from the service. Moreover, we all know Jack's estrangement, the result of his engineered conviction on trumped-up charges of rigging the stock market, cannot last. And, indeed, his sobriquet of &quot;Lucky Jack&quot; comes to the fore as his first cruise, intended only as a two-week shakedown exercise in preparation for a surreptitiously government-backed diplomatic and intelligence-gathering expedition to the Pacific coast of South America, quickly turns into a triumphant procession of Franco-American prizes back to Plymouth. There are also several interesting sub-plots, including Stephen's reconciliation with his departed wife, Diana, and his gradual but unintentional weaning from his extreme opium habit via his Irish servant. I'm pleased to recommend this yarn as one of the best in the mid-part of this series. (But if you haven't read the previous four or five, you'll have no idea of what's going on.)"},{"Title":"The Letter of Marque (Aubrey-Maturin)","review":"In THE LETTER OF MARQUE, Patrick O'Brian manages another exceptional entry into what is arguably the finest long series of novels in English of the twentieth century. As many have noted, these novels are simply unsurpassed for their combination of literary quality, historical veracity, dramatic tension, and narrative excellence. This particular volume also has more action than any in the series in a long while. It is also quite possibly the most upbeat in the series up to this point. My own theory is that O'Brian conceived both the previous novel, THE REVERSE OF THE MEDAL, and this one as companions. The former takes the fortunes of our heroes Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin to exceedingly low points; in fact, things never got so bad for Jack Aubrey as they did in that one. In this novel, however, a world of troubles comes to an end. Whereas at the end of THE REVERSE OF THE MEDAL Jack was publicly shamed by having been taken off the naval lists and stripped of his rank, by the end of THE LETTER OF MARQUE he knows that he will be restored with seniority to the Royal Navy within a few months. Whereas before Jack's financial affairs were in dismal shape, now he is wealthier than he has ever been, thanks to two extraordinary successes commanding the letter of marque (i.e., privateer) Surprise, lately of the King's Navy as the H.M.S. Surprise. And while his sham trial and conviction wasn't able to tarnish his reputation as completely as his father's political enemies had hoped, he nonetheless had seen better days in the public eye. Now, however, thanks to his great naval victories as a privateer, he had become something of a popular hero. Although Stephen's affairs were not nearly so bad in the previous novel-he had, after all, inherited a very large amount of money, so that he was now a very wealthy man, wealthy enough to purchase and outfit with ease Surprise as a privateer-he still suffered quietly over the departure of his often wayward wife Lady Diana Villiers. The end of the novel finds Stephen and Villiers reconciled, and each knowing that the other had actually been far more faithful to one another than either had a right to suspect.The novel is largely built around three incidents. First, there is the first sailing of Surprise as a letter of marque (the arcane yet preferred designation of what most would call a privateer) in which she not only captures an American privateer, but several of its prizes, including a ship carrying an entire cargo of quicksilver (literally worth its weight in gold). Although it does not suffice to negate the anguish of no longer being in the Royal Navy, this action alone would have seemed to permanently taken care of Jack's often beleaguered finances. The second incident is Jack's action in cutting out of a French port the French frigate Diane (later to be Jack's ship in the Royal Navy upon his reinstatement), an act that shifts the general public opinion in favor of Jack's reinstatement, though the decisive step in that direction will prove to be the death of his father and Jack's taking the seat in parliament vacated by him. The final section of the book is devoted to Stephen's trek to Stockholm in an effort to reconcile with his wife, who mistakenly thinks that Stephen not only had an affair with another woman in the Mediterranean but publicly flaunted it, and who then fled to Stockholm with another man whom Stephen mistakenly imagines was her lover. A subplot running through the novel is the gradual dilution of Stephen's opium by his servant, who each night steals a bit of it and replaces what he had taken with brandy. The effect was that Stephen gradually lessened the amount of opium he was taking, so that when he arrived in Stockholm and bought an undiluted bottle, then taking what he imagined was his usual dose, he went into an opium coma.Although most of O'Brian's novels have no especially clear beginning or end, this one does have a somewhat more self-contained story than most in the series. There is some overlap, of course, and a host of old, well-known characters to whom we are reintroduced. What I am amazed by in these novels, apart from their remarkable excellence, is their consistency. Some of the novels are better than others, but single novels is not really the right way to view them. This is a series, and the truth is that the only way to judge it is as a group of books. By this standard this is one of the most unique literary achievements of the past century. This is a series that pulls in both lovers of historical fiction as well as very serious readers more at home with George Eliot and Vladimir Nabokov, a claim that could never conceivably be made, say, about C.S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower series, which attracts virtually no serious readers at all."},{"Title":"The Letter of Marque (Aubrey-Maturin)","review":"The Letter of Marque (the entire series for that matter) goes so far beyond the swashbuckling cliche as to make the comparison irrelevant. O'Brian's ability to evoke a place, an era, an age is to my mind unprecedented. The series is actually so many chapters of one great work that will hook you completey, and leave you in awe of the mind that contained them."},{"Title":"The Letter of Marque (Aubrey-Maturin)","review":"Jack Aubrey has been drummed out of the service, removed from the post-captain's list and the possibility of hoisting his flag one day as a rear admiral commanding a squadron. Stephen Maturin buys HMS Surprise and has her outfitted as a privateer under Aubrey's command, with a letter of marque attesting to her status as a private warship still in service to Her Britannic Majesty's government. During a shakedown cruise, Surprise overtakes and captures a French privateer, the more heavily armed Spartan, and then, in a clever bit of subterfuge, seizes the privateer's prizes too. It is a brilliant action which strongly resembles Aubrey's amazing seizure of the Spanish xebec frigate chronicled in Patrick O'Brian's &quot;Master and Commander&quot;. Once more he is hailed in England as &quot;Lucky Jack&quot; Aubrey. Next Aubrey leads a daring nighttime raid on a French English Channel port, cutting out the newly built French frigate Diane, counting on the assistance of his former subordinate William Babbington, now the commander - and soon to be - post-captain of a sloop. Meanwhile Maturin finally frees himself of his opium addiction and joins Aubrey in a voyage to Sweden, ultimately reuniting with his estranged wife Diana Villiers. And Aubrey learns that he will soon be restored to the post-captain's list, after receiving an unexpected political legacy from an elderly cousin. This splendid novel is among the most suspenseful in the Aubrey/Maturin series, replete with O'Brian's brilliant lyrical prose and astute attention to detail. Without question it is among O'Brian's best."},{"Title":"The Letter of Marque (Aubrey-Maturin)","review":"In the last few months I have taken to listening to O'Brian rather than reading him. And, I hasten to add, I have read through the canon twice! Listening to O'Brian's words rather than reading them, has taken me to a completely new level of appreciation. Tull is superb.I listen to the novels in whatever order I can find the audiobooks available from my public library. I did begin with \\"Master and Commander\\" via a purchase of same (and with John Lee), but I cannot afford now to buy my own tapes of every novel so have taken to borrowing same from my library. I listen to the audiobooks on tape cassettes, and do so either while in the yard gardening (a sometimes rather boring job) or whilst driving about town (an always tedious and boring occupation!). Whilst doing the latter I am surely depriving my classical music station of one of its staunchest listeners!Because I listen to whatever novel I can find at the time, I have been listening in no particular order. One time I may be listening to \\"Desolation Island\\" and another time, as of late, it may be \\"Letter of Marque\\". And I have by no means listened to more than 4 or 5 books yet. But this presents no real problems as far as comprehension is concerned because I have read the canon twice over. Athough I do have to stop sometimes and figure out just what has happened already and what has yet to happen.In any event, I am listening to rather than reading O'Brian. And, the professional narrator, as I have already mentioned, must be able to dramatize the books, with different accents, with a range of emotional tones, with dramatic pauses, and so forth. These were not things that I did when I was reading the books silently to myself. As a result, I am more and more taken with O'Brian's mastery. And I often find myself chuckling over some droll bit which did not elicit the same while only reading it. I also often find myself marveling yet again over O'Brian's complete mastery as a writer, as an unabashed story-teller.The way that he was able to weave all of those 20 books together is simply astounding. It is as remarkable as what we are told of Mozart's scores, namely that they are all of one piece, having seemed to be simply taken down as dictation from on high. (I do know from seeing \\"21\\" that Patrick did in fact cross things out, etc.). He cannot have had the whole canon figured out in his mind in advance, and yet it seems that way.How he is able to bring in and out of the tales various characters, but in ways that are never contrived. His ability to write of naval technical terms so off-handedly and casually, as if it is as second nature to him as they would have been to Jack. And, apparently able to do so without ever having had much personal experience with sailing vessels himself. It often makes me wonder if O'Brian wasn't a 'square-rigged sailor' in some previous incarnation, and now he has somehow tied his conscious mind back into that former life. And, at other times, his writing is pure literary lyricism, such as, in LOM, when he tells us about Steven's state of mind during the days he was semi-unconscious after his fall from the tower. That bit of writing is the best of the best!So, as it was often put, in the novels, O'Brian's writing \\"was the completest thing\\".UPDATE: I have now spent the last year since this review in buying each set of tapes in their turn and have now listened to the whole 20 novels canon - and all by my very favorite narrator Patrick Tull (excepting Master and Commander)."},{"Title":"The Letter of Marque (Aubrey-Maturin)","review":"Picking up exactly whereThe Reverse of the Medal (Vol. Book 11) (Aubrey/Maturin Novels)left off - Jack Aubrey drummed out of the service, the Surpise decommissioned, _The Letter of Marque_ serves as the second half of the tale in a much more direct way than the previous books in the series. As such, many lose ends are tied up and O'Brian will (I assume) take readers in another direction with the following book.Keeping a reader's interest twelve books into a series is no easy feat, but O'Brian makes it look easy. Readers already know both Aubrey and Maturin quite well (having served and sailed with them literally around the world and in dozens of engagements), yet the characters remain fresh as they evolve and grow. Aubrey of course is terribly distraught and troubled after his humilating discharge from the service; even when an opening is made for him to reenter if he only were to ask for a pardon, he adamantly refuses such is the strength of his conviction. To ask for a pardon would be to admit he had done something wrong in the first place. Such characterization is one reason of several why the books are so popular. Another is the exquisite detail of O'Brian's descriptions of naval warfare - in _The Letter of Marque_, Aubrey's luck holds again in an absolutely riveting (and bold) engagement. I hesitate to say more, lest I spoil elements of the plot.The real heart of the story isn't the battle or the challenges and problems Aubrey faces - it is the closeness between Maturin and Aubrey and the gradual depth of those characters close them: Sophie, Diana Villiers, and Aubrey's children. (The very thought of precious 8-year old twins running around and yelling at one another \\"you swab!\\" and \\"avast, you whoreson!\\" still puts me in stitches.) These characters and the men with whom Aubrey and Maturin have served with, are becoming more and more real with each successive installment of the series. Highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"The Letter of Marque (Aubrey-Maturin)","review":"How does one review a book in this series? Having read much in this genre, I can say the Aubrey-Maturin books by O'Brien are unique. The style of writing is at first difficult. His transitions from action to dialogue, or from scene to scene are seldom clear. For the first two or three books this was offputting. But the richness, the detail, the cleverness, the character development, the action, the history, these books are wonderfully written and a joy to read, once one learns how to read them. I particularly like the work of Bernard Cornwell: simple, delightful reads with compelling characters and engaging plot lines. O'Brien is anything but simple. Yet I find myself in the 12th of the series, eagerly awaiting the next turn of the plot, and vaguely starting to dread the fact that there are only 8 (and a half) more of these wonderful books.The main character is based upon Sir Thomas Cochran, the British naval hero of the Natoleonic wars, who's life was as remarkable, if not more so, than any of the fictional accounts based upon him, the same Cochran that Forester's Hornblower is based upon.Lucky Jack is in a pickle. A tragedy has occurred in his life. Through a false accusation he is convicted of a fraud, and is struck from the service, his beloved navy. He has powerful friends working behind the scenes, and though a private and disgraced citizen, he is given letters of marque and a ship with which to pursue the King's enemies on the seas. A secret assignment sends him toward the Americas. He must avoid contact with the British navy for, being private, they can commandeer his crew, weakening his chances for successful completion of his mission. Will his small ship be captured by the Americans or the French? Will he ever gain reinstatement in the navy? On this impossible assignment stands any hope he may have of a future beyond shame and disgrace.

According to the author, Esfah is a dark and twisted world, where all characters seem to have a streak of evil running through them. Based on the best-selling game, Cast of Fate has little resemblance to the game, and would be more likely to turn people away than intrigue them enough to play. While the story idea had merit (a Morehl orphan raised by a Selumari general), I was disappointed that it didn't delve more deeply into that relationship. Instead it veered off into politics and betrayals, leaving me bored. Painting the races of Nature (namely the coral elves and dwarves) as opportunistic backstabbers was a mistake. In my opinion, Allen Varney rushed the job and failed to research the game as thoroughly as he could have. The only thing good about this book was the playable die that came with it, which in my opinion is the only reason anyone would even want to make the purchase.

Cloth with dustjacket.","review":"This is a collection of magnificent pictures by America's premiere photographer, sadly marred by the pretentious twaddle of a chronic kicker from Tucson who faults everyone in the Southwest except his own redeeming presence.It's beautiful work by Ansel Adams, well worth whatever you pay for the book. The pretentious twaddle by Lawrence Clark Powell is typical Tucson, people who manage to find fault with everything.First, the pictures. Photography was part of my job for years, and I have visited probably half of the places included in this book. For example, consider the picture of White House Ruin in Canyon de Chelly, taken in 1942. I've taken dozens of photos of it, and hiked every foot in the vicinity. Nothing of mine comes close to the mastery of Adams beautiful black-and-white photograph. I suspect that even if I copied his picture as precisely as possible, mine would still look dull in comparison to his artistry.Adams' mastery of the camera and the art of making prints is such that even in black-and-white, his pictures sparkle with a luminosity that puts color to shame. In recent years newspapers have wasted a great effort on color pictures. Adams' work shows how superior the old black-and-white photos could be in comparison to modern newspaper color. Any photo editor would weep to have such quality today. More's the pity the newspapers do not emphasize quality instead of glitzy novelty.It's more than a book about the Southwest; it's a book about how to see nature and the world around us. Adams had an eye for natural beauty. I've no doubt he could find beauty and art even in a junk yard. He knew what to include in a picture, and how much to leave out, and the precise moment when it all came together. His pictures of cacti, aspens, rocks and adobe structures will cause anyone to look again and more closely at their surroundings, to appreciate the beauty of detail in a grander setting.Sadly, the words fall far short of the pictures. Fifty years ago, Joseph Wood Krutch wrote in praise of the Southwest, &quot;the combination of brilliant sun and high, thin, dry air with a seemingly limitless expanse of sky and earth [that] my first reaction was delighted amusement. How far the ribbon of road beckoned ahead! How endlessly much there seemed to be of the majestically rolling expanse of bare earth dotted with sagebrush!&quot;Such beauty still exists in the Southwest, even today. I have often driven such roads.In contrast, Powell is an old grouch. The only things he finds to praise are his own presence and ruined adobes. He seeks the negatives, such as Gallup, New Mexico, where &quot;the Indian may be seen in the stages of disintegration -- drinking, fighting, staggering and falling to the sidewalk and gutter. Here is the place to read 'Laughing Boy,' LaFarge's lament for a people debauched by an alien race.&quot;Powell ignores the fact Gallup has established one of the nation's outstanding alcohol rehabilitation programs, far superior to anything in Tucson. His ugly words are a contrast to the beauty of Adams' photographs.It doesn't matter. Buy the book for the photographs, they are worth it. Ignore Powell's whiney complaints. You'll get a gem in terms of wonderful pictures, and for laugh's you'll see Tucsonian political correctness run amok."},{"Title":"Photographs of the Southwest.

Fair enough, there are some slips, but the readibility of this series is excellent - I would not be afraid to hand these books off to someone interested in the genre. Minford has rendered the sometimes terse Chinese into a flowing english that would hook just about anyone.The books are printed with very high quality, but unfortunately this raises the pricetag quite a bit. Collecting the entire trilogy is going to cost over $100, for books that will in all likelyhood be read once. These books are really crying out for a nice softcover treatment that could place it in a lot more hands!"},{"Title":"The Deer and the Cauldron: The Third Book","review":"This volume nicely ties together all of the entertaining threads that have been laid out over the course of the previous two books, which is impressive if only because books two and three are compressed from books two, three, four, and five of the Chinese original. The manic pace of the first two books slows down a bit here, but it's a satisfying conclusion. A must read if you've read the first two."},{"Title":"The Deer and the Cauldron: The Third Book","review":"My husband was into Chinese Wu-Xia. I bought this set, and he loved it! Since he got the books, he went everywhere with the book and finished the whole thing in a week. Great story, great translation."},{"Title":"The Deer and the Cauldron: The Third Book","review":"never quite get the essence of jing jong. Free translations on the web are much better"},{"Title":"The Wasp Eater","review":"I liked this novella, but didn't really love it. I am not quite sure why, though. Mostly because there just seemed like something was missing, or lacking, though I am not exactly sure what it was... The father's character was the focal point of the whole book but he seemed more like a shadow of a man than a real man. Perhaps it was this character flaw that made me feel like there was something lacking in the book... Still, it was a fascinating and engrossing book."},{"Title":"The Wasp Eater","review":"Although they were different in many ways, The Wasp Eater reminded me a little of The Secret Life of Bees. If you liked that one, give this one a try. This is a wonderfully told story by a writer who knows how to describe certain the details of something in such a way you already perceive them but didn't realize you did until you read his description! Such talent! I hope to see future work from Mr. Lychack."},{"Title":"The Wasp Eater","review":"William Lychak is a brilliant new writer who captivated me with his poetic yet insightful examination of a relationship between a father and son. He creates a heartbreaking tale about loss and longing in his novel about every child's desire to keep his family intact despite the ramifications and touches a nerve that resonates for each reader. If you appreciate beautifully crafted prose you will certainly appreciate this novel."},{"Title":"The Wasp Eater","review":"I thought it was an ephemeral novelette with several thoughtful descriptions of characters. Very good read."},{"Title":"The Wasp Eater","review":"This book is a real keeper! Not the typical summer best seller or beach book, The Wasp Eater brilliantly depicts basic elements in the tragedy of a broken family. Coming from a child's point of view, the narrative sensitively reveals Daniel's movement towards understanding. Through the development of his characters, Lychack demonstrates his perception of our tragic inability to communicate our needs to one another. Using the poignancy of idealism and hope opposed by inevitable weaknesses of character, the writer has produced a timeless and universal image of growing up."},{"Title":"The Wasp Eater","review":"William Lychack's book is truly a little gemI enjoyed every page. His writing flows with lyricism and gritty realism all at once. The characters are great and their relationships are perfectly complex, yet so understandable.The book hits all the right notes of despair, hope and understanding. A great tale of growing up before you want to.I can't wait for his second book."},{"Title":"The Wasp Eater","review":"Congratulations Mr. Lychack on a book well done...I read this book in one sitting. Mr. Lychack writes with great sensitivity and brought my feelings alive more with each chapter. Best wishes for the continuing writing achievements I know you will earn. I look forward to reading more from you. Keep up the good work."},{"Title":"The Wasp Eater","review":"This slim, lyrical novel beautifully captures the the intensity and impotence of childhood--a time when parents can be both fiercely loved and as inscrutable and destructive as forces of nature. Lychack takes his own bitter memories of this difficult time, and transforms them, as if by magic, into a tale of touching sweetness. What a pleasure to read!"},{"Title":"The Wasp Eater","review":"The Wasp Eater is one of the best novels I've read this year. The author's expertise with language and story is so complete that he draws you in from the start, and doesn't let go. It's a slender book; you'll read it quickly, and then you'll want to take your time when you read it again."},{"Title":"The Wasp Eater","review":"An excellent book that propells the reader along both with it's careful workmanship and it's underlying sense of inevitability. Lychak places his characters in situations where we wish they'd act differently, but know they won't. A beautiful, poignant book for those of us who have tried to make things work even when we know they can't."},{"Title":"The Wasp Eater","review":"Lychack writes with such simplicity and humor and heart. This book is not to be read so much as inhaled. It is a beautiful, high stakes tale of alienation and forgiveness. I read it in one sitting, then read it again. Thank you, Mr. Lychack!"},{"Title":"The Wasp Eater","review":"Beyond a doubt, this is one of the best bits of writing I have come across in several years. I would hate to classify it as a novel, per se, as it is more akin to a short story, or short narrative. The author's use of language is wonderful, lyrical yet rather shocking. The author touches on so many emotions and does it so well, that this one is bound to stay with you for some time. Very highly recommend this one, and I promise you will not be sorry after reading it. Hope we get more of the same from Mr. Lychack."},{"Title":"The Wasp Eater","review":"This is a thoughtful well-written book that explores many facets of family relationships. Although it is fiction it is likely to strike a familiar chord with anyone who has had a less than perfect relationship with their father."},{"Title":"The Wasp Eater","review":"A lovely book, written in a spare style, with a lot of underlying emotion that just barely ripples the surface ... Reminds me a bit of the delicate touch of Penelope Fitzgerald, nicely captures the feel of 1970s Connecticut, of a family falling apart, of a father who is kind of charming but more importantly a scoundrel, of a ten-year-old boy who doesn't know whether he wants his father back in his life (after the father cheats on the mother) or permanently out .... Definitely worth reading ...."},{"Title":"A Bad Day to Die: The Adventures of Lucius \\"By God\\" Dodge, Texas Ranger","review":"Jimmy's writing gets better with each book.

If you like good westerns, don't miss this one."},{"Title":"A Bad Day to Die: The Adventures of Lucius \\"By God\\" Dodge, Texas Ranger","review":"I'm a big fan of westerns, and spotted this one at my local Walmart. Intriqued by the title, I decided to pick it up. I'm glad that I did. This book is what westerns should be, exciting from beginning to end. It seems to be written in the first person at the beginning, and slips seemlessly in and out from that point on. I've read a lot of westerns, but the way the author put words together painted a pretty picture. Grab this one if you see it!"},{"Title":"A Bad Day to Die: The Adventures of Lucius \\"By God\\" Dodge, Texas Ranger","review":"I just finished reading J. Lee Butts' book, A Bad Day to Die, the adventures of Lucius \\"By God\\" Dodge, Texas Ranger. What a book! Butts is an exceptional writer, has an unusual gift for clever dialog, and is one who flat out knows how to tell a tall Western tale properly.The book picks up on Lucius Dodge as an old man talking to an old Ranger partner, and then flashes back to one of the craziest, meanest, bloodiest, nastiest cases Dodge and his partner Boz Tatum ever worked on...the Nightshade murders. The two young Texas Rangers, tough, smart, hard working honest fellows are sent to Sweetwater, Texas, a town terrorized by a big family of thugs, the notorious Nightshades.Two different beautiful girls fall for the handsome young Ranger, Dodge, one the impetuous, sweet-kissing, straight-shooting, green-eyed Martye, sixteen year old daughter from a big, dirt poor family of farmers, and the other the pistol-packing, hard-assed, gorgeous Nance Nightshade. Dodge is no ladies man by any means, often embarrassed by the obvious attentions of these two different, but extremely attractive females.A Bad Day to Dies isn't light reading, it's a tough book, it doesn't have fairy tale ending, it isn't a book that seems destined to be a Hollywood movie...too real for Hollywood, but what this excellent Western novel is, is historically accurate, hard-hitting, true to the flavor of time and place, and above all, interesting at every point. The deeper into the story the reader gets, the more difficult it is put this exciting book down. Told in the first person by an older and wiser Lucius Dodge, the flow of remarkable similes and metaphors is staggering, the book has the feel of one that was written and then re-written and polished over and over, and of one that was written by a real pro, a wordsmith with uncommon and serious skills. If you've never yet had the pleasure of reading J. Lee Butts, and you appreciate a good story set in the Wild West as it actually was, check out this talented writer. A Bad Day to Die is one mighty fine Western novel. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Greek's Ultimate Revenge (Harlequin Presents)","review":"Our Hero thinks the heroine is his sister's husband's mistress, so at his sister's request, he sets out to seduce her & take her away from his brother-in-law to save his marriage.

Needless to say, the sh*t hits the fan, and a marriage between the two is arranged to restore family honor.

The constant mental dialogs of Jenine and Nikos was driving me nuts. I like when the story shows actions because it moves the story forward. The first five chapters drag and drag. I gave this story three stars because the ending was nice. I did read a story very much like this one but the hero was Italian coming to the rescue of his sisters marriage. Unlike this story, that book was wonderful from start to finish. In this story I really didn't care for Nikos untill the end, and I didn't like Jenine much either.

I don't know about you, but that's exactly what I'm hoping for when I open up one of these novels, and this book delivered that and more.The angst and heartbreak in this book was scrumptious, and I really enjoyed both Janine and Nikos' characters.However, while the emotions were absolutely incredible, I couldn't help but be frustrated by Janine's \\"stiff upper lip\\" regarding certain circumstances, nor with how quickly things were resolved in the end after the Big Confrontation.

I loved this book. It has its flaws, but the strengths ensured those did not detract. What Julia James is able to do is use words like a master puppeteer...she's able to find the exact words that create emotion. I actually got teary at two scenes: when the heroine discovered the truth...and when the hero realized his feelings. The best way I can describe the experience of this book is to compare it to a movie that has dramatic music...and dramatic scenes that are highly compelling and stirring...that's what the writer was able to do. That's what makes this book work. The ability to connect the reader with the pain/conflict of the characters. She takes you to the edge and then delivers. The writer has not yet perfected her art--she still needs to refine it--but when she does--if she does it:. wow. We'll be in romance reader heaven.

This commentary on Proverbs (for the BCOTWP, for which Longman serves as editor) is no exception! The introductory section on the authorship and compilation of Proverbs is extremely informative and will undoubtedly change many readers' preconceived notions about this book for the better. Longman's theological insights are excellent, especially for Christian readers. He fully interacts with other Proverbs commentators such as Fox, Waltke, Murphy and others (It's a shame that Fox's commentary on Proverbs 10-31 was not available for Longman to interact with when he was writing this commentary). Longman's interaction with other commentators is so exhaustive that this commentary is easily the BEST single-volume option currently available. He skillfully extracts the most informative insights from each of the other works. In addition, he uses insights from other scholars to support many of his interpretations and graciously disagrees with some of their exegesis when warranted. Longman wisely restrains his own interpretations of many passages and reminds readers that the original context in which many Proverbs were first written is uncertain. He stresses the importance of Proverbs as a book whose verses are to be applied wisely after one has pondered the context of a given situation. Only then can a Proverb be employed. This commentary models careful, cautious interpretation and application beautifully! Pastors and teachers will find the topical appendix at the end of the book extremely helpful. As with the other volumes in this series, the linguistic insights are eye-opening and the tone of the writing is extremely pastoral and readable. I greatly appreciated his occasional reminders that although Proverbs was historically addressed to a male Jewish audience, its message is equally applicable to females as well. He carefully demonstrates how to tailor certain passages to both males and females a few times throughout the book. Pastors and rabbis addressing mixed congregations will find this helpful. His discussion of the epilogue in Proverbs 31:10-31 concerning the ways in which wisdom affects all aspects of life for anyone who typologically makes her their 'wife' is outstanding! It will surely allow that beautiful chapter to serve a greater purpose throughout the year instead of relegating it to hackneyed Mother's Day sermons! Excellent illustrations are provided throughout the text that will make preaching and teaching from Proverbs a delight rather than a burden. Crafting substantial lessons and sermons just became MUCH easier given the immense assistance with making legitimate application that Longman provides throughout the book. At times, it seemed like I was being taught how to properly interpret and apply Proverbs by a seasoned expositor, which is a definite plus for any commentary! This volume is a repository of penetrating insight and theological reflection that rescues Proverbs from being an alleged book of supposed timeless 'promises' akin to the cliched slogans that one encounters in fortune cookies. Readers desiring more detail should consult the two-volume Proverbs commentaries from Bruce K. Waltke (NICOT) and Michael V. Fox (Anchor Bible). They offer more exhaustive linguistic discussion from a Christian (Waltke) and a Jewish (Fox) perspective."},{"Title":"Proverbs (Baker Commentary on the Old Testament Wisdom and Psalms)","review":"Longman's commentary on Proverbs is simply great. The introduction alone is worth the price. He takes what could be a dry academic work and makes it interesting and readable. His explanations are understandable, his scholarship outstanding, and the topical appendix is wonderfully useful as a teaching resource."},{"Title":"Proverbs (Baker Commentary on the Old Testament Wisdom and Psalms)","review":"I really enjoy this book. It's become part of my daily Bible reading. It gives a very thoughtful and exegetical nuanced comment on every proverb in the Book of Proverbs.

Every page is full of new insights!"},{"Title":"Proverbs (Baker Commentary on the Old Testament Wisdom and Psalms)","review":"Tremper Longman knows Proverbs! His commentary is extensive but usually easy for even a lay person to use. Some of the resources in the back of the book are worth the cost by themselves!"},{"Title":"Proverbs (Baker Commentary on the Old Testament Wisdom and Psalms)","review":"A pile of neo-orthodox feminist trash! This commentary is full of modernist anti-Christian and liberal ideas that completely undermine and distort the nature and purpose of the Book of Proverbs. He sees no overarching stucture or development to the Book! What a \\"fool!\\" Let me just say, YES! THERE IS! He downplays the Solomonic authorship. He makes no mention of the role of the book as a manual for princes, soldiers, or magistrates (common in the Ancient world i.e. Xenophon's Cyropedia). Read Psalm 1-2 and Psalm 101! This is typical of the feminism, antinomianism and political polytheism of today! There is moreover nothing said either of the role of Proverbs in a theology of Christian education or for child training. How shocking!!! The implications for Christian education and for homeshooling in Proverbs are numerous! I wonder does this guy have a wife and kids? You wouldn't think so by this stupid commentary!!! Is this scholar blind as a bat??? There is moreover very little of Christ and the Gospel in the commentary at all either! It reads like a dull and tedious academic monograph written by a complete pagan. And what theology there is in this commentary is largely watered down by modern liberal academic or neo-orthodox jargon; the constant use of YHWH instead of simply \\"the Lord,\\" a very low view of the glory and sovereignty of God, the doctrine of the Covenant, the history of redemption, and of the revelation of Christ in the OT; a distorted and modernist view of the fear of God and true wisdom; a cowardly downplaying of God's wrath upon idolatry, false religion, the wicked, the foolish, the harlot, as well as pagans and idolaters in the world. You do not get any sense whatsoever of the serious contrast that is in the Book of Proverbs made between the way of the Lord (which is wisdom, the fear of God, true worship, righteousness and holiness...as well as the virtuous woman who is a godly housewife) and that of the wicked and the idolater which leads to hell. There is also no recognition whatsoever of the spiritual imagery made throughout of the church/Israel as the bride of Christ! Just the constant dumb and stupid terminology of \\"Woman Wisdom.\\" How ungodly! There is no prophetic or eschatological hope! No reference made to the relation of the prophets at all either! He even speaks as if there is no mention whatsover of the resurrection or the final judgment! This makes the commentary very trite and superficial. There is also a perverse accomodation to modern feminist ideology throughout of the book. Longman even has the audacity to say that you could change \\"son\\" to \\"child\\" in many passages for the sake of gender equality, or even that Proverbs 21:9 and others like it could equally refer to a contentious man! And he says the virtuous woman is described largely in terms of \\"a business woman.\\" What a brazen piece of compromising liberal feminist crap that totally distorts the Book of Proverbs! Longman has no real spiritual knowledge or understanding of the Book of Proverbs, or for that matter Ecclesiastes or the Song of Solomon. His accomodationist attitude to modern secular culture betrays him! This commentary and sadly many others like it today of the same nature (modern broad-evangelical neo-liberal scholarship) show how spiritually apostate the churches and seminaries have become over the last generation. Longman is certainly not the worst. But this is a very bad commentary! There is more \\"unbelief, foolishness, and chasing after the wind\\" in this commentary than there is real substantial wisdom, righteousness, godliness, and the fear of the Lord. You are better off getting the old works of Bridges, Wardlaw, and even Matthew Henry....which are all free on the internet. You would also be better off just to read the Book of Proverbs 20-30 times over, rather than to read this commentary. Read the Bible! Search the Scriptures! That is what Solomon says in Proverbs! And that is what the Lord Jesus says! As for this commentary it is dry and dull and without much of Christ or of true wisdom at all! Longman should have taken to heart Eccl.12:12!Pastor Brett Woody"},{"Title":"Ward's history of Coffee county","review":"This book gave a wonderful glimpse of life in Coffee County pre-1930.

Jeremy and Tricia were really in love, even in their young life. But, love does not always work out as we want it to, when we want it to. Through misunderstanding, Jeremy and Tricia were separated and a lot went on over the 14 or so years they were separated. However, true love is hard to separate.

The story was so unrealistic. The fact that one statement by one person could keep these two lovers apart for 14 years is ridiculous.

At the end of this book, I found that I did not connect with any of the characters and barely liked the female character.

She discovers a worthwhile ministry at the local Hope Canteen, sharing Christ with young servicemen and women. An automobile accident proves pivotal for both the story line and Christine's life. Oke introduces a handsome young resident at the hospital whose family helped found the town. Christine is torn about her future which seems to revolve around her beloved North. Oke has a very surprising ending to this book, one I was not prepared for nor particularly liked.

She builds up a romantic story line and then skips over into another story entirely. I must admit I like the stories about settlers better than the more modern settings and situations. I suppose the wars aren't that modern but they're a less innocent time. I felt like she had cheated her readers by rushing this to press before taking the time to edit it properly. She had proved herself in the past and I'll buy her books again but it was really disapointing. A writer who can write Roses For Mama can do a lot better."},{"Title":"When Tomorrow Comes (Canadian West)","review":"I was excited to see that Janette Oke had written two more books for her Canadian West series (my favorite of all her books)about the Delaney's kids. Either the quality of her writing has diminished or my literary taste has matured; either way, these two books were not that great. The sixth one was especially aggravating! The character development was poor; the plot was choppy. It was as if the author was trying to minimize words, frequently giving summaries of what had just occurred, rather than allowing you to enjoy it yourself. Without spoiling, the romance aspect of this book completely failed, and was completely unbelievable. Stick with the original four and skip the latter two."},{"Title":"When Tomorrow Comes (Canadian West)","review":"As an avid christian fiction reader, I eagerly await new books by my favorite authors. This book was well worth the wait. I don't know about anyone else, but I was disappointed when Janette Oke ended the Canadian West series a number of years ago. I was incredibly pleased to see her continue on last year, with &quot;Beyond the Gathering Storm&quot; and I have been anxiously awaiting this book. It is supurbly written and was satisfying in the end. There is just enough suspense to make it impossible to put down. It is a book that reminds the reader how important faith in God really is and that if you listen to Him, you will not choose the wrong path for you life. I am hoping that Oke decides to contine on with this series. I am looking forward to seeing these characters again. Happy reading!!"},{"Title":"When Tomorrow Comes (Canadian West)","review":"This book was merely ok for me. It starts right when Beyond the Gathering Storm lets off and continues the story of Christine. This time, Christine is the main character with no switching of point of view to her brother Henry. Her parents, Elizabeth and Wynn, feature slightly but are again, not the main characters.We find Christine living with her parents after the breakup of her relationship in the South where she subsequently loses her job as well. She is just about to look for another job when she gets the good news that her brother and his beloved Amber will be getting married at Christmas and would love if she would come early to help with things. This she agrees to readily.She and her mother first stop at Calgary to visit family and obtain some supplies, like fabric for a new suit for her position as bride's maid. While her mother stays in Calgary, she continues on to her brother's place.After the wedding, it is Christine's job to look after Danny, Amber's son. It is during this time that a certain young Mountie that we know from Beyond the Gathering Storm (one that was mauled by a bear actually) takes a special interest in her. While he is not pushy, Christine just isn't sure she is ready for a relationship yet. She leaves with him saying if she ever changes her mind, all she needs to do is send him a note.She stops briefly back home before going back to Edmonton to pursue a job. Here she finds one and is just hired when she gets the bad news that her Aunt in Calgary has fallen and hurt her back and needs a nursemaid. Knowing that it would be probably for the best, she goes to take care of her Aunt, abandoning the job she just had.The care of her Aunt goes well and soon she finds herself in a job in Calgary, thanks to her Uncle who was able to suggest it to her. With such happiness going on, they decide all family should come for Easter. When all but her brother Henry is there, they get bad news that he and his family have been in an accident. While they wait at the hospital visiting and looking after Henry and his family, she meets a young doctor who later turns out to have romantic pursuits.In addition to the doctor, a young priest also has been pursuing her and knows her from the volunteer work that she is doing for soldiers. However will she decide where her heart leads?There wasn't as much Christian emphasis in this book as there were in the rest of Oke's in my opinion. The only time she really brought it in was towards the end when Christine was seeking guidance towards making a decision. The way she did it, to me, was really strange. It involved Christine conversing with different quotes from the bible and while I realize people do this, it just seemed awkward to me. I think it was perhaps the way Oke wrote it rather than the situation actually being awkward.Another disappointment in this book for me, and the reason I only rated it three stars, was because I did not agree with the ending at all. While there were three guys to pick and choose from, she didn't choose the one I would have chosen for her. Oke had all possible logic leading to a certain one and then out of nowhere switches it up. It made it less of an enjoyable read for me.At least in this book, compared to the last, the characters were more believable. They weren't always perfect and were more fallible. This made it easier for me to connect with them.As always, Oke's writing is inoffensive and while she deals with some tough things, she doesn't go too far with them or get too descriptive in gory details.Overall, while I would have liked to see a better ending to the Canadian West series this wasn't terrible. It just isn't the end I would have chosen for it.When Tomorrow ComesCopyright 2001256 pages"},{"Title":"When Tomorrow Comes (Canadian West)","review":"Being a Janette Oke and looking forward to reading her books, I was disappointed that the book did not end in the way I had expected. I was pleased to see that I wasn't the only one who holds this opinion. I thought that it would have been a much better ending had it been Christine and Laray, especially with him going to the North as well rather than Eric. I hope Ms Oke writes another one in the series where Christine changes her mind for laray, i really liked him!"},{"Title":"When Tomorrow Comes (Canadian West)","review":"This is a great sequel to &quot;Beyond the Gathering Storm.&quot; I notice that another reviewer complained that Christine couldn't possibly decide she was in love with Eric at the end of the book just by reading the Bible. Why not? Plenty of real-life people have made decisions that way! There have also been cases of people in love with someone for years before they knew it, I'm glad the story wasn't like that. Perhaps the reviewer has never had such an experience, but that doesn't mean they know everything! It's great to have stories where people read the Bible and act on what they've learned, and Janette Oke is one of my favorite Christian writers! My only complaint is that sometimes it took too long to get through a part of the story that seemed unimportant to me."},{"Title":"When Tomorrow Comes (Canadian West)","review":"I was very pleased to see the sequel to Beyond the Gathering Storm so that I could find out what might become of Christine. Overall I thought it was an okay book, but the ending just didn't seem right. Even though Oke wanted us to finish the book with the feeling that Christine really was in love with Eric, I don't think she was. The day before she was supposed to make her decision about whether she wanted to continue seeing Eric seriously or not, she had no idea, then after just reading a chapter in Exodus she realized that she truly loves him?? Come on, really. I felt through the whole book that she and Henry's fellow RCMP Laray were a perfect match, esp. since he was going back to the North where she always felt that she belonged. Despite what I felt was an unsatisfactory ending, I overall enjoyed the story. I'd take it or leave it."},{"Title":"When Tomorrow Comes (Canadian West)","review":"I was totally let down when christene didn't go back for Laray! The ending was so lame!

I must say though, that this was the first time ive ever been dissapointed by her. I read the first book in this series (When calls the Heart) when i was 14 or so and it was my favorite book for years. The next 5 in the series were all entertaining and just the right amount of romantic while providing a beautiful message of God's love and guidance. This book was just a mess. I found Christine's character to be painfully flat and uninteresting. Her reactions to the men who were interested in her were almost irritatingly self-centered. I know the end of the book where she spends a week \\"searching for God's guidance\\" was supposed to make up for it all, but I think it fell a little short. The way the book starts by setting up the romance between Christine and Laray and then just dropping it suddenly to start another romance with Eric makes it all feel unhinged. I guess it might have worked if the relationship had been at least romantic, but Christine is unsure of her feelings the whole time so it's really hard to understand where it's going. Anyway, I guess it's hard to write an amazing story EVERY single time...so 5 good books out of 6 ain't bad.."},{"Title":"When Tomorrow Comes (Canadian West)","review":"I'll admit, I'm not a huge Oke fan, but she's decent. The characters were just all right in Beyond the Gathering Storm and When Tomorrow Comes...the plot twists are almost the only redeeming pt, though they do well in that role.

For that reason alone I give this collection 5 stars (as if that really means a thing.) There are other great poems here, and some lousy ones, as Eliot eventually turned into a lousy poet. It's ok, it happens to a lot of folks. Many poets are lousy from start to finish. Eliot at least was good enough to write &quot;Prufrock,&quot; and &quot;The Waste Land,&quot; and &quot;Preludes.&quot; So we'll forgive him for the 4 quartrets or whatever the hell that junk is called.Thank you for your time."},{"Title":"Collected Poems 1909-1962","review":"Every now and then certain turns of phrase or glimpses of landscapes in special light or just buried memories of poetic lines surface and send us back to the source for more. So often that source for this reader is TS Eliot and encountering this wondrous collection of his poems written between 1909 and 1962 reinforces the power of this great man of letters. This collection includes the major poems, those works that impacted our philosophy and our art in ways we are only now beginning to appreciate. From the ever fresh LOVE SONG OF J.ALFRED PRUFROCK &quot;I grow old...I grow old.../I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled&quot; and &quot;We have lingered in the chambers of the sea/By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown/Till human voices wake us, and we drown.&quot;) to the great FOUR QUARTETS (&quot;In my beginning is my end&quot;), this poet rattled the universe and simultaneously whispered solace in our ears like few others have done. While my own energies are always looking for the new in poets and in writers, finding that the throne of literature has never been so sought after, I am deeply moved by returning to the masters, the source of it all. This is a fine collection for the Eliot devotees as well as for those who seek to appreciate the great voices of literature. Here are savoury moments in abundance!"},{"Title":"Collected Poems 1909-1962","review":"Love him or hate him, you cannot deny his power. All arguments for and against Mr. Eliot can be countered easily and each have in them flaws that are substantial. T. S. Eliot cannot be read like most poets. Like the eastern scriptures he so loved, Eliot will take a lifetime for the reader to digest. Read and re-read. Question and re-read again. I became familiar with his works years ago. I have yet to tire of them. Eliot will grow with you, for his poems are the story of a man always growing and always searching. Discount the fighting that academics have over him. Read him for yourself. Immerse yourself in the spiral of darkness and light that is his poetry and judge for yourself. In the end, no matter what you think, you will not be able to deny his effect."},{"Title":"Collected Poems 1909-1962","review":"I became familiar with Eliot's work chronologically, learning something new at each step. &quot;Prufrock&quot; introduced me to modern poetical structure, &quot;The Waste Land&quot; showed me how literary allusion can enrich verse, &quot;Ash-Wednesday&quot; refreshed the world of religious poetry, and the supernal &quot;Four Quartets&quot; was for me a metaphysical insight of the greatest beauty.Eliot is without a doubt the finest poet of the 20th century, perhaps the finest poet ever. His contributions to the poets who came after him, and to literature in general, are persistently evident. Eliot doesn't always succeed, and many of his poems seem trite and pretentious, but when he succeeds he hits dead on with poetry perfect in form, balance, and sound. There is the man here, the poet as reflected in his own work, but there is also common human experience through looking at history (&quot;The Waste Land&quot;) and meditating on Man's relationship with the Divine and the eternal (Ariel Poems, and most of his output after 1928)."},{"Title":"Collected Poems 1909-1962","review":"When you think of the best poets ever, T.S. Eliot is one of those that comes to mind. His work is well crafted, intelligent, beautifully written, and has a flow to it that few poets can match. And this is a fine collection for the Eliot lover or for the reader unfamiliar with Eliot. It's divided into several sections. The first section is his Prufrock section, poems from 1917, which contains probably his finest poems: \\"Prufrock\\", \\"Preludes\\" \\"Rhapsody on a Windy Night\\", \\"Hysteria\\", among others. Then there is the Poems 1920 section which also contains many fine poems (\\"Sweeney Erect\\" and \\"The Hippopotamus\\" being my favorites). Then follows his masterpiece The Wasteland. Then The Hollow Men which is followed by the wonderful Ash Wednesday. Then the Ariel Poems (which contains \\"Journey of the Magi\\"). Then there are two unfinished poems, \\"Sweeney Agonistes\\" and \\"Coriolan\\" which I thought were weak. Maybe they would have been great had he ever finished them. Then there is a section called minor poems followed by the mediocre \\"Choruses from 'The Rock.' And then there is what I consider to be his true masterpiece, \\"Four Quartets.\\" And the book finishes with some occasional verses, one of which is a sweet and touching poem to his wife. This is a great collection of poems."},{"Title":"Collected Poems 1909-1962","review":"Responding to the response to the first review.

This volume, _Collected Poems_, contains the complete poems Eliot wrote in his adulthood except for _Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats_ and, of course, the plays (to be found in _Collected Plays_."},{"Title":"Collected Poems 1909-1962","review":"PRUFOCK AND OTHER OBSERVATIONSTHE LOVESONG OF J. ALFRED PRUFOCKThis poem is a beauty. The language is so fluent that it flows lightly and evenly between our ears and its music is perfect and delightful. The images build up a crown or a wreath, according to tastes, life and death mixing equally with love and gloat. Deeply shakespearian by its syntax it is pure Chopin by its music, both rhythm and notes.THE WASTE LANDOne of T.S. Eliot's bestknown poems. What I am feeling is more an impression than a meaning. The world is old, like coming to its end, decaying. The poet sees and only sees. It is soundless and yet it is music. He brings together all sorts of recollections, experiences and small vignettes of the world, and a whole array of references to all kinds of cultures to show how the past is foregone and the future is not there. There remains only the thunder that speaks unaudible sounds of farewell on a road we cannot even see, nor follow as for that.THE HOLLOW MENIt is the end of the world, and this is nothing but a whimper because men are hollow. They do not contain anything. They are ghosts of history, so that history itself is a ghost and the world has no future. This poem is extremely and astoundingly modern indeed. NO FUTURE.ASH WEDNESDAYThis poetry is entirely dedicated to death, but also to the time between birth and death, a time of turning, a time that is felt like flying, going, flowing but there is no word, no world able to whirl any sound. Men are like living deads, already dead and moving towards death with no hope, except maybe the hope of God, but God is silent, so there is the only consolation of the Lady who is also silent and comes only after death to stare more than anything else.CHORUSES FROM THE ROCKWhere is the Life we have lost in living ? Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge ? Where is the knowledge we have lost in information ? These choruses are entirely dedicated to God, but with some original approach. What is important is what comes from God. God is light, but a light that is invisible and it is this invisible light that must help us never to forget that man is spirit and body, just like the Temple, and that the spirit suffers when the body suffers. And the body does suffer a lot in our mechanical times. The body is split in myriads of individuals who do not think the body as one, and society as one, and this oneness as communion with the light of God, an invisible light in a time when touching is the proof of existence.FOUR QUARTETSBy far the crowning of T.S. Eliot's poetry. The evanescent equilibrium point between a whole set of couples of antagons. The present is such a point, but demultiplied by a myriad of other couples. Past-Future, Has-been-Might-have-been, and this point is movement, constantly moving between those antagons. It gives you a vertigo, the vertigo we feel in front of the present that is a constantly moving equilibrium point. Fascinating. Men are no longer hollow but they are unstoppable motion. They are some light, fine and fuzzy moving line between all the antagons of human nature, of nature as for that. Then a long and rich metaphor of life with the sea, neverending movement that ignores past and future but is pure present and nothing else. Men and women can only worship this everlasting present motion, time and place that is no time, no place and no motion, just unstable energy burnt in its own existence.OLD POSSUM'S BOOK OF PRACTICAL CATSA set of nice and musical poems on various cats. They are enchanting and light and every rhyme is the best, each one better than all the others. A little book to be given to boys and girls who do not know yet that language is art and speaking may be a compliment to their lives.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Collected Poems 1909-1962","review":"Certainly this is a valuable and nicely done volume of Eliot's work. But the Centenary Edition of his collected poetry does not contain many of the pieces claimed in the Reilly review. It certainly does not include any of Eliot's plays--as should be expected in a publication titled &quot;Collected Poems.&quot; Nor does it include, in entirety or in selection, anything from &quot;Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats.&quot; I wish I had a copy of the book Kerry Reilly read: it is a volume vastly superior in content to the Collected Poems 1909-1962 published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich (cover showing). Perhaps Reilly has mistakenly reviewed Complete Poems and Plays 1909-1950 instead of Collected Poems 1909-1962.

I guess he's regarded as too highbrow and too Catholic. Anyone who tends to believe this must read &quot;Prufrock&quot; and enjoy its vigour, its irony and its sheer cleverness. I always loved the tremendous amount of aggression in those early Eliot poems, very often directed at the speaker himself. Once you've come to like the young Mr Eliot, you might give the later stuff a try as well. Far from being &quot;junk&quot;, the Quartets do not just have a fascinating musical structure, but also embody a view of life, history and religion which is not so daft after all..."},{"Title":"Collected Poems 1909-1962","review":"Eliot's mastery of the complicated form and intense imagery of modernist poetry is without comparison. His complexity of allusion and intertextuality, his irreverence in moments of drama, his quirky and sometimes self-deprecating humour amidst the brightness and freshness of his own particular brand of the modernist form is starkly and completely unique.Eliot is a landscape populated with the dirty, smelly working class amidst mythical themes and figures; his imagery both divine and shockingly, intimately basic; his often symphonic (ie Preludes) form so true to the rejection of a linear narrative.Some may see some of Eliot's work as overly bizarre or even inaccessible; but even ignoring the grandness of allusion, the sheer, glancing quality of his lyricism and his offbeat yet exact dynamic of construction make this some of the most wonderful poetry ever. There is such depth here, both for the mind to grasp and the heart to love, that to begin Eliot is to begin walking an ever broadening highway: reassurance both of the ground beneath one's feet and the hazy horizon at the edge of the eye's range."},{"Title":"Collected Poems 1909-1962","review":"This book is the definitive collection of T.S. Eliot's work. It includes an amazing collection of poems, from the renowned &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,&quot; to &quot;The Hollow Men&quot; and everything in between. The poems are arranged, for the most part, in chronological order, in a manner that faciliates a better understanding of Eliot's growth as a writer. It also includes plays, including the famous &quot;Murder in the Cathedral,&quot; about Thomas a Beckett and &quot;Cocktail Party&quot; and &quot;Family Reunion,&quot; both of which are considered to be some of Eliot's best work. For all those cat-lovers, it includes the entire &quot;Old Possum's Book of Cats.&quot; At the core of the book, the reader will find &quot;The Four Quartets&quot; which is considered by many to be the greates of all Eliot's work."},{"Title":"Collected Poems 1909-1962","review":"The most discussed, frequently invoked 20th-century poet in both American as well as British literature academic arenas (the advantage of a St. Louis birth place and brief Harvard education), Eliot offers toe-holds, certainties, and assurances to readers even as he satisfies their need to proclaim their own latter-day modernity. Compare Eliot to his immediate predecessor, Mathew Arnold, the man-of-letters, poet, and cultural critic of his time. Like Eliot's, Arnold's poetic output was relatively modest, and his cultural criticism, like Eliot's, exposed the barrenness, fragmentation, excessive subjectivity and self-consciousness of the present while proclaiming the triumphant unity, objectivity, and visionary perspective of an earlier poetry.But whereas Arnold lays upon the reader the onerous project of reclaiming Greek epic and tragedy, Eliot asks us merely to make touch with the archetypal landscape of the unconscious self and to reclaim the concrete and clever poetry of Shakespeare's immediate descendants, the \\"Metaphysics.\\" And whereas Arnold in his poetry struggles to overcome his own romanticism, more often than not demonstrating an inability to produce poetry capable of rising above repetitious elegy and brooding despair, Eliot's offers us a body of work that is remarkably coherent, whole, of a piece.In the poetry from \\"Prufrock\\" through \\"The Wasteland\\" and \\"Hollow Men,\\" the themes and patterns of the collective unconscious provide a solid, dependable substratum to the motifs, the repeated cultural \\"fragments,\\" the objective correlatives which occur and recur until, more than in any other poetry, they lodge indelibly, memorably in the reader's consciousness. In the poetry from \\"Ash Wednesday\\" to \\"Four Quartets\\" the seemingly unconnected images and objective correlatives achieve grammatical order and thematic coherence through their elevation to the sacramental, to a vision of the \\"word\\" not as the product of the self's struggle with the deep regions of the unconscious but as the incarnation of meaning descending from higher realms of purification and grace.As the foremost representative, even prototype, of literary \\"modernism,\\" Eliot's work is at the same time as neat and tidy a body of poetry as that produced by any other poet--orderly to the point of being anal. It's little wonder that he retains his interest and popularity. It's smaller wonder yet that the guy was incapable of understanding let alone appreciating a work as resistent to ready explanation, as \\"messy\\" as \\"Hamlet.\\""},{"Title":"Collected Poems 1909-1962","review":"Yep, this is a great collection of Eliot's works.

Of course now I realize that the level on which I read most of these poems (visceral, emotional), was barely scratching the surface of the author's craftsmanship or intent. Perhaps these were meant to be unlocked only by the academic, but I am of the school of thought that the author's intention is secondary to the primary effect of the text as an independent object. So if I as a teenager was able to attatch personal significance to &quot;Prufrock&quot; notwithstanding my total lack of background, that is a valid and important experience.I bought this book this time around for a close friend, hoping he could experience some of the musical dizziness of words and recognition of the cyclical darkness and illumination which I felt as a first time reader."},{"Title":"Collected Poems 1909-1962","review":"That's all I need to say.

The message of modern mankind's meaninglessness, the broken fragments ( of Tradition) shored against his ruin is replaced by the vision of sacred turning, a Christian vision of redemption. Eliot is a writer whose work and life break down into these two distinct periods each of which has its champions in defining what is best in him.As one raised on 'April is the cruelest month, breeding lilacs out of the dead land' and 'Let us go then you and I when the evening is spread out against the sky, like a patient etherized upon a table' the most memorable lines are certainly of the first phase where it ends not with a bang but with a whimper.Yet my admiration for the hypnotic power of Eliot's memorable lines is strongly qualified by my knowledge of his 'Burbank with a Baedaker, and Bluestein with a Cigar' with his all too fashionable literary anti- Semitism. Of course Eliot was not preaching death camps and extermination but he did connect his work to the tradition of Christian Anti- Semitism.Thus I have always had difficulty being comfortable with my 'enjoying of Eliot's poetry. And I have never been able to sympathetically read 'The Quartets.' They have always seemed to me to be too impersonal characterless and abstract.Eliot who for most of the century strode the English Departments as if he were a colossus did noble work in reviving interest in 'The Metaphysicals' but somehow failed in my mind to write a poetry humanly rich in the deepest sense."},{"Title":"Collected Poems 1909-1962","review":"The Hollow Men (1927)(T.S. [Thomas Stearns] Eliot 1888-1965)Did T.S. Eliot have a sense of humor? I don't know; but, I sure as heck hope so. Because as we reach its end, the greatest poet of the 20th Century seems destined to be remembered as the guy who wrote Cats. His banishment from the canon was probably inevitable, what with being a white male Christian and the whiff of anti-Semitism wafting from him, but if he ever had a chance to cling to his spot on the basis of his early classics like The Wasteland and Prufrock, works like The Hollow Men pretty much guaranteed he would be consigned to oblivion. For this poem, while not as coherent an attack on Modern values or lack of said, as the writings of someone like C.S.

Our dried voices, when We whisper together Are quiet and meaningless As wind in dry grass Or rat's feet over broken glass In our dry cellarShape without form, shade without color, Paralyzed force, gesture without motion;Those who have crossed With direct eyes, to death's other kingdom Remember us - if at all - not as lost Violent souls, but only As the hollow men The stuffed men.IIEyes I dare not meet in dreams In death's dream kingdom These do not appear: There, the eyes are Sunlight on a broken column There, is a tree swinging And voices are In the wind's singing More distant and more solemn Than a fading star.Let me be no nearer In death's dream kingdom Let me also wear Such deliberate disguises Rat's coat, crowskin, crossed staves In a field Behaving as the wind behaves No nearer -Not that final meeting In the twilight kingdomIIIThis is the dead land This is the cactus land Here the stone images Are raised, here they recieve The supplication of a dead man's hand Under the twinkle of a fading star.Is it like this In death's other kingdom Waking alone At the hour when we are Trembling with tenderness Lips that would kiss Form prayers to broken stone.IVThe eyes are not here There are no eyes here In this valley of dying stars In this hollow valley This broken jaw of our lost kingdomsIn this last of meeting places We grope together And avoid speech Gathered on this beach of the tumid river Sightless, unless The eyes reappear As the perpetual star Multifoliate rose Of death's twilight kingdom The hope only Of empty men.VHere we go 'round the prickly pear Prickly pear prickly pear Here we go 'round the prickly pear At five o'clock in the morning.Between the idea And the reality Between the motion And the act Falls the shadowFor Thine is the Kingdom Between the conception And the creation Between the emotion And the response Falls the shadowLife is very longBetween the desire And the spasm Between the potency And the existance Between the essence And the descent Falls the shadowFor Thine is the Kingdom For Thine is Life is For Thine is theThis is the way the world ends This is the way the world ends This is the way the world ends Not with a bang but a whimperI wouldn't pretend to understand all of this, nor exactly what it is he's trying to say, but I do know what it says to me. I take it as an indictment of Modern man and the failure of confidence that characterizes us. The epigraph about Mr. Kurtz, from Conrad's Heart of Darkness (see Review), seems to harken back longingly for even such monstrous men who at least believed in what they were doing, however horrific the results. It sets up a natural contrast to the hollowness of Modern man , who fundamentally believes in nothing and is, therefore, empty at the core of his being, like a Guy Fawkes dummy.Two other powerful images really appeal to me. The comparison of the sound of modern voices to &quot;rat's feet over broken glass&quot; aptly dismisses all of the psycho babble and faux spirituality of the age, all of modernity's futile effort to replace the beliefs that have been discarded. And, of course, the great lines, &quot;This is the way the world ends Not with a bang but a whimper&quot; remind me of an argument that I used to enjoy during the Cold War when such melodramatics seemed more appropriate; that it would be better to just juke it out with the USSR, just let the missiles fly, than to gradually succumb to Communist domination. Of course, this seems like the product of unbalanced minds now that we've triumphed, but think back to things like Dr. Strangelove and you get a feel for the tenor of the confrontation between absolutists and appeasers. I for one preferred the bang to the whimper.This is a powerful poem that rewards repeated readings, revealing different interpretations and images with each successive return.GRADE: B+"},{"Title":"Collected Poems 1909-1962","review":"I'm writing a paper on T. S. Eliot's use of quotation in The Waste Land, and I would love to quote your review as one possible viewpoint on the finished product of a \\"cut and paste\\" poem. I would also love to argue passionately with you about your assessment . . . Eliot's utilization of the scope of not only Western but Eastern literature does not erase his own contribution, but places him firmly in the ranks of the greatest. His own brilliance shines through.Also, for the purposes of actual review, I have ordered but not yet experienced this book; however, having read most of what's in it, I can say without reservation, this is some of the most profound writing you will ever read. Ash-Wednesday changed my life. Four Quartets showed me how to live it from there."},{"Title":"Collected Poems 1909-1962","review":"The Wasteland is a poem that has been severely edited by the \`superior craftsman' Pound. We have a poem in five sections in free verse, freighted with erudition, literary allusions, quotations, cribbing lines from old poems, Dante,Shakespeare, Spenser, Marvell, Goldsmith, Baudelaire, Wagner, Nerval,Augustine and Buddha.He mingles a line from Marvel,say, with snatched overheard conversation or a fragment of stage dialogue to produce an effect as of an orchestra tuning up.He has transformed bits and pieces of cultural scrap into a new broken,dissonant form.We know Eliot had had a breakdown and had taken leave from work when he wrote The Waste Land. There is a merging of the personal and the political. With Eliot's desire to escape from his personality through detachment in his work, he uses impersonality. The technique where variations of mental state are depicted through various personae and voices is radically experimental. We have a fractured narrative, changing voices and tonal shifts and we cannot identify who the voices are: who \`we' \`us' or \`I' is.Through the indolence of illness he tapped the depths of his subconscious.He emphasises the aural imagination.We need to remember Eliot is a major dramatic poet,(his most experimental work is Sweeney Agonistes)using dramatic monologue, dramatic meditation, striving to grasp a metaphysical condition that could be called religious in a world that knew nothing of it at a time when Eliot was non-Christian. He draws on the mythical method he admires in Ulysses, but the result is incoherent and messy. We also get voices from the music-hall, like the Victorian novel, a dying form with the rise of cinema, with Eliot doing a \`turn'.What unifies everything is the subtle music of the soul, a passive undriven music of Eliot's best poetry. As Leavis said:\\" The unity the poem aims at is that of an inclusive consciousness: the organisation it achieves as a work of art is...an organization that may, by analogy, be called musical\\". Poetry to Eliot approximates to the experience of listening to music. The notes, the intellectual apparatus, the references, the allusions, need to be dropped to appreciate this poem. He said poetry could communicate even before it was understood. Beautiful poem that it is, I tend to believe that Yeats, holding to traditional forms has, in the longer run, in the 20th century, been much more influential.After the pre-Christian modernist spurt of The Wasteland came the Eliot of the Four Quartets, the High Anglican who believed that the Church was going to lead Europe out of the disruptions and darkness of the Thirties. And then, after he'd won the Nobel Prize in 1948, there was a much calmer and more confident Eliot altogether. Prufrock ,his early poem is also a great favorite with some startling imagery and sly humour.This American expatriate took to English poetry and criticism (Sacred Wood,Tradition and the Individual Talent etc.)and cultivated a new kind of innovative spoken poetry.I still think The Wasteland had a greater intensity thanhis Christian poetry,once he had found belief.He was the modernist par excellence."},{"Title":"Collected Poems 1909-1962","review":"I'll quote from Prufrock 'til I'm a pair of ragged claws.

Scott Fritzgerald, John Steinbback and other white literary luminaries. Seldom are African-American names mentioned or acknowledged in terms of their presence as well as literary output from France. Michael Fabre, author of &quot;The Unfinished Quest of Richard Wright&quot;, who was a Black expatriate from the United States, provides us with a history of Black writers who from 1840 to 1980 came to France as expatriates. Most people are unaware that Blacks from Louisiana were the first handful from the States to come to France for education, freedom and to write. From this small group the tradition continued with Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Du Bois and other great Black intellectuals.Why did they come? France's tradition of liberty, equality and brotherhood was an attraction. Throughout the early 20th century, Blacks came to escape the racism of America and have the opportunity to work in their craft which was denied them in Europe. France's &quot;lack&quot; of racism was a breath of fresh air to African Americans under the mantle of segregation. France enabled them as writers to be artistically free. Each generation of Black writers who came to France were inspired by its so called liberalism. Yet even in its liberalism Black writers in the 60's began to scrutinize the racism of France that was articulated in its treatment of those colonials from Algeria and Senegal.Fabre critiques each individual writer who came and gives us a historical context in which we can understand the unique spell that France had over attracting Black writers. The text concentrates on Black males since few Black female writers stayed over for any length of time. Those that did are given an even treatment. From Harlem to Paris gives one an appreciation for the contributions of Black writers in France. It is a book to have in one's library for literary studies of African Americans and expatriate writers."},{"Title":"Playboy -Back Issue - May.- 1998- Arianna Huffington on Bill Clinton","review":"Playboy May 1998 is 176 pages and feature Geri Halliwell (aka Ginger Spice) on the front cover.

Wide-ranging and well-informed, what's so surprising is that the book was produced with no official help from Warner Bros. or any of the participants: the authors had to go out there, dig up the stories for themselves and separate fact from fiction. How successful they were was borne out when I was commissioned by the studio to write a book on the film (subsequently withdrawn and pulped at Friedkin's behest) with full access to all the documentation in the studio's archives as well as masses of deleted footage and audio and several of the surviving principals. Every other time I thought I had a scoop, it turned out to be in this volume: and where the authors were wrong, it wasn't by much. Yes, there are inaccuracies and errors, but it's still by far the best book on one of the seminal blockbusters, and more deserving of a reprint than many of the similar tomes currently available."},{"Title":"The Vedanta Way to Peace and Happiness","review":"I'm over sixty now.

Rarely does one have the opportunity to read actual accounts of the difficulties individuals went through in an effort to seek out their own personal business and survive during the 1800's. When we study the development of the western portion of the US we picture carts and wagons of pioneers struggling to a new life. Rarely do we realize that a tremendous amount of development occurred before there were wagon roads and much of this activity was accomplished with the use of mules packing supplies to the many places we visit by car. Mules and mule packing was one of the few ways to convey large amounts of necessary items during the western development. The book Journal of Mule Train Packing in Eastern Washington in the 1860's by James W.

But i dont. The problem isnt the recipes, they are well authored, there is a lot of information about the ingredients, there are several variations of many recioes. The problem is the kindlization of the book. There are two indexes, Subjects and Recipes. Neither contains page numbers or location numbers or hot links. So they are just a list of things you could,at best, consider to be search terms. However, you cannot rely on their finding anything useful. Case in point: the subject index contains the phrase \\"tips for starters\\" as in sourdough starters. If you enter this term in your kindle search, you get one result: the listing in the Subject Index. Circular and useless. I own many Kindle cookbooks.

I have tried several of the recipes and they have all turned-out reasonably well.Many of the recipes in the book require a great deal of manual intervention and shaping, so sure you can make croissant dough in your automatic bread machine--if you transfer the dough in and out of the machine several times, coat butter bits with flour and freeze them, roll out the dough and shape it--but should you? There are also a lot of quick-bread recipes that are often easier to just mix and bake traditionally. In the end, it seems like 75% of the recipes are either so manually intensive that your automatic bread machine is essentially just a nice place to let dough rise or they are so simple without using a bread machine that the machine is just an unnecessary step.While there is no shortage of recipes in the book, there is a shortage of a few other things: the cheap paperback binding won't lay flat, there is not a single picture in the book; and, most serious, the index is horrible and simply a listing of the recipe names. This is a huge problem in a nearly 700-page recipe book. You cannot find recipes by main ingredients: for instance \\"Orange Bread with White Chocolate, Apricots, and Walnuts\\" is listed in the index under \\"orange\\" but it is not listed under \\"white,\\" \\"chocolate,\\" \\"apricots,\\" or \\"walnuts.\\"If this book were limited to only recipes that are both reasonable to make in an \\"automatic\\" bread machine and that benefit in some way from doing so; and also contained a usable index and maybe a few pictures, I would give it a much higher rating."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I have made over 10 different breads from this book.

I orginally thought that having a bread machine meant I could toss all the ingredients in, walk away and come back to a perfect loaf of bread every time. Eh, not quite so easy.But Hensperger gives us all the information we need to produce our miraculously light and delicious breads. We just have to read carefully. For example, there's a review here on Amazon that says she didn't emphasize the difference between vital wheat gluten and just plain old gluten. But she spent half a page doing exactly that.I knew NOTHING about making bread when I bought my breadmachine and this book a couple months ago. I also bought multigrain flour and dove right in. I relied heavily on the troubleshooting section that starts on pg 38 \\"What can go wrong and how to fix it.\\" I made several of dense but delicous loaves and ended up throwing out only half of one loaf (total) where the inside was too doughy to be edible.And now, I can make any of these recipes, substituting any variety of flours or other ingredients, with ease. It's not that I'm a particularly clever cook. I just kept going back to the front section of the book (and the blurbs in between sections) and re-reading until I fully understood the how bread gets made.Breadmachines vary in terms of what they can do. Flours vary in terms of their protein levels. Eggs vary in terms of their size (and therefore, how much liquid they contribute to the mix). Yeasts and other ingredients vary in quality and effectiveness. Climates vary in terms of their humidity. Cooks vary in their skill levels. By starting at the very beginning, Hensperger educates and makes it possible for us to maximize what our machines are capable of.It's a frustrating road for a beginner to travel. But it's well worth it. When I served up the Buttermilk Bread with Lavender with a honey/butter spread for dinner last night (I substituted 2/3 multigrain flour), it was one of the most delicious things I have ever served.The Light Whole Wheat Bread and Honey Whole Wheat Bread recipes are recommended. The Buttermilk Whole Wheat Bread recipe gets rave reviews from everyone who eats it and is my regular daily bread.I highly recommend this book. Read carefully. Be willing to fail a few times.

I've searched online for recipes that might meet our specific needs, but few had reviews. If this bread making thing was going to truly be part of our life (and for what I paid for the machine it had better be!), I needed a LOT of recipes. I bought this book with slight hesitation because although most give the book high marks, I wasn't sure how many recipes I'd be able to use as is or how easily I'd be able to adapt recipes. Was this the book for us? Oh yes, it is!Made our first loaf of bread last night and it was a winner. I made the first loaf recipe in the book - pg. 26: Homestyle White Bread. I substituted the 1 1/8 C water with 1 1/8C hemp milk (leaving out the water and 2T nonfat dry milk completely) and the 2T butter with 2T canola oil. It was wonderful! We only have one person with allergies, and NOBODY else likes her hemp milk, but the taste was still great. Maybe if we'd made the recipes using cow's milk in the past we'd be able to taste a difference?There are some recipes we won't use at all because they call for either cheese, nuts or both. I mean, what's the point in making Parmesan Nut Bread without the cheese or nuts? ;-) But there are others that we can just leave the nuts out of, and I'll experiment with the cheese and evaporated milk recipes to see what may work instead. The Beer Bread with Cheddar may work with fine Daiya cheddar style shreds, for example.Gluten-Free people - there's a small section for you, but I haven't seen any reviews detailing it, so here you are: there are 7 recipes in the section, but I guess only 6 for you (weird, IMO)- GF Cinnamon Raisin Bread- GF Mock Light Rye- GF Ricotta Potato Bread- GF Buttermilk White Bread- GF Chickpea, Rice, and Tapioca Flour Bread- GF Almond and Dried Fruit Holiday BreadThat 7th recipe is a Low-Gluten White Spelt Bread and what it's doing in the GF section I'll never understand, but there you go.No matter your allergies, I highly suggest looking through theThe Whole Foods Allergy Cookbook: Two Hundred Gourmet & Homestyle Recipes for the Food Allergic Family. She has a chart on pg. 7 entitled \\"Substituting the Substitutions\\" which can help you adapt recipes to suit your needs. You just use the chart to substitute in reverse.Hope this helps!Update 07/29/2011:We've been using this book for 2 months now and I'm still quite pleased with it. We use the machine 2-3x/week. I've made a couple of the semolina breads, and quite frankly wouldn't again. Semolina flour is quite expensive and I didn't find the breads worth the extra cost. I wouldn't lower the number of stars, though. Taste is such a subjective thing. And I am not able to taste small changes in flavor like some people can. The textures of every bread have been spot on, and flavors have been good. *That* is why this book still gets my 5 stars.A note about the quick breads (banana, carrot, etc): My first 2-3 loaves were underdone. The book said this would happen and that I should just cook it a bit longer. With my machine I was unable to do this, because it won't let me turn it right back on if it's hot. I had to wait for 15+ minutes to get the machine cool enough for a restart, and then it wouldn't cook through, even with an additional 40 mins! BUT. I finally realized that although my machine doesn't work the way the book said it should, *I* was not cooking the bread properly. I misunderstood the directions which say to cook on the \\"quick bread/cake\\" cycle. I was cooking on the \\"quick\\" bread cycle - very different from the \\"quick bread\\" cycle! Once I tried baking the breads on the \\"cake\\" cycle, they turned out as they should with no additional time neeed.One final note: For our taste, the carrot bread requires only 2 tsp cinnamon and the zucchini only 1. We substitute the sour cream called for in the banana bread with plain coconut yogurt and it's delicious :-)"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I had my breadmaker in the car, ready to take it to the thrift store. Maybe someone else could make it work, Lord knows I couldn't.Back in my younger years, I made my bread by hand and it was wonderful, that smell, the taste and texture, but nothing I made in the bread machine turned out that way.I took the breadmaker (a breadman) out of my car and decided to try one more time to make bread. I bought a bread machine mix and low and behold, the bread came out fine. So what was the secret???Well, it turns out that the secrets are in this book. I bought this book because $2.99 a box for that bread mix is too steep for me, when I loaf of bread from the store is less than a buck fifty (for now).The first thing I noticed about this book is that it's HEAVY! It's got over 400 pages! But it's not intimidating.I read through the first portion of the book and then went to the store to buy the vital wheat gluten that is so needed to make good bread machine bread. I followed the first recipe and had super success! Every recipe is broken down into easy to follow directions. it's lovely. And the bread is excellent.I am making pizza dough now and have already put two portions of dough in the fridge for our pizza dinner tonight. I might make some more for calzones to freeze for lunches later in the week.With just a few good core ingredients added to my cabinet (vital wheat gluten - not gluten flour), SAF yeast, and good flour, I am making great bread now.If I could ask for anything else, it would be photos to accompany recipes, but I am going to try them out anyway, even without photos to tempt me.My Breadman has received a reprieve and I am delighted to say that my bread paddle has been happy spinning out wonderful loaves for my family all week."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I am an experienced bread machine baker (over 10 years). While many of the recipes in this book are excellent, beware of the ingredients ratios. In my machine I had to cut back a lot on tne yeast. I used both the recommended SAF and Fleishmans Bread machine yeast with similar over-risen results. My pages are filled with notes on ingredient and baking modificatiobns. You may have to adjust your proportions according to your machine or do the baking solely in the oven after an observed rise. I even had a case of oven baking where the loaf \\"exploded\\" out of the baking pan due to way too much yeast."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I love this book. I have at least ten bread books and this one is the one I give as gifts. I have had great success with every recipe I've tried. I saw a comment here from someone about recipes being too wet or the ingredient order being wrong for their machine. Different machines have different recommended ingredient orders and Beth does tell the reader to follow their mfgr's recommended order. Babysitting the dough at the beginning is necessary for any recipe not used before. No adjustment may be needed, but then again scooped flour is heavier than sifted or spooned flour and unless one knows how the author measures flour, the results can be too wet or too dry and the dough may need to be adjusted. I've been making bread for many years and still prefer to back mine in the oven. Perhaps being an experienced baker helps with all bread books. I've written ten of my own bread recipes in the past two years. I've seen no inherrent problems in this book. Bread machines save the pain in my arthritic shoulders."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I had this book from our local library.

I went in looking for a simple little bread book, but ended up getting this - the largest and most comprehensive one in the store - mainly because it had a recipe for whole wheat pizza crust! (And several other pizza crusts - whereas other books only had one generic crust recipe.)I use this several times a week, though I have not ventured into the realm of sourdough breads just yet. I have become a big fan of the recipes that can be made using a delay timer. Since I am not a morning person at all, I usually assemble the dry ingredients for several loaves in tupperware containers on the weekend and attach a post-it with the instructions for wet ingredients and yeast. Then in the morning it is quick and easy to put it all in the machine. I have not once bought a pre-made machine mix! (Though she does give some recipes to jazz up store-bought mixes.)I have had a few instances of \\"crater bread\\" that I have found all seemed to happen with recipes calling for the French Bread cycle. I have not determined if this is a problem with the recipes or with my machine, so I'll need to play around to try to solve that. My only other complaint is that many of the breads call for dairy or eggs and thus can't be used with the delay timer. I would like to see some \\"breakfast\\" breads that could be made overnight, but nearly all the ones in this book say they are not suitable for the delay timer.As other reviewers have mentioned, this book gives tons of background notes, information on ingredients, and information about specialty breads, such as gluten-free.Overall, I would highly recommend this book to those wanting to get the most out of their bread machine."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I'm a newbie to bread making via machine and this book is a God-send. The author goes into detail as to the \\"why\\" you need to measure accurately, how your machine does what it does, different types of flours, and general trouble shooting for breadmaking. Yes...great recipies too, but what I really appreciate is understanding HOW great bread is created and finding the secret tips to doing fantastic bread baking. She also includes recipes for things like pasta making (on the dough setting) and other fun things to try. Highly recommended!

Clear, well written instructions that can be used in almost every bread making machine. Ms. Hensperger has written a thick book (and there are few things I like better than THICK recipe books!) full of breads, cakes, jams....everything you ever thought you could do with a breadmaker, and a few you probably didn't.I've tested several of them, and each loaf is wonderful."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I found this to be the best written bread machine cookbook of several I have tried. Every recipe works great and all of the helpful asides on how breads work, types of flour, shaping custom loaves, storing bread, using old bread... these make it more than worth it. The author writes well, is experienced, and there are enough recipes and tips to keep you busy for years.I would avoid the digital edition though. I tried the paperback version (initially from my local library) and loved it. I thought I'd avoid the hassle of storing yet another (fairly large) cookbook by trying the digital edition. It's adequate and in some ways easier (no weighting pages open, and I know what to recipe titles I want to search for), but the formatting of the recipe ingredients is pretty poor. The publisher / editor clearly didn't proofread the converted digital version.Examples: sometimes ingredients are listed two on one line, making it easy to miss something if you're not paying attention. Sometimes fractions aren't shown properly; you'll wonder why you have to add \\"4 14 cups bread flour\\" instead of \\"4 1/4 cups\\". Lots of little things like this get annoying, and mar and otherwise excellent cookbook.All that said: I still love the recipes, and use the digital version with a bit of extra vigilance."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I bought this book because of the good reviews. After making several of the recipes, I have to add my own kudos. The recipes are so much better than the ones included with my bread machine, and chapters in WHY the recipes were done as they were were wonderful to read. I now make fantastic bread that my family loves (but don't forget the salt. That failure was definitely NOT the fault of the recipe).I'm making pizza tonight .. The recipe is foolproof, and I had no idea before that' i could freeze half the dough for next time. With only 2 of us for most meals, that's such a time saver.And I no longer buy 'artisan bread' at the bakery. This book and my bread machine have made our meals so much more tasty. It's SO well worth the cost!!!Am adding s bit more from my experience: first, i never buy hamburger or hotdog buns any more. I make instant potato bread or our family favorite pain ordinaries au beurre, then follow the instructions under hamburger/hotdog buns. Delicious, and they're dense enough to hold up under juicy fillings without falling apart.I do wish they'd include instructions for 1lb loaves like they do for 1.5 and 2 lb loaves, but now I just make the 1.5 lb loaves and not worry if I have a slice or two left over. That's rare anyway. Yes, she mentions cutting the ingredients of the 2lb recipes in half, but I always forget that for a few ingredients and the result isn't good.I do normally add more flour .. I simply set a timer for 5 minutes after the machine starts and then check to see if the dough looks too wet.I have post-it's all over the book for recipes I want to try,but I have red ones on the 'tried and loved' ones and we keep going back to those. They're so good!"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I continue to make bread using this book - never fails. I use the Zojirushi (pardon the spelling) brand 1 lb bread machine, so I halve the quantities for the larger loaf recipes. I would recommend this as a required book for anyone using a bread machine. Lots of options, including background information on ingredients / origin of recipe etc."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"This book is a complete baker's resource for the bread machine! I have baked all my family's bread in the bread machine for a few years now, and I wish I'd had this book at the very beginning! The information is so valuable, from types of flours to substitutions to equipment. I really feel I can't do without this book!I've tried several recipes, and they have all turned out absolutely delicious, but I must offer one caveat: she always seems to use way too much yeast. Living at an elevation of 3300 feet, I'm used to reducing yeast in bread recipes by 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon; however, I have to drastically reduce it in almost all of these recipes. As an example, the loaf I make most often calls for 1 tablespoon plus 1/2 teaspoon of yeast; I only use 1 teaspoon, less than a third of what it calls for. This is my only complaint; just be aware that you may need to be very conservative with the leaveners.Some have criticized the lack of 100% whole grain recipes. It's true that this is not a particularly health-oriented book, and that most of the recipes call for a sizable amount of white flour. However, the few that she does include are simply the best. I'd tried making 100% whole wheat bread a few times in the past, and it was always too dry and crumbly to be useful; however, after so much success with these recipes, I tried her basic 100% whole wheat recipe, and it has turned out beautiful, moist, and tasty every time. It's now my favorite recipe. So, not very many 100% whole grain recipes, but the ones she does include are gems.If you enjoy baking with your bread machine, this book is a must-have.--Jennifer Ritchie"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I really am enjoying this book and it certainly deserves five stars for the content and recipes. It's much more than recipes; it's a wealth of information and I'm sure especially great for those new to baking bread (either with or without a machine).I don't love the binding or the pages. It's quite a thick book (about 3\\" tall since it's about 700 pages) and it has no hope of ever lying flat, even with much coaxing from me. To get it to stay open while I'm using it, I either have to have someone else hold it (and read the recipe to me) or I have to weigh down one or both sides with canisters of flour or sugar (which then makes it hard to see the page I need to read). I have about a hundred cookbooks and while they're not all spiral, lay-flat or 3-ring, I don't have any others that refuse to stay open like this one.I also do not care for the actual pages or printing. They are the color/texture of cheap construction paper or even newsprint (very greenish/gray) which creates a very low-contrast situation with the printing and makes the pages hard to read, especially if I'm not in direct light.Between the low-quality binding and pages/printing, I often have a headache by the time I have a recipe in the machine! I'm transcribing my favorite recipes to recipe cards so I don't have to deal with the actual book every time I bake.FWIW I use Fleischmann's Instant Yeast (purchased at Sam's Club) and I follow the SAF instructions and I get great results.I have several other bread machine books that are just easier to deal with, so I'm finding myself pulling this one out less and less, which is a shame. If it's going to be your only bread machine book, I cannot really recommend."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"Bought this book to go with the Zojiriushi bread machine purchased at the same time - both are excellent, the book is already proving to be an invaluable tool to perfect bread of whatever type we choose - we are very happy with it."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"We bought this book with our bread machine and we love it. We recently have had time to try her 2 week Biga (pg 243 I think) and then the following Pagnotta. OMG this is the BEST bread ever. It's very similar to an Italian bread you'd get at a fine italian restaurant for dipping in olive oil and cheese. We haven't had a bad loaf yet. We did find the Vital Wheat Gluten (not flour) at the local WalMart...you just have to search for it a bit. Ours is on a top shelf in the flour aisle. And it does seem to help. This starter in particular doesn't smell like any other starter we've ever tried and we highly recommend it. We'll also take care with the Dutch Sugar recipe due to the sugar cubes. But we haven't had any problems."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I have a pretty simple oster bread machine that I bought on a whim after seeing it on sale. I found this book because I wanted to make more than just the few recipes in the manual. Without really planning to I sat and read this cookbook from cover to cover and have been using it ever since. I have stopped buying bread and just make my own and have even felt adventerous enough to change some of the recipes to fit my own tastes and moods because the book gives a solid understanding of how making bread is supposed to occur. While I haven't made all the recipes I have made a huge number of them and if I had a problem it was usually because I messed up somehow.Here are a few tips that I have learned. Vital wheat gluten and vital wheat gluten flour work very differently. I usually use the gluten flour because it is the easiest for me to find and it works just as well. With the flour you have to use a tablespoon of the vital wheat gluten flour for each cup of bread flour that you use. You don't use that much with the plain vital wheat gluten. You follow her recipes for that or the instructions on the gluten packet. Make sure you use bread flour for your base flour and not general purpose flour. There isn't enough protein in general purpose flour for it to work well. If your bread is rising too much you may have used too much vital wheat gluten/flour or even the yeast so try reducing the amount. I always use at least a cup of bread flour but for the rest I use whatever specialty flour I feel like. Flax Flour is one of my favorites but I only use a cup of it mixed with the bread flour and another type of wheat flour. Make sure you don't forget the salt, your loaf won't rise well without it. Change out the types of \\"sugar\\" you use for changes in flavor. I use everything from honey to maple syrup and even jams or jellies and haven't had any problems. If it tastes too sweet, just reduce the amount you use next time.I've made the recipes in the bread machine then pulled the dough out and made rolls that I've then cooked in the oven as well as other types of loafs. This book has given me the confidence to try all sorts of things which is pretty amazing considering the few times I tried making bread by hand I made flour bricks that were tough enough to make a garden wall with. The real trick is to play with the recipes and make them your own. She gives you the basics to work from. Don't be afraid to do your own things with them."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"This cookbook is an excellent -- make that essential -- companion to any bread machine.

Have made maybe 1/4 of them (there are so many!) and they always turn out great. Easy to read recipes and format. I appreciate the huge background section on bread machines in the beginning, and that many recipes have the option to just make the loaf in the machine, or to make the dough in the machine and cook the bread in an alternative/traditional shape in the oven (challah comes to mind).Complaints: a lay-flat binding is always nice for cookbooks, especially ones this thick. Also I wish there were more whole wheat and whole grain recipes. Even her whole wheat bread is only half whole wheat flour. I realize that bread is tricky and entirely whole wheat breads can turn off some people, but it would be nice to have some more options in that category. I was also looking for a breadstick dough, and there is only one in this book and it requires special flour (seminola)- I haven't tried it yet but I expected breadsticks to be a little more accessible/easier to find.Overall, it's a great book and easy to use."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"nice cookbook to help you with homemade bread baking.even tells how to make pasta dough in breadmachine even if you don't have a pasta setting on your machine. so much info in this book."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"Bought a bread machine to save money and make specialty breads?...then buy this book - PERIOD!

I couldn't even imagine what went wrong--I had followed the recipe to the letter, and it wasn't a case of bad yeast (although the author's discussion of yeast is confusing and makes one doubt the validity of every recipe in the book). I wasted 4 and a half cups of good whole wheat flour on this recipe, not to mention 3 and a half tablespoons of vital wheat gluten--now if that couldn't make the crumbs stick together, nothing could!

I don't use the manual that came with my machine except for looking at the order to add ingredients and how to use it. Otherwise, I make the recipes from the book. They have all come out well. The two I recommend most highly are the SOUR CREAM BREAD and the BRIOCHE. These breads are the best I've ever had and get devoured by my family within a day. Yes, if you follow Hensperger's recipe for the BRIOCHE bread exactly you will be amazed that such a bread would come from your machine. I've made Brioche by hand, and I can tell you the result from the machine using her recipe is awesome!It's french bakery quality. Buy this book; you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"We bought this book after reading the other reviews as we were looking for something to help us make more than basic white and wheat bread. Ms. Hensperger does an excellent job of helping you understand the the different types of flour, the effect of protein, gluten, yeast, along with ratios of the various ingredients so you can confidently achieve the results you want. If you are looking to up the ante on your bread-making skills with your bread machine, or just jazz up your bread a bit, get this book! There are plenty of interesting recipes, but also the foundation information you need to really understand the whole process of bread making!"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I bought this cookbook to use with the Panasonic SD-YD250. I've only made a few recipes so far because I've only had the machine for 2+ weeks. All the bread has turned out excellent! The book is comprehensive and well written, and I can't wait to continue trying new recipes!"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I have found this bread machine guide/receipe book excellent.

I have made eight loaves of different breads and each one was great."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"This book is without a doubt, the best on the market for completeness on every aspect of making bread with a Bread Maker. I have learned so much. The recipes I have tried, have all worked perfectly. Everything you might want to know about every aspect of bread making."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"This is actually the second copy of this cookbook I have purchased, the first was a paperback version and I finally broke the spine from opening it so much! The recipes are easy to follow and customized to the size of your machine. I have not had a single loaf fail. If you only own one cookbook for your bread machine, this should be the one."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I love this book and highly recommend it! It is stock full of recipes that are well-organized. It is also full of advice and tips that have been a wonderful help to me. It does an excellent job explaining terms and explaing WHY certain ingredients are needed and what they do for the bread. And not only does it cover basic bread recipes, it also inclueds many other recipes that some higher-end machines are capable of handling: sweet breads, jams, etc.It does not have pictures, though. I don't mind, but some people might."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I purchased this book after reading the reviews. It is incredible and has so many recipes that I want to try, plus giving me tips on how to recreate some great breads I've eaten in other areas of the country. It's a great addition to any cookbook collection."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I have really enjoyed this book and it has been a great resource to make great bread with my bread machine!"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I read a review stating this book was not great for beginners but I can't disagree more. I am brand new to bread making and with the help of this book have had only successes so far -knock on wood! I know it will take me years to do all the recipes and learn all the wonderful information she has included in this book. I can't imagine ever needing another bread book. I purchased a Sunbeam Bread which I got on Amazon for only $34 and it works perfectly with this book. I can't be happier."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I received this cookbook and a Breadman TR2500BC Ultimate Plus 2-Pound Stainless-Steel Convection Breadmaker for Christmas. So far I have made two loaves of bread and a batch of strawberry jam, and I have spent the greater part of today reading the recipes and information in this cookbook. I am giving this five stars because I am confident that I will be getting the most out of my machine because of this cookbook!This book goes way beyond just variations of white and wheat bread. Additionally, there are many traditional breads from early America, the British Isles, Europe and the Mediterranean represented here. There is even a recipe for steamed Chinese buns called David SooHoo's Bao. Additionally, there are recipes for pasta dough, jams, chutney and quick breads. There are many many recipes that do not require anything more for you to do than to measure the ingredients into the pan. But there are also recipes for dinner rolls and hand-shaped breads. A bread machine does the most efficient job of kneading dough, even better than my stand mixer. Unless you have been working as a baker your entire life or kneading dough several times a week since you were eight, a bread machine is they way to go simply because of the way it kneads and helps you develop the dough.There is a wealth of information in here, from the history of the recipe to techniques and hints to help you along, as well as technical information that will help you understand what works, what doesn't work, and why.I love that I can make my own jam, I can avoid high fructose corn syrup altogether, and if I find the right pectin, I can make jam that is reduced in sugar content. I love that I have such a variety of healthy whole wheat and whole grain recipes from which to choose. I like the idea of making quick breads, because I can mix and bake with one machine instead of two, and clean up is easy.In addition to the recipes you can use in your machine, there are also recipes for: ways to use extra bread, day old bread, spreads for your fabulous bread, flavored butters and honeys, etc.This cookbook is well organized. There is a general index, which is helpful for example, if you want to go over your options for using oats, or spelt flour. There is also a recipe index, so you can quickly find the page number of an old favorite.Unlike a previous reviewer states, you do not have to use just SAF yeast for these recipes. The quantity needed for this yeast may differ from the quantity needed for other types of yeast, that's all.My only disappointment is that there are no illustrations for about six of the roll and loaf shaping techniques described. As there is such a wealth of other information here, and as I will be trying new recipes from this book for the next couple of years, I didn't allow that little point to knock my review down to four stars.To sum up: whether you bought this so that you will have plenty of recipes to use and you'll never have to knead or touch unbaked dough to have a home baked loaf, or if you want to wring every possible use out of your bread machine and don't mind getting your hands in the dough, this is a useful cookbook."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"i was just lucky - i didn't know anything about baking bread and i decided this looked like a good book. i had just received a bread machine as a gift and didn't know the first thing about making bread. this book helped explain it all and turned out DELICIOUS loafs of bread. now, mostly b/c of this book, i am an avid home baker and love to bake. this book still surprises me with the great variety of recipes you just don't find anywhere else."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"Just ordered a new hardback copy as my paperback fell apart!All but one of Beth's recipes have worked great for me.

The author knows her stuff, and has included many helpful hints on baking ingredients and techniques to ensure that you get a perfect loaf every time. You will never buy another loaf of bread from the store again!"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I have tried many other bread machine cookbooks with mixed results. This book is by far the best. I have tried many of the recipes and each has been a hit. In addition, there is a great variety of breads to choose from including savory and sweet: egg, fruit, cheese, herb, grain. Be sure to try the Cornell Bread, Pizza Crusts, and House Bread. I am making a 9-grain today and cannot wait to make the Cottage Cheese Dill Bread, Cranberry Pumpkin Bread and the Parmesan Nut Bread. There are also many options for serving my friends who do not eat dairy or refined sugar. There is no need to buy any other bread cookbook this is the one you need on your shelf."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I purchased this book based on its good reviews as a companion to a new bread machine (I have never owned a bread machine before). My goal is to make whole wheat bread at home so that I do not have to worry about the additives that most commercial whole wheat breads contain. Imagine my dismay when I turn to the whole wheat chapter, and NEARLY EVERY recipe contains \\"bread flour\\" (read: refined white flour) *and* whole wheat flour. Come on, are you serious? To me, the point of making whole wheat bread, is to make WHOLE WHEAT bread - not half-whole wheat bread. What a disappointment. I will be returning this book and will attempt to make my own recipe conversions from Laurel's Kitchen Bread Book, which doesn't have any refined white flour included in any recipe.Please understand, I am sure the recipes for white bread & hybrid white/wheat breads in this book taste good, as other reviewers have noted, but I feel the whole wheat chapter was misrepresented, and I would have never purchased the book if I knew what I know now, so hopefully this review will alert someone else who may have similar interests.Happy baking!"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I was thrilled when I received this book for a Christmas gift. I am an experienced baker and I would not recommend this book for a beginning baker or bread machine user. I have made a couple of recipes with great success. I have also had my share of failures. Like another reviewer of this book, I find that you have to watch closely and continue to add more flour than originally stated in the recipe. There are some recipes that will not turn out unless you use vital wheat gluten or SAF yeast. This book however does have numerous helpful hints and sidebars stories of interest. I agree with another reviewer who does not like the index. This book is not a total loss for me, but again I wouldn't purchase it unless I was an experienced bread machine baker."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I just received this book, and I love the subtle sweetness and hardiness of this one recipe. The whole book is worth it for this one recipe: The Cornmeal Honey bread. I'm confident that any bread maker can bring out the mastery behind this recipe. (However, the Panasonic breadmaker, the only one this company sells, makes such a flawless crust, you want to cry that you just tried something that can't possibly be made better.)My biggest problem is that there's no nutritional facts here. Maybe the author didn't want to scare his readers and earn negatives points that way, so the nutritional facts were never mentioned. Although it's clear that this book isn't for the health nut, to promote a sound sense of proportion, the book should have included an idea of how many calories each slice is. I mean, we're handling heavy substances, like buttermilk, butter, eggs, gluten, etc.; I think we should know these things, if your aim is health or not. For most of us, out of sight means out of mind, so information like this should be present. I don't want to have to do the calculations myself, so I, being a health nut, would like to know how much of any one bread I can have that's within my proportion and daily allowance."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I've made every type of bread and dough (with every type of flour) for years, and they've all turned out great--spelt, buckwheat, etc. None of those EVER required the addition of gluten, and they all came out fine. Yet this book requires (REQUIRES) you to add actual gluten to nearly every recipe--she even admits that outright in the beginning of the book (she likes how it makes a loaf rise a little nicer). So, the high gluten content found in bread flour isn't enough? I've tried some of the recipes without adding gluten, and they've turned out to be less than grand, but just a bit \\"OK\\". The reality is that the author worked these recipes based upon the addition of vital gluten to each recipe. And, many of the recipes still require plain old high-gluten bread flour. So oveall, the only thing that puts this book as a stand-out to others is that you'd better run to the store and stock up on vital gluten. How disappointing.Skip this book. Instead, I'm sticking to my mid-90's pocket book (also called The Bread Machine Cookbook) by Donna German. Her recipes are tried and true, and I've been able to substitute a few of them with spelt or buckwheat with very little adjustments--and no additional vital gluten."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"While reading reviews on bread machines, I found so many recommendations for this book that I decided to purchase it with my new bread machine.

Hensperger was an able guide as I learned what's the same and what's different between the 2 methods. Her first 3 recipes use different features (e.g. delayed baking, dough cycle) so that I felt like I knew the machine better.Two cautions:(1)In the 2000 paperback edition, the order of loading ingredients in the pan is incorrect for my Zojirushi BBCC-X20. So rely upon manufacturer's instructions.(2) It all depends on the kind of bread you like. Hensperger features recipes with light touches of seeds and nuts and all the good stuff. For example, her Dakota Bread calls for 1/3 c each sunflower and pumpkin seeds, 2 t each sesame and poppy seeds. It's a lovely bread, mind you, but I prefer a more substantial bread. The recipe we like includes 1 c rolled oats, 1/2 c each sunflower and pumpkin seeds, and 3 T each sesame and flax seeds.I was delighted to find I can use my old dough-hook recipes and just use the Zojirushi order of adding ingredients."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I bought this for my boyfriend and was a little worried since we're vegan.

This will work well for bread machine beginners or advanced bakers. I cannot understand why some other reviewers have been so negative towards this resource. The instructions are clear. Her section for beginners literally takes you step-by-step to make a perfect loaf. The troubleshooting section is somewhat slim, but it did solve a problem I was having. I wish the book had a glossary and nutritional listings for each recipe. I think this is money very well spent.

Zopf is our favorite Sunday treat now. I was afraid of the bread machine at first, because the recipes that came with it were not all successes.

Her baking tips, such as adding gluten and using SAF yeast, have helped me enormously, especially when you consider my home is at 6,000 feet altitude. I've made the Banana Bread (p. 543) twice, since my family practically inhaled the first loaf! A slice of that, toasted, with Irish butter, some fruit and a steaming mug of cappucinno is the way to start your day. And the French Sandwich Pain au Lait (p. 51)is the PERFECT white sandwich bread. The Orange-Buckwheat (p. 154) was another delicious surprise.

I started using it in my breadmaker, but have now begun adapting the recipes for use in my KitchenAid Mixer. The recipes turn out great! I love the bread from the recipes in this book a lot more than the bread from the recipes in the book that came with my machine...much softer and tastier.

I wanted to make them all.I purchased myself a copy and sent one to my mother for mothers day so she could enjoy all the great bread you can make from this book.So far I have tried 10 different recipes and each one comes out delicious, I just cant rave enough about them. I cant wait to try all the others. I personally make the dough and the shape the breads and bake in my oven. I prefer it that way and this book makes great bread no matter where you bake it.If you love bread and want some great recipes this book is the one to get!!!!!

I got it right after I got my bread machine and I have made more recipes from it than from any other cook book. It's full of information about bread making and it has tons of easy recipes. The format of the book is easy to read and follow. The only problem I had was when I made the sugar cube bread recipe and the sugar cubes destroyed my bread pan. Hopefully she's taken that recipe out but if not don't make it! If you use a bread machine this cook book is definitely a must!"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I've been baking with a bread machine for a number of years, and I didn't expect to see much new information in this book. However, I have another book by Hensperger (which I like very much also) and I was interested to see her recipes tailored to the machine. Her recipes are innovative and they work beautifully. Her olive bread, for example, uses about twice the olives of other recipes I've tried, and I was afraid the salt content would prevent this one from rising - on the contrary, I produced a large loaf with a rich brown color and hearty olive flavor. Other recipes in the book have been similarly pleasing. The book also contains sidebars with valuable information about bread making topics, and includes an appendix with sources for materials and supplies, etc. This is a great book for someone who's just buying their first bread machine, and also for those of us who've become a bit jaded by the standard bread machine recipes found in other books. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"The book layout is logical and easy to read. Wealth of information pertaining to not just the bread making process but also the ingredients. The list of ingredients is in an easy to follow format. Most recipes are given for 1 1/2 AND 2 lb loaves. The one lb loaf recipes section is small but the author notes that one only has to halve the 2 lb loaf recipes to make 1 lb loaves. I tried this with several recipes and was very pleased with the results. I have a simple Welbilt bread machine that makes up to a 2 lb loaf. I've made many of the recipes and taken them to potlucks and such and the breads have been great hits. I'd recommend the book to friends and I have. The one thing that for me would make the book better would be pictures to see what the slices look like but many bread machine books do not contain pictures."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I have tried very few of the recipes in this book. The reason is, well, I am lazy. The book is written for machines that produce 1.5 or 2 lbs loaves. My family is small so I opted for a Zojirushi Mini that makes 1 lb loaves. NOW, I am perfectly capable of doing the calculations to divide the 2 lb recipes in half, but I just don't care to do so. I grab my Bread Machine Magic cookbook because it has tables in it for the ingredients and is set up for 1 lb. Reading the table is so fast, that I can toss together bread in just a bit longer than it takes me to set up the coffee maker. And I have enjoyed the outcome of the recipes, so that is my GO-TO recipe book. One of these days I will branch out and try more of these recipes for variety or something special, but I have a feeling that my BMM cookbook will be filled with notes and comments long before this book is pulled off the shelf. If you have a full size machine or don't mind doing calculations, it's probably really awesome."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"When I first received this cook book, I was going to return it as it is quite large. After reviewing several comments from the Author, Beth Hensperger, on how to make a really good loaf of bread, I decided to keep it.My original objection was the detail she goes into about what to expect from a Bread Machine as well as the types of grains and flours to use along with the results you may receive.These explanations make for a large cook book (a total of 643 pages).I have tried several recipes that were very good, even better than the ones that came with my Bread Machine.The price is resonable and if you are new or accustomed to a Bread Machine it is worth the price."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I received this book yesterday and spent the entire evening reading and marking recipes to make.

They are both good books. This has everything in it that the other has plus some more complex breads. I would get this book if you are going to be baking bread with lots of ingredients like all kinds of fruits, nuts, whole wheat breads, and if you are going to try out different types of sour dough breads (which you can only mix in the machine and need to bake in the oven). So if you are planning on doing a lot of complex stuff outside of the bread machine itself i would get this book..if you are going to stick to basics and just make really good bread in the machine itself mostly i would get Bread Machine Magic. Also on a side note this book is so thick that the binding tends to want to break if you stretch the binding out too much...which happened on mine because i kept going back to a few or a couple recipes over and over which split the binding."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"This is a great book for making bread with bread machines. I don't know how to cook, nor do I know how to bake. The bread I made following the recipes in the book came out better tasting than the bread from supermarkets and some bakeries. The book is much better than the instructions that came with my bread machine. Just make sure to read the first part of the book that provides an overview of bread machines and ingredients. If you do not like the shape of the bread from a bread machine, you can follow the instruction to shape your own bread and bake in your own oven.Great Book!"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"This book has many varieties of breads and explains the history of a lot of breads.

It has great recipe and tricks to use your bread machine. It even contains recipes for pancake batter which are really good. I am not the one using the bread machine but I certainly enjoy the food made from it. Note that the bread recipe which is so good uses the bread machine to prepare the dough but it is cooked in the over (I guess that's the secret).

I am a novice read maker. The recipes from this book work perfectly in this machine. A recipe with 3-3.5 cups flour is about a 1.5 pound loaf. Four cups of flour is about a 2 pound loaf.This book has a ton of info, very thick book, about types of flour, other ingredients, types of bread, and the process. I am learning a lot from reading all the material in this book. The only cavaet it that it uses a special fast acting yeast (SAF) for the recipes. I just use a little bit more of the normal active dry yeast (Red Star), such as the 2.25 teaspoons listed in the 2 lb. recipes in the West Bend manual, instead of the lesser amount listed in these recipes.The book has very good instructions on how to use the bread machine to knead and rise the read, and then shape and rise the bread for baking in the oven (such as for artisan breads and french bread, baquettes).It seems to have receipes and thorough discussions on every type of bread: daily breads, country breads, European breads, artisan, quick/sweet breads, etc.I highly recommend this cookbook as the first and best breadmaker cookbook. It will be a long time before you need another."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"This book is amazing. I have had my first bread machine for only two months and have tried about a dozen of the recipes in this book-and every single one is incredibly delicious! The tips about using fruit, troubleshooting errors and easy to follow directions have made me obsessed with making bread. I surprise friends, neighbors and coworkers with a new loaf just about every week. My daughter is happy I have a new hobby-because she benefits. A couple favorites: Cherry Wheatberry, Maple Oatmeal, Sunflower Honey Oatmeal, Sweet Potato Cranberry, CROWW (Cinnamon Raisin, Oatmeal, Whole Wheat, Walnut) All of these were excellent with Thanksgiving leftovers.

I'd never baked bread before by hand or otherwise so I thought a good book about it would be helpful. This book has been well used! For a while, I was actually trying to make every recipe in the book. I've made around 100 recipes, making bread 2-3 times a week. My family especially loves all the pizza doughs and pizza recipes. I didn't buy the bread machine with pizza in mind but we have it every other week now! We especially like the corn meal dough but they've all turned out quite well. In fact, few of the breads didn't turn out. Mostly it was my error in measuring or turned out to be too sweet for my family (big sourdough or French bread fans). I still have hardly tapped the recipes using starters - that's my next step."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"As a passionate baker, I own and have borrowed many bread books. Beth's is the best in many ways. The recipes are written in a clear, concise manner. I've made every recipe in the book except for one, and all of them have been worthy of repeating.

The franskbrod bread came out just beautifully multiple times. There are recipes ranging from the simple to the complex so if you are in the mood for easy or challenging, this book has it covered. The measurements are very clear and easy to use with items you probably already own such as measuring cups and measuring spoons. As with any bread machine recipe, it is well advised to also own a water thermometer so the water temp is in the correct range unless you own a bread machine that takes the extra time to bring ingredients up to temp, which I do not. The only ingredient that you may have a hard time finding if you live in a small town is Vital Wheat gluten which is used in many recipes. If that is the case, the Betty Crocker Bread Machine cookbook doesn't use gluten in the ingredient listing so you might want to try that one instead."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I absolutely love this cookbook. The wisdom she shares about the science and culture behind bread making is just as fun to read as the recipes are to follow.I have a Food Network bread machine and not every recipe I have tried has turned out 100% perfect but I am still a new baker and getting used to the exact \\"science\\" of baking, as opposed to the experimentation of stove top cooking. Also it seems that every machine and environment is a little different, so sometimes results will vary. She does have a great troubleshooting section for what to do differently next time if it's not exactly as you were expecting.

This is a very large book and has great information listed throughout the book, one very helpful list of information is the customer service numbers list which list many of the manufactures of the model of bread machine that you own, no need to have to run to the internet to look this information up (what happen to the days of phone books whew times have changed)Back to the book, there is a know your machine section, making bread section, gluten free breads section, recipe index section, jams preserves and chutney for your bread machine.

As a matter of fact, we will be purchasing a second bread machine in the near future, so that we can make two loaves at once or jams and pizza dough at the same time so that we can save on time and also have more loaves of bread made at once, yes there is so much to make from this book that we plan to get a second machine.. No yeast quick breads! There is also a resource section for products you will need or may want to use along with your machine..This book will make a great gift! There are also bread machine bakers hints throughout the book! Whew! fresh bread for the week!Hurry and get your copy!

We were fortunate to find a very good sale and purchase a nicer one not too long after that. But I was disappointed with the recipe booklet (or should I say flyer?) that came with our machine. We now own a Black & Decker Bread Maker Model B6000C which can also could give me a bread up to 3 lbs!Like I mentioned I was disappointed with the recipes included with the machine. So when I saw the book The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook I thought it would be a great addition to our cookbooks bookshelf that is in our kitchen. I wasn't disappointed. With more than 600 pages of recipes and tips about bread making it is an excellent resource to have.After a chapter on orientation on getting to know your bread machine and learning about making bread, the author immediately jump into the different kind of breads you can make. Here's an idea of the table of contents.Daily Breads: white breads and egg breadsEarth's Bounty: whole wheat, whole-grain, and specialty flour breads with a section on gluten-free breadsTraditional Loaves: country breads and sourdough breadsAll Kind of Flavors: breads made with the produce of the garden, orchard, and creameryCircle, Squares, and Crescents: pizzas and other flatbreadsSweet Loaves: chocolate, fruit, and other sweet breadsExpress Lane Bread: no-yeast quick breadsJams, Preserves, and Chutneys in Your Bread Machine.Appendixes: crumbs, croutons, crostini, toasted appetizers, spreads, butters, cheeses and vegetables.As you can see there is something for everyone in this cookbook. We like bread - especially fresh and hot - and we know that this cookbook will be very useful. I was checking the recipes and was pleasantly surprised to find recipes based on different kind of flour. Just when I was thinking of parting with my WonderMill because I couldn't see how I could use it more regularly, I get a cookbook containing recipes with flour I can make with it! Perfect. So sorry flocks but I will keep the WonderMill for a bit longer.If you have a bread machine and you are tired of always making the same recipes, I would strongly suggest you check out the Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook.

My default bread machine recipe is the \\"milk bread\\", and I love the \\"buns\\" version for great hamburger and hot dog buns.

None of the loaves have been a disappointment so far. I had never used a bread machine before and found the introduction to bread machines and their ingredients very helpful. I compared it with the user manual for my Cuisinart machine and there were no contradictions. The book provides more information than the manual. I used to make yeast breads by hand, but I think those days are over for me!I love the Honey Wheat Bread and Vienna Bread recipes in the book.

But the few recipes that came in the manual were not that imaginative. I then bumped into Hernsperger's \\"Bread\\" and bought it. I was delighted with her style and recipes, but above all, by the excellent results. The recipes worked just fine! I then bought this book, with recipes adapted to the machine. She is absolutely right to state in the book that the bread machine, despite being seen with suspicion by bread handmakers, brought a new lot of people into making bread. People like me, that would never had tried this task if it was not the machine. The book: clearly written, cleverly organized, excellent recipes. If you buy it (I recommend) do try CROWW p. 438.As nothing is perfect, small gripes relate to the lack of pictures and the way quantities are shown. In order to comply with the cup and spoon measures accompanying the machines, yeast, for instance, is 2 and 1/4 teaspoons. How on earth can I measure 1/4 of a teaspoon? With good and cheap electronic scales, everything should be presented in weight (as well).

The hamburger rolls to die for. The cinammon swirl loaf was unbeatable. I've never had anything like that from my bargain bread machine.The index took me all of 5 minutes to figure out ,but it makes sense. The half toned boxes are filled with information. I loved this book the moment I looked through it. I loved it more when I plopped a pile of dough on my board that looked better than any I had ever seen or touched.

Some of the recipes are nice and then there was the disaster I tried to make! I should have known better too! I tried the sweet bread with the crushed sugar cubes mixed in (I forget the name of the recipe in the book). Adding sugar cubes (even crushed!) to a non-stick bread machine bread pan is NOT a good idea! It totally ruined my bread pan by severely scratching the non-stick coating. AND I got nice non-stick coating flakes in the dough. Did I do something wrong? I don't know, but it seems some of these recipes have not been thought out very well or not tested or something.It has a lot of recipes, but it's almost too many. If this is your cup of tea and you want some more exotic breads, this might be for you. Just DON'T use the sugar cube bread recipe or you'll be shopping for a new bread pan for your machine!!

I've made the basic white bread, then the loaf with a banana. Both were flops. I noticed that the amount of flour seemed to be way off in the bread with banana. It was a sloppy mess without the addition of a lot of flour. Or could it be the addition of gluten?? Maybe I'll try one more, but that will be it."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"Recipes are for one-and-a-half and two pound loaves only. I could find no methodology or formula in the book for adapting recipes to make smaller loaves. How much more serviceable this volume would be, and how much wider its audience, had the author included a third column with each recipe giving directions to make one pound loaves, as Donna Rathmell German does in all her bread-machine cookbooks! Further, be aware that this book is a tome, very heavy and awkward to handle.Not for use with the very popular Mini Zo (Zojirushi BB-HAC10 Home Bakery 1-Pound-Loaf Programmable Mini Breadmaker).

I prefer to bake 1 lb. loaves and use plain yeast, and really didn't feel like doing the math every time I want to use this book. A minor defect, but enough of a defect that I couldn't see myself using this book regularly.

The result was a sticky mess that could barely be corrected by adding more and more flour. In one case, adding flour never did compensate for the combinations of other ingredients (chocolate and orange segments).When I read the book more closely, I discovered that the author recommends standing by during mixing to make this adjustment on all the recipes. So much for having fresh bread ready when you wake up in the morning.The author's credentials seem good, but she doesn't understand the breadmaker's approach.I suppose I'll use the ideas in this book and adjust the liquid as needed, but it certainly won't replace the recipes that I've used for the past ten years. Too bad."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I have this author's older book, \\"The Bread Bible,\\" and love the book. I anticipated that this book would be as good but for the bread machine. I have a 1 pound machine and was surprised to find all recipes in book are for larger loafs. She instructs to just halve the recipe (2lb) to make the 1 pound loaf, but after my first attempt to divide 1 7/8 and 2 5/8 I gave up. I'm not a complete math dummy, but I don't care to do this math every time i wish to bake a quick loaf of bread. A couple of recipes that were evenly divisable, I did try and they could not have been tested.

The dinner roll recipe is an absolute favorite!There *are* some difficult or time consuming recipes in this book. But, there are a number of 4 ingredient recipes as well. It has something for the novice as well as the expert wanting to try something new.One reviewer took exception with the ubiquitous use of vital wheat gluten. Yes, it is in many of the recipes.

I use my bread machine(s) almost daily and I recommend this book to anyone looking for the ultimate bread machine recipe book. I do agree with a previous reviewer that the 2 lb recipes are iffy and tend to out-rise the machine - I always stick with the 1.5 lb measurements and they fill my Zojirushi machine perfectly.The recipes with starters are gold. I never liked straight bread machine recipes - they always tasted off to me somehow, unfinished, raw. Using a simple poolish or biga makes all the difference in the world. It was a revelation to me. When I'm feeling fancy I bake in a dutch oven or on a cast iron pizza pan, but I'm also totally fine with baking right in the machine. My family's favorite is the Olive Oil Bread. Before I got my newest bread machine we would spend $5 a loaf for Zingerman's bread several times a week - but when I make bread or dough in the machine using this book we are just as happy and save that money. It may not look as pretty but it's delicious and has such a well-developed flavor.The only bread I didn't like was the Mexican chocolate bread - just not my thing. I am not a fan of chocolate breads in general, though. I also find the selection of ryes a bit disappointing - my family's gold standard is Zingerman's Jewish rye and there really isn't anything close in this book.Get this book if you have a bread machine - you will not regret it!"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I purchased this book because many of the reviews for bread machines (I ultimately purchased a Sunbeam) insisted that I had to get this book. I agree that the book is very helpful for making many bread recipes. However, a vast majority of the recipes in this book require the addition of gluten. Good luck finding gluten in the grocery store. I ended up purchasing a 3.5 pound keg of gluten on Amazon.com. It would have been helpful if the review for this book suggested purchasing gluten at the same time, so I am hopefully helping the next person to do so."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I rented this book from my local library, renewed it three times, and decided I simply could not live without having my own copy so I bought it last week.

I'm really enjoying using this cookbook. I bought it about a year ago along with the Gold Standard for bread machine recipesBread Machine Magic, Revised Edition: 138 Exciting Recipes Created Especially for Use in All Types of Bread Machinesbut more & more I'm finding myself using this one over the other. My only pet peeve would be it doesn't have the option for 1 lb loafs and that's only because it's just me & my husband so smaller loaves get eaten faster.I'm particularly fond of the \\"Country Breads and Sourdough Breads\\" section which is full of recipes using different kinds of bread starters (e.g. biga, levain, pate fermentee, poolish - mixture of flour, water & yeast that you let ferment over period of 8 to 10 hours right on the kitchen counter in your bread machine). I've never heard these terms before but let me tell you, the final product is absolutely worth the extended baking time. They are \\"dead-gone-to-heaven\\" delicious...Another section that I find myself using a lot this summer is the \\"Jam, Preserves & Chutneys\\". The recipes for small batches of jams are just right for my small family and I'm more than happy with the results. A few of the recipes have sort of a \\"secret\\" ingredient that makes the jam stand out - like Creme de Cassis in the Blueberry Jam or dried apricots in the Rhubarb Jam. My favorite so far...

I also only use the 1 1/2 lb recipes (which still fill my bread pan fully).

There are so many great recipes in this book that I have a hard time choosing what to try next, and have made very few more than just once.I have most frequently made the Vienna Bread and Chuck Williams's Country French, but have also liked Herb Bread, Sour Cream Bread, Honey Whole Wheat, Parmasan Nut Bread, Hot Jalapeno Bread with Longhorn Cheese, Cornmeal Honey Bread, Peasant Bread, and Soft Whole Wheat Dinner Rolls.I have to admit there are some recipes which I didn't care for: Irish Potato Brown Bread, Banana Bread, or Coconut Milk White Bread. And some which do not appeal to me at all (ie: Prune Bread??), but there are hundreds to choose from, so why not?I love shaping and forming dough, so I appreciate how the author also goes into great detail on how to shape loaves and rolls, giving many examples and clear, detailed instructions. The author also gives suggestions for what to serve with certain breads, and introduces each recipe with some background for that particular bread.The book is also a great reference for all the ingredients and techniques involved in bread baking. I even attempted making homemade jam with these recipes. Despite my inexpereince, it makes me feel like I really know what I am doing.

That is, with everything except bread machine recipes. I have a respectible yogurt-based sour dough bread and a fair pizza crust dough. That's it . . .Until I got this book for Father's Day, 2008 and everything I've tried from it (even when I twisted the ingrediants a little) worked! And not just worked but worked wonderfully! The loaves are too good looking to eat. They are just incredible. I have tried the sour creme bread (even added Italian seasoning for an herbal slant), the ciabatta (twice with great results), the bagel recipe, the cinnamon swirl, and the country white (even tweaking a little whole wheat into the receipe). I sent two loaves to my mother for Mother's Day (3-day shipment to CA) and they arrived in great shape and were consumed within two days!I would highly recommend this book to anyone wanting a consistent bread from a machine and for anyone wanting to expand into some lessor-known bread styles.PS: have since tried the honey white bread with outstanding results.

I made a few recipes from the owner's manual and experienced quite a few flops. I refused to be defeated and knew there must be a book out there that would help me make good bread (with the machine that I had begged for). THIS is the book!I read all the reviews that precede 2002 and got the book right away. I love the way Hensperger explains ingredients, the science of bread and how the machine works. We use our machine at least 3-4 times a week. Some of my favorites from the book include the Hamburger and Hot Dog Buns (I will never buy storebought again!), the Garlic Foccacia, the Orange Bread with White Chocolate, Apricots and Walnuts, and for sandwiches my family loves the Instant Potato Bread and the Maple Buttermilk Bread, both of which turn out light and fluffly.I remember reading a review that discussed the different ways to measure flour. For some reason, if I do it Hensperger's way, I always have to add more flour. So, I just scoop it without aerating the flour first.Another review mentioned that you &quot;have to&quot; use SAF yeast. I haven't found this to be true. I have used the SAF, but have also used fast-acting and bread machine yeast. Both have turned out fine. All of the ingredients have been at a local supermarket (I live in a small town - 23,000, on the Central Coast of CA) except the specialty flours like barley, spelt, semolina, etc. Those I have found at a health-food store.I can't say enough good things about this book! My copy is tattered and stained and I am enjoying working my way through all the recipes. It is a book I definitely can't live without"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I am a fan of Beth Hensperger's, and have baked my way through others of her bread books, and so was very excited when I discovered this book. Several of the breads I have made have been fantastic -- the Whole Wheat Cuban Bread and the Spelt Bread, for example. But I've had many problems when baking from this book (I bake twice weekly, and experiment once a week), which suggests that some of the recipes weren't tested, they were just \\"written\\" or adapted from convetional recipes. I'll mention two, the Honey Wheat Berry Bread and the Sennebeck Hill Bread. If you follow the instructions for the 2-pound loaf, in both cases, you'll have a bread that will rise way beyond the capacity of the largest machine -- I have a Zo, with a huge capacity. I was lucky enough to be in the kitchen at the time, and rescued the breads by taking the pan out, putting a greased heavy duty aluminum collar around the baking pan, secured with paper clips, and baking in the oven. That's not what I expect from someone as skilled as Hensperger. And I don't want to have to be in the kitchen when using a bread machine. So be forewarned."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I received this book for Christmas, and have been having lots of fun with it. I first made a country-style bread that combined whole wheat and bread flours with a touch of maple syrup, and it was yummy. I'll be trying one of the Italian semolina bread recipes this weekend for an Italian dinner party. But my favorite so far has been the Vienna bread. It is best while still warm from the machine (slathered with butter, if you're feeling naughty). It is fairly dense for a white bread, makes great sandwiches, and keeps well for several days. I haven't yet tried any of the biga (starter) breads, but I am looking forward to them. I wish the book contained a cinnamon-raisin bread recipe that was *not* gluten-free; I'll have to improvise.The instructions in this book are clear and very easy to follow. I also appreciate knowing which recipes are suitable for use with the delay timer. While some ingredients are hard to find, plenty of the recipes call for readily available items. I've discovered that the vital wheat gluten required in most recipes is available at my local Safeway, as are Red Star yeast and semolina flour.The fact that vital wheat gluten is *not* the same as wheat gluten flour is mentioned in the book, but not emphasized strongly enough. Also, I have to remember to add salt along with the liquid ingredients, although the recipes list salt with the dry ingredients, because my bread machine manual states that salt can interfere with the action of the yeast if it comes in contact with the yeast too early. Perhaps this is a possibility unique to my machine (a Breadman Ultimate). I agree with an earlier poster who complained that recipes using the Dough cycle (for breads to be baked in an oven) call for unplugging the machine at the completion of the cycle; this seems unnecessary.Overall, I am pleased with and inspired by this book, which contains a great amount of useful information and a slew of easy and delicious-sounding recipes! Thanks, Beth!"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"Baking is my thing, even though I must cook everyday foods to survive. Because I have limited shelf space, and because I want to simplify my life, I only keep those cookbooks I use and treasure. This is one of those books. I love the recipes in this book!! They are accurate and produce consistent results. If you like glossy pictures in your cookbooks then this book is not for you, but if you want easy and tasty recipes then this is the best book in the market.In reading some of the negative reviews I would like to comment that perhaps the fault does not lie in the recipes, but in the cook. Successful baking requires quality ingredients, careful measuring and correct temperature. Of all the ingredients used in bread baking the most important is of course the flour. Not all flours are created equal, they vary in protein content and moisture. Protein helps give structure to the dough, a soft spring wheat, low protein, flour (White Lily, Wondra) is good for cakes, a high protein winter wheat flour (most bread flours) is good for breads. The moisture content of the flour determines the amount of liquid to be added to the recipe. I have found Gold Medal and Pillsbury flours have a higher moisture content than other flours and require slightly less liquid. So try the same recipes using a different flour, and check the dough before the machine goes into the bake cycle and adjust accordingly..... too wet, add flour; too dry, add liquid. Lastly, always use the same brand of flour and learn to work with it. I use King Arthur flour exclusively for consistent results.I know some of the info in this review is not necessarily about the book in question, but the info may be helpful to someone having difficulty in achieving consistent results in the baking process."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I absolutely LOVE this book!! Buy-it-a-ring-march-it-down-the-aisle love it!! I'm one of those people with more cookbooks than I shake a whisk at and I go to this one over and over and over! It has everything! I've never had a loaf go wrong and every recipe I've tried is just delicious.To start with, the Roman Bread alone (p. 409) is worth the price of the book! The granola bread, the blueberry coffee cake, Mexican chocolate bread, brioche rolls...I could go on and on!! It has everything from the simplest white and wheat to unique breads using exotic grains and interesting nuts, fruits and herbs (persimmon bread, lavender rosemary bread). It's made me a better baker because there are so many notes on the science of how bread \\"works\\". And it's not just bread - if you could make pot roast in a bread machine this book would tell you how to do it! There are jam recipes, quick bread recipes and recipes for using the leftover bits. There are pizza and calzone recipes that include the toppings, not just the dough. The Cheese Pizza Torte is amazing!I love my bread machine but I'm not the biggest fan of the shape of the pan, so I often use the dough recipes and then proof the bread and bake it in a regular pan. Many of the recipes for country loaves have you do that anyway for a more authentic loaf.My husband bought me the book as a Christmas present when I was 4 months pregnant. Here it is August and the bread machine hasn't gone back into the cupboard yet! It's a miracle our daughter wasn't born weighing 17 pounds!

My husband is European and won't eat American store-bought bread, so I got my first bread maker shortly after we were married almost 16 years ago. I got this book quite a few years ago and I've opened it about once a week since (about how often I make bread). I've made more than half of the recipes in the book, and they are all wonderful. I really couldn't live without it.However, as others have said, the whole wheat recipes are generally not quite that. Only one or two of the WW recipes are 100%. The others have half to 3/4 white flour. The author explains why - she doesn't feel that you get a \\"satisfactory\\" result with the whole wheat flour, and she adds a lot of extra gluten to these recipes.However some of us really like the dense 100% whole wheat(or other grain) breads. I wish that there were a companion volume dedicated just to whole grains. I learned so much about machine bread baking from this book - now I want to learn just as much about machine bread making with 100% whole grains.I'd really like to understand the properties of the other bread-grains better, as well."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I have been a bread machine user since the very first models came out ages ago. I make bread now, more than ever. This is the first book I turn to for creative, delicious recipes, and troubleshooting. I am a mile high above sea level, and after we moved here, I thought I would never make bread again. The altitude was causing my bread to be disastrous.I first got this book from the library, and checked it out for about 12 weeks. I successfully tried several of the recipes in the book, and my passion for bread was ignited again! I bought my own copy to have forever. Beth takes all the problems and guess work out of bread making, at any altitude. I even contacted her about a baking question, and she answered me within 1/2 hour. How's that for service?The recipes are delicious and rewarding to make. There is only one recipe that I would warn about. It is the one with the crushed sugar cubes. Mixing the recipe as listed damaged some of the non stick on my bread pan and paddles. (I am a freak about keeping things nice, so this was really a downer.) I would change the recipe to making the dough in the pan, sans the cubes,knead them in by hand before the last rise, and then bake the loaf in the regular oven. This will protect your pan, and you will still have that wonderful bread.I have a lot of bread making books, and bread machine books. If you are only going to have one, make it this one. If you have more, get this one anyway! You will use it more than the rest! It is comprehensive, and will satisfy just about any bread baker out there. I hope you try it and like it as much as I do.

But I want to make bread with all (or nearly all) whole grain flours. I was amazed at how many recipes had a large percentage of regular while bread flour.Even the breads in the section for Whole Wheat, Whole-Grain, and Specialty Flour Breads the recipes had lots of white flour. For example the following all have over 50% of the flour as white flour: \\"Nine Grain Honey Bread\\", \\"Barley Bread\\", \\"Whole-Greain Daily Bread\\".I like the heavier dark breads, and admit that most people like lighter breads than I do. This book would have gotten more stars if she would only tell me how to adapt the recipes. The author does mention that in time beginners will figure out how to adapt recipes, but I would like some hints rather than going through the school of hard loaves."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I originally gave this book four stars, but after trying *many more* of the absolutely delicious recipes, I felt compelled to write a new review and up the star count to five. This book is fabulous! The more I use this book, the more Beth Hensperger seems like a friend guiding me as I learn about my bread machine's capabilities, and I can't thank her enough.I ordered the SAF yeast from the King Arthur Flour Company and it really does make a difference. (The expiration date stamped on the package troubled me, because it was only a five months away, so I emailed King Arthur and learned that if you keep the yeast in the freezer, it will be good for a year or more. The stamped date is based on professional bakery use, where the yeast sits out in a hot kitchen every day.)I have tried several whole wheat and semolina breads, graham bread, seeded whole grain breads, and white breads, and they all turned out beautifully. The semolina bread was particularly luscious baked on the French bread cycle for a crackling crisp crust and slathered with garlic butter, as Hensperger recommends. Using Hensperger's guidelines, I successfully added gluten to other recipes that did not call for it and saw the breads rise perfectly.Beth Hensperger's talent for recipe development is amazing; her sandwich buns and pizza crusts turned out great, too! (A nice bonus is her pizza sauce recipe, which is scrumptious and very easy.) I love, love, love this book!"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I bought this book because I read the reviews written by other customers and they were overall very good. So far I've made 3 recipes from the book - a flax seed bread, beer bread and a whole wheat bread - and they've all turned out amazingly well. I was resigned to the &quot;fact&quot; that bread machine bread was more dense than grocery store bread - until I tried these recipes. The bread is light and moist and the crust is crispy and delicious. I haven't bought the SAF yeast, I'm using regular bread machine yeast but it doesn't seem to matter. I admit - because I'm from Canada, apparently our flour is different from US flour - that I modify the recipes a bit - reducing the flour by 1/8 to 1/4 cup. I've also found that I can reduce the amount of sugar and fat called for in the recipes and still have excellent results.This book is wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone with a bit of knowledge of baking and a desire to spend some time with their bread machines."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I, too, was hesitant about buying this book, based on previous reviews I had read here. I own almost all of her books, and they all have fantastic recipes, instructions, and information. I decided to go with her past successes and asked for this book for Christmas. I have used 3 or 4 recipes so far, and each one has come out perfectly. I did not have to make any adjustments at all; the ingredients were right on. There is a wealth of information in this book, definitely the best book I have seen on bread machine baking. I have had not-so-great success with bread machine cookbooks by other authors. This book has everything you need to know on this subject, and then some. Also included are tempting recipes for jams, preserves, butters, spreads, etc., plus creative ways to use leftover bread. I highly recommend this book, whether you are beginning or experienced at bread machine baking."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine CookbookThis review is for the Kindle version of this cookbook.I have tried recipes from at least 5 or 6 different bread-machine cookbooks, and this is, without a doubt, the BEST one there is (in my opinion!) ;) Every single recipe I've made in this cookbook has been a huge success, and my family has raved about every one. (The crescent rolls - \\"Virginia Light Rolls\\" are the family-favorite I think - they are SOOoo yummy! My daughter and I happen to love raw bread dough, and this is the best dough we've ever had!)The cookbook has many recipes, with chapters divided into groups (white breads, whole-grain breads, \\"rustic\\" breads, quick-breads, buns and rolls, etc.) and each chapter has a table of contents, so I can find exactly what I'm looking for fairly easily. (There is a detailed index as well, but unfortunately, it is not linked/click-able in the Kindle version.) I also use the Kindle's bookmark and notes features to make notes about recipes I like, or alterations I make, etc.There is also a good bit of \\"general\\" information about bread-baking, with helpful info so you can figure out what might be wrong if your loaf doesn't turn out perfectly. There is info about different bread-machine settings as well, and about individual ingredients in typical loaves. I found the info on wheat-gluten and SAF yeast especially helpful, and using them, I can now be virtually guaranteed of getting good results every time I bake. :)I have not found any issues/problems with Kindle formatting in this book. I do make a physical copy of each recipe I use, so I don't have to worry about spilling on my Kindle, or having it turn off in the middle of things. Other than that, it has been no different than using a \\"real\\" (paper version) book.

The other cookbooks had really strange recipes that I would never even want to try (not sure why I bought them...). But this cookbook is wonderful.There is a lot of helpful information in the book, such as the Bread Machine Baker's Hint on Dough Enhancers, that many people are likely to find helpful (I did).But the recipes are what shine. There is a recipe for any type of bread you might want to make. Seriously. Want a recipe for Prune Bread? They've got it (okay, I admit I haven't tried that one, so I have no idea how good it is).My absolute favorite recipe in the entire book is their banana bread recipe. It is incredibly moist and dense. Any time my bananas start to get too ripe to eat I pull out this book and turn to page 543. When I'm in the mood, I've modified the recipe by adding about 3/4 C of pumpkin and a sprinkling of pumpkin pie spice. Good gracious, but that's good!Another recipe I love is their carrot bread recipe. Generally speaking, I can't stand carrots or carrot cake. This bread, however, is incredible (it's on page 558 of my book).My only complaint is that I think there are too many recipes. Sometime I find it hard to pick one, simply because there are so many to choose from. But don't let that stop you from getting this book if you have a bread maker that is collecting dust."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I've made quite a bit of bread but never used a bread machine. When I ordered my first bread machine, I wisely ordered this book at the same time. That was a very good decision. The first loaf I made was using a recipe in the bread machine's manual - it turned out so-so. I immediately grabbed this book. The machine hadn't even cooled down before I was pouring in the ingredients for Honey White Bread. The result? Homemade bread with the flavor and texture I remember as a child. I've since made two other breads from this book and they were flawless as well.This is not just a bunch of recipes. The first chapter is 'Orientation', providing enough information to give you the confidence you need. Confused about 'active dry yeast' vs 'instant yeast'? Page 13 has the answers. etc."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I have made a ton of these recipes now. The Vienna Bread is as good or better than any white bread you can find in the grocery store. The carrot bread and scandinavian bread recipes are also easy and delicious. Pretty much whatever leftovers you have in your house, you can find a bread recipe in this cookbook for. Oh and the herb bread for when you make Italian is fantastic! I'm really enjoying going through all the recipes. The only bread I have not liked from this cookbook is the 100% Whole Wheat BUT my bread machine conked out at the same time I made this bread so it could have been my machine just didn't put it together right. The recipes are clearly written in big letters if text size is important to you. The author gives you the 1.5 lb loaf and the 2 lb loaf options. She has a whole chapter on 1 lb sample loaves. She gives you the history of most of her bread recipes.

I had tried to make soft moist whole wheat bread for months before buying this book. I got recipes for the oven and converted them to the bread machine, and I got recipes for the bread machine and used them \\"as is\\". I tried bread cook books, bread machine cook books, and the internet. Every time I baked whole wheat bread it turned out dry and hard.Since I've gotten this book I haven't made a dry hard loaf of bread. The instructions are so easy to understand, and make such great bread. I can make bread with any kind of flour I want and it turns out soft and moist.

Country White Bread,how basic can you get, right? Boywas I surprised at the loaf my machine turned out! It's the best loaf I've ever made!

I almost did not buy the book. After I thought about the other bread books this author had written; I decided to make the purchase and I am very glad I did. I just got done eating a slice of the bread with the orange sections and chocolate mentioned in one of the reviews. My loaf was wonderful. This is about the 8th or 9th recipe I have tried and they have all been wonderful. I have baked bread without a bread machine but am in no way an experienced bread maker. This book has a lot interesting information and lots of tips. I didn't know about SAF yeast until I read it here. It does work better. Well worth the money"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I've made a small portion of the recipes from this book, perhaps thirty recipes. I've found that, without tweaking, perhaps two have performed reliably and the others have been mostly salvageable with modifications (modifications made loaf after loaf to see what works and what doesn't). I am a moderately accomplished bread baker and have a good understanding of how to tweak ingredient volumes and I would say that most of the recipes in this book are inadequately tested.This morning I decided to make the Dutch Sugar Loaf bread for my family as a treat since we are snowed in. What a bad idea. I followed the recipe to a letter and was concerned about the noise in the pan when I added the sugar lumps. I should have followed my intuition to abort the loaf. After the bread finished baking, I went to clean out the bread pan and blades. The sugar cubes scoured the finish off of the bottom of the pan and almost completely stripped the finish off of the blades. Total replacement for a new bread pan to fit my one year old Zo and two new blades: $75. And, lo and behold, the bread didn't turn out as expected either. It is beyond me why this recipe made it to publication.If you really want to purchase this book, I would try the library first and then try to get it second hand. Better yet, just ask someone you know for a couple of copies of their favorite recipes. It is not worth the full cost for a handful of reliable recipes."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"Since i use this book everyday i owe it to Beth not only to give a review, but a good one at that.i have tried every recipe in this book and have crapped out 2 bread machines doing it! lol its been so much fun and my family has fresh bread for breakfast lunch and dinner.For those of you who complain that these recipe ingredients are not accurate, Beth tried her best to create recipes that will suit all machines, the HUNDREDS of them!PEOPLE LEARN TO USE YOUR OWN MACHINE! learn what order ingredients need to go in, touch and feel the dough at all levels of preparation, if its too wet, add more flour, too dry, add more liquid, really its that easy!"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I was a bit skeptical when I bought this book as I'm a vegan and was wondering if I would get the same result substituting the ingredients.

I've made quite a number of recipes from this book and they are all excellent. For the novice there's also an analysis of how bread machines work (number of cycles, different types of sugars, etc.), equivalent measurements, and a great description on all a bread machine can do. Note though that the table on page 17 for the order of loading ingredients in the pan is incorrect for the current Westbend model (horizontal loaf, two paddles, which I have). For the Westbend, you do put the wet ingredients first, then the dry, then the yeast. I have several other bread machine cookbooks and now I never use them. I'm going to donate my old bread machine cookbooks to the library. Beth Hensperger's bread machine cookbook is the one to have!

I got this book after reading some reviews and have made just about 10 different loaves from this book. I've tried most of the white breads, along with the C.R.O.W.W, pane francese and parmesan nut bread. I only flopped on the milk bread but I think that was because i used flour that was too cold ( i tried to keep it in the freezer to prolong freshness). I am thrilled with just about every recipe! The only one that i didn't think was great was the croww bread. It was not as flavorful as I expected it to be since it smelled incredible while baking. The recipes are straightforward, easy to read and the ingredients are listed in the order that they should go into your breadmaker. As expected, some ingredients are rare and it's unlikely you'll ever use them again unless you make the same loaf. So long as you have bread flour, eggs, water, gluten and yeast you'll be able to make many many many different breads with the addition of common ingredients found in most households. For those that are gluten intolerant there is a section with gluten free breads. This cookbook was clearly designed to meet all bread makers needs. Happy baking!"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"This is a fabulous book for anyone with a bread machine, especially if you're like me and have little prior bread-making experience. Any type of bread you could want to make is in this book. So far I've only tried a few recipes, but they've all been delicious. Aside from the recipes, all the information about bread-making is invaluable - specifics to using bread machines, the properties of different types of flour, the chemistry behind making a successful loaf of bread, why a loaf didn't turn out right and how to fix it, etc. One of my favorite tips so far is about white whole wheat flour, which is made from white wheat rather than red wheat. It's a whole grain flour, but it's lighter in texture than regular whole wheat, so it can be substituted for all-purpose flour and makes loaves with a similar texture to a white bread. One thing I don't like about the book is that many of the recipes in the Whole Grain chapter aren't 100% whole grain - a few of them even contain only a small amount of whole grain flour. Also, from what I've seen so far, it looks like most of the recipes are designed to create light, fluffy breads. Nothing wrong with that type of bread, but sometimes I want something with more density to it, especially in a whole grain bread. Some of the other chapters (country breads, herb breads, fruit and nut breads, etc.) also include whole grain and multi-grain recipes, so if that's your main interest make sure you look through the whole book. Despite the few things I don't like about this book, I feel that the information is so helpful that once I've tried a few more recipes and experimented a bit, I'll be able to adjust recipes successfully and maybe create my own."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I love this book, I only use the make the dough, to do breads and pizza and coffee cake, which is so good, the cinabun coffeecake, I have had to make 3 in 2 weeks, I copy the recipes I love and put them in a clear sheet cover,so much easier than pulling out the book, shaping and baking in the oven myself makes two loaves and is fun to shape with my grand daughters, I have gotten so much use out of my Zo bread machine.

I'm 60+ and still have great eyesight for close work, but I need my reading glasses for this book. While colored type is pretty and often sets a book apart from others, I just can't see the brown-on-white very well; I'd have given a black-type book as many stars as Amazon allowed.

We gave copies to two nieces along with bread machines, and they've had Hensperger successes as well, one niece in particular having acted as a spur to her aunt with the lovely breads she's made; I'm sure she'd like me to put in a word for the lush chocolate challah, which her husband made for her when she came home with a new baby daughter, and the cinnamon bread, shaped and baked in a spiral. There are plenty of whole-grain recipes too, some that introduce us to the world of unusual and healthy grains, most however using some white flour, for texture and rising power. Of these, I especially like the rye breads; ryes can be tricky to make, and hers are always reliable. Though I baked happily in my machine for years, I've since found that every recipe in the book can be made on the dough cycle, if that's what you enjoy; you can shape it as you please, and bake it in your oven. (If a recipe, written for baking in the machine, doesn't specify an oven temperature, you can find what works best for your type of dough on websites like The Fresh Loaf and King Arthur Flour.) It would take too much space to list my favorite recipes, and there are still so many I want to try. Start with the easy ones, where she walks you through the basics, and then be more daring. Experiment with your own flavorings, seeds, and toppings. Be sure to read all the introductory material. I hope you get bitten by the bread bug too.

I have never been disappointed with a single loaf. There are all kinds of recipes, from gluten free, to whole wheat to other things you can make in your bread machine besides bread. I am so pleased that Beth converted the Cornell bread recipe for use in a bread machine. That is one of my and my husband's favorites.

I did it the old fashioned way, kneading with my hands on the counter top. I decided to get a bread machine in hopes that it would make baking fresh bread easier. I also bought this book for recipes. I gave this book a decent chance. I tried about 5 recipes multiple times and none of them worked without extensive troubleshooting. They either rose and fell, turned out to be bricks, or rose and broke the crust. None of the recipes I tried turned out well right off the page. The recipe book that came with my bread machine turns out flawless loaves. I have better luck with recipes I find on recipe web sites. Hey at least if a recipe from the web doesn't turn out, I didn't have to pay for the crappy recipe. I thought it was my fault due to the raving reviews on amazon for this book. Perhaps I just kept picking the recipes that don't work , assuming there are recipes in the book that work. It's kind of sad that google gives you better recipes for free than a book you paid for.

Once I got this book that all changed. So far I haven't had to buy any bread since I opened the package with this book in the mail. The only problem I've had is with the Cracked Wheat Bread recipe. It goes up over the top and burns a little on the sides and is a real pain to even get the pan out of the machine. I dropped to the 1 1/2 pound recipe and it still when over the top. My family thinks it's great and call it Frankenstein Bread and I usually cut the top off and they eat it while it's still warm. I guess I'll have to play with it to get it right. At least the mistakes still taste good. I've learned so much about making bread from this book. It's wonderful!"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"Got this book last week and sat down and read it cover to cover the night it arrived from Amazon. We have owned our bread machine for about four weeks. While there are some fabulous blogs on the net where you can cull some very good \\"free\\" recipes, I was not disappointed by the contents of this book, which was well worth the investment.There are many recipes I will no doubt try, but this books's biggest value for me was the guide to making up your own recipes. In our \\"empty nest\\", we need only to make 1.5 lb loaves every 3-4 days and our favorites are the multi-grain varieties, using no salt, due to dietary restriction. Kitchen alchemy is the better part of cooking/baking and I have already begun to venture off on my own \\"holy grail\\" adventure, experimenting with different flours and ingredients. The author well explains the dry/wet/yeast ratios needed to make successful loaves as well as the chemistry and labor of establishing the right environment for making one of our favorite foods. As you can see by the reviews here, this is one book you can buy that leaves no regrets or left over crumbs!"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I bought this book from Amazon a few months ago when I also bought a breadmaker (cuisinart). I LOVE this book. I find myself reading it, just for fun. Beth Hensperger is a great writer and the introduction to the book was very helpful. I also really enjoy the comments she makes on every recipe. The book is divided into chapters based on bread type. Every recipe I have tried is fabulous. No tweaking necessary. I have recently become obsessed with the artisan loaves and they are so good it is like you went to an upscale bakery and bought the bread. The best thing about the book is that it really motivates you to use the machine to its maximum potential. Regular breads, wheat breads, artisan breads, sweet breads, pizza dough, non-yeast breads and even jam.I originally bought the breadmaker because I am trying to get off the \\"food grid\\" as much as I can (partially motivated by the book \\"In Defense of Food\\"). I want to feed my family food that is as pure and natural as possible. After studying ingredient lists on commercially prepared breads, I realized the stuff sold in grocery stores has little resemblance to actual bread. Since I do not have time to make bread by hand, I bought a bread machine.Since purchasing the machine and this book, I buy very little bread at the store. It is so easy and satisfying (and so much healthier) to make it myself.Buy this book!"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"Beth Hensperger is one of my favorite cookbook authors! (I love her Ultimate Rice Cooker and Not Your Mother's Slow Cooker Cookbooks, too, check 'em out!)This cookbook offers a wonderful variety of recipes for your bread machine. It contains broad coverage of traditional loaves of bread, as well as a treasure trove of creative ways to use the bread machine to prepare dough for other things - foccacia, dinner rolls, pizza crust, etc.I use my bread machine weekly - wore out the fins, as a matter of fact. I use this cookbook exclusively for the bread machine.Instant-potato bread, Virginia light rolls, scandanavian light rye, basic pizza dough (homemade margharita pizza - yum!) and cracked wheat bread are all family favorites I make on a regular basis.Start with a few basics - bread flour, instant yeast (keep it in the freezer; it doesn't matter what brand you buy) and vital wheat gluten. Make some of the classic recipes, then broaden your repetoire from there. I like to select a new ingredient from King Arthur or the health food store - eg wheat berries or spelt flour - and experiment with some of the less common recipes.I have enjoyed using this cookbook immensely, and years later I am still discovering wonderful new uses for the bread machine in this cookbook.

There are a few favorite loaf recipes that I stick with for our daily consumption, but I also like experimenting with the specialty breads. We never buy bread anymore. Even make our own hamb/hotdog buns. This recipe calls for white flour only, but I make it with 1/2 white, 1/2 whole wheat and it works great for me. Not only does this book have great recipes, but Beth Hensperger has loaded it with some great information and helpful hints throughout.After seeing and tasting the products I've turned out using this book, both of my daughters talked their husbands into buying them bread machines.

Smooth, round and easily circles the pan. It was great. I followed the recipe and it was perfect. I didn't have to add anything during the kneading process and it produced a great loaf of bread.

I expected this book to provide him with recipes that require the breadmachine to do the work but just about every recipe requires taking the dough out of the machine, kneeding it and bake it in the oven. What's up with that? I thought, \\"that's not what the bread machine was designed to do\\". So I'm stuck with it! In a busy world the bread machine was designed to give us fresh breads investing very little of our time other than piling up the ingredients and letting it do the work.Oh well!"},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"The title claims that this book is for every kind of bread machine. Well, we have a one-pound Zojirushi bread machine and apparently this book only has recipes for one-and-a-half-pound and two-pound bread. While you can prepare recipes for smaller bread in a larger machine, the opposite is not true (the bread would rise and overflow).That's really too bad."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"Years ago, when I first started baking home-made bread, I was introduced to this book. I remember liking this book a lot. It indeed provides in-depth information about bread-making especially by using the bread machine. It also has some great recipes that helped me make good bread; but some of the recipes didn't work well, as some other reviews have pointed out, maybe because they were not tested thoroughly. Over the years, I drifted away from this book and now my favorite bread baking book is from the King Arthur Flour company. I am not saying they are the only authority. But one thing, among others, that I learn from the King Arthur Flour cook books, is that serious bakers ALWAYS use weight rather than volume for baking. Because one person's one cup of flour, for example, is different from another person's. Bread machine baking, for one thing, requires high accuracy of the amount of each ingredient, since people have less leverage in fixing the dough especially if you finish the baking in the bread machine pan. I guess you can overcome this problem by experimenting many times to figure out how to use this book, which is what I did. Still, a better way for sure success is to measure by weight. Another thing I don't like about a lot of the recipes is that they are on the salty side. I just compared a 2-pound bread machine recipe from the King Arthur Flour website to a similar recipe in this book. A typical recipe in this book, except for sweet breads, calls for 2 teaspoon salt; while King Arthur Flour recipes use about 1 1/2 teaspoon salt or less. I imagine you can eat your bread with lots of jam or spread, but really it's too salty by itself to have 2t salt in a 2-pound loaf. Bread machines are a great invention. New bakers can finish everything in just one machine; More experienced bakers use the machine for dough and then finish with fancy-shaped bread in the oven. I heard those King Arthur Flour people develop their recipes using bread machines too. This is a great book by a great baker, but I think some home bakers are getting so serious these days that they would want more professional-grade recipes that ensure better success. Still I would recommend this book to any of my baking friends,as one of the recipe books they use, because of the variety of the bread recipes and detailed information."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"At first glance this cookbook seems simple, but I have encountered a couple quirks that have caused ruined loaves. The biggest one: the book advises in many recipes to stop and reset your machine after \\"Knead 2\\" and restart the process so the dough is kneaded an extra time. The problem? My machine only has one knead cycle. There is no setting on the machine that kneads the dough twice. I don't have an obscure machine; it's a terrific Zojirushi. I use the \\"basic\\" cycle just like the book instructs, but there is only one knead cycle. Also, it recommends SAF yeast. I have purchased this. My Zojirushi guide says to use the \\"Quick\\" cycle for any fast-rising yeast, and I have done this, but the loaves do not rise. I have to use the standard cycle that takes nearly four hours, even though I am using the fast-acting SAF yeast. So basically my problems with this cookbook boil down to it giving instructions that don't match up with the settings on my breadmaker, despite my breadmaker being a well-known, high quality machine."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I've been baking bread in my Panasonic bread machine for the past 10 years. The breads I made were quite good, but never as good as the ones I could buy in German bakeries (I live in Switzerland, right at the German border). But bread, as all other foods, available in the shops today, has changed quite a bit. There are too many additives, which I don't like to eat or feed to my family. Baking our own bread gives me some control as to what goes into it.Finally, after so many years of using my bread machine and trying to replicate the \\"real\\" taste and texture with countless recipes, I found \\"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook\\", and the results are great. Every recipe I try is an experiment, and so far every one resulted in excellent bread. There is a downside, however. We bake too many loaves, just out of curiosity...

There is one thing though. My breadmaker has the capacity for 1, 1 1/2 and 2 pound recipes. I always begin with the 1 1/2 pound recipes. I have found that the 1 1/2 pound recipes rises to equal to the 2 pound capacity! So I would not recommend the 2 pound recipes without trying the 1 1/2 recipes first and seeing the results."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"Today I made Sunflower Pumpernickel Rye bread, a recipe found in this book, and it is so scumptious I can't believe any is left over. I purchased The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook over a year ago, when I was still using my old (circa 1995) Breadman and all the recipes came out beautifully.Soon after purchasing the book, I decided I needed a spiffier machine and purchased the Zojirushi BBCC-X20. The first recipe I tried from this book failed miserably. However I determined it was mostly my fault. I put in the ingredients and left the house, never checking on the dough. It needed more water, as it turned out.Since that first failure, I always watch over the dough the first five or ten minutes. Approximately fifty percent of the time, I'll need to add a little more water to the dough to get it to that perfect consistency. I don't believe that is the fault of the recipes' author. My experience has been that most bread recipes need be 'tweaked' some of the time, given the variables affecting dough, such as climate, altitude or even different 'batches' of flour. It is imperative that you check the dough in the beginning stage of bread making and most recipe books, this one included, will advise you to do just that.I have roughly twenty bread making cookbooks, at least half of those focusing on bread machine recipes. This is the book I use 99.9% of the time. There are more recipes in here than I'll ever use but it is delightful to have one book that encompasses so many different types of breads. You can always find a recipe that has just the ingredients you wish to use. Some of the most delicious and unique bread recipes are included the \\"All Kinds of Flavors\\" chapter. I love all of the cheese breads, the Cornmeal Honey Bread recipe is excellent, and the sourdough recipes have always turned out perfectly.But nothing is perfect and this book is no exception. I have never had success with the Black Olive Bread recipe, even though I've attempted it several times. This is a great disappointment to me. I do not believe one should fault the author of this book, Beth Hensperger, for individual failures such as this. Even with a bread machine, certain complicated recipes that call for lots of ingredients are a challenge. Machine types vary and as stated above, there are many variables that go into bread making that change from time to time. In the case of the olive bread recipe, I believe it is best to remove the dough after the machine has finished the kneading process and add the VERY DRY chopped olives to the loaf manually, then return it to the machine for rising and baking. The author does advise to drain the olives well or else add more flour. I still find this a very difficult recipe to execute well.Another reviewer here complained that only SAF and bread machine yeast are listed in the recipes, not the regular type of instant or active yeast. I have used 'regular' yeast in the quantity given for bread machine yeast and the bread came out fine. Someone else complained that most of the recipes called for bread flour rather than being 100% whole wheat. This is true. I don't see anywhere on the cover of the book or inside where the author claims her recipes to be 100% whole wheat. However, there are many recipes that call only for whole wheat flour, or else in combination with other 'whole grain' flours.I believe any serious bread machine baker will find more recipes in this collection than any other book available. Not all will be wonderful but given the large quantity of recipes included in this collection, I believe you'll find, like I have, more than enough to delight you and your family for years to come."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"The bread machine is a wonderful invention. For those of us who have tried traditional bread making with only modest success, machine baking takes the guesswork out and gives us consistently edible bread. But machine baking and traditional bread making are two very different processes. It helps to have a guide to the ins and outs of the machine and how to make the best use of its features.I bought Beth Hensperger's cookbook on the recommendation of other Amazon reviewers. I haven't been disappointed. I haven't done a lot of fancy things with my bread machine (no breads using starters, no jams or jellies, no rolls). But of the twenty or so recipes I have tried, the results were consistently good. The basic information Hensperger provides on the theory and practice of bread machine baking is very helpful.As a previous reviewer said, every brand of bread machine is a little different, and you have to become familiar with your own. I use a Breadman Ultimate and have not had the problems with dryness that another user reported. But I have made some adjustments in the kind of yeast that I use. Hensperger recommends SAF, a fast-acting brand of yeast, or bread-machine yeast. I've used bread machine yeast successfully, but find that it makes the texture of the bread a little too much like store-bought white for my taste. I've taken to using regular yeast instead, which seems to give a slightly denser texture. But that's really a matter of personal taste. For novice bread machine bakers, I recommend following the recipes for awhile and then beginning controlled experiments to find out what works best for you. But Hensperger's book will give you a firm base on which to build."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I've had a bread machine for years but with this cookbook, I am finally using it, making bread nearly every day for over two weeks now! With such a great number of recipes, there is always a new one to try. The hamburger rolls are fabulous in taste and general appearance. I like more 100% whole grain breads but once you get the general proportions you can experiment. I use instant yeast and no gluten and I haven't had one failure. Unless you call rising to the very top of the machine a failure! I love to cut the top off and eat when freshly made, sometimes with butter and sometimes without to get the true taste of the bread. With my family, it never lasts long."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I bought this book after reading through it at a local book store. it looked good. Its been even better than I hoped. I have never baked bread successfully before I got my machine. now i can't stop. I have never had a failure from this book. I found the additional information about ingredients very educational. I am now purchasing a hard bound copy. im giving my paperback as a gift along with a bread machine to a good friend who loves the bread ive made her family. in my opinion this book has everything a new bread machine baker needs to know. I have had so much fun modifying the recipts. adding and changing, learning and enjoying the results. I have other bread machine books. none of them is as fun as this one. my only complaint is that the index is not complete. I find wonderful things i want to try, then later i have to look long and hard to find them again. expecially the little extra things like what to do with left over bread or educational information. its mixed throughout the reciept texts with no seprate index. I still love it.

It must have some kind of magic in it because every loaf I have tried has been amazing. I find I can only use the 1 1/2 pound loaf recipe in my 2 pound machine because the loaves come out huge. HUGE.I love this book so much, I bought two more copies to give to my best friends. One of them never made anything but sourdough. He was a sourdough snob. He made my very favorite recipe, Sour Cream Bread and made two loaves that same night. One for bread and one for cinnamon rolls.I've never seen someone so excited over a loaf of bread. It really is an unbeatable loaf. Just this one recipe is worth the price of the book alone. If you don't make any other recipe, make this one. It's perfect for a peanut butter sandwich, french toast, or just spread with real butter. Yum.Update - 12/10/07I made the Peach jam recipe and OMG, it was amazing. I used frozen peaches instead of fresh. Do try the jam in the machine.

Trying to adapt some of the half-whole-wheat recipes into 100% whole wheat recipes didn't turn out that great, but that's probably less the book's fault and more my own. The recipes where I followed the book with no adaptations turned out fine. So I will echo what several other reviews said - that I was disappointed at how few of the whole grain recipes were truly WHOLLY whole grain.But then I tried the \\"Dutch Sugar Loaf\\" recipe and it damaged my machine. It sounded like a great idea - a cinnamon and clove bread with crushed sugar cubes that would melt into little bits of sugary goo in the middle of the bread. The directions said to let it knead for 5min and then add half of the crushed sugar cubes and spices, wait another 3min and add the rest. When I did this it created an ENORMOUS racket as it bashed the crushed cubes around the breadpan. When I went to take out the loaf it got stuck. Turns out one of the sugar chunks had burned onto the side of the pan. But the worst part was when I finally cleaned it - I found that the sugar cubes had scoured off the non-stick surface in several spots and THAT was why the sugar cube was sticking! Now I need to get a replacement breadpan.

I am not sure what to do if someone in the family is allergic to gluten and can't have it.. but I just got the book and haven't read it completely so perhaps there is info in there about substitutes.

I have several good bread books including another by Hansperger but this one helped me to have a great experience with my bread machine.Most recipes are given in 1.5 pound as well as 2 pound versions. When I reviewed prior to purchase I thought it was repetitious and redundant, but once I used the book I realized the value of the author's hard work. I use a 1.5 pound loaf when baking in my Breadman Ultimate, and the 2 pound when baking in the oven.It is a large paperback book and can lay flat when following a recipe. My book is now over 4 years old and is falling apart - because I use it several times a week over many years, and use a clear plastic book holder.I have tried about 100 of the recipes and had good success with almost every one. I write notes beside the recipes so I can remember what I have tried and how it turned out. For several years I have been going through over 100 pounds of flour per year. The past year I have stuck with just a handful of recipes. My favorites include:- House bread. A simple daily bread for sandwiches and such. I alter to use about 1/4 cup of corn meal.- Tecate Ranch. It is a whole wheat bread. I have not tasted a similar bread elsewhere. I use sesame seeds instead of poppy seeds.- Semolina. My mother in law has a wheat allergy but enjoys eating this half-wheat bread without problems. Good in the machine or oven.- Limpa.- Pain De Maison Sur Poolish. A recipe with a sponge starter. I let the starter sit for a day or several. It is fantastic when baked in the oven.- Roman bread.

This is not a BAD cookbook. It just falls into a category of books I loving call \\"high maintenance\\". It is Bread for Beautiful People. It's one of those books written for people who either have enormous pantries or who shop every time they are about to bake. The ingredients are persnickety and can be hard to find, and there's no consistency, for example, in using real buttermilk/milk or dry. Every recipe needs added vital wheat gluten. There's just not very much that you can just \\"whip up\\" using ingredients most of us keep in the pantry and refridgerator -- even if your pantry already includes 4 kinds of flour and 6 kinds of sugar.Maybe that's what I get for buying a book full of recipes for French inspired breads. Maybe that means it's going to be full of high-maintenance recipes. But if you wanted abread machine to have fresh, homey breads without a lot of fuss, this might not be the best book for you either.Again, it's not a bad book. There's plenty of info in it, and if you want a lot of country style breads and breads that are best eaten the day they are cooked, it's a nice book. I will probably put a bow on it and re-gift it to my sister, who loves to read cookbooks but seldom actually makes the more interesting or challenging recipes.

It is **huge**--643 pages. A very unwieldy, heavy book to use as a recipe book. Just because of the size and weight, I find it inconvenient to leaf through, browsing in the normal way that we tend to do with recipe books.If it truly had to be so large, they could at least have given it a spiral binding. As it is, I know the paperback binding is not going to last long.If you are absolutely new to bread-making, perhaps this book would be useful. It does tell about different flours and other ingredients---it is more encyclopedic than a truly usable recipe book needs to be. However, if you are an experienced bread-maker, then use your money to pay for a more usable book, less heavy book.I will either give this book away or sell it---or take it apart and put it in a spiral binder notebook. I doubt that I will give it away, as nobody I know wants or needs such an unwieldy recipe book. And in any case I doubt that I will use it much, as I don't like to handle a spiral notebook of this weight either.If you want such how-to detail, you are better off using the recipe book that came with your bread machine, and then get another and thinner book that has a great variety of recipes."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"Used recipe for beer bread and dough was so thick it burned up motor in our bread machine.Be careful with this recipe."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"The book has some flaws: It has virtually no European bread recipes. I am European and love traditional European breads. The quality of industrial bread in American supermarkets is known to be extremely low, and compared to American industrial breads, all breads made according to the recipes in the book are (presumingly - as I didn't test all recipes) superior to the US industrial standards, but do not come close to European bread quality.I am used to high quality breads, especially rye and sourdough breads; the recipes provided in the book are virtually all based on wheat flour and yeast and there are hundreds of recipes, but hardly a single one that would yield a high quality European bread - not even near,The recipes are all based on cups. I tried some of them, but the results were not satisfactory. Is it because I live on Hawaii? Generally recipes are regarded as much more reliable when they are based on grams (or ounces - if you are still pre-metric).Furthermore, handling measurements in cups and table spoons is not only not accurate, but also messy, especially in small kitchens.

My whole reason to purchase a book like this was to give me some good base recipes, that I could then experiment on. Unfortunately, every recipe I have tried so far has been too dry. I have started notations in the book telling me how much extra liquid to add for each one, but it is quite annoying - the whole point of a recipe book is that you should be able to pick a recipe, bundle the ingredients together, and get a good result.In addition, most of the recipes call for gluten, which is not all that easy to find, so a trip to a specialty or health-food store is required if you are going to try most of them.

Did she get the others right? 2) In many recipes she says &quot;unplug the machine&quot; at one point or other in the process, making it very clear that she's not familiar with how machines work....or the simple expedient of pressing the reset/cancel button to achieve the desired effect.

It gives a good introduction to the processes and some hints of the chemistry behind baking, and I enjoyed it for that. My main problem is that I really dislike using archaic measures like 'cupful of flower' or 'two tablespoons and one teaspoon.' Anyone who can afford a bread machine can afford a kitchen scale, and can then use recipes which speak of grams of flour, which are much easier to measure and which can be easily scaled. Better still, use the Bakers' Percentage system.The problem is well illustrated by some of the menus - for example the first, on page 26, where we see a recipe for a 1 1/2 pound and a 2 pound loaf side by side, using 3 cups or 4 cups of bread flour. The ratios between the other ingredients and the flour are quite different in the two sized loaves.I would recommend finding a book which has left all this behind."},{"Title":"The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook: A Master Baker's 300 Favorite Recipes for Perfect-Every-Time Bread-From Every Kind of Machine","review":"I purchased a bread machine so we could start eating healthier breads. I wish I'd read through all the reviews before purchasing this book so I would have read the warnings about gluten in the recipes.. I was really excited to get this book, but so disappointed when I started flipping through the recipes and kept seeing gluten in every single recipe! The only ones that don't have gluten are the few recipes for gluten free breads in the book.. Gluten is one of the biggest things we want to cut out, so obviously, I won't be using any in these recipes.. Not sure how the breads will turn out without it, but I'll try at least one.. I had purchased a Betty Crocker bread machine book and there isn't one recipe in that book that calls for Gluten..
