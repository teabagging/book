Hyperaccumulation plants are an appealing and economical alternative to current methods of soil recovery. Phytoremediation of Contaminated Soil and Water is the most thorough literary examination of the subject available today. The successful implementation of phytoremediation depends on identifying plant material that is well adapted to specific toxic sites. Gentle remediation is then applied in situ, or at the contamination site. No soil excavation or transport is necessary. This severely contains the potential risk of the pollutants entering the food chain. And it's cost effective. The progress of modern man has created many sites contaminated with heavy metals. The effected land is toxic to plants and animals , which creates considerable public interest in remediation. But the commonly used remedies are ex situ, which poses an expensive dilemma and an even greater threat. Phytoremediation offers the prospect of a cheaper and healthier way to deal with this problem.

This reference shows how to understand the history and tactics of the global terror group ISIS and how to use that knowledge to defeat it. ISIS the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria has taken on the mantle of being the single most dangerous terrorist threat to global security since al-Qaeda. In Defeating ISIS, internationally renowned intelligence veteran and counter-terrorism expert Malcolm Nance, author of The Plot to Hack America and the forthcoming Hacking ISIS, gives an insider s view to explain the origins of this occult group, its violent propaganda, and how it spreads its ideology throughout the Middle East and to disaffected youth deep in the heart of the Western world. The group and its followers have struck repeatedly over the past few years: in Paris, Brussels, and Nice; at a center for developmental disabilities in San Bernadino, California; in the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Defeating ISIS gives a step-by-step analysis of the street-level tactics the terrorists have employed in assaults against fortified targets, in urban combat, and during terrorist operations both at home and abroad. As much as ISIS is a threat to Western targets and regional stability in the Middle East, Nance describes not only its true danger as a heretical death cult that seeks to wrest control of Islam through young ideologues and redefine Islam as a fight to the death against all comers, but also how to defeat it. Updated throughout and featuring a new afterword, Defeating ISIS is a highly detailed look into the organization by one of the world s foremost authorities in counter-terrorism","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SivMAQAACAAJ&dq=ISIS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hibachi barbecue in the American manner: A collection of recipes from the kitchens of George's, Tokyo","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SBf7HAAACAAJ&dq=Hibachi+barbecue+in+the+American+manner:+A+collection+of+recipes+from+the+kitchens+of+George%27s,+Tokyo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dark Light","description":"'Ten minutes to midnight!'

Matthiessen, a student of Zen Buddhism, was also on a spiritual quest to find the Lama of Shey at the ancient shrine on Crystal Mountain. The result is a remarkable account of a journey both physical and spiritual, as the arduous climb yields to Matthiessen a deepening Buddhist understanding of reality, suffering, impermanence, and beauty.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BRRvDQAAQBAJ&dq=Leopard&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Masterpieces of Western Art: A History of Art in 900 Individual Studies (Jumbo) (Slipcased) 2 volumes","description":"Published to accompany the exhibition Jackson Pollock held the Museum of Modern Art, New York, from 1 November 1998 to 2 February 1999.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vNoX4iTHPs0C&dq=Masterpieces+of+Western+Art:+A+History+of+Art+in+900+Individual+Studies+(Jumbo)+(Slipcased)+2+volumes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dalits and the Democratic Revolution: Dr Ambedkar and the Dalit Movement in Colonial India","description":"This important book traces the history of the Dalit movement from its beginning in the 19th century to the death of its most famous leader, B.R.

From birth, children are learning and rely on parents and the other caregivers in their lives to protect and care for them. The impact of parents may never be greater than during the earliest years of life, when a child's brain is rapidly developing and when nearly all of her or his experiences are created and shaped by parents and the family environment. Parents help children build and refine their knowledge and skills, charting a trajectory for their health and well-being during childhood and beyond. The experience of parenting also impacts parents themselves. For instance, parenting can enrich and give focus to parents' lives; generate stress or calm; and create any number of emotions, including feelings of happiness, sadness, fulfillment, and anger. Parenting of young children today takes place in the context of significant ongoing developments. These include: a rapidly growing body of science on early childhood, increases in funding for programs and services for families, changing demographics of the U.S. population, and greater diversity of family structure. Additionally, parenting is increasingly being shaped by technology and increased access to information about parenting. Parenting Matters identifies parenting knowledge, attitudes, and practices associated with positive developmental outcomes in children ages 0-8; universal/preventive and targeted strategies used in a variety of settings that have been effective with parents of young children and that support the identified knowledge, attitudes, and practices; and barriers to and facilitators for parents' use of practices that lead to healthy child outcomes as well as their participation in effective programs and services. This report makes recommendations directed at an array of stakeholders, for promoting the wide-scale adoption of effective programs and services for parents and on areas that warrant further research to inform policy and practice. It is meant to serve as a roadmap for the future of parenting policy, research, and practice in the United States.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FA8MDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"File No. 113","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KKxcAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Poems an Short Stories","description":"Presents a collection of fifty-six familiar and unfamiliar stories by such writers as Washington Irving, Ernest Hemingway, Edgar Allan Poe, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Henry James, and Kate Chopin.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Vwn2B6pPHjAC&dq=American+Poems+an+Short+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Soul Food and Living Water: Spiritual Nourishment and Practical Help for the African American Family","description":"As God-conscious families, we all struggle to maintain a vibrant faith that will lead to strength and happiness in the midst of declining social values and daily challenges.

His new work often has an almost theatrical effect on the viewer -- seeming to emanate directly from the lives of the artist's models. The settings, the subjects, the sumptuous lighting will all be familiar to longtime admirers of Sturges' ongoing body of work. As his experience as a photographer has deepened and his relationships with his growing subjects spans decades of collaboration, both subjects and photographer have found more to say to each other. The new photographs include diptychs of clothed/nude models, pictures of true mutual trust, as well as never-before seen color photographs! This large format book takes direct aim at Jock Sturges' long-standing vision as his large format, 8x10 view-camera always demanded the large exhibition prints that were to follow. Thanks to the brilliant combination of computer-driven advances in modern printing techniques and the old-world attention to detail and craftsmanship, this book sets a new standard for the reproduction of artworks.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N9uFSQAACAAJ&dq=Jock+Sturges:+New+Work,+1996-2000&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Before the Gates of Excellence: The Determinants of Creative Genius","description":"Before the Gates of Excellence is an exceptionally well-written and lively account of the nature of productive creativity or 'genius'.

If you think that your eyesight could be made better by natural methods, you are right. After years of experimentation, Dr. Bates came to the conclusion that many people who wore glasses did not need them. He gradually and carefully developed a simple group of exercises for improving the ability of the eyes themselves to see, eliminating the tension caused by poor visual habits that are the major cause of bad eyesight. These exercises are based on the firm belief that it is the natural function of the eyes to see clearly and that anyone, child or adult, can learn to see better without glasses.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vNXsXCVCMoYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, 2007","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O4NgtgEACAAJ&dq=Sports+Illustrated+Swimsuit+Issue,+2007&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mean As Hell","description":"New Mexico rancher and lawman Dee (Daniel R.)

Harkey served as a New Mexico peace officer from 1893 until 1911. Among the many cattle rustlers, train robbers, and other outlaws he confronted were Jim Miller, whom Harkey fingers as Pat Garrett s real killer, and the Dalton Gang. Harkey observes that, in 1948,  cattle stealing has gone out of fashion. We ve gotten civilized. Instead..., we now have statesman who practice nepotism, pad the public payrolls and graft as much as they think they can get away with (in an honorable way, of course) just like the folks back east.

Used as both a high-altitude escort fighter and a low-level fighter-bomber, it quickly gained a reputation for being tough and resilient. Many different air forces operated this plane, and it sported a wide range of camouflage schemes, finishes and markings, including stunning nose art. Modellers have been well served with Thunderbolt kits over the years, right up to the latest highly accurate releases. This book takes a step-by-step approach to modelling a wide variety of P-47 types in 1/48-scale, from 'Razorbacks' in USAAF colours to RAF T-bolts in the Far East. It provides expert advice on conversions (including a Bubbletop to a P-47M), adding aftermarket items, detailing, and ways to achieve top quality weathering and finishes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xaIXDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Napoleon's Hussars (Men-at-Arms)","description":"Napoleon's Hussars made their first real impact during the Napoleonic Wars in 1806, with their astonishing pursuit of the Prussians over 1,160km from the river Saale to the Oder in twenty-five days.

As a result of the Nazi regime s scorn for modern art, virtually all non-traditional art between 1933 and 1945 was banned in Germany on the grounds that it was un-German, Jewish, or Communist in nature. Those identified as degenerate artists were dismissed from teaching positions and forbidden to exhibit or to sell their works. This book sheds light on the historical significance and provenance of nearly 525 works by modernist greats, such as Picasso, Chagall, and Kandinsky, which were acquired by the Kunstmuseum Bern through a combination of auctions and private donations. The book traces the fates of artists who suffered under the Nazi regime and who had connections to Switzerland, including Kirchner, Klee and Dix, and contrasts the cultural policies of the Third Reich with those of Switzerland in the same period. Finally, it details the dramatic events and unprecedented efforts that went into preserving invaluable works of art.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=83U5jwEACAAJ&dq=Reich+(Modern+masters)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Las Semanas del jardin de Miguel de Cervantes: Estudio, edicion y facsimil del manuscrito (Serie Lengua y literatura) (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NTtfAAAAMAAJ&dq=Las+Semanas+del+jardin+de+Miguel+de+Cervantes:+Estudio,+edicion+y+facsimil+del+manuscrito+(Serie+Lengua+y+literatura)+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cracking the NEW SAT, 2005 Edition (College Test Prep)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dictionary of eye terminology","description":"This new edition has been expanded with more terms and more abbreviations.

W. Brands comes the definitive biography of a visionary and transformative president In his magisterial new biography, H. W. Brands brilliantly establishes Ronald Reagan as one of the two great presidents of the twentieth century, a true peer to Franklin Roosevelt. Reagan conveys with sweep and vigor how the confident force of Reagan's personality and the unwavering nature of his beliefs enabled him to engineer a conservative revolution in American politics and play a crucial role in ending communism in the Soviet Union. Reagan shut down the age of liberalism, Brands shows, and ushered in the age of Reagan, whose defining principles are still powerfully felt today. Employing archival sources not available to previous biographers and drawing on dozens of interviews with surviving members of Reagan's administration, Brands has crafted a richly detailed and fascinating narrative of the presidential years. He offers new insights into Reagan's remote management style and fractious West Wing staff, his deft handling of public sentiment to transform the tax code, and his deeply misunderstood relationship with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, on which nothing less than the fate of the world turned. Reagan is a storytelling triumph, an irresistible portrait of an underestimated politician whose pragmatic leadership and steadfast vision transformed the nation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FoQQDAAAQBAJ&dq=Ronald+Reagan:+A+Life+In+Politics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Amphibians of Java and Bali","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BgLbAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Amphibians+of+Java+and+Bali&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Drop-Surface Interactions","description":"This book presents a comprehensive overview of fluid mechanical, thermal and physico-chemical aspects of drop-surface interactions.

More than 80,000 Canadian women were married to men who left home to fight in the war, and its effects on their lives were transformative and often traumatic. Yet the everyday struggles of Canadian war wives, lived far from the battlefields of France, have remained in the shadows of historical memory. Anxious Days and Tearful Nights highlights how Canadian women's experiences of wartime marital separation resembled and differed from those of their European counterparts. Drawing on the letters of married couples separated by wartime service and the military service records of hundreds of Canadian soldiers, Martha Hanna reveals how couples used correspondence to maintain the routine and the affection of domestic life. She explores how women managed households and budgets, how those with children coped with the challenges of what we today would call single parenthood, and when and why some war wives chose to relocate to Britain to be nearer to their husbands. More than anything else, the life of a war wife - especially a war wife separated from her husband for years on end - was marked and marred by unrelieved psychological stress. Through this close personal lens Hanna reveals a broader picture of how war's effects persist across time and space.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LeXoDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dark Rainbow","description":"Instant National Bestseller The long-awaited autobiography by one of heavy metal s most revered icons, treasured vocalists, and front man for three legendary bands Rainbow, Black Sabbath, and Dio. Prior to his tragic death in 2010, Ronnie James Dio had been writing his autobiography, looking back on the remarkable life that led him from his hometown in upstate New York to the biggest stages in the world, including the arena that represented the pinnacle of success to him Madison Square Garden, where this book begins and ends. As Ronnie contemplates the achievement of a dream, he reflects on the key aspects that coalesced into this moment the close gang of friends that gave him his start in music, playing parties, bars, frats, and clubs; the sudden transition that moved him to the microphone and changed his life forever; the luck that led to the birth of Rainbow and a productive but difficult collaboration with Ritchie Blackmore; the chance meeting that made him the second singer of Black Sabbath, taking them to new levels of success; the surprisingly tender story behind the birth of the Devil Horns, the lasting symbol of heavy metal; his marriage to Wendy, which stabilized his life, and the huge bet they placed together to launch the most successful endeavor of his career his own band, Dio. Everything is described in great detail and in the frankest terms, from his fallout with Blackmore, to the drugs that derailed the resurrection of Black Sabbath, to the personality clashes that frayed each band. Written with longtime friend of thirty years and esteemed music writer, Mick Wall, who took up the mantle after Ronnie s passing, Rainbow in the Dark is a frank, startling, often hilarious, sometimes sad testament to dedication and ambition, filled with moving coming-of-age tales, glorious stories of excess, and candid recollections of what really happened backstage, at the hotel, in the studio, and back home behind closed doors far away from the road.

Civil wars represent the principal form of armed conflict since the end of the Second World War, and certainly in the contemporary era. The nature and impact of civil wars suggests that these conflicts reflect and are also a driving force for major societal change. In this sense, \\"Understanding Civil War: Continuity and Change in Intrastate Conflict\\" argues that the nature of civil war is not fundamentally changing in nature. The book includes a thorough consideration of patterns and types of intrastate conflict and debates relating to the causes, impact, and changing nature of war. A key focus is on the political and social driving forces of such conflict and its societal meanings, significance and consequences. The author also explores methodological and epistemological challenges related to studying and understanding intrastate war. A range of questions and debates are addressed. What is the current knowledge regarding the causes and nature of armed intrastate conflict? Is it possible to produce general, cross-national theories on civil war which have broad explanatory relevance? Is the concept of civil wars empirically meaningful in an era of globalization and transnational war? Has intrastate conflict fundamentally changed in nature? Are there historical patterns in different types of intrastate conflict? What are the most interesting methodological trends and debates in the study of armed intrastate conflict? How are narratives about the causes and nature of civil wars constructed around ideas such as ethnic conflict, separatist conflict and resource conflict? This book will be of much interest to students of civil wars, intrastate conflict, security studies and IR in general.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=E_GsiMU2sksC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Uncle Yeshu, Messiah","description":"Jesus' nephew narrates the history of his family from the marriage of Joseph and Mary to the Bar Kokhba uprising.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eMHEAAAACAAJ&dq=Uncle+Yeshu,+Messiah&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Down and Out in Flamingo Beach (Kimani Romance)","description":"Mine is simple: return to my old hometown to help myailing Granny \\"J\\" give her failing quilt shop a major makeover,and hightail it back to Los Angeles and civilization.

She demonstrates how Nabokov arranges the details of his fiction to explore human psychology and moral truth, and she argues her case with style. Focusing on the most highly wrought and aesthetically self-conscious of Nabokov's novels, Pifer shows how he deploys artifice to bring into bold relief what is real. In her chapter on King, Queen, Knave she reveals Nabokov's radical distinction between genuine and simulated human existence. She shows how, in Invitation to a Beheading and Bend Sinister, he contrasts \\"grotesque design\\" of collective existence with the individul's radiant internal life. In Despair, Lolita, and Pale Fire Nabokov's parody of the double illuminates the unique source of human consciousness. In Ada, as in the earlier Laughter in the Dark, the inhuman nature of aesthetic bliss qualifies its delights. Making clear the moral perception of reality that lies behind Nabokov's artistic strategies, Pifer offers a new assessment of Nabokov's fiction and of his contribution to the tradition of the novel.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=H2eqngEACAAJ&dq=Nabokov+and+the+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Che Guevara and the Fight for Socialism Today: Cuba Confronts the World Crisis of the '90s","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Dore Bible Illustrations","description":"Detailed plates from the Bible: the Creation scenes, Adam and Eve, horrifying visions of the Flood, the battle sequences with their monumental crowds, depictions of the life of Jesus, 241 plates in all.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CutTLGiAueUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Plan of Salvation: Doctrinal Notes and Commentary","description":"Thought-provoking, in-depth, & readable book on the plan of salvation","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0KluJgAACAAJ&dq=The+Plan+of+Salvation:+Doctrinal+Notes+and+Commentary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ghosts of Denver: Capitol Hill","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HGfjSgAACAAJ&dq=The+Ghosts+of+Denver:+Capitol+Hill&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Don Juan.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_3vfmEwoO1AC&dq=Don+Juan.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History","description":"In 1979, FBI Agent Robert Philip Hanssen began to sell some of America?s most closely guarded intelligence secrets to the Soviet Union.

Although local economic, ethnic, and religious issues tended to dominate northern antebellum politics, The South and the Politics of Slavery convincingly argues that national and slavery-related issues were the overriding concerns of southern politics during these years. Accordingly, southern voters saw their parties, both Democratic and Whig, as the advocates and guardians of southern rights in the nation. William Cooper traces and analyzes the history of southern politics from the formation of the Democratic party in the late 1820s to the demise of the Democratic-Whig struggle in the 1850s, reporting on attitudes and reactions in each of the eleven states that were to form the Confederacy. Focusing on southern politicians and parties, Cooper emphasizes their relationship with each other, with their northern counterparts, and with southern voters, and he explores the connections between the values of southern white society and its parties and politicians. Based on extensive research in regional political manuscripts and newspapers, this study will be valuable to all historians of the period for the information and insight it provides on the role of the South in politics of the nation during the lifespan of the Jacksonian party system.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zBCVIKhrN0cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Games That Teach Teams: 21 Activities to Super-Charge Your Group!","description":"Building on his first book, \\"Games That Teach, \\" Steve Sugar, along with George Takacs, uses games and interactive learning exercises to tackle team issues.

Language and Responsibility is a well-organized, clearly written and comprehensive introduction to Chomsky s thought.   The New York Times Book Review  Language and Responsibility brings together in one readable volume Chomsky s positions on issues ranging from politics and philosophy of science to recent advances in linguistic theory. . . . The clarity of presentation at times approaches that of Bertrand Russell in his political and more popular philosophical essays.

Where does judicial power come from, how does it develop in the early stages of democratic liberalization, and what political conditions support its expansion? This book answers these questions through an examination of three constitutional courts in Asia: Taiwan, Korea, and Mongolia. In a region that has traditionally viewed law as a tool of authoritarian rulers, constitutional courts in these three societies are becoming a real constraint on government. In contrast with conventional culturalist accounts, this book argues that the design and functioning of constitutional review are largely a function of politics and interests. Judicial review - the power of judges to rule an act of a legislature or national leader unconstitutional - is a solution to the problem of uncertainty in constitutional design. By providing insurance to prospective electoral losers, judicial review can facilitate democracy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qJrsouEjOZEC&dq=Judicial+Review+in+New+Democracies:+Constitutional+Courts+in+Asian+Cases&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Natural history and antiquities of Selborne","description":"Originally published as part of: The natural history and antiquities of Selborne, in the county of Southampton.

These exasperated purists complained that realignment would mean the loss of existing rivalries, that interleague play would cheapen the thrill of the World Series, and that each move would contribute to the loss of statistical continuity. But change, even radical change, is nothing new to baseball. Arguing that self-alteration is perhaps the national pastime's truest tradition, Russell O. Wright shows that it is customary for management to change not only the rules, but the ball, the franchises, and the stadiums. The author considers the key rule changes, franchise moves, ball modifications, and variations in the player pool, and traces the effects each of these had on the game's statistics. The book includes tables, chronologies, and lists of logically presented statistics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WXITAQAAIAAJ&dq=A+Tale+of+Two+Leagues+:+How+Baseball+Changed+As+the+Rules,+Ball,+Franchises,+Stadiums+and+Players+Changed,+1900-1998&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Silk","description":"In the 1860s, when Japan is still closed to foreigners, Herve Joncour, a young French merchant, makes a series of clandestine journeys across Siberia to Japan, at first to purchase silkworm eggs, and later to pursue an affair with a Japanese nobleman's concubine.

Proclaimed as the playwright of his generation, he went on to win three Pulitzer Prizes for his searing and innovative plays. Mel Gussow, author, critic, and cultural writer for The New York Times, has known Albee and followed his career since its inception, and in this fascinating biography he creates a compelling firsthand portrait of a complex genius. The book describes Albee's life as the adopted child of rich, unloving parents and covers the highs and lows of his career. A core myth of Albee's life, perpetuated by the playwright, is that The Zoo Story was his first play, written as a thirtieth birthday present to himself. As Gussow relates, Albee has been writing since adolescence, and through close analysis the author traces the genesis of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Tiny Alice, A Delicate Balance, and other plays. After his early triumphs, Albee endured years of critical neglect and public disfavor. Overcoming artistic and personal difficulties, he returned in 1994 with Three Tall Women. In this prizewinning play he came to terms with the towering figure of his mother, the woman who dominated so much of his early life. With frankness and critical acumen, and drawing on extensive conversations with the playwright, Gussow offers fresh insights into Albee's life. At the same time he provides vivid portraits of Albee's relationships with the people who have been closest to him, including William Flanagan (his first mentor), Thornton Wilder, Richard Barr, John Steinbeck, Alan Schneider, John Gielgud, and his leading ladies, Uta Hagen, Colleen Dewhurst, Irene Worth, Myra Carter, Elaine Stritch, Marian Seldes, and Maggie Smith. And then there are, most famously, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, who starred in Mike Nichols's acclaimed film version of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? The book places Albee in context as a playwright who inspired writers as diverse as John Guare and Sam Shepard, and as a teacher and champion of human rights. Edward Albee: A Singular Journey is rich with colorful details about this uniquely American life. It also contains previously unpublished photographs and letters from and to Albee. It is the essential book about one of the major artists of the American theater.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SoylVIJfvgEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Darkest Knight","description":"As Earth has been taken over by the Dark Multiverse, the Justice League fight to survive!

Now William Dunham gives them the attention they deserve. Dunham places each theorem within its historical context and explores the very human and often turbulent life of the creator   from Archimedes, the absentminded theoretician whose absorption in his work often precluded eating or bathing, to Gerolamo Cardano, the sixteenth-century mathematician whose accomplishments flourished despite a bizarre array of misadventures, to the paranoid genius of modern times, Georg Cantor. He also provides step-by-step proofs for the theorems, each easily accessible to readers with no more than a knowledge of high school mathematics. A rare combination of the historical, biographical, and mathematical, Journey Through Genius is a fascinating introduction to a neglected field of human creativity.

From this raw material Robert Graves brilliantly recreates a world of power, intrigue and cruelty, a world permeated through and through with the threat of sudden and violent death. In the process he raises striking, sometimes unanswerable questions: was Tiberius really as depraved as Suetonius suggests? Was Livia the true power behind Augustus' throne? And did she really poison all those people? Did Caligula seriously plan to make his horse a consul? Whether or not we can answer these questions, this was certainly a world in which such things could happen.With an Afterword by Tom Griffith.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Lv1xMAEACAAJ&dq=The+Twelve+Caesars%3B+The+Folio+Society+Special+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Freezing Tillie: An Alliance of Strangers","description":"Would you deep-freeze a dying loved one in anticipation of a medical cure?

Some of the stories related in the following pages are deadly serious, some rather less so.

In a masterful biography laden with new revelations, veteran country music journalist/historian Rich Kienzle offers a definitive, full-bodied portrait of legendary country singer George Jones and the music that remains his legacy. Kienzle meticulously sifted through archival material, government records, recollections by colleagues and admirers, interviewing many involved in Jones s life and career. The result: an evocative portrait of this enormously gifted, tragically tormented icon called  the Keith Richards of country.  Kienzle chronicles Jones s impoverished East Texas childhood as the youngest son of a deeply religious mother and alcoholic, often-abusive father. He examines his three troubled marriages including his union with superstar Tammy Wynette and looks unsparingly at Jones s demons. Alcohol and later cocaine nearly killed him until fourth wife Nancy helped him learn to love himself. Kienzle also details Jones s remarkable musical journey from singing in violent Texas honky tonks to Grand Ole Opry star, hitmaker and master vocalist whose raw, emotionally powerful delivery remains the Gold Standard for country singers. The George Jones of this heartfelt biography lived hard before finding contentment until he died at eighty-one a story filled with whiskey, women and drugs but always the saving grace of music.

There's only one catch . . . he has four legs and a tail. Relatively indifferent to the natural world, allergic to dogs, and happily independent, writer Louise Bernikow never had a pet and knew nothing about caring for one. But one day while running along Manhattan's Hudson River, she came across an abandoned boxer. He had a gimpy leg and a dim past, but Bernikow instantly, bewilderingly, did the one thing her mother always warned her not to do-she brought the strange male home. Here is the comical and offbeat story of their first year together. Libro, as she comes to call him (for \\"book,\\" in Spanish), introduces her to the curious world of dog runs and dog people, and to a local dive where the bartender pulls pints from the tap and dog biscuits from the drawer. Bernikow, in turn, introduces Libro to the eccentric neighbors and to life as a media hound. When they meet a handsome man and his equally handsome dachshund, life takes an unexpected turn for both of them. Wonderfully written and captivating to the last, this is a remarkable tale of companionship.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HtVYcZmEh50C&dq=Bark+If+You+Love+Me+(Harvest+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Access French : A First Course for Adults","description":"ACCESS LANGUAGE SERIES The Access Language series provides an innovative, modern course for adult language learners of all ages.

Disregarding late-nineteenth-century aesthetic standards that called for carefully delineated and composed landscapes filled with transparent washes, his confidently bold, dense strokes and loosely defined forms startled critics and fellow practitioners alike. One reviewer in England, where Sargent spent much of his adult life, called his work swagger watercolours. For Sargent, however, the watercolours were not so much about swagger as about a new way of thinking. In watercolour as opposed to oils his vision became more personal and his works more interconnected. Presenting nearly 100 works of art, this book is the first major publication of Sargents watercolours in twenty years. Each chapter highlights a different subject or theme that attracted the artists attention during his travels through Europe and the Middle East: sunlight on stone, figures reclining on grass, patterns of light and shadow. Insightful essays by the worlds leading experts enhance this book and introduce readers to the full sweep of Sargents accomplishments in the medium, in works that delight the eye as well as challenge our understanding of this prodigiously gifted artist.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yV0vlQEACAAJ&dq=Roumeli:+Travels+in+Northern+Greece+(Isis+(Hardcover+Large+Print))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Electromyography in Clinical Practice: A Case Study Approach","description":"The only case-based guide to electromyography back in a fully revised and updated New Edition!

The polemic asserts that society is advancing from primitive economic systems toward the utopian state of communism. It remains a work of tremendous importance and influence and offers an astute critique of capitalism, exploring commodities, value, money, and other factors related to the system's historic origins and contemporary functions. The examination of these elements forms the basis of Marxist doctrine: the system is irredeemable, a revolution is imperative, and a socialist system is the only viable alternative, providing a structure in which production serves the needs of all rather than the enrichment of the elite. AUTHOR: Philosopher and radical thinker Karl Marx (1818-74) was expelled from Germany and France after publishing controversial material, including The Communist Manifesto, which he co-wrote with Friedrich Engels. In 1848, he was exiled to London, where he wrote Das Kapital and resided for the remainder of his life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fZeWDwAAQBAJ&dq=Capital:+A+critique+of+political+economy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great Paper Quilling","description":"It is astonishing how many intricate patterns can be created from narrow strips of paper.

To many couples, marriage means little more than just living together. But others succeed in establishing a true union, a profound emotional fusion that involves not only sharing a home, but sharing an entire life as well. In Marriage Is for Grownups, Joseph and Lois Bird analyze the problem areas common to most marriages and offer sound guidelines toward solving them and attaining that true union and meaningful relationship. The authors--who have years of experience in marriage counseling--offer no marital nostrums; instead, they encourage each partner to examine his own fears, demands, values, and defenses in order to decide where he wants his marriage relationship to go--and how to reach that goal. The Birds explore many aspects of married life maturely and positively, and at the same time suggest rational ways of confronting them. Whether they're discussing communications problems, finances, sex, in-laws, children, they do so on a realistic level with the aim of helping married couples become motivated to improve their marital relationship. As Dr. Bird points out, \\"This is not a marriage 'cook book,' providing pat answers which would hopefully apply to all (but which never do). It raises questions by which the spouses can find their own answers.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xw_pJYkgSBkC&dq=Marriage+is+for+grownups&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The genius of George Washington (The Third George Rogers Clark lecture)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bU4fvwEACAAJ&dq=The+genius+of+George+Washington+(The+Third+George+Rogers+Clark+lecture)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Joy of Painting With Bob Ross (Vol VI)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7SpttAEACAAJ&dq=The+Joy+of+Painting+With+Bob+Ross+(Vol+VI)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blood and Guile","description":"Follows four men into the woods on a friendly hunting trip that results in the shooting death of one of them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7FkQZz8MpBcC&dq=Blood+and+Guile&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Basketful of Snowflakes","description":"It's the peak of orange harvesting season at the Kerrs' little farm in the entrancing Tramuntana Mountains of Mallorca, and the family are trying to relax into their new life on the sunny Spanish island.

It is not heaven. Award-winning author N. T. Wright outlines the present confusion about a Christian's future hope and shows how it is deeply intertwined with how we live today. Wright, who is one of today's premier Bible scholars, asserts that Christianity's most distinctive idea is bodily resurrection. He provides a magisterial defense for a literal resurrection of Jesus and shows how this became the cornerstone for the Christian community's hope in the bodily resurrection of all people at the end of the age. Wright then explores our expectation of \\"new heavens and a new earth,\\" revealing what happens to the dead until then and what will happen with the \\"second coming\\" of Jesus. For many, including many Christians, all this will come as a great surprise. Wright convincingly argues that what we believe about life after death directly affects what we believe about life before death. For if God intends to renew the whole creation and if this has already begun in Jesus's resurrection the church cannot stop at \\"saving souls\\" but must anticipate the eventual renewal by working for God's kingdom in the wider world, bringing healing and hope in the present life. Lively and accessible, this book will surprise and excite all who are interested in the meaning of life, not only after death but before it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M5df9T6QJjMC&dq=Hope+of+Heaven&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Emigration from Germany to Russia in the years 1763 to 1862","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lGMMAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Emigration+from+Germany+to+Russia+in+the+years+1763+to+1862&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On the Cosmic Horizon: Ten Great Mysteries for Third Millennium Astronomy","description":"\\"On the Cosmic Horizon reaches wide across the cosmos to provide lucid explanations for many of the most compelling cosmic questions.

Further new trends of study and fresh approaches (existentialist, Marxian, postmodern) have in more recent years generated new quests and horizons for reflection and research. Theological enquiry in Great Britain was transformed in the late nineteenth century through the gradual acceptance of the methods and results of historical criticism. New agendas emerged in the various sub-disciplines of theology and religious studies. Some of the issues raised by biblical criticism, for example Christology and the 'quest of the historical Jesus', were to remain topics of controversy throughout the twentieth century. In other important and far-reaching ways, however, the agendas that seemed clear in the early part of the century were abandoned, or transformed and replaced, not only as a result of new discoveries and movements of thought, but also by the unfolding events of a century that brought the appalling carnage and horror of two world wars. Their aftermath brought a shattering of inherited world views, including religious world views, and disillusion with the optimistic trust in inevitable progress that had seemed assured in many quarters and found expression in widely influential 'liberal' theological thought of the time. The centenary of the British Academy in 2002 has provided a most welcome opportunity for reconsidering the contribution of British scholarship to theological and religious studies in the last hundred years.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UfwI_XOkHaYC&dq=Campaigns+in+Palestine+From+from+Alexander+the+Great+(The+Schweich+Lectures,+1922)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zarela's Veracruz: Mexico's Simplest Cuisine","description":"Capturing the easy-going atmosphere of Mexico's eastern coastal cuisine, this Veracruz cookbook reveals various delicious combinations for seafood, chicken, vegetables, olive oil, and fresh herbs, featuring more than 150 recipes that reveal the dishes' Spanish culinary roots.

It offers general techniques for working with varying quantities of content and shows how designers can apply these techniques in their own work.

With this six-step Bonding(R) process, you can heal past wounds by re-parenting the Inner Child and overcome obstacles that prevent you from progressing in life. Based on the pioneering principles featured in Healing Your Aloneness and Inner Bonding, this easy-to-use workbook gently guides you through a powerful spiritual healing process. Whether you use it in conjunction with aforementioned books or on its own, this guide can connect us with our Inner Child, our loving Adult, and our Higher Power ultimately to create loving relationships with others. Through dynamic exercises, guided visualizations, and inner dialogues with both the Inner Child and Higher Power, Chopich and Paul give us the tools to create a powerful, spiritually connected inner loving Adult. It is a lack of a loving Adult that leads to aloneness, alienation, emptiness, and resulting addictions to substances, processes, and people. This process allows an integrated self to emerge, one that combines the playfulness, creativity, and intuition of a child with the wisdom, strength, and nurture of a loving Adult. The Healing Your Aloneness Workbook demonstrates how you can connect with your essence to help cultivate personal empowerment and loving relationships. Erika J. Chopich, PhD, has been a psychotherapist, noted speaker, and workshop leader. She is the co-creator of the Inner Bonding Process and co-author of Healing Your Aloneness.

Two men meet for dinner each week. Over the course of one of these drunken evenings, the writer recounts the stories he would write, had he the courage: a young man buys an old kiln and opens a private crematorium, delighting in his ability to harass the corpses of police officers and Party secretaries, while swooning to banned Western music; a heartbroken actress performs a public suicide by stepping into the jaws of a wild tiger, watched nonchalantly by her ex-lover. Extraordinary characters inspire him, their lives pulled and pummeled by fate and politics, as if they are balls of dough in the hands of an all-powerful noodle maker. Ma Jian's satirical masterpiece allows us a humorous, yet profound, glimpse of those struggling to survive under a system that dictates their every move.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2S95NBFYnGEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Human rights, equality and democratic renewal in Northern Ireland.","description":"Recent developments in Northern Ireland have correctly been described as historic. While the future of constitutional change is by no means certain,events merit close scrutiny. The Good Friday Agreement 1998 marked a significant departure from incrementalism and thus with the dominant logic of British constitutionalism. The Agreement is in essence a constitutional promise anchored in clear normative principles. Although several aspects of the Agreement are in operation there is no guarantee that this new form of constitutionalism will work. However, the foundations of the settlement are clear. The building blocks reflect a strong commitment to human rights, equality and democratic renewal which encompasses a multiplicity of overlapping relationships. This book examines several key aspects of this complex picture. Developments in Northern Ireland have attracted a large measure of international interest. Reflecting this the contributors demonstrate the links to current controversies in constitutional and human rights law scholarship. At a time when there is much consideration of constitutional change in the UK and beyond, the intention is to offer a collection that both describes the changing legal and political landscape in Northern Ireland and one which provides a significant contribution to current debates on constitutionalism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7rbbBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Morning, Noon, and Night","description":"The drowning death of one of the wealthiest men in the world has international ripple effects that become complicated by the appearance of a beautiful woman who claims to be the man's daughter and heir.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BgT_mIpOO2oC&dq=Morning,+Noon,+and+Night&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sailing Through Six Sigma - Book & CD Set","description":"Sailing through Six Sigma is the most user-friendly and comprehensive guide for implementing the Six Sigma performance improvement process.

Yet they continue to be extravagantly praised for accomplishing what they never attempted or intended, and they are even more foolishly abused for possessing attitudes and attributes foreign to them. In the popular mind they are still generally confused, to their great disadvantage, with the Puritans who settled to the north of them around Boston Bay. The purpose of the Willison narrative is to allow the Pilgrims to tell their own story, insofar as possible, in their own words and deeds.Saints and Strangers brings back to life men and women who were among the most stalwart of American ancestors. George F. Willison destroys the myth that too long has been createdin the American mind: that Pilgrims, while pious and much to be admired, were a drab, stern people dedicated to prudery. Nothing could be further from the facts. These were lusty English people who were well aware of good food, drink, and pleasurable living. They were also an adventurous, hardheaded community united in their campaign for freedom of worship.The book takes the reader from the Puritan exile in Holland, their long and troubled voyage from old Europe to new America, and the hazardous period of settling on a strange, bleak coast. ThePuritans were comprised of weavers, smiths, carpenters, printers, tailors, and working people - with scarcely a blue blood among them. It was a long trek to Plymouth Rock from English village life. Willison has produced a realistic picture of these people who often have been inaccurately portrayed with little appreciation of their substantial place in the history of a New World.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jxcetAEACAAJ&dq=Saints+and+Strangers:+Being+the+Lives+of+the+Pilgrim+Fathers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wzJyzgEACAAJ&dq=Surrendering+to+Motherhood+:+Losing+Your+Mind,+Finding+Your+Soul&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gale Encyclopedia of Psychology: Projective techniques","description":"Contains approximately 500 alphabetically-arranged entries that provide information about key concepts in psychology, and includes illustrations and a glossary of terms.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FkUQAQAAIAAJ&dq=Gale+Encyclopedia+of+Psychology:+Projective+techniques&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crossing Shattuck Bridge: Stories","description":"A collection of stories set in the U.S. South.

(Although if St. Paul had stuck with its original name it would be Minneapolis-Pig s Eye Landing, the name came from a notorious whiskey runner.)The long and cold Minnesota winters and humid summers have spawned an architecture to feat the weather with indoor shopping malls, domed stadia, skyways and a whole host of sports and celebrations that thrive in this climate.

This process is no less true for the role of imagination in sonic events and artifacts. Many existing works on sonic imagination tend to discuss musical imagination through terms like compositional creativity or performance technique. In this two-volume Handbook, contributors shift the focus of imagination away from the visual by addressing the topic of sonic imagination and expanding the field beyond musical compositional creativity and performance technique into other aural arenas where the imagination holds similar power. Topics covered include auditory imagery and the neurology of sonic imagination; aural hallucination and illusion; use of metaphor in the recording studio; the projection of acoustic imagination in architectural design; and the design of sound artifacts for cinema and computer games.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uAqlDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Day At Greenhill Farm (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (DK Readers: Level 1 (Prebound))","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NXDxHIpAKm0C&dq=A+Day+At+Greenhill+Farm+(Turtleback+School&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Che Guevara y la lucha por el socialismo hoy Cuba hace frente a la crisis mundial de los a&#241;os 90 (Spanish Edition)","description":"El socialismo s lo podr  ser construido por hombres y mujeres libres que trabajen juntos para sentar los cimientos de una sociedad nueva y al mismo tiempo se transformen a s  mismos.

From 1973 to 1989 he led the Phillies to five National League championship series and two World Series. Twelve times an All-Star, Schmidt was perhaps baseball's premier power hitter during the 1970s and 1980s. His 548 home runs are seventh best all-time. In the field he was just as exceptional, winning ten Gold Gloves, more than any other third baseman besides Brooks Robinson. A three-time N.L. Most Valuable Player (1980, 1981 and 1986), Schmidt was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1995, his first year of eligibility. This book is the first serious account of Schmidt's celebrated career with the Philadelphia Phillies. Concentrating on contemporary newspaper accounts, periodicals, baseball histories and biographies by Schmidt's teammates, this long-overdue work is the full story of one of the game's greatest sluggers, and one of its true heroes and role models.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KVvi5G_rlB4C&dq=Mike+Schmidt:+Philadelphia%27s+Hall+of+Fame+Third+Baseman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","description":"\\"What am I writing?

He was born poor but thrived on ruthless ambition, devoured his competitors and outsmarted his most formidable peers to build an international empire as a publisher, politician, and industrialist. For the first time, this well-researched book from best-selling author Gordon Thomas and terrorism expert Martin Dillon tells the other, long-secret half of Maxwell's story. We are shown how Maxwell achieved his topmost objective as a superspy for Israel's Mossad; sold PROMIS America's state-of-the-art surveillance software stolen by Mossad to the USSR and many other countries; recruited foremost Republican Senator John Tower to acquire for Israel top-secret, cutting-edge U.S. technology being developed at Los Alamos; cultivated his vast KGB connections and strove to involve Israel in a coup to oust Mikhail Gorbachev; and how Maxwell ultimately became Mossad's target in an elaborately prepared assassination plot. For in November 1991, as his yacht cruised offshore of the Canary Islands, the life of Robert Maxwell ended officially, by drowning. The facts that the news media did not then report or know, what truths even the autopsies concealed, are now revealed. Eight pages of black-and-white illustrations add to this compelling work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Sm1TtAEACAAJ&dq=Robert+Maxwell,+Israel%27s+Superspy:+The+Life+and+Murder+of+a+Media+Mogul&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Residential Landscape Architecture","description":"With a focus on the process of design, this bookAs practical approach serves users with a design manual for those interested in gaining knowledge and developing skills in the design of landscapes for private residences.

Compared with German and Soviet tank forces, the performance of British tank units during Worl War II was largely ineffective and the lives of hundreds of British tank crews were wasted unnecessarily. This was not due only to the poor design and construction of British tanks, but also to the lack of thought and planning on the part of successive pre-war governments and the War Office. At the end of World War I, Britain's tank forces were more advanced than any others in the world, and ideas were being developed for the provision and use of progressively more effective tank forces. Had progress been maintained, even on a modest scale, it would have been possible for Britain to have had tank forces comparable with those of Germany in 1936. This was not to be, however, and at no time until 1945, did Britain's armoured capability meet that of the Germans.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JNz5PAAACAAJ&dq=Death+by+Design:+The+Fate+of+British+Tank+Crews+in+the+Second+World+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Generous Man: How Helping Others is the Sexiest Thing You Can Do","description":"When it comes to sex, Darwin didn't go far enough. Whereas his theory of natural selection dictates that species adapt the most efficient and logical traits (a streamlined fin, say, or a long wingspan), Generous Man makes the case that an animal's success, sexually, depends on developing the least efficient traits. N?rretranders uses as the central symbol of his theory the peacock's plumage. It's cumbersome, showy, and inefficient   and therefore terribly attractive to peahens. Put more simply, nothing shows a potential mate just how worthy you are as a partner than your ability to be wasteful and inefficient. It's like a man with money to burn. But money isn't everything: humans really measure their worth by doing something that's difficult. This is a central   though hitherto overlooked   factor in evolution. In order to win a partner to mate with, humans display their best sides. We strive for perfection, prove we are willing to help others, show consideration, and go out of our way. In other words, we are generous. This book shows how our nobler traits derive from our need for sex and are, in fact, the best way to get more of it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j8XKtAEACAAJ&dq=The+Generous+Man:+How+Helping+Others+is+the+Sexiest+Thing+You+Can+Do&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Christmas Story (Slide/Sound Library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=06LoAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Christmas+Story+(Slide/Sound+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thee, Hannah!","description":"Nine-year-old Hannah, a Quaker living in Philadelphia just before the Civil War, longs to have some fashionable dresses like other girls but comes to appreciate her heritage and its plain dressing when her family saves the life of a runaway slave.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w5sgAAAAMAAJ&dq=Thee,+Hannah!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dos mundos (Student Edition)","description":"Based on the Natural Approach, Dos mundos stresses the use of engaging activities and interesting readings in a natural and spontaneous classroom atmosphere.

In this book Elton introduced and drew together many principles still central to ecology today, including succession, niche, food webs, and the links between communities and ecosystems, each of which he illustrated with well-chosen examples. Many of Elton's ideas have proven remarkably prescient for instance, his emphasis on the role climatic changes play in population fluctuations anticipated recent research in this area stimulated by concerns about global warming. For Chicago's reprint of this classic work, ecologists Mathew A. Leibold and J. Timothy Wootton have provided new introductions to each chapter, placing Elton's ideas in historical and scientific context. They trace modern developments in each of the key themes Elton introduced, and provide references to the most current literature. The result will be an important work for ecologists interested in the roots of their discipline, for educated readers looking for a good overview of the field, and for historians of science.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=76nwAAAAMAAJ&dq=Animal+ecology,+(Text-books+of+animal+biology,+ed,+by+Julian+S.+Huxley)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Boston cooking-school cook book","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1H8EAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What's Cooking in Children's Literature (Professional Growth Series)","description":"When teachers and parents are looking for snack ideas, you can highly recommend this book and tie in children's literature.

She begins the book by sharing the philosophy of these great horse-loving people: \\"There are those who feel the sun rises and sets on the back of a horse, and no matter what obstacles life sets in their way, they never dismount.\\" The spirit and fortitude of the Lakota Indians inform Baker's words as she describes how this once-nomadic tribe came to view the horse as sacred and assigned it great significance in their culture, religion, and lifestyle. The Indians who live on the Pine Ridge Reservation have grown spiritually and as a community through their relationship with their horses, and it is through this connection to the natural world that the power of healing and ultimately, health, flows.With photography by Hope Vinitsky, The Healing Power of Horses tells the individual stories of over a dozen Lakota Indians and how horses have affected each of their lives. Baker was able to interview each of these inspiring individuals for inclusion in this book. The empowering stories told come from Wayne Waters, Marlin \\"Moon\\" Weston, Eugenio White Hawk, Wendell Yellow Bull, Aldeen Twiss, Phillip Jumping Eagle and Billy, Dale Vocu, Emma and Shelly Waters, Wilmer Mesteth, Vernell White Thunder, Pat Heathershaw, Lester Waters, and the Carlows. While the stories of each of these exceptional men and women are different, the common denominator in each is the horse's transformative power to heal their minds, spirits, and bodies. These are stories of artists, athletes, and common noble folk, all of whom have struggled to overcome life's many obstacles to thrive and become better people.The author's intention in this book, as she describes in the final section \\"The Future of the Lakota Horsepeople,\\" is to have her readers gain a better understanding of horses in Lakota culture while at the same time affording some of the Lakota people an opportunity to reconnect with their cultural identity. In reading this book, it is clear that the Lakota people have preserved the emotional power of their ancient culture and strength as a people by maintaining their connection to horses, animals that they deeply love. Fiercely loyal to the United States, the Lakota horsepeople are a strong, proud, and brave community who have much to teach all people about life and the pursuit of healing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=L9gPBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life, Sex, And the Pursuit of Happiness","description":"\\"Life: a psychiatrist/his patient.

As a result, some feel like they have to stop asking certain questions or check their brain in at the church door. A new book, I AM a Thinking Christian, addresses how to keep, and even strengthen, your faith in an increasingly rational world. The author, Kim Michaels, claims that you can use scientific discoveries to expand your understanding of Jesus inner message and thereby internalize spiritual principles. The book explains the fundamental difference between the fear-based approach to life taken by most people and the love-based approach demonstrated by Jesus. By adopting Jesus approach, you can overcome the fear of losing your faith and find real answers to your questions about the spiritual side of life. Instead of spending your life defending certain mental holy cows, you can move toward becoming a self-actualized person. The author argues that this is what Jesus wanted to see for all people, and that is why he stressed the importance of love.The author explains how some of the latest scientific discoveries have raised serious questions about the validity of scientific materialism. He outlines a new world view based on a skillful blend of scientific findings and spiritual principles. For example, Einsteins theory of relativity created a place for God in the scientific universe, and even the Big Bang theory and the theory of evolution can be reconciled with a love-based understanding of the Bible.The author uses the new world view to explain a deeper meaning behind many of the more baffling statements made by Jesus and his disciples, including Pauls call to Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus. If you are open to a fresh perspective on Christianity and its potential fate in the new millennium, this book delivers much food for thought.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6d3GAAAACAAJ&dq=I+Am+a+Thinking+Christian&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"University of Minnesota: Off the Record (College Prowler)","description":"Provides a look at University of Minnesota from the students' viewpoint.

He knew his grandfather John Sampson had been an authority on the gypsies. They had called him the Rai - the Master - and had flocked to his magnificent funeral on a Welsh mountain. But of his grandfather's private life he was told nothing, nor of the mysterious aunt who joined the family after his death. In fact only sixty years later did the truth begin to emerge. This book follows a trail of clues to uncover an extraordinary hidden life and a gypsy world now disappeared. John Sampson was a brilliant philologist who, happening to encounter a gypsy tribe in North Wales, compiled over thirty years a dictionary of the Romani language that remains the standard work. But he also became a Bohemian himself, a bigamist and the father of a child who was brought up secretly and who would in turn become a remarkable scholar. Using intimate letters, bawdy rhymes and wonderful illustrations- including many by Augustus John who was part of the circle - Anthony Sampson brings to life a group of scholars, writers and painters who escaped Victorian convention to pursue an alternative life in the Welsh hills. The Scholar Gypsy is both a detective story and a moving voyage of discovery. Ranging through finely observed contrasts and connections it illuminates many lesser-known aspects of Victorian and Edwardian Britain and vividly conveys the spell that gypsies cast on the imagination of artists and writers, and the fear that they arouse among the conventional.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FVM382bdGX4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clever Girl","description":"Clever Girl is an indelible story of one woman s life, unfolded in a series of beautifully sculpted episodes that illuminate an era, moving from the 1960s to today, from one of Britain s leading literary lights Tessa Hadley the author of the New York Times Notable Books Married Love and The London Train. Like Alice Munro and Colm T ibin, Tessa Hadley brilliantly captures the beauty, innocence, and irony of ordinary lives an ability to transform the mundane into the sublime that elevates domestic fiction to literary art. Written with the celebrated precision, intensity, and complexity that have marked her previous works, Clever Girl is a powerful exploration of family relationships and class in modern life, witnessed through the experiences of an English woman named Stella. Unfolding in a series of snapshots, Tessa Hadley s moving novel follows Stella from the shallows of childhood, growing up with a single mother in a Bristol bedsit in the 1960s, into the murky waters of middle age. Clever Girl is a story vivid in its immediacy and rich in drama violent deaths, failed affairs, broken dreams, missed chances. Yet it is Hadley s observations of everyday life, her keen skill at capturing the ways men and women think and feel and relate to one another, that dazzles.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0XXqAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Boy Who Picked the Bullets Up","description":"\\"I am determined to be gallant and butch ... and a glory to the marines.\\" So writes gay, ex-baseball player Kurt Strom--a super-handsome Southerner whose letters home from Vietnam, 1966-67, tell of the horrors of war.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=smCxAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Boy+Who+Picked+the+Bullets+Up&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death of a Dj: A Mystery","description":"An unpleasant job turns deadly when shock jock Jerry Dudek is gunned down after an interview with entertainment writer Cat Austen, but now a handsome detective with an eye for more than just the case must protect Cat from a killer who thinks she knows too much.

The dancers, whose humanity and intelligence is graciously depicted in Marilyn Futterman's brilliant black-and-white photographs, describe in their own words how they feel about themselves, their marginal profession, and the men who support it. How does such a sexual, competitive occupation affect the self-esteem of these women? What are their fears, hopes, and ambitions? Futterman, after deciding to do a photographic series on strippers, became a waitress in one of the clubs in Atlanta, Georgia. Working with and interviewing the dancers enabled her to better understand their diverse and complex lives. She witnessed first-hand the strippers' working environment, the people met there, and the relationships between the women. Men go to these clubs seeking fantasy for a dollar with no threat of intimacy. And the women achieve a kind of emotional fulfillment that is remarkably harder to find outside the doors of the club. Dancing Naked's poignant depiction of this odd social contract is important cultural history, vivid autobiography, and beautiful photography.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G3GFAAAAIAAJ&dq=Dancing+Naked+in+the+Material+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Buchanan's Gun","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T8B7tgAACAAJ&dq=Buchanan%27s+Gun&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Official Parent's Sourcebook on McCune-Albright Syndrome","description":"This 2006 handbook of neonatal endocrinology provides a wealth of practical information on the diagnosis and management of suspected endocrine pathology.

Capital Dilemma investigates the political decisions and historical events behind the redesign of Berlin's official architecture. It tells a complex and exciting drama of politics, memory, cultural values, and architecture, in which Helmut Kohl, Albert Speer, Sir Norman Foster, and I. M. Pei all figure as players. If capital city design projects are symbols of national identity and historical consciousness, Berlin is the supreme example. In fact, architecture has played a pivotal role throughout Germany's turbulent twentieth-century history. After the fall of the monarchy, Germany gave birth to the Bauhaus, whose founders argued that their own revolutionary designs could shape human destiny. The century's warring ideologies, Nazism and Communism, also used architecture for their own political ends. In its latest incarnation, Berlin will become the capital of the fifth German state in this century to be ruled from that city. How will the official architecture of reunified Berlin, a democratic capital being built amid totalitarian remains, be different this time around? Th e Federal Republic of Germany, a highly stable democracy in stark contrast to its predecessors, has been struggling with burdensome architectural legacies. In the process, it has considered remedies as varied as outright destruction, refurbishment, and, in the case of the former Nazi Central Bank now being converted into the new Foreign Ministry, physical concealment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xv5PAAAAMAAJ&dq=Capital+Dilemma::+Germany%27s+Search+for+a+New+Architecture+of+Democracy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Labor's stronghold: 120 years of Local 22, United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, in San Francisco, California, 1882-2002","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AZvxHAAACAAJ&dq=Labor%27s+stronghold:+120+years+of+Local+22,+United+Brotherhood+of+Carpenters+and+Joiners+of+America,+in+San+Francisco,+California,+1882-2002&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Super Simple Guide to Housetraining","description":"Everything you need to know to make housetraining easy and effective at any stage of your dog's life","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SipWAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Super+Simple+Guide+to+Housetraining&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reckoning with Reagan: America and Its President in the 1980s","description":"At the height of Ronald Reagan's popularity in July 1986, Time magazine wrote glowingly of how he had \\"found America's sweet spot.\\" Reagan seemed a \\"magician who carries a bright, ideal America like a holograph in his mind and projects its image in the air.\\" Not since the rhapsody about \\"Camelot\\" that surrounded John F.

Reagan pledged to bring Americans a \\"little good news\\" and during the next eight years, through recession and recovery, cold war and detente, success and scandal Reagan forged a powerful bond with the public. His popularity appeared so unrelated to actual achievements and so undiminished by failure that Colorado Representative Pat Schroeder dubbed him the \\"Teflon president.\\" Providing a brief but comprehensive and non-polemical overview of what exactly took place during the Reagan years, Michael Schaller presents a lively account of the Reagan presidency, weighing the president's great personal and political popularity against the effects of his economic, social, diplomatic, and strategic decisions. Much more than an account of Reagan the man, Schaller offers us a fascinating evaluation of the Reagan phenomenon, providing an accessible introduction for Americans struggling to understand the illusory and actual impact of the Reagan administration on the 1980s and on years to come.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7UvzZAZcDl4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prehistoric Europe;: The economic basis,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zdmAAAAAMAAJ&dq=Prehistoric+Europe%3B:+The+economic+basis,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pollyanna of the Orange Blossoms","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GaluHQAACAAJ&dq=Pollyanna+of+the+Orange+Blossoms&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Evangelism","description":"Warning against the temptation to uncritically embrace the latest evangelistic fad, this book will help churches cultivate a culture of evangelism within the context of community.

The suffix ah is a feminine singular inflection, so that allah means  goddess.

Brands tells the story of the American Revolution as it really unfolded as a civil war between colonial patriots and those loyal to the British Crown and Parliament. Division, Brands reminds us, is as American as unity.   Jon Meacham, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of His Truth Is Marching On From best-selling historian and Pulitzer Prize finalist H. W. Brands comes a gripping, page-turning narrative of the American Revolution that shows it to be more than a fight against the British: it was also a violent battle among neighbors forced to choose sides, Loyalist or Patriot. What causes people to forsake their country and take arms against it? What prompts their neighbors, hardly distinguishable in station or success, to defend that country against the rebels? That is the question H. W. Brands answers in his powerful new history of the American Revolution. George Washington and Benjamin Franklin were the unlikeliest of rebels. Washington in the 1770s stood at the apex of Virginia society. Franklin was more successful still, having risen from humble origins to world fame. John Adams might have seemed a more obvious candidate for rebellion, being of cantankerous temperament. Even so, he revered the law. Yet all three men became rebels against the British Empire that fostered their success. Others in the same circle of family and friends chose differently. William Franklin might have been expected to join his father, Benjamin, in rebellion but remained loyal to the British. So did Thomas Hutchinson, a royal governor and friend of the Franklins, and Joseph Galloway, an early challenger to the Crown. They soon heard themselves denounced as traitors--for not having betrayed the country where they grew up. Native Americans and the enslaved were also forced to choose sides as civil war broke out around them. After the Revolution, the Patriots were cast as heroes and founding fathers while the Loyalists were relegated to bit parts best forgotten. Our First Civil War reminds us that before America could win its revolution against Britain, the Patriots had to win a bitter civil war against family, neighbors, and friends.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HKUbEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ARTIST AT WORK","description":"The main affirmation of artistic practice must today happen through thinking about the conditions and the status of the artist's work.

Istria is the heart-shaped promontory at the northern crux of the Adriatic Sea, where rows of vines and olives grow in fields of red earth. Here, the cuisine records a history of changing borders - a blend of the countries (Italy, the Republic of Venice, Austria, and Hungary) that have shared Istria's hills and coasts and valleys. This book is a record of traditions, of these cultures and of Paola's family: recipes from her childhood, the region's past, and her family and friends who still live beside the Adriatic coast. Among recipes for semolina dumplings, beef and pork goulash, and apricot strudel are memories of the region and the stories of the recipes' authors: the Italian-Istrians who remained in the region after the 1940s, and those who left for new countries. Istria is full of recipes inspired by home kitchens and memories of what grew in the owner's gardens: hearty grain soups and seafood, crepes piled high, and biscuits flavored with cinnamon. Istrian cuisine is a rich blend of Venice and Vienna, Hungary, and the Balkans - food doesn't have borders, and certainly not in this book's recipes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SGlBEAAAQBAJ&dq=Istria&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vallabhacarya on the Love Games of Krsna (Unesco Collection of Representative Works: Indian Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-i4qAAAAYAAJ&dq=Vallabhacarya+on+the+Love+Games+of+Krsna+(Unesco+Collection+of+Representative+Works:+Indian+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roman Women (Cambridge Introduction to Roman Civilization)","description":"This book examines the daily lives of Roman women by focusing on the mundane and less celebrated aspects of daily life - family and household, work and leisure, worship and social obligations - of women of different social ranks.

What is it that makes Nietzsche Nietzsche? In The Shortest Shadow, Alenka Zupan?i? counters the currently fashionable appropriation of Nietzsche as a philosopher who was \\"ahead of his time\\" but whose time has finally come the rather patronizing reduction of his often extraordinary statements to mere opinions that we can \\"share.\\" Zupan?i? argues that the definitive Nietzschean quality is his very unfashionableness, his being out of the mainstream of his or any time. To restore Nietzsche to a context in which the thought \\"lives on its own credit,\\" Zupan?i? examines two aspects of his philosophy. First, in \\"Nietzsche as Metapsychologist,\\" she revisits the principal Nietzschean themes his declaration of the death of God (which had a twofold meaning, \\"God is dead\\" and \\"Christianity survived the death of God\\"), the ascetic ideal, and nihilism as ideas that are very much present in our hedonist postmodern condition. Then, in the second part of the book, she considers Nietzsche's figure of the Noon and its consequences for his notion of the truth. Nietzsche describes the Noon not as the moment when all shadows disappear but as the moment of \\"the shortest shadow\\" not the unity of all things embraced by the sun, but the moment of splitting, when \\"one turns into two.\\" Zupan?i? argues that this notion of the Two as the minimal and irreducible difference within the same animates all of Nietzsche's work, generating its permanent and inherent tension.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lL9NEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Shortest+Shadow:+Nietzsche%27s+Philosophy+of+the+Two+(Short+Circuits)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Here Comes the Guide: Northern California: Wedding Locations and Services","description":"This location bible is the last word in finding the ideal place for weddings, business functions, and other special events.

Drawing on the work of John Dewey, Lekan asserts that moral norms are neither timeless truths nor subjective whims, but habits transmitted through practices. Like the habits that make up medicine or engineering, moral habits are subject to rational evaluation and change according to new challenges and circumstances. This pragmatic interpretation of morality provides a way out of the conundrum of relativism and absolutism. Building on classical American philosophy to address current philosophical concerns, Lekan's theory revises our basic understanding of moral life and the place of theorizing within that life. Making Morality will prove of great interest to ethical theorists, as it enjoins them to measure theoretical inquiries by how well they produce intellectual tools for problem-solving in dynamic, complex communities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q4df7T3_KbwC&dq=Making+Morality:+Pragmatist+Reconstruction+in+Ethical+Theory+(The+Vanderbilt+Library+of+American+Philosophy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thermal shutters and shades: Over 100 schemes for reducing heat-loss through windows","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EAG8AAAAIAAJ&dq=Thermal+shutters+and+shades:+Over+100+schemes+for+reducing+heat-loss+through+windows&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alexander the Great and the Mystery of the Elephant Medallions (Hellenistic Culture and Society)","description":"A rare set of coin medallions is used to analyze Alexander the Great's reputation for invinceability in war.

Critics from the left blame lax regulation for the housing meltdown and financial crisis not to mention major public health disasters ranging from the Gulf Coast oil spill to the Upper Big Branch Mine explosion. At the same time, critics on the right disparage an excessively strict and costly regulatory system for hampering economic recovery. With such polarized accounts of regulation and its performance, the nation needs now more than ever the kind of dispassionate, rigorous scholarship found in this book. With chapters written by some of the nation's foremost economists, political scientists, and legal scholars, Regulatory Breakdown brings clarity to the heated debate over regulation by dissecting the disparate causes of the current crisis as well as analyzing promising solutions to what ails the U.S. regulatory system. This volume shows policymakers, researchers, and the public why they need to question conventional wisdom about regulation whether from the left or the right and demonstrates the value of undertaking systematic analysis before adopting policy reforms in the wake of disaster.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VH6u3fgTZUEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Star Paws (Puppy Patrol #5)","description":"Thrilled that their favorite TV show will be filming at a local castle, Neil and Emily look forward to meeting cocker spaniel Prince, the star, but the problems begin when Prince misbehaves in front of the camera.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NBiU_LfJFF4C&dq=Star+Paws+(Puppy+Patrol&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cardinal and the Queen","description":"The young Queen Anne is at the mercy of her husband's hatred, the caprice of her domineering mother-in-law and the unholy passion of Cardinal Richelieu.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VlfmngEACAAJ&dq=The+Cardinal+and+the+Queen&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Witnesses of Jehovah","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6by-0moRVgwC&dq=Witnesses+of+Jehovah&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Notes from the Underground: The Most Outrageous Stories from the Alternative Press","description":"Tired of the same boring news stories? look no further than this compilation of the best, most original stories covered by alternative newspapers throughout America's metropolitan cities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S-33AQAACAAJ&dq=Notes+from+the+Underground:+The+Most+Outrageous+Stories+from+the+Alternative+Press&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strictly personal;: The adventure of discovering what God is really like","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LDpxAQAACAAJ&dq=Strictly+personal%3B:+The+adventure+of+discovering+what+God+is+really+like&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Raising poultry the modern way","description":"Covers stock selection, feeding, brooding, rearing, disease prevention, butchering.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ShsKAAAACAAJ&dq=Raising+poultry+the+modern+way&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unearthed Arcana (Dungeons & Dragons d20 3.5 Fantasy Roleplaying)","description":"Includes spells, character classes, magic weapons, and other items used in playing Dungeons and Dragons.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=urrZAAAACAAJ&dq=Unearthed+Arcana+(Dungeons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"After The Wall","description":"Social sciences.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Tez8PAAACAAJ&dq=After+The+Wall&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fool's gold: Chronicles of a country doctor : the story of Dr. Delmar Mock","description":"This is an account of a young doctor and his life companion as they rely on God's choosing the location for their professional labors in His great universe.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gR8cQgAACAAJ&dq=Fool%27s+gold:+Chronicles+of+a+country+doctor+:+the+story+of+Dr.+Delmar+Mock&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Short History of Scene Design in Great Britain (Drama & Theatre Studies)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4vqGAAAAIAAJ&dq=Short+History+of+Scene+Design+in+Great+Britain+(Drama&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Promotion and Integrated Marketing Communication with InfoTrac College Edition","description":"A comprehensive marketing text organized around the marketing mix and filled with student-oriented, current examples of the latest marketing topics, concepts and technologies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HlhaAAAAYAAJ&dq=Promotion+and+Integrated+Marketing+Communication+with+InfoTrac+College+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Success through the Magic of Personal Power","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=440kGQAACAAJ&dq=Success+through+the+Magic+of+Personal+Power&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teacher in America","description":"To find more information on Rowman & Littlefield titles, please visit us at www.rowmanlittlefield.com.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jv98PwAACAAJ&dq=Teacher+in+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Relational Communication: Continuity and Change in Personal Relationships (Wadsworth Series in Speech Communication)","description":"Focusing on personal, intimate relationships, this text offers a sophisticated integration of current theory and research, that is interdisciplinary in scope, to help students see how important theories about communication and relationships pertain to everyday experiences.

Learners come with life experience, pop beliefs, and smatterings of pseudoscientific information including many myths and misconceptions. For development in thinking to occur, questioning about preexisting knowledge must take place. It is the illusion of certain knowledge that may impede learning. How to gently create doubt about misinformation and open up learners or seekers to empirically based information? A frontal assaut on learners' current beliefs may not be the best approach. It may only further convince the believers in psychics, horoscope, alternate healers, and unbounded self improvement that empirical psychology holds nothing for them. It may have the same discouraging effect on those who are struggling in other ways with the inevitable problems that human beings have. In the war between the forces of organized irrationality and the methods of science, this book holds a unique place. Through a series of ten interconnected narratives or 'fables', it explores the cognitive processes that make us vulnerable to irrationality and provides a world view based on psychological science. The topics of the fables parallel the organization of standard introductory psychology texts. For example, the first five fables deal with critical thinking, sensation and perception, consciousness, learning, and memory. The fables illustrate how illusory correlation, confirmation bias, hindsight bias, mental sets, selective attention and memory as well as other social cognitive processes lead to the adoption and maintenance of common misconceptions. The fables promote comprehension and application of basic psychological principles. Use of these particular fables in learning and teaching has been shown to reduce beliefs in the paranormal. The fables and accompanying discussion and assignment guides provide an actice, engaging, and memorable way to learn.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zIGlyszvOPYC&dq=Fables+for+Developing+Skeptical+and+Critical+Thinking+in+Psychology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blood in the Ashes","description":"After the nuclear devastation of World War III, Ben Raines and a small group of survivors search for a haven free of radiation, but an insidious group known as the Ninth Order is plotting their demise.

Although the basic outlines of the story are already known, Anne Cahn succeeded in getting many previously declassified documents released and uses these, supplemented by seventy interviews with principal players, to add much greater depth and detail to our understanding of this troubling event in U. S. history. In the mid-1970s a very controversial intelligence estimate was performed by people outside the government. They were given access to our most secret files and leaked their report to the press when Jimmy Carter was elected president. This study, which became known as &\\"The Team B Report,&\\" became the intellectual forbearer of the &\\"window of vulnerability&\\" and led to the demise of detente between the Soviet Union and the United States. Team B was the fundamental turning point in renewing the Cold War in the 1980s. The debate over the leaked report moved the center of arms control policy strongly to the right from where it had been during the years of detente. Team B presaged the triumph of Ronald Reagan and a military buildup on a scale unprecedented in peacetime that left present and future generations with the most crippling debt in our nation& s history. This book is about attempts to destroy improved relations between the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1970s. Those opposed to the easing of tensions between the two countries used every means available, including accusing the Central Intelligence Agency of understating the threat posed by the Soviets. Charging the CIA this way seems preposterous now.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6uraAjrJ0QcC&dq=Killing+Detente+:+The+Right+Attacks+the+CIA&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dead Easy (Mack Bolan)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Pj4pwAEACAAJ&dq=Dead+Easy+(Mack+Bolan)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lonely Planet Best of Paris (Lonely Planet Encounter Series)","description":"Lonely Planet s Paris is your passport to the most relevant, up-to-date advice on what to see and skip, and what hidden discoveries await you.

Their palette of materials includes wood, stone, glass and metals and these elements are carefully woven into the projects in finished and raw states. This gives the work both a natural and an abstract quality. Their work has an intellectual rigour stemming from the history of ideas and the arts, while maintaining a precise formal vocabulary that has allowed them to craft buildings that work equally well in rural and urban settings. The four states of architecture described in this book- horizon, light, atmospheres and ground - are derived from contemporary interpretations of matter, light and the natural world. This book features 14 of Hanrahan + Meyers' projects, each of which is aligned with one of these states. The projects range in scale from individual residences to galleries, museums, and buildings for the performing arts. The context of ideas in which they are set crosses the boundaries that typically divide architecture, art, science and experience. The projects represented - three performance spaces, three galleries, two museums, one urban design project and five residences - include: * Holley Loft, New York * Interpretive Center, Elise Chapin Wildlife Sanctuary, Chattanooga, Tennessee * Museum of Women, Battery Park City, New York * Ojai Festival Shell, Libbey Park, Ojai, California Forewords by Billie Tsien, architect, and Terence Riley, Chief Curator of Architecture and Design at the Museum of Modern Art, New York","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_OFPAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Four+States+of+Architecture+(Architectural+Monographs+(Paper))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"University of Mississippi: Off the Record (College Prowler) (College Prowler: University of Mississippi Off the Record)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bTN4IVwNujEC&dq=University+of+Mississippi:+Off+the+Record+(College+Prowler)+(College+Prowler:+University+of+Mississippi+Off+the+Record)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gift from the Sea","description":"A woman's reflections on life, its stages, and its states, comparing them with the natural treasures of life in the sea","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l8q6m9Xgek0C&dq=Gift+from+the+Sea&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wives of Henry VIII","description":"A  brilliantly written and meticulously researched  biography of royal family life during England s second Tudor monarch (San Francisco Chronicle). Either annulled, executed, died in childbirth, or widowed, these were the well-known fates of the six queens during the tempestuous, bloody, and splendid reign of Henry VIII of England from 1509 to 1547. But in this  exquisite treatment, sure to become a classic  (Booklist), they take on more fully realized flesh and blood than ever before. Katherine of Aragon emerges as a staunch though misguided woman of principle; Anne Boleyn, an ambitious adventuress with a penchant for vengeance; Jane Seymour, a strong-minded matriarch in the making; Anne of Cleves, a good-natured woman who jumped at the chance of independence; Katherine Howard, an empty-headed wanton; and Katherine Parr, a warm-blooded bluestocking who survived King Henry to marry a fourth time.  Combin[ing] the accessibility of a popular history with the highest standards of a scholarly thesis , Alison Weir draws on the entire labyrinth of Tudor history, employing every known archive early biographies, letters, memoirs, account books, and diplomatic reports to bring vividly to life the fates of the six queens, the machinations of the monarch they married and the myriad and ceaselessly plotting courtiers in their intimate circle (The Detroit News).

Thompson's literary formation, achievement, and continuing relevance. Savage Journey is a \\"supremely crafted\\" study of Hunter S. Thompson's literary formation and achievement. Focusing on Thompson's influences, development, and unique model of authorship, Savage Journey argues that his literary formation was largely a San Francisco story. During the 1960s, Thompson rode with the Hell's Angels, explored the San Francisco counterculture, and met talented editors who shared his dissatisfaction with mainstream journalism. Author Peter Richardson traces Thompson's transition during this time from New Journalist to cofounder of Gonzo journalism. He also endorses Thompson's later claim that he was one of the best writers using the English language as both a musical instrument and a political weapon. Although Thompson's political commentary was often hyperbolic, Richardson shows that much of it was also prophetic. Fifty years after the publication of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and more than a decade after his death, Thompson's celebrity continues to obscure his literary achievement. This book refocuses our understanding of that achievement by mapping Thompson's influences, probing the development of his signature style, and tracing the reception of his major works. It concludes that Thompson was not only a gifted journalist, satirist, and media critic, but also the most distinctive American voice in the second half of the twentieth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hplEEAAAQBAJ&dq=SAVAGE+JOURNEY&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grim Riders","description":"Five years of hell.

Most people fight shy of giving up their cars, or their toxic household products, their cheap washing machines, or dodgy, unethical bank accounts in order to make the world a better place.

The result is a work that moves the history of antebellum reform to a higher level of sophistication. Hirrel focuses upon New School Congregationalists and Presbyterians who served at the forefront of reform efforts and provided critical leadership to anti-Catholic, temperance, antislavery, and missionary movements. Their religion was an attempt to reconcile traditional Calvinist language with the prevalent intellectual trends of the time. New School theologians preserved Calvinist language about depravity, but they incorporated an assertion of nominal human ability to overcome sin and a belief in the fixed, immutable nature of truth.

Beginning with his debut play, The Zoo Story (1958), and on to his barrier breaking works of the 1960s, most notably The American Dream (1960), Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1963), and the Pulitzer Prize-winning A Delicate Balance (1966), Albee's provocative, unsparing indictment of the American way of life earned him early distinction as the dramatist of his generation. His acclaim was enhanced even further in the decades that followed with prize-winning dramas such as Seascape and Three Tall Women, as well as recent works like The Play About the Baby and Who is Sylvia? Albee has brought the same critical force to his non-theatrical prose. Stretching My Mind collects for the first time ever the author's writings on theater, literature, and the political and cultural battlegrounds that have defined his career. Many of the selections were drawn from Albee's private papers, and almost all previously published material dating from 1960 to the present has never been reprinted. Topics include Samuel Beckett, Eugene Ionesco, Sam Shepherd, as well as autobiographical writings about Albee's life, work, and worldview.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BhllG-TPJSQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The cassique of Kiawah: A Colonial romance","description":"First drafted as a novel called Oyster Point when the author was only eighteen, The Cassique of Kiawah was finally published thirty-five years later, in 1859, at the height of William Gilmore Simms's career. It is a history through fiction of early Charleston, South Carolina, and completed Simms's series of Revolutionary War novels. Through satire and realism he portrays the charm and the corruption of late seventeenth-century Charleston society, and he contrasts the quiet majesty of the wilderness with the violence of man. The book was widely reviewed and highly praised, and it confirmed Simms's position as the nation's best-known novelist.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vE9bAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+cassique+of+Kiawah:+A+Colonial+romance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tales from the Arabian Nights","description":"Great Stories in Easy English.

And yet, place also limits the questions art historians can ask and impairs analysis of objects and locations in the interstices of established, ossified categories. The chapters in this interdisciplinary volume investigate place in all of its dynamism and complexity: several call into question traditional constructions regarding place in Art History, while others explore the fundamental role that place plays in lived experience. The particular nexus for this collection lies at the intersection and overlap of two major subfields in the history of art: South Asia and the Islamic world, both of which are seemingly geographically determined, yet at the same time uncategorizable as place with their ever-shifting and contested borders. The eleven chapters brought together here move from the early modern through to the contemporary, and span particular monuments and locations ranging from Asia and Europe to Africa and the Americas. The chapters take on the question of place as it operates in more obvious settings, such as architectural monuments and exhibitionary contexts, while also probing the way place operates when objects move or when the very place they exist in transforms dramatically. This volume engages place through the movement of objects, the evocation of senses, desires, and memories and the on-going project of articulating the parameters of place and location.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pDglDwAAQBAJ&dq=A+village+art+of+South+India+(Publication+/+Madurai+Kamaraj+University)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What is a brother?

M. Jeanne Peterson rejects such formulations and the received wisdom they embody in favor of a careful examination of Victorian ladies and their lives. Focusing on a network of urban professional families over three generations, this book examines the scope and quality of gentlewomen's education, their physical lives, their relationship to money, their experience of family illness and death, and their relationships to men (brothers and friends as well as fathers and husbands). Peterson also examines the prominent place of work in the lives of these \\"leisured\\" Victorian ladies, both single and married. Far from idle, the mothers, wives, and daughters of Victorian clergymen, doctors, lawyers, university dons, and others were accomplished and productive members of society who made substantial public and private contributions to virtually every sphere of Victorian life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XBiZXuV9OqUC&dq=Family,+Love,+and+Work+in+the+Lives+of+Victorian+Gentlewomen&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"So You Want to Build a Little Log Cabin in the Woods?: A How to ... and How Not to Book","description":"There is no available information at this time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IywRcnLd3oUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Oracle","description":"The author of the New York Times bestsellers The Harbinger, The Mystery of the Shemitah, The Book of Mysteries, and The Paradigm, now opens up the jubilean prophecies and a mystery so big that it has determined everything from the rise and fall of world empires to two world wars, the current events of our day, the future, end-time prophecy, and much more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N7yxDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Oracle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Back to basic selling: Unique sales tips for sure-fire success","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Rs4kAQAAMAAJ&dq=Back+to+basic+selling:+Unique+sales+tips+for+sure-fire+success&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spanish correspondence,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZEsTAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Designer Style Jewelry: Techniques and Projects for Elegant Designs from Classic to Retro","description":"Explains how to make elegant and quality designer-style jewelry with a variety of easy-to-use jewelry-making and crafts supplies--wire, beads, polymer clay, leather, resin, laminate, and shrink plastic--with detailed instructions for a variety of innovative projects for earrings, necklaces, Pendants, pins, rings, and bracelets.

Lee","description":"Despite the literary outpouring on the life of Robert E. Lee, the southern chieftain remains an enigma. The existing scholarship is so voluminous, complex, and contradictory that it is difficult to penetrate the inner Lee and appreciate him as a general. Peter S. Carmichael has assembled a formidable array of Civil War historians who rigorously return to Lee's own words and actions in interpreting the war in Virginia. This is the first collective volume to scrutinize specific aspects of the general's military career. Carmichael's opening contribution confronts Lee's supposed drive for a victory of annihilation and takes issue with claims that he was too aggressive. William J. Miller's novel analysis of Lee's leadership during the pivotal Seven Days battles reconstructs his strategic thinking and corrects old assumptions. Gordon C. Rhea overturns the common notion that Lee anticipated his adversaries with uncanny precision in the Overland campaign of 1864. Robert E. L. Krick takes aim at the oft-repeated criticism that Lee was not attuned to the demands of modern warfare because he failed to surround himself with enough subordinates to ensure the smooth operation of the army; in fact, Krick argues, Lee continually fine-tuned the performance of his support staff, striving to eliminate deficiencies. Finally, Max R. Williams's examination of the relationship between Lee and North Carolina governor Zebulon B. Vance, and Mark L. Bradley's portrait of Lee's relationships with Jefferson Davis and Joseph E. Johnston, offer contrasting views of the soldier as both politically assertive and reticent, respectively. Falling easily into neither the pro- nor anti-Lee camp, Audacity Personified challenges long-standing beliefs accepted since Douglas Southhall Freeman's influential biography of Lee was published seventy years ago.

It emphasizes  special introduction  the study of individual books ? It interacts in an irenic spirit with the historical-critical method ? It features points of research history and representative scholars rather than an exhaustive treatment of past scholarship ? It deals with the meaning of each book, not in isolation but in a canonical context ? It probes the meaning of each book in the setting of its culture Including callouts, charts, and graphs, this text is written with an eye on understanding the nature of Old Testament historiography.

Now, generations later, while Captain Jean-Luc Picard is conducting delicate diplomatic negotiations with the Tarn, the Enterprise discovers the descendants of Murat and his crew marooned on a desolate planet, still fighting a war that ended decades ago. The human castaways face destruction as the forgotten war builds to its catastrophic conclusion, but more is at stake than these precious lives alone. Planetside, and cut off from communication with the Enterprise, Commander Riker becomes entangled with the Federation refugees and their desperate struggle, and any action he takes could break the present ceasefire. Tarn observers face the same dilemma - but some feel the Tarn would welcome a renewal of hostilities. Unless Picard can find a solution, a lost hero's legacy may ignite a new era of interstellar war!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S7VRAj5FLd4C&dq=The+Forgotten+War+(Star+Trek:+The+Next+Generation)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The house of the dead","description":" Here was the house of the living dead, a life like none other upon earth  In January 1850 Dostoyevsky was sent to a remote Siberian prison camp for his part in a political conspiracy. The four years he spent there, startlingly re-created in The House of the Dead, were the most agonizing of his life. In this fictionalized account he recounts his soul-destroying incarceration through the cool, detached tones of his narrator, Aleksandr Petrovich Goryanchikov: the daily battle for survival, the wooden plank beds, the cabbage soup swimming with cockroaches, his strange  family  of boastful, ugly, cruel convicts. Yet The House of the Dead is far more than a work of documentary realism: it is also a powerful novel of redemption, describing one man s spiritual and moral death and the miracle of his gradual reawakening. This edition includes notes and an introduction discussing the circumstances of Dostoyevsky s imprisonment, the origins of the novel in his prison writings, and the character of Aleksandr Petrovich.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=40TkX46PUZUC&dq=The+house+of+the+dead&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Developing Rich Clients with Macromedia Flex","description":"Web applications have extended the reach of enterprises to customers, offering anywhere and anytime access, but at the expense of the overall user experience, which is diminished by delivery through the Web browser.

Indeed, it is highly desirable that an undergraduate course in chemistry incorporates a separate module on the history of chemistry. This book is therefore aimed at teachers and students of chemistry, and it will also appeal to practising chemists. While the last 25 years has seen the appearance of a large number of specialist scholarly publications on the history of chemistry, there has been little written in the way of an introductory overview of the subject. This book fills that gap. It incorporates some of the results of recent research, and the text is illustrated throughout. Clearly, a book of this length has to be highly selective in its coverage, but it describes the themes and personalities which in the author's opinion have been of greatest importance in the development of the subject. The famous American historian of science, Henry Guerlac, wrote: 'It is the central business of the historian of science to reconstruct the story of the acquisition of this knowledge and the refinement of its method or methods, and-perhaps above all-to study science as a human activity and learn how it arose, how it developed and expanded, and how it has influenced or been influenced by man's material, intellectual, and even spiritual aspirations' (Guerlac, 1977). This book attempts to describe the development of chemistry in these terms.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=un3ZBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rhetoric in Postmodern America: Conversations with Michael Calvin McGee","description":"The first book-length presentation of the influential work of Michael Calvin McGee, this volume demonstrates the importance of rhetoric to understanding power and culture in the postmodern age.

An introduction by John Louis Lucaites discusses McGee's pathbreaking role within the wider field of rhetoric, and a concluding essay on Spike Lee enacts the \\"performative criticism\\" McGee theorizes in previous chapters to construct a powerful argument about race in contemporary America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o97MwAEACAAJ&dq=Rhetoric+in+Postmodern+America:+Conversations+with+Michael+Calvin+McGee&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deputy United States Marshal (Career Examination Series : C-1620)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7cMwAQAAIAAJ&dq=Deputy+United+States+Marshal+(Career+Examination+Series+:+C-1620)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Faithful Gardener","description":"Clarissa Pinkola Est s, Ph.D., the internationally known poet, psychoanalyst, and author of the seminal classic Women Who Run With The Wolves (99 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, translated into eighteen languages, and a bestseller worldwide), touches our lives anew, rendering in the strong and lyrical voice for which she has become known a powerful series of her signature healing stories. These elegantly interlocked tales of loss, survival, and fierce rebirth center around Dr. Estes's uncle, a war-ravaged Hungarian peasant farmer and refugee, a faithful gardener, and a storehouse of stories who was one of the \\"dancing fools, wise old crows, grumpy sages, and 'almost saints' who made up the old people\\" in Est s's childhood. Told with graceful simplicity, deep feeling, generous humor, and profound optimism, The Faithful Gardener is, at its captivating core, the story of an open-hearted child who listened well to her old-country elders and who grew up to remember, to bear witness, and, as one of the premier storytellers of our times, to remind readers and listeners of all ages of \\"that magisterial life force within all things that strengthens us in times of turmoil or transition, that faithful force which can never die.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CSjLl5V64TYC&dq=The+Faithful+Gardener&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fat Dictator Diet Featuring G.L.A.","description":"Technology and increasing levels of education have exposed people to more information than ever before. These societal gains, however, have also helped fuel a surge in narcissistic and misguided intellectual egalitarianism that has crippled informed debates on any number of issues. Today, everyone knows everything: with only a quick trip through WebMD or Wikipedia, average citizens believe themselves to be on an equal intellectual footing with doctors and diplomats. All voices, even the most ridiculous, demand to be taken with equal seriousness, and any claim to the contrary is dismissed as undemocratic elitism. Tom Nichols' The Death of Expertise shows how this rejection of experts has occurred: the openness of the internet, the emergence of a customer satisfaction model in higher education, and the transformation of the news industry into a 24-hour entertainment machine, among other reasons. Paradoxically, the increasingly democratic dissemination of information, rather than producing an educated public, has instead created an army of ill-informed and angry citizens who denounce intellectual achievement. When ordinary citizens believe that no one knows more than anyone else, democratic institutions themselves are in danger of falling either to populism or to technocracy or, in the worst case, a combination of both. An update to the 2017breakout hit, the paperback edition of The Death of Expertise provides a new foreword to cover the alarming exacerbation of these trends in the aftermath of Donald Trump's election. Judging from events on the ground since it first published, The Death of Expertise issues a warning about the stability and survival of modern democracy in the Information Age that is even more important today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ttf_DQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ethical and Religious Thought in Analytic Philosophy of Language","description":"This is a critical history of analytic philosophy from its inception in the late-19th century to the present day.

The deliberately audacious mix of contributors spans different generations, races, ethnicities, and sexual preferences: CEOs, housewives, rock stars, farmers, scientists, prostituted women, politicians, women in prison, firefighters, disability activists, artists, flight attendants, an army general, an astronaut, an anchorwoman, even a pair of teens who edit a girls' magazine. Each article celebrates the writer's personal voice -- her humor, passion, anger, and the integrity of her perspective -- while offering the latest data on women's status, political analysis, new \\"how-to\\" tools for activism, and visionary yet practical strategies for the future -- strategies needed now more than ever. Robin Morgan's own contributions are everything her readers expect: prophetic, powerfully argued, unsentimentally lyrical. From her introduction: \\"The book you hold in your hands is a tool for the future -- a future also in your hands.\\" ? Edna Acosta-Bel n ? Carol J. Adams ? Margot Adler ? Natalie Angier ?

It recounts the stories of Dhoruba Bin Wahad, Mumia Abu-Jamal and Assata Shakur, all of whom were arrested and jailed during the COINTELPRO probe of the Black Panther Party. Dhoruba Bin Wahad, who organized chapters of the Black Panther Party in New York and along the Estern Seaboard and worked with tenants in Harlem and on drug rehabilitation in the Bronx, was accused of murdering two officers while still in his teens and imprisoned for 19 years. He always maintained his innocence and won his freedom by forcing the FBI to release thousands of classified documents proving that he had been framed. The justice department eventually rescinded Bin Wahad s conviction and he was released in 1990, seven months after the documentary premiered. Mumia Abu-Jamal, a journalist who headed the Black Panther free breakfast program for inner-city school children in Philadelphia, was also accused of the murder of an officer and sent on death-row, where he still is today. Assata Shakur was a college educated social worker in her twenties when she was accused of shooting a cop, then arrested and tortured and denied medical treatment. Her interview was conducted in Cuba where she has been exiled since her escape from a New Jersey women's prison in 1975. Bin Wahad, Shakur and Abu-Jamal offer a little-known history and an incisive analysis of the Black Panthers' original goals, which the U.S. Government has tried to distort and suppress. As one confidential, 1969, memo to J. Edgar Hoover put it, \\"The Negro youth and moderates must be made to understand that if they succumb to revolutionary teaching, they will be dead revolutionaries.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vdF1AAAAMAAJ&dq=Still+Black,+Still+Strong&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PUTNAM AND PENNYROYAL","description":"Uncle Frank always takes Cora Lee fishing and tells her great stories about two birds, old Putnam and spunky Pennyroyal.

GORDON'S last work was the publishing of his \\"Reminiscences of the Civil War.\\" This volume, written in his vigorous style and broad, patriotic spirit, has been most favorably received and read all over the country. Since his death this memorial edition is brought out; and it is appropriate that an additional introduction should accompany it, somewhat in the shape of a biographical sketch. General John Brown Gordon was an all-round great man--a valiant and distinguished soldier, an eminent statesman, a great orator, an author of merit, and a public-spirited and useful citizen. He was born in Upson County, Georgia, February 6, 1832. His father was the Rev. Zachary Herndon Gordon. The family was of Scotch extraction, and its members fought in the Revolutionary War. He received his education at the university of his native State, and by profession was a lawyer. At the breaking out of the war, in 1861, he enlisted as a private soldier, and was elected captain of his company. His career was perhaps as brilliant as that of any officer in the Confederate army. In rapid succession he filled every grade--that of Major, Lieutenant-Colonel, Colonel, Brigadier-General, Major-General, and, near the end, was assigned to duty as Lieutenant-General (by authority of the Secretary of War), and while he never received the commission in regular form, he commanded, at the surrender at Appomattox, one half of the Army of Northern Virginia, under Robert E. Lee. At the close of the war he had earned the reputation of being perhaps the most conspicuous and personally valiant officer surviving, and the one generally regarded as most promising and competent for increased rank and larger command. His imposing and magnificent soldierly bearing, coupled with his splendid ringing voice and far-reaching oratory, made him the \\"White-plumed Knight of our Southland\\" and the \\"Chevalier Bayard of the Confederate Army.\\" He had the God-given talent of getting in front of his troops and, in a few magnetic appeals, inspiring them almost to madness, and being able to lead them into the jaws of death. This was notably done at Fredericksburg, and again on the 12th of May, at the battle of Spottsylvania Court House. He greatly distinguished himself on many bloody fields. I mention now, as most prominent, the battles of Seven Pines, Sharpsburg or Antietam, the Wilderness, Spottsylvania Court House, Cedar Creek, Petersburg, and Appomattox. At Sharpsburg he was wounded five times, but would not leave his troops till the last shot laid him helpless and insensible on the field. A scholarly professor of history in one of our Southern universities recently stated that in his study of the great war on both sides he had found but one prominent general who, when he was in command, or when he led a charge, had never been defeated or repulsed, and that general was John B. Gordon.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=scoPcxkx9EoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Why the whales came","description":"This is an exciting adventure and friendship story by a much-loved, award winning author.

Who is to judge and by what standards? In this new edition of Herbert Gans's brilliantly conceived and clearly argued landmark work, he builds on his critique of the universality of high cultural standards. While conceding that popular and high culture have converged to some extent over the twenty-five years since he wrote the book, Gans holds that the choices of typical Ivy League graduates, not to mention Ph.D.'s in literature, are still very different from those of high school graduates, as are the movie houses, television channels, museums, and other cultural institutions they frequent. This new edition benefits greatly from Gans's discussion of the ''politicization'' of culture over the last quarter-century. Popular Culture and High Culture is a must read for anyone interested in the vicissitudes of taste in American society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SnjZVeLq4j8C&dq=Popular+Culture+and+High+Culture:+An+Analysis+and+Evaluation+of+Taste&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Chestry oak","description":"As he watches his homeland of Hungary being taken over and run by invaders from Nazi Germany, young Prince Michael of Chestry strives to retain his identity and integrity during one of the most dangerous seasons in human history. Michael carries an acorn all the way from his castle home in Chestry Valley to the warm soil of the Hudson Valley farm in the USA where he makes a new home after WWII. It is difficult to decide which are the most unforgettable; the scenes in Hungary, Michael's proud, valiant father and his beloved Nana, or the friendly young GI and his family who take Michael to their hearts and make him their own. Perhaps the most compelling character of all is Midnight, the dancing black stallion, full of fire and beauty, and trained to perform before princes. Kate Seredy's drawings make this a book to treasure. A masterpiece of childhood literature. -Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II The prose is perfect: vivid and often poetic. -National Review ...a modern fairy tale of Hungary. -Kirkus Reviews Kate Seredy's fine illustrations help to link Hungary and America in this story of young Prince Michael whose changing fortunes brought him at last to the warmth of an American home. -Horn Book Occasionally something precious is lost for a while only to be rediscovered and become appreciated all over again. Perhaps never is this more true than with the story Chestry Oak. Originally published in 1948, it is a beautifully told story of a boy who begins with a happy childhood, overcomes peril, and finishes strong. Chestry Oak is a book with all-too-rare and wonderful values that has been cherished by readers for generations.

The horrific brutality which both women and children undergo evokes a response of unparalleled intensity in the playwright whom Aristotle called the most tragic of the poets. Yet the new battleground of the aftermath of war is one in which the women of Troy evince an overwhelming greatness of spirit. We weep for the aged Hecuba in her name play and in The Trojan Women, yet we respond with an at times appalled admiration to her resilience amid unrelieved suffering. Andromache, the slave-concubine of her husband's killer, endures her existence in the victor's country with a Stoic nobility.

It presents in graphic detail and on a vast canvas the great events and the small which reached a decisive crescendo in Custer s fate. Here is no savage battle incident presented in isolation from other events, but a sweeping panorama of a whole ere-inept, hesitant, and tragic. To insure comprehensiveness, the author describes the pertinent facts of the Grant administration, the embitterment of the Great Plains tribes, and the deteriorating Civil War army. The book is the record not only of the dashing Seventh Cavalry and its leader but also of the Grant-Custer feud, Sitting Bull, the Belknap scandal, Rain-in-the-Face, the battle strategy of the Indians, and Custer s military rivals. Particular note is taken of the effect on history of Custer s recklessness and glory-seeking and of the superstitions and fatalistic determination of the Sioux and the Cheyennes. The Battle of the Little Big Horn, reconstructed in this account largely on Indian eyewitness testimony, climaxed the long-developing tragedy and provided a \\"smashing crescendo to the vacillating policy of the United States government...towards the Indians of the Great Plains.\\" A four color reproduction of an oil painting by John Hauser, entitled \\"The Challenge,\\" has been selected for the cover of Custer s Luck. The original canvas is in the collection of the Thomas Gilcrease Institute of American History and Art, Tulsa, Oklahoma, and the publishers gratefully acknowledge the cooperation of that organization in making this reproduction possible.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5NEhJgX9iuMC&dq=Custer%27s+Luck&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The string quartet","description":"Table of contents","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0bJAZU27hWEC&dq=The+string+quartet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Question of Honour: The Life Of Lieutenant General Valentine Baker Pasha","description":"A Question of Honour focuses on a previously unpublished account of a great Victorian scandal, in which Baker was charged with assault upon a young woman in a railw ay carriage.

With his curmudgeonly wit, his literary allusions, his disdain for personal ambition and his lack of pomposity, he has, in the words of the Daily Telegraph, 'ascended to the pantheon of literary immortals'. Over a period of thirty years, beginning in the late 1970s, John Mortimer wrote almost eighty Rumpole stories (as well as four Rumpole novels). During that time the world changed dramatically with the result that late in his career Rumpole found himself defending hunt-saboteurs and alleged Islamic terrorists. But the old boy himself remained the same: committed to defending the apparently indefensible, trusting of the good sense of a jury and scornful of the law's pomposities - values he carried with him wherever he practised, whether he was defending a murderer down at the Bailey or someone up on a spot of assault at the Uxbridge Magistrates Court. And when the day was over, it was a quick nip into Pommeroy's Wine Bar for a glass or two of Chateau Thames Embankment before the tube home to She Who Must Be Obeyed in Foxbury Mansions. Forever Rumpole contains seven stories originally chosen by the author himself in 1993 as his favourites to that point, together with a further seven from the later period and the opening chapters of a Rumpole novel that Sir John was working on when he died in January 2009. With an introduction by Ann Mallalieu, fellow lawyer and for many years Sir John's colleague in practice, Forever Rumpole offers the very best of Horace Rumpole.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yvyjkQEACAAJ&dq=The+Best+of+Rumpole:+Chosen+By+the+Author&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alexander Y El Da Terrible, Horrible, Espantoso, Horroroso (Spanish Edition)","description":"Judith Viorst's long-popular tale of a day that begins badly ... and gets worse.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vXFCAwEACAAJ&dq=Alexander+Y+El+Da+Terrible,+Horrible,+Espantoso,+Horroroso+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Testament Exposition: From Text to Sermon","description":"Expository preaching is an elusive ideal. Many preachers aspire to it, few are acknowledged masters. For most a gap exists between the sermon that addresses the needs of the hearers and one that methodically plumbs the depths of Scripture. New Testament Exposition is written to bridge this gap and bring together the disciplines of preaching and exegesis. In this book Liefeld addresses the three main concerns of expository preaching: What is the text saying? How can its message be communicated in ways that are appropriate to the passage, the seeing, and the goals of the sermon? How can the message meet the real needs of the congregation in a way that is consistent with the purpose and function of the text? This book demonstrates how these concerns can be brought together in a sermon, and it is this thoughtful, practical approach that makes the book so valuable to preachers and seminarians. The book is divided into three parts. Part I explores the characteristics of expository preaching. Part II deals with preparing the text and addresses such areas as practical exegesis, exegetical outlines, narratives and compositional patterns, semantic patterns, and underlying assumptions of the text. Part III discusses application of the text by asking, What is the function of the text? What are the needs of the congregation? How can one preach to inner heart needs as well as to the external circumstances facing the congregation? New Testament Exposition is not vague theory, nor is it esoteric study beyond the grasp and time of the busy pastor. Throughout the book Dr. Liefeld reflects his experience in the classroom and pulpit, and his concerns as scholar and pastor are clearly seen in the final chapters of this volume. Chapter 9 examines preaching from difficult texts: How might one handle parables, miracle stories, obscure passages, culturally related texts? The final chapter provides a demonstration of all that is discussed throughout the book by walking the road through the actual preparation for a sermon.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=McuPh5__SGIC&dq=New+Testament+Exposition:+From+Text+to+Sermon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The riddle of the sands: A record of secret service","description":"Tempted by the idea of duck shooting, Carruthers joins his friend Davies on a yachting expedition in the Baltic.

Yet in spite of the apparent simplicity of approach, none of these books has used the functional analytic method of presenting semimartingales and stochastic integration. Thus a 2nd edition seems worthwhile and timely, though it is no longer appropriate to call it \\"a new approach\\". The new edition has several significant changes, most prominently the addition of exercises for solution. These are intended to supplement the text, but lemmas needed in a proof are never relegated to the exercises. Many of the exercises have been tested by graduate students at Purdue and Cornell Universities. Chapter 3 has been completely redone, with a new, more intuitive and simultaneously elementary proof of the fundamental Doob-Meyer decomposition theorem, the more general version of the Girsanov theorem due to Lenglart, the Kazamaki-Novikov criteria for exponential local martingales to be martingales, and a modern treatment of compensators. Chapter 4 treats sigma martingales (important in finance theory) and gives a more comprehensive treatment of martingale representation, including both the Jacod-Yor theory and Emery s examples of martingales that actually have martingale representation (thus going beyond the standard cases of Brownian motion and the compensated Poisson process). New topics added include an introduction to the theory of the expansion of filtrations, a treatment of the Fefferman martingale inequality, and that the dual space of the martingale space H^1 can be identified with BMO martingales. Solutions to selected exercises are available at the web site of the author, with current URL http://www.orie.cornell.edu/~protter/books.html.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lQcGkgAACAAJ&dq=Stochastic+Integration+and+Differential+Equations:+Second+Edition,+Version+2.1+(Stochastic+Modelling+and+Applied+Probability)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Sveshnikov Sicilian","description":"The Sveshnikov Variation is one of the most uncompromising lines of the Sicilian Defence.

Through the heavy Caspakian air, beneath the swollen sun, the five men marched northwest from Fort Dinosaur, now waist-deep in lush, jungle grasses starred with myriad gorgeous blooms, now across open meadow-land and parklike expanses and again plunging into dense forests of eucalyptus and acacia and giant arboreous ferns with feathered fronds waving gently a hundred feet above their heads. About them upon the ground, among the trees and in the air over them moved and swung and soared the countless forms of Caspak's teeming life.

Weekends, however, found her visiting churches in Harlem and Bedford-Stuyvestant, looking for a taste of home. Food has long been a part of the spiritual life of African-American churches, and what she found there, along with what she missed from home, was the comforting blend of cooking and fellowship that feeds both the body and soul. In this warm and joyful collection, White offers more than 150 recipes for the foods that worshipers look forward to after services, and she captures the spirit of these sociable meals with warm, conversational and occasionally poignant reflections from African-American churchgoers around the United States. \\"We don't just come to church service and leave,\\" says a retired nurse who directs hospitality for a large church in Los Angeles. \\"Many of us stay here half the day.

That is what the government leaders of the various nations told them. They were expected to blindly follow the dictates of the political leaders, as would a flock of sheep. It would be history repeating itself. But some human hearts would defy these dictates and love would replace hate. World War II was a most destructive time in the modern world. Many books have been written about persons injured or who died during this tragic period. But there were others, never mentioned, whose lives were changed forever. This book tells the story of those events. Then the Russians took a part of Poland and moved the Polish people to the Eastern most state of Germany. Thousands of German women and their children were forced from their homes and taken by cattle cars on trains to other parts of Germany. The lives of the characters in this book tell of the torment of the period, but it also shows that it is not the people who hate it is the politicians who encourage them to hate. The human feelings of Alexei and Olga prove that love can conquer all.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LXvQwAEACAAJ&dq=DEADLY+BREW:+She+Loved+Him+to+Death&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cutting Loose","description":"With more than thirty-five years of experience in psychotherapy, Dr. Halpern enables the adult child to understand his or her parent and foster a positive, healthy adult relationship. In all respects, you appear to be well-adjusted, reasonably successful adult, but in the presence of your parents, you feel vulnerable, dependent, guilty, insecure childlike. They manipulate you, smother you, demand your attention or elicit your resentment. In clear, nonclinical terms, renowned psychotherapist Dr. Howard Halpern shows you how to break these familiar family routines so that you can build healthy, rewarding parent-child relationships. He teaches you, for example, how to handle martyred mothers, despotic fathers, and moralistic, unloving, or seductive parents. He also addresses the sensitive topics of how to deal with aging, divorced, or dying parents. Resolving conflicts with your parents will enable you, finally, to cut loose to start being yourself rather than your parent's child. Without guilt, revenge, or fear as your motives, you will be able to make the choices in love, work, and values that do justice to who you are. With more than thirty-five years of experience in psychotherapy, Dr. Halpern enables the adult child to understand his or her parent and foster a positive, healthy adult relationship.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wqSaEXEY2I0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"d20 Weapons Locker: A d20 Modern Supplement","description":"An extensive library of firearms for the d20 Modern roleplaying game.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8OYMAAAACAAJ&dq=d20+Weapons+Locker:+A+d20+Modern+Supplement&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Day's Perfect Weather: More Twice Told Tales","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"When We Were Very Young","description":"A collection of poems reflecting the experiences of a little English boy growing up in the early part of the twentieth century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bB3hAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Macromedia Flash 8 for Windows & Macintosh","description":"An improved script editor (with a visual interface), a revamped library interface, a new Undo feature, powerful run-time effects, breakthrough motion-graphics capabilities these are just a few of the reasons Web designers are raving about the newest version of their favorite Web tool, Macromedia Flash 8.

Systems must exhibit software quality attributes, such as accuracy, performance, security and modifiability. However, such non-functional requirements (NFRs) are difficult to address in many projects, even though there are many techniques to meet functional requirements in order to provide desired functionality. This is particularly true since the NFRs for each system typically interact with each other, have a broad impact on the system and may be subjective. To enable developers to systematically deal with a system's diverse NFRs, this book presents the NFR Framework. Structured graphical facilities are offered for stating NFRs and managing them by refining and inter-relating NFRs, justifying decisions, and determining their impact. Since NFRs might not be absolutely achieved, they may simply be satisfied sufficiently (\`satisficed'). To reflect this, NFRs are represented as \`softgoals', whose interdependencies, such as tradeoffs and synergy, are captured in graphs. The impact of decisions is qualitatively propagated through the graph to determine how well a chosen target system satisfices its NFRs. Throughout development, developers direct the process, using their expertise while being aided by catalogues of knowledge about NFRs, development techniques and tradeoffs, which can all be explored, reused and customized. Non-Functional Requirements in Software Engineering demonstrates the applicability of the NFR Framework to a variety of NFRs, domains, system characteristics and application areas. This will help readers apply the Framework to NFRs and domains of particular interest to them. Detailed treatments of particular NFRs - accuracy, security and performance requirements - along with treatments of NFRs for information systems are presented as specializations of the NFR Framework. Case studies of NFRs for a variety of information systems include credit card and administrative systems. The use of the Framework for particular application areas is illustrated for software architecture as well as enterprise modelling. Feedback from domain experts in industry and government provides an initial evaluation of the Framework and some case studies. Drawing on research results from several theses and refereed papers, this book's presentation, terminology and graphical notation have been integrated and illustrated with many figures. Non-Functional Requirements in Software Engineering is an excellent resource for software engineering practitioners, researchers and students.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IgV_nRpf5tUC&dq=Non-Functional+Requirements+in+Software+Engineering+(THE+KLUWER+INTERNATIONAL+SERIES+IN+SOFTWARE+ENGINEERING+Volume+5)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daniel Webster: The Man And His Time","description":"Reveals Daniel Webster's role in American politics up to the Civil War, and describes why he was renowned for his oratory, but also for his political conniving","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=abJ4Ctql6M0C&dq=Daniel+Webster:+The+Man+And+His+Time&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death Goes on Retreat","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zI-mtQEACAAJ&dq=Death+Goes+on+Retreat&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Habla Malcolm X: Malcolm X Speaks (Malcolm X speeches & writings)","description":"\\"The young generation of whites, Blacks, browns, whatever else there is-you're living at a time of revolution,\\" Malcolm told young people in the United Kingdom in December 1964. \\"And I for one will join in with anyone, I don't care what color you are, as long as you want to change this miserable condition that exists on this earth.\\" Four talks and an interview given to young people in Ghana, the UK, and the United States in the last months of Malcolm's life.\\"Revivified to an extent that even the best biographies rarely achieve?.

Cutting across race and nationality, their photographs -- chosen from 40,000 entries worldwide -- bring to life the intimate moments and emotions shared by all families, whether in Australia, Rwanda, Colombia, or the United States. Taken from the most ambitious photographic competition and exhibit ever staged, the M.I.L.K. Collection -- Moments of Intimacy, Laughter, and Kinship -- these photos depict the joy, heartbreak, and love that shaped and make up our lives. Here are the bonds that bring us together as parent and child, sister and brother, youth and elder. From a father's first look at his new baby to a weathered grandma's embrace, the laughter of octogenarian uncle and nephew to the promise of a mother's kiss, these powerful images tell the story of humanity and celebrate its deepest emotional connection. The M.I.L.K. project was conceived to honor what it is to be part of a family. Look at the men, women, and children on these pages. In their faces you will recognize yourself and your loved ones, for you, too, are a member of the great kinship that is the human family. As James McBride writes, \\"without family, we are all a tribe of nomads, cut adrift, disconnected, wandering the earth with neither time nor place nor history to give our aching souls a home.\\" Family is a universal homecoming, a commemoration of the human spirit itself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yHrlwAEACAAJ&dq=Family:+A+Celebration+of+Humanity+(M.I.L.K.)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ziegfeld Girl: Image and Icon in Culture and Cinema","description":"A study of the iconographic significance of the Ziegfeld girl in twentieth-century American conceptions of sexuality, race, class, and consumerism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yKHv6NGfqpoC&dq=Ziegfeld+Girl:+Image+and+Icon+in+Culture+and+Cinema&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Most Wanted Bachelor","description":"Kathryn set her sights on the most wanted bachelor in Denver.

Extracted from Michael Steen s book The Lives and Times of the Great Composers, these concise guides, selected by The Independent s editorial team, explore the lives of composers as diverse as Mozart and Puccini, reaching from Bach to Brahms, set against the social, historical and political forces which affected them, to give a rounded portrait of what it was like to be alive and working as a musician at that time. Haydn's long life spanned the transition between the baroque and the classical. Though sometimes called the  father of the symphony , in reality he elevated the genre to an unprecedented degree of sophistication; his 104 symphonies still enchant today. His contribution to the quartet was similarly immense; he transformed it into what was to become the most expressive form of Western instrumental composition. Of the 90 still extant, the great musicologist Hans Keller deemed 45 of them  absolutely flawless, consistently original master quartets . Haydn's vast output included opera (not much heard today), keyboard and chamber music, masses and two oratorios. Yet this amazing inventiveness was achieved, for the most part, in the 30 years he spent closeted away in the fabulously rich Esterhazy palace 30 miles outside Vienna.  There was no one near to confuse me, so I was forced to become original,  he said later. Michael Steen shows the young Haydn from his village beginnings becoming a chorister in Vienna, and his struggles when thrown on to the streets at seventeen, all played out against the backdrop of the glittering reign of Maria Theresa and the later upheavals of her son's reforms. From the relative security of the Esterh zys' patronage, Haydn went on to become internationally famous, travelling twice to England. Friend to Mozart, teacher of Beethoven, Haydn died as Napoleon's troops rained down shells on Vienna.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QeGhBQAAQBAJ&dq=Haydn+(Great+composers+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Math Detectives: Finding Fun in Numbers","description":"A collection of math games and experiments, arranged in such categories as \\"On the Lookout for Shapes,\\" \\"Make a Tally,\\" and \\"Calculator Games.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IDyHZwEACAAJ&dq=Math+Detectives:+Finding+Fun+in+Numbers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Never Broken","description":"New York Times bestselling poet and multi-platinum singer-songwriter Jewel explores her unconventional upbringing and extraordinary life in an inspirational memoir that covers her childhood to fame, marriage, and motherhood. When Jewel s first album, Pieces of You, topped the charts in 1995, her emotional voice and vulnerable performance were groundbreaking. Drawing comparisons to Joan Baez and Joni Mitchell, a singer-songwriter of her kind had not emerged in decades. Now, with more than thirty million albums sold worldwide, Jewel tells the story of her life, and the lessons learned from her experience and her music. Living on a homestead in Alaska, Jewel learned to yodel at age five, and joined her parents  entertainment act, working in hotels, honky-tonks, and biker bars. Behind a strong-willed family life with an emphasis on music and artistic talent, however, there was also instability, abuse, and trauma. At age fifteen, she moved out and tasked herself with a mission: to see if she could avoid being the kind of statistic that her past indicated for her future. Soon after, she was accepted to the prestigious Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan, and there she began writing her own songs as a means of expressing herself and documenting her journey to find happiness. Jewel was eighteen and homeless in San Diego when a radio DJ aired a bootleg version of one of her songs and it was requested into the top-ten countdown, something unheard-of for an unsigned artist. By the time she was twenty-one, her debut had gone multiplatinum. There is much more to Jewel s story, though, one complicated by family legacies, by crippling fear and insecurity, and by the extraordinary circumstances in which she managed to flourish and find happiness despite these obstacles. Along her road of self-discovery, learning to redirect her fate, Jewel has become an iconic singer and songwriter. In Never Broken she reflects on how she survived, and how writing songs, poetry, and prose has saved her life many times over. She writes lyrically about the natural wonders of Alaska, about pain and loss, about the healing power of motherhood, and about discovering her own identity years after the entire world had discovered the beauty of her songs.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=U9lJBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Discovering Your Perfect Career","description":"What do you really want to do?

As work and personal demands rise, we try to keep up by juggling everything better, moving faster, and doing more. While we might succeed in the short term, this approach comes at a high cost in the long term: it hurts our well-being, our relationships, and paradoxically our productivity. In this life-changing book, Emma Sepp?l? explains that the reason we are burning ourselves out is that we fall for outdated theories of success. We are taught that getting ahead means doing everything that s thrown at us with razor-sharp focus and iron discipline, that success depends on our drive and talents, and that achievement cannot happen without stress. The Happiness Track demolishes these counterproductive theories. Drawing on the latest scientific research on happiness, resilience, willpower, compassion, positive stress, creativity, and mindfulness, Sepp?l? demonstrates that being happy is the most productive thing we can do to thrive whether at work or at home. She shares practical strategies for applying these scientific findings to our daily lives. A fulfilling, successful, and anxiety-free life is within your reach. The Happiness Track will show you the way. Happiness Is the Fast Track to Success  Are you a hard-driving, multitasking, conscientiously striving professional? Then your ideas about success are probably all wrong and you need The Happiness Track, Dr. Emma Sepp?l? s investigation into the counter-intuitive factors that create career and life success. The best news of all? All these skills are well within your grasp.  Daniel H. Pink, author of Drive and A Whole New Mind  Emma Sepp?l? convinces us that reconfiguring our brain for happiness can change the way our lives unfold and the way we approach success. A worthwhile read for anyone who wants to achieve a successful and fulfilling life.  Amy Cuddy, professor at Harvard Business School and author of Presence  Backed by extensive research in psychology and neuroscience, The Happiness Track offers a wealth of insight on changing how we approach our work, our personal lives, and our relationships. It s a carefully researched, engaging look at how to improve ourselves without losing our authenticity or our sanity.  Adam Grant, Wharton professor and New York Times bestselling author of Give and Take and Originals  Through her research-backed strategies, Emma Sepp?l? teaches us not only how to thrive in our chosen profession, but how to stay true to ourselves and enjoy every moment of the process.  Susan Cain, cofounder of Quiet Revolution and New York Times bestselling author of Quiet  For decades we ve been tied to theories of success that have burned us out and driven us into the ground because we don t know of any alternatives.

Ever since the publication of its original version, Naming and Necessity has had great and increasing influence. It redirected philosophical attention to neglected questions of natural and metaphysical necessity and to the connections between these and theories of reference, in particular of naming, and of identity. From a critique of the dominant tendency to assimilate names to descriptions and more generally to treat their reference as a function of their Fregean sense, surprisingly deep and widespread consequences may be drawn. The largely discredited distinction between accidental and essential properties, both of individual things (including people) and of kinds of things, is revived. So is a consequent view of science as what seeks out the essences of natural kinds. Traditional objections to such views are dealt with by sharpening distinctions between epistemic and metaphysical necessity; in particular by the startling admission of necessary a posteriori truths. From these, in particular from identity statements using rigid designators whether of things or of kinds, further remarkable consequences are drawn for the natures of things, of people, and of kinds; strong objections follow, for example to identity versions of materialism as a theory of the mind. This seminal work, to which today's thriving essentialist metaphysics largely owes its impetus, is here published with a substantial new Preface by the author.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9vvAlOBfq0kC&dq=Naming+and+Necessity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan","description":"A guide to achieving financial stability and prosperity encourages new ways to think about and manage money, discussing such topics as balancing a budget, planning for entertainment, and getting out of debt.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S_qbjMxbhYEC&dq=All+Your+Worth:+The+Ultimate+Lifetime+Money+Plan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diaries of a Young Poet","description":"\\"In the diaries [Rilke] kept from 1898 to 1900, now translated for the first time . . . the overall impression is that of a genius just coming into his own powers.\\" Boston Phoenix In April 1898 Rainer Maria Rilke, not yet twenty-three, began a diary of his Florence visit. It was to record, in the form of an imaginary dialogue with his mentor and then-lover, Lou Andreas-Salome, his firsthand experiences of early Renaissance art. The project quickly expanded to include not only thoughts on life, history, and artistic genius, but also unguarded moments of revulsion, self-doubt, and manic expectation. The result is an intimate glimpse into the young Rilke, already experimenting brilliantly with language and metaphor. \\"For the lover of Rilke, this superb translation of the poet's early diaries will be a watershed. Through Edward Snow's and Michael Winkler's brilliantly supple and faithful translation . . . a new and more balanced picture of Rilke will emerge.\\" Ralph Freedman","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ggp2CQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"E-Male: Of Mouse and Men","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4PYAAAAACAAJ&dq=E-Male:+Of+Mouse+and+Men&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Samurai Jack Calendar","description":"BEST SALE OFF 30%? ?SPECIAL LAUNCH PRICE  REGULAR PRICE 14.99$  Special Calendar with Official Holidays, Very Beautiful calendar gift for fans and making Successful achievements This year.

Clerici is a man with everything under control - a wife who loves him, colleagues who respect him, the hidden power that comes with his secret work for the Italian political police during the Mussolini years. But then he is assigned to kill his former professor, now in exile, to demonstrate his loyalty to the Fascist state, and falls in love with a strange, compelling woman; his life is torn open - and with it the corrupt heart of Fascism. Moravia equates the rise of Italian Fascism with the psychological needs of his protagonist for whom conformity becomes an obsession in a life that has included parental neglect, an oddly self-conscious desire to engage in cruel acts, and a type of male beauty which, to Clerici's great distress, other men find attractive.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yANPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Conformist&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"University of Nebraska: Off the Record (College Prowler) (College Prowler: University of Nebraska Off the Record)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=krB_0VwEMJwC&dq=University+of+Nebraska:+Off+the+Record+(College+Prowler)+(College+Prowler:+University+of+Nebraska+Off+the+Record)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The life and ministry of Jesus","description":"The Twelve Disciples - The Life and Ministry of Jesus' 12 Disciples Who were the 12 men who were the closest to Jesus?

The Twelve Disciples takes a look at the disciples' personalities, their encounters with Jesus, and the lessons we can learn from those who knew Jesus best while he was on earth. This bestselling resource is an excellent tool to help you learn about those who were the closest to Jesus and what it takes to be a disciple of Jesus today. 12 panels, fits inside most Bibles, 8.5 x 5.5 inches, unfolds to 33 inches long What do you know about the disciples who learned at Jesus' feet? The Twelve Disciples contains a close-up on the 12 ordinary men who Jesus trained to care for his church: Peter, James (son of Zebedee), Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James (son of Alphaeus), John, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot. What was the purpose and mission of the 12 disciples? Below are a few of the facts you will learn in this fascinating pamphlet: Each of the disciples were from the Galilee region except for Judas. The disciples were Jesus' main focus of instruction. Jesus was very aware of each one's strengths and weaknesses. Jesus trusted them to carry God's message of redemption to the ends of the earth. The Twelve Disciples reveals the personality and character of the disciples. For example, Peter was impulsive and courageous whereas John was bold yet vengeful. Each disciple had unique and personal encounters with Jesus that helps us learn more about how we can improve our relationship with Jesus today Peter was called to be a fisher of men (Matthew 4:19). James was with Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane (Matthew 26:36-46). Andrew told Jesus about the boy with five loaves of bread and two fish (John 20:19-25). Thomas affirmed that Jesus was Lord and God (John 21:2-7). What do you know about the 39 followers of Jesus, outside of the disciples, who are mentioned by name in the New Testament? Yes, there are 39 other key people who were significant to Jesus and the church, including: Cleopas, Joanna, Judas (brother of Jesus), Mary Magdalene, Luke, Apollos, and dozens of others.

Glossy and full-color, every fact in The Twelve Disciples includes a Scripture reference. Each of these 12 men will give you new insights into how you life can change by walking with Jesus. This pamphlet is an ideal resource for a Sunday school class or a small group Bible study. Both my husband and I found [The Twelve Disciples] surprisingly rich in information and historical facts concerning the characters, lives and deaths of Jesus' 12 disciples. My husband found it useful too for his sermons and we were surprised by some facts that we didn't know about the so-much-studied disciples.

Her recently announced book and motion picture deal has her enmeshed in a new legal controversy a Son of Sam lawsuit over the proceeds from that deal.

The entire community of Hemingway, South Carolina, shared responsibilities, helped raise all of the children, and worked side by side together every day in the bean fields. Perhaps most important, the community shared its food and recipes. When Sylvia set out to write this cookbook, she decided to hold a cook-off back home in Hemingway at Jeremiah Church. Family and friends of all ages shared their favorite dishes as well as their spirit and love for one another. The recipes offered at the cook-off were then compiled to create this incredible collection, along with many of Sylvia's and the Woods family's own recipes. Here are the kinds of recipes you'd find if you visited the Woods family's home. Sylvia's daughter Bedelia is well known for her Barbecued Beef Short Ribs, which are as sassy and spicy as Bedelia herself. Kenneth, Sylvia's youngest son, has loved to fish ever since he was a child, spending his summers by the fishing hole in Hemingway. Now Kenneth's son, DeSean, enjoys fishing, too. Kenneth's Honey Lemon Tilefish, DeSean's favorite, is just one of Kenneth's special recipes presented here. And there are many, many other wonderful dishes, too. In this remarkable cookbook, Sylvia has gathered more than 125 soul food classics, including mouthwatering recipes for okra, collard greens, Southern-style pound cakes, hearty meat and seafood stews and casseroles, salads, mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, and more. These recipes are straight from the heart of the Woods community of family and friends. Now Sylvia gives them to you to share with your loved ones. Bring them into your home and experience a little bit of Hemingway's soul.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=--j1kWiGG80C&dq=Sylvia%27s+Family+Soul+Food+Cookbook+:+From+Hemingway,+South+Carolina,+To+Harlem&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lectures on the Curry-Howard Isomorphism, Volume 149 (Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics)","description":"The Curry-Howard isomorphism states an amazing correspondence between systems of formal logic as encountered in proof theory and computational calculi as found in type theory. For instance, minimal propositional logic corresponds to simply typed lambda-calculus, first-order logic corresponds to dependent types, second-order logic corresponds to polymorphic types, sequent calculus is related to explicit substitution, etc. The isomorphism has many aspects, even at the syntactic level: formulas correspond to types, proofs correspond to terms, provability corresponds to inhabitation, proof normalization corresponds to term reduction, etc. But there is more to the isomorphism than this. For instance, it is an old idea---due to Brouwer, Kolmogorov, and Heyting---that a constructive proof of an implication is a procedure that transforms proofs of the antecedent into proofs of the succedent; the Curry-Howard isomorphism gives syntactic representations of such procedures. The Curry-Howard isomorphism also provides theoretical foundations for many modern proof-assistant systems (e.g. Coq). This book give an introduction to parts of proof theory and related aspects of type theory relevant for the Curry-Howard isomorphism. It can serve as an introduction to any or both of typed lambda-calculus and intuitionistic logic. Key features - The Curry-Howard Isomorphism treated as common theme - Reader-friendly introduction to two complementary subjects: Lambda-calculus and constructive logics - Thorough study of the connection between calculi and logics - Elaborate study of classical logics and control operators - Account of dialogue games for classical and intuitionistic logic - Theoretical foundations of computer-assisted reasoning   The Curry-Howard Isomorphism treated as the common theme.

In Changing Places, authors Richard Moe and Carter Wilkie give examples of how America's embattled towns are defing themselves against corporate giants and depressed economies, from community activists restoring pride in their innercities to municipalities breathing life back into historic downtowns.

Sustainable agricultural intensification - producing more output from the same area of land while reducing the negative environmental impacts - represents a solution for millions of African farmers. This volume presents the lessons learned from 40 sustainable agricultural intensification programmes in 20 countries across Africa, commissioned as part of the UK Government's Foresight project. Through detailed case studies, the authors of each chapter examine how to develop productive and sustainable agricultural systems and how to scale up these systems to reach many more millions of people in the future. Themes covered include crop improvements, agroforestry and soil conservation, conservation agriculture, integrated pest management, horticulture, livestock and fodder crops, aquaculture, and novel policies and partnerships.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yml0jnrrBRcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ENDOCRINOLOGY","description":"This state-of-the-art, tenth edition of endocrinology's classic text bridges the gap between basic science and endocrinology clinical practice.

Initially presented as the History of Photography Series in 1976, the first volume featured Henri Cartier-Bresson and was edited by legendary French publisher Robert Delpire, who cofounded the series with Apertures own Michael Hoffman. Twenty volumes have been published in total, each of them devoted to an image-maker whose achievements have accorded them vital importance in the history of photography. Each volume presents an evocative selection of the photographers lifes work, introduced with a foreword by a notable curator or historian of each artist. The series will be relaunched in Fall 2014, beginning with books on Paul Strand and Dorothea Lange, elegantly updated and refreshed for todays photography-hungry audiences, and introducing new, image-by-image commentary and chronologies of the artists lives for each of the previously published titles. The series will also include entirely new titles on individual artists. The Aperture Masters of Photography Series is an unparalleled library of both historical and contemporary photographers, and serves as an accessible compilation for anyone studying the history of photography.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cIWioAEACAAJ&dq=Paul+Strand&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"can Green Tomatoes Hatch and Other Stories","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0b9xAAAACAAJ&dq=can+Green+Tomatoes+Hatch+and+Other+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Petrarch's Songbook: Rerum Vulgarium Fragmenta : A Verse Translation (Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies)","description":"\\"Petrarch's Canzoniere is a body of 366 poems, mostly sonnets but including forms such as madrigals and canzoni.

This volume collects the self-published edition of Poems, Williams's foray into the world of letters, with previously unpublished notes he made after spending nearly a year in Europe rethinking poetry and how to write it. As Poems shows his first tentative steps into poetry, the notes show him as he prepares to make a giant transformation in his art. Shortly after Poems appeared, Williams went through a series of experiences that changed his life-a trip to Europe, a marriage to the sister of the woman he genuinely loved, and the establishment of his medical practice. In Europe he was introduced to a consideration of an unlikely trio: Heinrich Heine, Martin Luther, and Richard Wagner, resulting in an exposure that subsequently influenced his developing style. Williams looked back on Poems as apprentice work, calling them, bad Keats, nothing else-oh well, bad Whitman too. But I sure loved them... booklet-except the intent, and never republished the collection. Now that Williams's work is widely read and appreciated, his reputation secure, his development as a poet is a matter worth serious study, Poems can be seen as a point of departure, a clear record of where Williams began before his life and ideas about poetry made seismic shifts. Virginia M. Wright-Peterson's succinct introduction puts Poems in the context of his life and times, discusses the reception of the volume, his reconsideration of the poems, and what they reveal about his poetic ambitions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9o0jh7ch2bMC&dq=The+ice+box+poems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Developing Products in Half the Time: New Rules, New Tools, 2nd Edition","description":"Advance praise for Developing Products in Half the Time Second Edition New Rules, New Tools Preston G.

At its center is Kathleen Mallory, an extraordinary wild child turned New York City policewoman. Adopted off the streets as a little girl by a police inspector and his wife, she is still not altogether civilized now that she is a sergeant in the Special Crimes section. With her ferocious intelligence and green gunslinger eyes, Mallory (never Kathleen, never Kathy) operates by her own inner compass of right and wrong, a sense of justice that drives her in unpredictable ways. She is a thing apart. And today, she is a thing possessed. Although more at home in the company of computers than in the company of men, Mallory is propelled onto the street when the body of her adoptive father, Louis Markowitz, is found stabbed in a tenement next to the body of a wealthy Gramercy Park woman. The murders are clearly linked to two other Gramercy Park homicides Markowitz had been investigating, and now his cases become Mallory's, his death her cause. Prowling the streets, sifting through his clues, drawing on his circle of friends and colleagues, she plunges into a netherworld of light and shadow, where people are not what they seem and truth shifts without warning. And a murderer waits who is every bit as wild and unpredictable as she.... Filled with deep, seductive atmosphere and razor-sharp prose, Mallory's Oracle is gripping, resonant suspense of tantalizing complexity a genuinely unforgettable novel.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VLUW0hAOjjcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lonely","description":"When a wonderful new book arrives at the library, at first it is loved by all, checked out constantly, and rarely spends a night on the library shelf.

Many of his discoveries are described in his book Gnosis, which contains in its three volumes the fundamental components of that Christian esoteric teaching revealed by Ouspensky in fragmentary form. This Gnosis is not a modern statement of the second century texts known as 'Gnosticism', but a previously unpublished ancient Christian knowledge tradition. Boris Mouravieff taught Eastern Esotericism at Geneva University for many years, and Gnosis is the result of his teaching. First published in French in 1961, the three volumes of Mouravieff's Gnosis have since been translated into Greek and Arabic. During the 1980's and early 1990's, Praxis Research Institute published the English translation of all three volumes.

Trained in philosophy in North America and Asia, and well-experienced in real politik as a diplomat on the world stage, Mahbubani has unusual insight into America's ever more troubled relationship with the rest of the world. In Beyond the Age of Innocence Mahbubani reveals to us the America that Asia and the rest of the world see. We are a country that has given hope to billions by creating a society where destiny is not determined at birth. After the Second World War, we created a global order which allowed many nations to flourish. But when the Cold War ended, America made a terrible mistake. We started behaving like a normal country, ignoring the plight of others, indifferent to the consequences of our decisions on others. America was imprudent in its policy towards two large masses of mankind: the Chinese and Muslim populations. Guantanamo damaged our moral authority, but Abu Ghraib, paradoxically, may have demonstrated the accountability of American institutions. Still, disillusionment with America has spread to all corners. To allow any lasting gap between America and the world, Mahbubani argues, would be a colossal strategic mistake for America and a huge loss to the world. But there is still time for the US to change course; and in this thoughtprovoking, visionary book, Mahbubani shows us how.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gQOoKDgG8wIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Charging Ahead","description":"Provides startling facts and figures that reveal the hidden costs of maintaining a consumptive fuel society in America, compares the U.S. to foreign countries that are already providing strong support for renewable energy sources, and examines the future of energy technology.

X-ray powder diffraction is a technique used to fingerprint solid samples, which are then identified and cataloged for future use-much the way the FBI keeps fingerprints on file. The current database of some 70,000 material prints has been put to a broad range of uses, from the analysis of moon rocks to testing drugs for purity. Introduction to X-ray Powder Diffractometry fully updates the achievements in the field over the past fifteen years and provides a much-needed explanation of the state-of-the-art techniques involved in characterizing materials. It covers the latest instruments and methods, with an emphasis on the fundamentals of the diffractometer, its components, alignment, calibration, and automation. The first three chapters outline diffraction theory in clear language, accessible to both students and professionals in chemistry, physics, geology, and materials science. The book's middle chapters describe the instrumentation and procedures used in X-ray diffraction, including X-ray sources, X-ray detection, and production of monochromatic radiation. The chapter devoted to instrument design and calibration is followed by an examination of specimen preparation methods, data collection, and reduction. The final two chapters provide in-depth discussions of qualitative and quantitative analysis. While the material is presented in an orderly progression, beginning with basic concepts and moving on to more complex material, each chapter stands on its own and can be studied independently or used as a professional reference. More than 230 illustrations and tables demonstrate techniques and clarify complex material. Self-contained, timely, and user-friendly, Introduction to X-ray Powder Diffractometry is an enormously useful text and professional reference for analytical chemists, physicists, geologists and materials scientists, and upper-level undergraduate and graduate students in materials science and analytical chemistry. X-ray powder diffraction-a technique that has matured significantly in recent years-is used to identify solid samples and determine their composition by analyzing the so-called \\"fingerprints\\" they generate when X-rayed. This unique volume fulfills two major roles: it is the first textbook devoted solely to X-ray powder diffractometry, and the first up-to-date treatment of the subject in 20 years. This timely, authoritative volume features: * Clear, concise descriptions of both theory and practice-including fundamentals of diffraction theory and all aspects of the diffractometer * A treatment that reflects current trends toward automation, covering the newest instrumentation and automation techniques * Coverage of all the most common applications, with special emphasis on qualitative and quantitative analysis * An accessible presentation appropriate for both students and professionals * More than 230 tables and illustrations Introduction to X-ray Powder Diffractometry, a collaboration between two internationally known and respected experts in the field, provides invaluable guidance to anyone using X-ray powder diffractometers and diffractometry in materials science, ceramics, the pharmaceutical industry, and elsewhere.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AKsPAQAAMAAJ&dq=Introduction+to+X-Ray+Powder+Diffractometry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Firefighter's Handbook: Essentials of Firefighting and Emergency Response","description":"Contains an illustrated guide to firefighting, and includes information on hazardous materials, terrorism, and the requirements for passing the Firefighter I and II, and complies with the 2002 standards for firefighting professionals.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XJhSAAAAMAAJ&dq=Firefighter%27s+Handbook:+Essentials+of+Firefighting+and+Emergency+Response&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Understanding Object-Oriented Programming with Java","description":"This book develops the object-oriented programming skills of experienced programmers by showing how to use Java 2 (the latest release of Sun's Java platform), and by providing a complete understanding of the philosophy behind Java 2.

Jen Dixon is not your typical Kansas City kindergarten class mom or mom in general. Jen already has two college-age daughters by two different (probably) musicians, and it s her second time around the class mom block with five-year-old Max this time with a husband and father by her side. Though her best friend and PTA President sees her as the  wisest  candidate for the job (or oldest), not all of the other parents agree. From recording parents  response times to her emails about helping in the classroom, to requesting contributions of  special  brownies for curriculum night, not all of Jen s methods win approval from the other moms. Throw in an old flame from Jen s past, a hyper-sensitive  allergy mom,  a surprisingly sexy kindergarten teacher, and an impossible-to-please Real Housewife-wannabe, causing problems at every turn, and the job really becomes much more than she signed up for.

In this book, seven earlier papers and articles, read previously only by a restricted audience, have been brought together with four new chapters, the whole volume showing a continuity of approach across a period when all too often literary and linguistic studies have appeared to drift further apart. Leech sets the concept of  foregrounding  (also known as defamiliarization) at the heart of the interplay between form and interpretation. Through practical and insightful examination of how poems, plays and prose works produce special meaning, he counteracts the  flight from the text  that has characterized thinking about language and literature in the last thirty years, when the response of the reader, rather than the characteristics and meaning potential of the text itself, have been given undue prominence.

This book is not about pornography. You won't find graphic depictions about the porn industry, the catastrophic effects it has on individuals and relationships, or how to think differently about porn. If you're reading this book, you probably have some understanding of those things already the last thing you need is to be subjected to that kind of detail...again. Finally Free is about hope. It's about discovering the freeing power available to those who trust in Jesus Christ, who can, will, and does set people free from the power of pornography. Dr. Heath Lambert, a leader in the biblical counseling movement, has organized this book around eight clear and practical tactics you can wield to make it easier to flee lust and temptation and shelter in the protection of God's grace. Each chapter: Clearly demonstrates how the gospel applies to the fight against sexual temptation. Lays out relevant methods for leaning on Christ's strength both in advance of and in moments of temptation. Explains how Jesus can move readers from a life of struggle to a life of purity. If you've struggled personally against the powerful draw of pornography, or if you've ever tried to help someone fighting this battle, you know how hard it is to break its bonds. But there is good news: no matter how intense or long-standing the struggle, Jesus Christ has the power to free people from the enslaving power of pornography. The Gospel has a power that works practically in the lives of those who seek to imitate Christ and you can learn how to live into that power.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nQWdWY6qDYsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Waste Engine Oils: Rerefining and Energy Recovery","description":"Waste Engine Oils presents a complete description of the field of engine used oils, widely collected in the networks of services-stations and garages.

The essays in Identities, Politics, and Rights question these assumptions and examine how rights constitute us as subjects and are, at the same time, implicated in political struggles. In contrast to the liberal notion of rights' universality, these essays emphasize the context-specific nature of rights as well as their constitutive effects. Recognizing that political disputes throughout the world have increasingly been cast as arguments about rights, the essays in this volume examine the varied roles that rights play in political movements and contests. They argue that rights talk is used by many different groups primarily because of its fluidity. Certainly rights can empower individuals and protect them from their societies, but they also constrain them in other areas. Frequently, empowerment for one group means disabling rights for another group. Moreover, focusing on rights can both liberate and limit the imagination of the possible. By alerting us to this paradox of rights--empowerment and limitation--Identities, Politics, and Rights illuminates ongoing challenges to rights and reminds us that rights can both energize political engagement and provide a resource for defenders of the status quo.

The purpose of this workshop series is to gather academic and industrial researchers working on all aspects of performance engineering. This year the workshop was structured around three main areas: system and network p- formance engineering, software performance engineering, and the modeling and evaluation techniques supporting them. This edition of the workshop attracted 38 submissions, whose authors we wish to thank for their interest in EPEW 2010. After a careful review process during which every paper was refereed by at least three reviewers, the Program Committee selected 16 papers for presentation at the workshop. We warmly thank all the members of the ProgramCommittee and all the reviewersfor their fair and constructive comments and discussions. The workshop program was enriched by two keynote talks given by Marco Roccetti and Ralf Reussner.

The Price of Whiteness documents the uneasy place Jews have held in America's racial culture since the late nineteenth century. The book traces Jews' often tumultuous encounter with race from the 1870s through World War II, when they became vested as part of America's white mainstream and abandoned the practice of describing themselves in racial terms. American Jewish history is often told as a story of quick and successful adaptation, but Goldstein demonstrates how the process of identifying as white Americans was an ambivalent one, filled with hard choices and conflicting emotions for Jewish immigrants and their children. Jews enjoyed a much greater level of social inclusion than African Americans, but their membership in white America was frequently made contingent on their conformity to prevailing racial mores and on the eradication of their perceived racial distinctiveness. While Jews consistently sought acceptance as whites, their tendency to express their own group bonds through the language of \\"race\\" led to deep misgivings about what was required of them. Today, despite the great success Jews enjoy in the United States, they still struggle with the constraints of America's black-white dichotomy. The Price of Whiteness concludes that while Jews' status as white has opened many doors for them, it has also placed limits on their ability to assert themselves as a group apart.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Yoa-DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Annotated Gilbert & Sullivan","description":"Contains the complete text of all the Gilbert and Sullivan operas which are still performed today, together with extensive annotations and commentaries","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gUrPngEACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Annotated+Gilbert&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bible book by book,","description":"Reading the Bible doesn't need to be a difficult journey through strange and bewildering territory.

Without self-esteem, the only change is an exchange of masters; with it, there is no need for masters. When trying to find books to give to  the countless brave and smart women I met who didn t think of themselves as either brave or smart,  Steinem realized that books either supposed that external political change would cure everything or that internal change would. None linked internal and external change together in a seamless circle of cause and effect, effect and cause. She undertook to write such a book, and ended up transforming her life, as well as the lives of others. The result of her reflections is this truly transformative book: part personal collection of stories from her own life and the lives of many others, part revolutionary guide to finding community and inspiration. Steinem finds role models in a very young and uncertain Gandhi as well as unlikely heroes from the streets to history. Revolution from Within addresses the core issues of self-authority and unjust external authority, and argues that the first is necessary to transform the second. This ebook features an illustrated biography of Gloria Steinem including rare images from the author s personal collection, as well as a new preface and list of book recommendations from Steinem.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BgCKtyZnbVgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ghosts in Residence","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q0_jAAAACAAJ&dq=Ghosts+in+Residence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Alaskans (The Old West)","description":"A pictorial history of Alaska, from its purchase by the United States in 1867 through 1912, chronicling the exploration of the wilderness, the discovery of gold, and the development of the whaling, fishing, and fur industries.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8h5DugEACAAJ&dq=The+Alaskans+(The+Old+West)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE HARVARD CLASSICS","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fLYOAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Managing Projects with Microsoft(r) Project 98: For Windows","description":"Managing single or multiple projects is tough enough.

In this revolutionary new cookbook, Thomas Keller, America's most respected chef, explains why this foolproof technique, which involves cooking at precise temperatures below simmering, yields results that other culinary methods cannot. For the first time, one can achieve short ribs that are meltingly tender even when cooked medium rare. Fish, which has a small window of doneness, is easier to finesse, and shellfish stays succulent no matter how long it's been on the stove. Fruit and vegetables benefit, too, retaining color and flavor while undergoing remarkable transformations in texture. The secret to sous vide is in discovering the precise amount of heat required to achieve the most sublime results. Through years of trial and error, Keller and his chefs de cuisine have blazed the trail to perfection and they show the way in this collection of never-before-published recipes from his landmark restaurants The French Laundry in Napa Valley and per se in New York. With an introduction by the eminent food-science writer Harold McGee, and artful photography by Deborah Jones, who photographed Keller's best-selling The French Laundry Cookbook, this book will be a must for every culinary professional and anyone who wants to up the ante and experience food at the highest level.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_1rnDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Light Through the Crack: Life After Loss","description":"A deeply moving and engaging work of Christian spirituality in the tradition of Henri Nouwen, written by his close friend and literary executrix.

In Light Through the Crack, she tells her own story and the stories of the people she has known throughout her life.

Leonard Cohen once wrote in a song:  There is a crack in everything/That s how the light gets in.

But cooking in a small kitchen, with minimal equipment, doesn't have to be limiting; it can actually be is a great opportunity to hone food-prep skills and become a more efficient, versatile home chef. And the smarter the workspace, the easier it is to cook. In The Tiny Kitchen Cookbook, chef Annie Mahle shares her small-space cooking strategies and 50 of her favorite recipes she developed as the galley chef aboard the J&E Riggin, a windjammer she operated with her husband off the coast of Maine for many summers. From her 6-by-8-foot kitchen, she prepared three beautiful, flavorful meals from scratch every day, for up to 30 people. From versatile breakfast options, such as Sweet Corn and Jalapeno Pancakes or Pan Roasted Honey Pears with Oatmeal, to one-bowl salads and mains, stovetop meals such as Pan-Fried Red Snapper with Fresh Peas, Shiitakes, and Asparagus with Dill, dishes that can be prepared in the toaster oven (for cooks without a full oven) such as Cheese-Stuffed Meatballs with Fresh Tomato Sauce and Fettuccini, and even make-ahead desserts in a mug, every recipe is delicious and utterly attainable in a kitchen with as little as six square feet of counter space. Along with gorgeous recipes, Mahle delivers tips and techniques for making the most of a small kitchen. Strategies such as  shopping  the pantry before going to the store, transforming leftovers into new meals, create vertical storage options, and buy utensils that nest all help create meals with maximum flavor in minimal space.

The Virgin Queen ruled over a Golden Age: the Spanish Armada was defeated; English explorers reached the ends of the earth; a new Church of England rose from the ashes of past conflict; the English Renaissance bloomed in the genius of Shakespeare, Spenser and Sidney. But the image is also armour. In this illuminating account of Elizabeth's reign, Helen Castor shows how England's iconic queen was shaped by profound and enduring insecurity-an insecurity which was both a matter of practical political reality and personal psychology. From her precarious upbringing at the whim of a brutal, capricious father and her perilous accession after his death, to the religious division that marred her state and the failure to marry that threatened her line, Elizabeth lived under constant threat. But, facing down her enemies with a compellingly inscrutable public persona, the last and greatest of the Tudor monarchs would become a timeless, fearless queen.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XoPIugEACAAJ&dq=Kings+and+Queens+of+England:+Book+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond Eden (Contemporary Romantic Thriller)","description":"A heart-stopping story of romantic suspense from #1 New York Times bestselling author Catherine Coulter.

In Our First Admiral, the reader will learn of gross inefficiency and waste in the conduct of war, in the North as well as the South; of jealous ambition and malicious criticism; of lukewarm support of the government, lack of cooperation between the Army and Navy, and the inroads upon morale made by war weariness and disease, all of which tried Farragut s courage as much as the enemy in battle. Farragut was a practical resourceful leader with vision and intuition (a rare combination), a courageous hard-hitting fighter who hated war, and a deeply religious man with an exuberant spirit and love of fellowship who was also exceedingly loyal to the Navy and his country. Though he was small in physical stature, Farragut was tall indeed in the fundamental characteristics of true manhood.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1F49BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dubious Mandate : A Memoir of the UN in Bosnia, Summer 1995","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Temptation","description":"Vance Hale has everything.

Warner prominent in his day as a writer and newspaper editor was a dedicated amateur gardener who shared with Mark Twain, his close friend and neighbor, a sense of humor that remains deliciously fresh today. In monthly dispatches, Warner chronicles his travails in the garden, where he and his cat, Calvin, seek to ward off a stream of interlopers, from the neighbors  huge-hoofed cows and thieving children, to the reviled, though  propagatious,  pusley weed. To read Warner is to join him on his rounds of his beloved vegetable patch, to feel the sun on his sore back, the hoe in his blistered hands, and yet, like him, never to lose sight of  the philosophical implications of contact with the earth, and companionship with gently growing things.

Between 1987 and 1989, Alepho, Benjamin, and Benson, like tens of thousands of young boys, took flight from the massacres of Sudan's civil war. They became known as the Lost Boys. With little more than the clothes on their backs, sometimes not even that, they streamed out over Sudan in search of refuge. Their journey led them first to Ethiopia and then, driven back into Sudan, toward Kenya. They walked nearly one thousand miles, sustained only by the sheer will to live. They Poured Fire on Us from the Sky is the three boys' account of that unimaginable journey. With the candor and the purity of their child's-eye-vision, Alephonsian, Benjamin, and Benson recall by turns: how they endured the hunger and strength-sapping illnesses dysentery, malaria, and yellow fever; how they dodged the life-threatening predators lions, snakes, crocodiles and soldiers alike that dogged their footsteps; and how they grappled with a war that threatened continually to overwhelm them. Their story is a lyrical, captivating, timeless portrait of a childhood hurled into wartime and how they had the good fortune and belief in themselves to survive.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nRtpCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Accounting Information Systems: Essential Concepts and Applications","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Fr2LNAEACAAJ&dq=Accounting+Information+Systems:+Essential+Concepts+and+Applications&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Typographers on Type","description":"A collection of writings about important typographers and the development of their art.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y5oVAQAAIAAJ&dq=Typographers+on+Type&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Animal Hide and Seek","description":"While one cow, two pigs, three sheep, and increasing numbers of other animals can be found in their usual spots on the farm, one of each kind of farm animal is hiding behind the flaps.

Twenty years ago, Mary Sojourner was a mental health consultant and counselor in Rochester, New York, a divorced mother of three, longing for her real work, her real home. She found it in Flagstaff, Arizona, in a remote two-room cabin that had no running water and only a wood stove for heat, but offered Sojourner everything she needed in terms of light, beauty, joy, and the perfect setting for writing and reconnecting. Solace is a book about obsession and release, and the lifelong search for balance in a world revolving around appetite and acceleration. Written in short, beautifully crafted pieces, the book carries the reader through Sojourner's life, from a restrained Catholic childhood to the excesses of her generation, through motherhood and divorce to her quiet, solitary existence in the Southwest, where she has learned the importance of living at the right pace. Sojourner's voice is as compelling on the page as it is on the radio -- lively, funny, moving, combining the outspoken out-of-stepness of Anne Lamott with the environmental activism and poetic prose of Terry Tempest Williams. In chapters with titles such as \\"God Is Coming and She Is Pissed\\" and \\"How to Leave: Leave,\\" her vivid personality, passion, and sense of humor come through. This is a book for women everywhere -- those who recognize their own truths in Mary's life and younger readers who will find inspiration in her hard-won wisdom.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JOsOwzpWhI0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The witches of All Saints","description":"Tansy Tremayne arrives at her aunt's country estate in early nineteenth-century England in time to witness the ritual murder of a young neighbor by a group of witches.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=haJRAgAACAAJ&dq=The+witches+of+All+Saints&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Advent of Divine Justice","description":"The Advent of Divine Justice is a letter from Shoghi Effendi to the Bah ? s of the United States and Canada written on 25 December 1938.

With this stunning debut, Mary Howard has crafted an electrifying and hauntingly evocative novel of truth and perception, of the ties we tell others-and the lies we tell ourselves. Two years ago Linda Garbo left her graphic design job in Minneapolis to open a printmaking studio in a small town in Iowa with the encouragement of Luci Cole, a weaver and an old friend from art school. Arriving in Linden Grove for good, Linda agrees to stay with Luci and her boyfriend, Charlie, in their old farmhouse outside of town until the renovations to her new studio space are completed. But the following afternoon as she is driving down the long winding road toward Luci's house, Linda sees Luci's neighbor, Peter Garvey, walking out the front door-and when Linda enters the house a few minutes later, she discovers her friend's lifeless body on the kitchen floor. Now, two years later, Peter Garvey has been convicted of Luci's murder. Linda is married to Charlie and living in the very house where Luci died. And she is convinced someone is following her. As she begins to confront her fears-approaching the man she believes is spying on her, visiting Peter Garvey in prison-she finally faces the cause for her frequent panic attacks: she was too traumatized by her discovery of Luci's body to be a reliable witness. And if she's identified the wrong man, the killer may still be close by, ready to react if she admits she might have made a mistake. Compelled to unravel the mystery surrounding Luci's final days, Linda finds that Luci was a master at weaving her true colors into a complex tapestry, preferring involvements that required secrecy. A beautifully crafted tour de force of significant depth, passion, and power, Discovering the Body is a completely beguiling meditation on perception, loss, memory, and redemption whose conclusion proves to be as significantly haunting as it is satisfying.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yc9WIpSPDR4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The first Metis: A new nation","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FIkIAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+first+Metis:+A+new+nation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hagstrom New York City 5 Borough Pocket Atlas","description":"The New York City 5 Borough Pocket Atlas is the most accurate of its kind.

If your answer to this ethical question is yes, then you need a working knowledge of health policy. An understanding of how policy decisions are made gives healthcare leaders a knowledge base from which they can turn what once appeared to be limitations or obstacles into opportunities to facilitate better access to care, improve the quality of care, and more effectively manage costs. Leaders who have a firm grasp on the policymaking process can advocate for their patients, their organizations, and their communities. This revamped version of the classic textbook originally authored by Beaufort B. Longest, Jr., links policy concepts to practical applications and real healthcare outcomes. It covers formulation, implementation, and modification of health policymaking at both the federal and state levels, while giving readers insight into real-life political results and details of on-the-ground policy decisions. Highlights include: - A new chapter on federalism and the role of the states - Policy Snapshots at the beginning of each of the book's sections that offer brief, true stories of a significant policy event or an opportunity for students to envision their future selves as health advocates - A thoroughly revised and updated chapter on how the courts shape health policy - A rich array of new or updated examples drawn from actual policymaking events, in addition to new graphics and sidebars - Updated appendixes reorganized to provide easy access to examples germane to the topic at hand - An epilogue highlighting federal and state policy challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic of 2020 Let author Michael R. Meacham guide you through health policy as a process. With a background in policy, law, healthcare leadership, and academia, he enables students to understand both the big picture and the small, but important, details.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pXx4zQEACAAJ&dq=Health+Policymaking+in+the+United+States+(3rd+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Letters of the Queens of England 1100-1547","description":"While the role and character of England's medieval and Tudor kings are well documented, little attention has been paid to their often powerful and influential consorts. This volume allows the queens to speak for themselves through their own correspondence, with each letter set in context and a general introduction to the role of the queen in medieval and Tudor England. Virtually every English queen from Matilda of Scotland, first wife of Henry I, to Katherine Parr, sixth wife of Henry VIII, is represented. By rescuing them from their traditional role as faceless consorts, this study shows these women as considerable political figures in their own right, and as strong, intelligent, occasionally awkward, members of society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OftVAAAAYAAJ&dq=Letters+of+the+Queens+of+England+1100-1547&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ambassadors at Sea: the High and Low Adventures of a Diplomat","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q_ZWwAEACAAJ&dq=Ambassadors+at+Sea:+the+High+and+Low+Adventures+of+a+Diplomat&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Coreldraw 7: The Official Guide","description":"Packed with innovative tips and tricks to help you create spectacular effects, improved page layouts and more.

Drawing on cryptic intimations in the work of J. G. Ballard, Georges Bataille, William Burroughs, Andr  Leroi-Gourhan, Elaine Morgan, and Friedrich Nietzsche, in the late twentieth century Daniel Barker formulated the axioms of spinal catastrophism: If human morphology, upright posture, and the possibility of language are the ramified accidents of natural history, then psychic ailments are ultimately afflictions of the spine, which itself is a scale model of biogenetic trauma, a portable map of the catastrophic events that shaped that atrocity exhibition of evolutionary traumata, the sick orthograde talking mammal. Tracing its provenance through the biological notions of phylogeny and  organic memory  that fueled early psychoanalysis, back into idealism, nature philosophy, and romanticism, and across multiform encounters between philosophy, psychology, biology, and geology, Thomas Moynihan reveals the historical continuity of spinal catastrophism. From psychoanalysis and myth to geology and neuroanatomy, from bioanalysis to chronopathy, from spinal colonies of proto-minds to the retroparasitism of the CNS, from  railway spine  to Elizabeth Taylor's lost gill-slits, this extravagantly comprehensive philosophical adventure uses the spinal cord as a guiding thread to rediscover forgotten pathways in modern thought. Moynihan demonstrates that, far from being an fanciful notion rendered obsolete by advances in biology, spinal catastrophism dramatizes fundamental philosophical problematics of time, identity, continuity, and the transcendental that remain central to any attempt to reconcile human experience with natural history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aMK9DwAAQBAJ&dq=Catastrophism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Foul Play (Golden Rod Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1FRGAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essentials of New Testament Greek","description":"For almost seventy years, Essentials of New Testament Greek has been a classic textbook and key tool for students of New Testament Greek.

None survived. On Top of the World tells the story not only of that tragic day but also of the complicated and emotionally charged events that followed. It is an intimate, often harrowing look at how private families processed a public atrocity, how corporate war-room strategy sessions saved the company from liquidation and the efforts of opportunistic competitors. This book examines the media scrutiny that followed Howard Lutnick, who struggled to be at once the compassionate leader the grieving families needed and the tough-minded CEO his decimated company required. It also tells the story of the men and women of Cantor whose lost coworkers were relatives and friends, and brothers and sisters. That Cantor's business has survived and even flourished -- and that an initially uneasy but ultimately significant covenant has been formed between those who lived and the families of their lost friends -- is a powerful testament to the ability of a community to endure.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5eN1PwAACAAJ&dq=On+Top+of+the+World:+Cantor+Fitzgerald,+Howard+Lutnick,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eating Out in Santa Fe: All the Best Restaurants, Cafes, Markets, Bakeries & Street-Eats","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OLEJAAAACAAJ&dq=Eating+Out+in+Santa+Fe:+All+the+Best+Restaurants,+Cafes,+Markets,+Bakeries&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Color of Summer: or The New Garden of Earthly Delights","description":"The penultimate chapter in the author's \\"secret history of Cuba\\" offers a saga of the triumph of the human spirit and will in the face of political and sexual repression.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y2rmAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Color+of+Summer:+or+The+New+Garden+of+Earthly+Delights&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dear Rabbi, Why Can\`t I Marry Her?","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7iE4UkusohkC&dq=Dear+Rabbi,+Why+Can%60t+I+Marry+Her%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maverick Marine: General Smedley D.

This new edition of Che Guevara's diary of the last year of his life describes Che's efforts to launch a guerrilla insurrection against the military government of Bolivia. It was found in his backpack when he was captured by the Bolivian Army in October 1967.This edition includes Fidel Castro's \\"A Necessary Introduction,\\" exposing the lies of an earlier, pre-emptive edition prepared by the C.I.A. to discredit Che and the Bolivian expedition, as well as the Cuban Revolution itself. The Bolivian Diary reveals an older, more time-tested, and health-compromised Che than either the exuberant The Motorcycle Diaries or the mature and implacable Congo Diary. There is rich irony here as he recounts the daily challenges faced by his small guerrilla band, the pronouncements of the military government, and the actions of the large military force attacking them. The last entry describes the day before Che's capture, two days before his murder.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5mJOEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Bolivian+Diary+of+Ernesto+Che+Guevara&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fainting Phenomenon: Understanding Why People Faint and What Can Be Done About It","description":"Fainting, the sudden and often unpredictable loss of consciousness,can be a frightening experience.

On this basis, he formed the 'Center for Christian Esoteric Studies' in Geneva - now closed. Many of his discoveries are described in his book Gnosis, which contains in its three volumes the fundamental components of that Christian esoteric teaching revealed by Ouspensky in fragmentary form. This Gnosis is not a modern statement of the second century texts known as 'Gnosticism', but a previously unpublished ancient Christian knowledge tradition. Boris Mouravieff taught Eastern Esotericism at Geneva University for many years, and Gnosis is the result of his teaching. First published in French in 1961, the three volumes of Mouravieff's Gnosis have since been translated into Greek and Arabic. During the 1980's and early 1990's, Praxis Research Institute published the English translation of all three volumes.

Even though everyday problem solving does not necessarily follow logical pathways, it is sensible and effective in handling practical problems.

The studies also illustrate the different research strategies appropriate to the investigation of the art and skills of domestic everyday making.

Out of this skirmish arose a stirring tale of war, which was recorded in the oldest extant epic poem in French. The Song of Roland, written by an unknown poet, tells of Charlemagne s warrior nephew, Lord of the Breton Marches, who valiantly leads his men into battle against the Saracens, but dies in the massacre, defiant to the end. In majestic verses, the battle becomes a symbolic struggle between Christianity and paganism, while Roland s last stand is the ultimate expression of honour and feudal values of twelfth-century France.

Their father was the Duke of York, the second son of King George V, and their Uncle David was the future King of England. We all know how the fairy tale ended: When King George died, \\"Uncle David\\" became King Edward VIII---who abdicated less than a year later to marry the scandalous Wallis Simpson. Suddenly the little princesses' father was King. The family moved to Buckingham Palace, and ten-year-old Princess Elizabeth became the heir to the crown she would ultimately wear for over fifty years. The Little Princesses shows us how it all began. In the early thirties, the Duke and Duchess of York were looking for someone to educate their daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret, then five- and two-years-old. They already had a nanny---a family retainer who had looked after their mother when she was a child---but it was time to add someone younger and livelier to the household. Enter Marion Crawford, a twenty-four-year-old from Scotland who was promptly dubbed \\"Crawfie\\" by the young Elizabeth and who would stay with the family for sixteen years. Beginning at the quiet family home in Piccadilly and ending with the birth of Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace in 1948, Crawfie tells how she brought the princesses up to be \\"Royal,\\" while attempting to show them a bit of the ordinary world of underground trains, Girl Guides, and swimming lessons. The Little Princesses was first published in 1950 to a furor we cannot imagine today. It has been called the original \\"nanny diaries\\" because it was the first account of life with the Royals ever published. Although hers was a touching account of the childhood of the Queen and Princess Margaret, Crawfie was demonized by the press. The Queen Mother, who had been a great friend and who had, Crawfie maintained, given her permission to write the account, never spoke to her again. Reading The Little Princesses now, with a poignant new introduction by BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond, offers fascinating insights into the changing lives and times of Britains royal family.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CX4aDVMO0ugC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cat Who Went into the Closet","description":"While sifting through closets of junk in the mansion they have rented, Qwilleran and his feline companions, Koko and Yum Yum, uncover a mystery involving the suicide of the former owner and the murder of a potato farmer.

It investigates the relations between garden aesthetics and metaphysics, discussing issues similar to those raised by Weiss's critically acclaimed Mirrors of Infinity. The Western garden has always served as a setting for music, dance, theater, sculpture, and architecture, as well as the minor arts of meditative contemplation and erotic seduction. The history of landscape architecture is therefore inextricable from the histories of the other arts, and must be studied from an interdisciplinary and polycultural point of view. Some of the topics included in this book are the influence of neo-Platonic philosophy on the Italian Renaissance garden, erotic fantasies and the 18th-century libertine garden, the contrast between Thoreau's romantic notion of virgin nature and changes in perception due to increasing speed and mechanization, and the limits of landscape architecture as art form in 20th-century gardens.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cKTUwvjVjjcC&dq=Unnatural+Horizons:+Paradox+and+Contradiction+in+Landscape+Architecture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Whitsun Weddings & Less Deceived (Master Guide)","description":"The most cherished of poets, Philip Larkin is a writer with an unrivalled ability to touch readers with his evocations of English life.

The crucial truth and burden embodied in these twelve messages may be summarized in four statements: (1) In Christ's death we have been separated from sins, and in His resurrection we have been enlivened so that we might live to righteousness under the government of God. (2) We must redeem the time to enjoy Christ as the supreme preciousness of God so that He can build Himself into us to make us His spiritual house and His holy and royal priesthood for the accomplishment of His heart's desire. (3) We should be diligent to pursue the growth and development of the divine life and divine nature for a rich entrance into the eternal kingdom.

DISTINCTIVELY DEAVER. Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs return to New York City to confront a killer terrorizing couples at their happiest--and most vulnerable. In the early hours of a quiet, weekend morning in Manhattan's Diamond District, a brutal triple murder shocks the city. Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs quickly take the case. Curiously, the killer has left behind a half-million dollars' worth of gems at the murder scene, a jewelry store on 47th street. As more crimes follow, it becomes clear that the killer's target is not gems, but engaged couples themselves. The Promisor vows to take the lives of men and women during their most precious moments--midway through the purchase of an engagement ring, after a meeting with a wedding planner, trying on the perfect gown for a day that will never come. The Promisor arrives silently, armed with knife or gun, and a time of bliss is transformed, in an instant, to one of horror. Soon the Promiser makes a dangerous mistake: leaving behind an innocent witness, Vimal Lahori, a talented young diamond cutter, who can help Rhyme and Sachs blow the lid off the case. They must track down Vimal before the killer can correct his fatal error. Then disaster strikes, threatening to tear apart the very fabric of the city--and providing the perfect cover for the killer to slip through the cracks.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1AYyDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Manwatching A Field Guide to Human Behavior","description":"A catalogue of human actions, postures, gestures, facial expressions, clothing, and adornments includes explanations of their underlying causes and meanings","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lGHIJAAACAAJ&dq=Manwatching+A+Field+Guide+to+Human+Behavior&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sacajawea,: A guide and interpreter of the Lewis & Clark expedition, with an account of the travels of Toussaint Charbonneau, and of Jean Baptiste, the expedition papoose","description":"This remarkable study rescues from undeserved obscurity the name and reputation of Sacajawea   a true Native American heroine.

Though Stalin spared the life of Boris Pasternak whose novel-in-progress, Doctor Zhivago, was suspected of being anti-Soviet he persecuted Boris s mistress, typist, and literary muse, Olga Ivinskaya. Boris s affair with Olga devastated the straitlaced Pasternaks, and they were keen to disavow Olga s role in Boris s writing process. Twice Olga was sentenced to work in Siberian labor camps, where she was interrogated about the book Boris was writing, but she refused to betray the man she loved. When Olga was released from the gulags, she assumed that Boris would leave his wife for her but, trapped by his family s expectations and his own weak will, he never did. Drawing on previously neglected family sources and original interviews, Anna Pasternak explores this hidden act of moral compromise by her great-uncle, and restores to history the passionate affair that inspired and animated Doctor Zhivago. Devastated that Olga suffered on his behalf and frustrated that he could not match her loyalty to him, Boris instead channeled his thwarted passion for Olga into the love story in Doctor Zhivago. Filled with the rich detail of Boris s secret life, Lara unearths a moving love story of courage, loyalty, suffering, drama, and loss, and casts a new light on the legacy of Doctor Zhivago.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7RUZDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Collected Works of G.K.

The economic ground is shifting beneath our feet. The world is becoming more volatile, and people are understandably worried about their financial futures. In this urgent and accessible guide to the crises and opportunities that lie ahead, economist and former Governor of the Bank of Canada Stephen Poloz maps out the powerful tectonic forces that are shaping our future, and the ideas that will allow us to master them. These forces include an aging workforce, mounting debt, and rising income inequality. Technological advances, too, are adding to the pressure, putting people out of work, and climate change is forcing a transition to a lower-carbon economy. It is no surprise that people are feeling uncertain. The implications of these tectonic tensions will cascade throughout every dimension of our lives the job market, the housing market, the investment climate, as well as government and central bank policy, and the role of the corporation within society. The pandemic has added momentum to many of them. Poloz skillfully argues that past crises, from the Victorian Depression in the late 1800s to the more recent downturn in 2008, give a hint of what is in store for us in the decades ahead. Unlike the purely destructive power of earthquakes, the upheaval that is sure to come in the decades ahead will offer unexpected opportunities for renewal and growth. Filled with takeaways for employers, investors, and policymakers, as well as families discussing jobs and mortgage renewals around the kitchen table, The Next Age of Uncertainty is an indispensable guide for those navigating the fault lines of the risky world ahead.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ieczEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Big Book of Self-Reliant Living: Advice and Information on Just About Everything You Need to Know to Live on Planet Earth","description":"A giant compendium of advice on how to live off the grid and by one's own means covers a dizzying array of topics, from how to build a greenhouse and stock a shelter in anticipation of a nuclear attack to administering emergency first aid and hunting in the wild.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e2MrvgAACAAJ&dq=The+Big+Book+of+Self-Reliant+Living:+Advice+and+Information+on+Just+About+Everything+You+Need+to+Know+to+Live+on+Planet+Earth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Biker's Girl on the Run","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AEEsAAAACAAJ&dq=Biker%27s+Girl+on+the+Run&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AAA Spiral Guide to Vancouver & the Canadian Rockies (AAA Spiral Guides)","description":"An innovative series of pocket-size travel guides featuring lay-flat spiral bindings and full-color illustrations provides valuable information on a wide range of popular travel destinations, including recommendations for restaurants and lodging, locator maps, attractions and landmarks, shopping tips, and more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=__KXAAAACAAJ&dq=AAA+Spiral+Guide+to+Vancouver&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Great Day in Cooperstown: The Miraculous and Unlikely Beginning of the Baseball Hall of Fame","description":"A history of baseball's first century, told through the story of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and set against a backdrop of the museum's inaugural ceremony in 1939, explains how the Hall of Fame was partially created in an attempt to revive the Depression-era economy, shares the story of the fictitious Abner Doubleday, and more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rqA_F52saboC&dq=A+Great+Day+in+Cooperstown:+The+Miraculous+and+Unlikely+Beginning+of+the+Baseball+Hall+of+Fame&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Problem-Based Learning for Math and Science: Integrating Inquiry and the Internet","description":"Illustrates how to strengthen learners' problem-solving skills by incorporating problem-based learning (PBL) with Internet resources and presents projects that correlate to national science, mathematics, and technology standards.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gnX750EfDKUC&dq=Problem-Based+Learning+for+Math+and+Science:+Integrating+Inquiry+and+the+Internet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"And the Winner Is...: Using Awards Programs to Promote Your Company and Encourage Your Employees First Edition","description":"In this book, Leverence shows you how to use existing awards programs to your advantage.

Erik Larson Devotion tells the inspirational story of the U.S. Navy s most famous aviation duo, Lieutenant Tom Hudner and Ensign Jesse Brown, and the Marines they fought to defend. A white New Englander from the country-club scene, Tom passed up Harvard to fly fighters for his country. An African American sharecropper s son from Mississippi, Jesse became the navy s first Black carrier pilot, defending a nation that wouldn t even serve him in a bar. While much of America remained divided by segregation, Jesse and Tom joined forces as wingmen in Fighter Squadron 32. Adam Makos takes us into the cockpit as these bold young aviators cut their teeth at the world s most dangerous job landing on the deck of an aircraft carrier a line of work that Jesse s young wife, Daisy, struggles to accept. Deployed to the Mediterranean, Tom and Jesse meet the Fleet Marines, boys like PFC  Red  Parkinson, a farm kid from the Catskills. In between war games in the sun, the young men revel on the Riviera, partying with millionaires and even befriending the Hollywood starlet Elizabeth Taylor. Then comes the conflict that no one expected: the Korean War. Devotion takes us soaring overhead with Tom and Jesse, and into the foxholes with Red and the Marines as they battle a North Korean invasion. As the fury of the fighting escalates and the Marines are cornered at the Chosin Reservoir, Tom and Jesse fly, guns blazing, to try and save them. When one of the duo is shot down behind enemy lines and pinned in his burning plane, the other faces an unthinkable choice: watch his friend die or attempt history s most audacious one-man rescue mission.

A Russian dissident, formerly an employee of the KGB and its successor, the FSB, had seemingly been poisoned in a London hotel. As Alexander Litvinenko's condition worsened, however, and he was transferred to hospital and placed under armed guard, the story took a sinister turn. On 23 November 2006, Litvinenko died, apparently from polonium-210 radiation poisoning. He himself, in a dramatic statement from his deathbed, accused his former employers at the Kremlin of being responsible for his murder. Who was Alexander Litvinenko? What had happened in Russia since the end of the Cold War to make his life there untenable, and even in severe jeopardy in Britain? How did he really die, and who killed him? In his spokesman and close friend, Alex Goldfarb, and widow Marina, we have two people who know more than anyone about the real Sasha Litvinenko, and about his murder.

With Pragmatism offering the allure of potentially resolving the impasse between epistemological realists and antirealists, analytic and continental philosophers, as well as thinkers across the disciplines, have been energized and engaged by this movement. In Beyond Realism and Antirealism: John Dewey and the Neopragmatists, David L. Hildebrand asks two important questions: first, how faithful are the Neopragmatists' reformulations of Classical Pragmatism (particularly Deweyan Pragmatism)? Second, and more significantly, can their Neopragmatisms work? In assessing Neopragmatism, Hildebrand advances a number of historical and critical points: ? Current debates between realists and antirealists (as well as objectivists and relativists) are similar to early twentieth-century debates between realists and idealists that Pragmatism addressed extensively. ? Despite their debts to Dewey, the Neopragmatists are reenacting realist and idealist stands in their debate over realism, thus giving life to something shown fruitless by earlier Pragmatists. ? What is absent from the Neopragmatist's position is precisely what makes Pragmatism enduring: namely, its metaphysical conception of experience and a practical starting point for philosophical inquiry that such experience dictates. ? Pragmatism cannot take the \\"linguistic turn\\" insofar as that turn mandates a theoretical starting point. ? While Pragmatism's view of truth is perspectival, it is nevertheless not a relativism. ? Pace Rorty, Pragmatism need not be hostile to metaphysics; indeed, it demonstrates how pragmatic instrumentalism and metaphysics are complementary. In examining these and other difficulties in Neopragmatism, Hildebrand is able to propose some distinct directions for Pragmatism. Beyond Realism and Antirealism will provoke specialists and non-specialists alike to rethink not only the definition of Pragmatism, but its very purpose.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nbspEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"100 Ways to Build Self-Esteem and Teach Values (Loomans, Diane)","description":"Mother-and-daughter team Diana and Julia Loomans offer 100 creative ideas, techniques, and processes for making day-to-day family interactions easier and more joyful.
