Indeed, the belief that more guns in private hands means higher rates of armed crime underlies most modern gun control legislation. But are these assumptions valid? Investigating the complex and controversial issue of the real relationship between guns and violence, Joyce Lee Malcolm presents an incisive, thoroughly researched historical study of England, whose strict gun laws and low rates of violent crime are often cited as proof that gun control works. To place the private ownership of guns in context, Malcolm offers a wide-ranging examination of English society from the Middle Ages to the late twentieth century, analyzing changing attitudes toward crime and punishment, the impact of war, economic shifts, and contrasting legal codes on violence. She looks at the level of armed crime in England before its modern restrictive gun legislation, the limitations that gun laws have imposed, and whether those measures have succeeded in reducing the rate of armed crime. Malcolm also offers a revealing comparison of the experience in England experience with that in the modern United States. Today Americans own some 200 million guns and have seen eight consecutive years of declining violence, while the English--prohibited from carrying weapons and limited in their right to self-defense have suffered a dramatic increase in rates of violent crime. This timely and thought-provoking book takes a crucial step in illuminating the actual relationship between guns and violence in modern society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ddaDbEIwiCUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Essential Pug","description":"Pugs have a very long and rich history, but their most enduring legacy has always been their cheerful temperament and social personality.

An Attempt to Lay a Foundation for the Study of Society and History.","description":"For some two centuries, scholars have wrestled with questions regarding the nature and logic of history as a discipline and, more broadly, with the entire complex of the \\"human sciences, \\" with include theology, philosophy, history, literature, the fine arts, and languages. The fundamental issue is whether the human sciences are a special class of studies with a specifically distinct object and method or whether they must be subsumed under the natural sciences. German philosopher Wilhelm Dilthey dedicated the bulk of his long career to there and related questions. His Introduction to the Human Sciences is a pioneering effort to elaborate a general theory of the human sciences, especially history, and to distinguish these sciences radically from the field of natural sciences. Though the Introduction was never completed, it remains one of the major statements of the topic. Together with other works by Dilthey, it has had a substantial influence on the recognition and human sciences as a fundamental division of human knowledge and on their separation from the natural sciences in origin, nature, and method. As a contribution to the issue of the methodologies of the humanities and social sciences, the Introduction rightly claims a place. This is the first time the entire work is available in English. In his introductory essay, translator Ramon J. Betanzos surveys Dilthey's life and thought and hails his efforts to create a foundational science for the particular human sciences, and at the same time, takes serious issue with Dilthey's historical/critical evaluation of metaphysics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EkFkvhHTugEC&dq=Introduction+to+the+Human+Sciences.+An+Attempt+to+Lay+a+Foundation+for+the+Study+of+Society+and+History.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Champagne for one: A Nero Wolfe mystery","description":"Faith Usher had a decidedly morbid personality.

Premodern hospitals, according to many scholars, existed mainly as refuges for the desperately poor and sick, providing patients with little or no medical care. Challenging this view in a compelling survey of hospitals in the East Roman Empire, Timothy Miller traces the birth and development of Byzantine xenones, or hospitals, from their emergence in the fourth century to their decline in the fifteenth century, just prior to the Turkish conquest of Constantinople. These sophisticated medical facilities, he concludes, are the true ancestors of modern hospitals. In a new introduction to this paperback edition, Miller describes the growing scholarship on this subject in recent years.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_FJrAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Birth+of+the+Hospital+in+the+Byzantine+Empire+(Supplement+to+the+Bulletin+of+the+History+of+Medicine)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My First Missal","description":"Kids and parents will love this handy-sized Mass book.

When the eminent neuropsychologist, Lawrence Weiskrantz first coined the term 'blindsight' to describe a condition whereby a patient could demonstrate that they were aware of some object, yet insist that they were completely unaware of its existence, the response from some in the scientific community was one of extreme skepticism. Even now, there are those who question the existence of unconscious (implicit) learning, and the topic remains one of the most actively researched and debated in psychology. In recent years evidence for unconscious processing across a range of sensory modalities have come from studies of vision, audition, memory, emotion, and action. Never before have these studies of unconscious processing in the different senses been brought together into a single volume. In a book dedicated to Lawrence Weiskrantz, some of the leading psychologists and cognitive neuroscientists of the day explain what we know about unconscious processing in the different senses. Including contributions from, amongst others, David Milner, Jon Driver, Alan Cowey, and Ray Dolan, the book presents a state of the art account of what we now know about 'the unconscious'. The book will provide a fascinating account for students and researchers in psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and philosophy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rpNlQgAACAAJ&dq=Out+of+Mind:+Varieties+of+Unconscious+Processes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"For Goodness Taste","description":"This elegant book has more than 400 recipes, planned menus, and entertainment ideas for the novice as well as the gourmet cook.

She shares her knowledge in her popular workshops and now in this book. Cohen, who has suffered from rheumatoid arthritis for eighteen years, was hobbling painfully to her local Zen center one day, when she made a discovery that changed her life: if she focused on the foot that was in the air rather than the one that was hitting the pavement, her stamina increased enormously. It was the beginning of a completely different approach to the crippling pain that had beset her for so long. As she demonstrates here, this approach can be expanded to all types of pain: physical, psychological, and spiritual. Cohen a certified massage and movement therapist and Zen teacher proposes a radically liberating alternative to the usual desperate search for pain relief: paradoxically, she says, release from suffering lies in paying closer attention to it. When we keep pain at bay, we keep pleasure at bay, too. The two are interdependent, and our ability to experience each is totally dependent on our understanding of the other. \\"Enrich your life exponentially,\\" Cohen advises. If your pain is one of the ten things you are aware of, then it constitutes a tenth of your total awareness. Expand your awareness to a hundred things, however, and your pain is only a hundredth of your awareness. With stories, strategies, exercises, and an awareness born of long Zen practice, Cohen shows us how to tap into that enrichment and how we can lead a satisfying and even joyful life in the very midst of pain.

For more than eighty years, people have wondered how it came to be there and at the story it could tell. Under Pressure: The Final Voyage of Submarine S-Five is that story. On Monday, August 30, 1920, the S-Five, the newest member of the U.S. Navy's fleet of submarines, departs Boston on her first cruise -- to Baltimore for a recruiting appearance at the end of the week. Two days later, as part of a routine test of the submarine's ability to crash dive, her crew's failure to close a faulty valve sends seventy-five tons of seawater blasting in. Before the valve can be jury-rigged shut, the S-Five sits precariously on the ocean floor under 180 feet of water. Her electrical system is shut down, her radio too weak to transmit, and one drive motor is inoperable -- and, because of a last-minute course change, the sub has gone down in a part of the Atlantic deliberately selected because it is well outside any regularly trafficked sea lanes. Rescue by a passing ship is virtually impossible. No one expects them in Baltimore for another two days. And forty hours worth of air is all they have left. The S-Fives are on their own. Her captain, Lieutenant Commander Charles M. \\"Savvy\\" Cooke Jr., tries to pump the seawater out, but each of three pumping systems fails in succession. The salt in the seawater combines with the sulfuric acid in the sub's batteries to create a cloud of chlorine gas. They have little air, no water, and only the dimmest of light by which to plan their escape. By shifting the water in the sub toward the bow torpedo room, Cooke is able to stand the 240-foot-long sub on its nose, bringing it close to vertical, and, using trigonometry, he calculates that at least part of the boat's stern is now above sea level. In a race against time -- will the crew die of asphyxiation before chlorine gas poisoning? -- Cooke assembles his crew into three-man teams charged with cutting a hole out of the highest point in the sub: the telephone-booth-size tiller room. With no acetylene torch, no power tools -- nothing but ratchet drills and hacksaws -- the crew must cut through nearly an inch of strengthened steel or die in the attempt. Under Pressure is the story of the thirty-six-hour-long ordeal of the crew of the S-Five. It is a story of the courage, endurance, and incredible resourcefulness of the entire forty-man crew: of Charlie Grisham, the sub's executive officer, a \\"mustang\\" promoted to the navy's officer corps from the enlisted ranks; of Chief Electrician Ramon Otto, whose baby daughter was born just days before the S-Five's departure; of Machinist's Mate Fred Whitehead, who at the last minute is able to dog the all-important watertight hatches shut; of Chief of the Boat Percy Fox, who redeems himself for the failure to close the induction valve that sank the S-Five; and of the sub's indomitable captain, Savvy Cooke, leading his crew through sheer force of will. An incredible drama, a story of heroism and of heroes, Under Pressure is that most remarkable of books, a true story far more dramatic than any fiction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NQfuM1MCsUgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Puppies, Dogs, and Blue Northers","description":"Minnesota author and dog musher Gary Paulsen reflects on the growth of his sled dogs as he and his animals discover the world around them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=maQ-9BvBUUYC&dq=Puppies,+Dogs,+and+Blue+Northers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"\\"I Liked Your Profile\\": Experiences in Gay Online Dating","description":"After the demise of his relationship, which lasted more than a decade, one man began a four year online journey in an attempt to meet a decent, relationship oriented man. \\"I Liked Your Profile\\" - Experiences in Gay Online Dating is a brutally honest look into online dating, exposing a number of patterns and behaviors to be aware of when corresponding with people online.

His research comes from more than twenty years of working with families from two highly successful independent secondary schools for boys that he helped establish, The Heights School in Washington D.C., and Northridge Preparatory School in Chicago. As headmaster, he made it his business to know hundreds of families intimately studying their family lives, watching their children grow into maturity, very often successfully, but sometimes not. Through countless conversations with fathers and mothers, he tried to account for the differences, looking for patterns of family life among those parents who triumphed with their children. What did these successful men and women have in common? What did they manage to do right? Most important: what could other parents learn from their experience? This wisdom of fatherhood is what this book is all about. It explains the main obstacles in today's society that undercut a father's teaching role, and tells men what they could do to overcome them. Then within this framework, James Stenson spells out how successful fathers deal with their children in the more crucial areas: family rules, discipline, schooling, sports, recreation, the media, and ongoing teamwork with one's wife. In short, this book provides the guidance that will help any father to carry out a serious responsibility - that of protector of his family.

Both men and women, and even priests played the game despite the Catholic Church's repeated prohibitions. Characters in countless romances, chansons de geste, and moral tales of the eleventh through twelfth centuries also played chess, which often symbolized romantic attraction or sexual consummation. In Power Play, Jenny Adams looks to medieval literary representations to ask what they can tell us both about the ways the game changed as it was naturalized in the West and about the society these changes reflected. In its Western form, chess featured a queen rather than a counselor, a judge or bishop rather than an elephant, a knight rather than a horse; in some manifestations, even the pawns were differentiated into artisans, farmers, and tradespeople with discrete identities. Power Play is the first book to ask why chess became so popular so quickly, why its pieces were altered, and what the consequences of these changes were. More than pleasure was at stake, Adams contends. As allegorists and political theorists connected the moves of the pieces to their real-life counterparts, chess took on important symbolic power. For these writers and others, the game provided a means to figure both human interactions and institutions, to envision a civic order not necessarily dominated by a king, and to imagine a society whose members acted in concert, bound together by contractual and economic ties. The pieces on the chessboard were more than subjects; they were individuals, playing by the rules.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k-_SBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lippincott's Critical Care Drug Guide","description":"Large type and uncluttered design provide quick access to pertinent information immediately.

It was a letter that took some thirty days, and ran to thirty-seven typewritten pages. In these pages, Robert H. W. Welch, Jr., set forth brilliantly and convincingly a straightforward clarification of some important recent history in Asia. At the same time he poured into paragraph after paragraph his indignation at the stupidity and suspicions of treason revealed by this history, and his alarm at the continuing course of events. This book is his letter, now published only after his friends had distributed several thousand mimeographed copies. Robert H. W. Welch, Jr., gives here the historical background of events which culminated in the dismissal of General MacArthur. Using on the public information available to him, he goes back twenty-five years to the first Communist uprising in China, Step by step he traces the blunders, betrayals, and deceptions which formed the United States foreign policy, the policy which led to sweeping Communist victories in China. As a concise, thorough summary of these events this book is invaluable. The final part of the book is a short biographical sketch of Chiang Kai-Shek (1887-1975), leader of the Republic of China between 1928-1975, first in mainland China until 1949 and then in Taiwan until his death.  Your treatise is just the kind of concise exposition of a whole picture which, as a publisher, I was constantly seeking and so seldom found. It presents for the first time in brief compass, with convincing honesty, crucial and appalling facts of a foreign policy that has led from one Communist victory to another; a foreign policy that, in spite of all revelations of stupidities and betrayals, has not been corrected and is still heading in the same direction. If your small book is read widely enough it can have far-reaching results.  W. T.

In this gripping novel of alternate history, he doesn t just come close he succeeds. But he could never have imagined the terrible consequences that would follow from this act of heroism. Hermann G?ring, masterful political strategist, assumes the Chancellery and quickly signs a non-aggression treaty with the isolationist president Joseph Kennedy that will keep America out of the war that is about to engulf Europe. G?ring rushes the German scientific community into developing the atomic bomb, and in August 1944, this devastating new weapon is tested on the English capital. London lies in ruins. The war is over, fascism prevails in Europe, and Canada, the Commonwealth holdout in the Americas, suffers on as a client state of the Soviet Union. Georg Elser, blinded in the A-bombing of London, is shipped to Canada and quarantined in a hospice near Toronto called Mercy House. Here we meet William Teufel, a German-Canadian boy who in the summer of 1960 devises a plan that he hopes will distance himself from his German heritage and, unwittingly, brings him face to face with the man whose astonishing act of heroism twenty-one years earlier set the world on its terrifying new path. In this page-turning narrative, Bock has created an utterly compelling and original novel of historical speculation in the vein of Philip Roth s The Plot Against America, John Wyndham s The Chrysalids and Philip K.

A week later, Lee surrendered. Two weeks later, Lincoln was dead. In this meditation on that battle, Alexander juxtaposes the story of the battle, which he tells through narrative, letters, and journal entries, with his own impressions, viewing the South through Northern eyes. In addition, he views contemporary American society through the story of the Civil War and specifically through the story of Five Forks. If it is true that we meet our past coming to us out of the future, then, Alexander posits, America is still grappling with issues unresolved by the Civil War. Those issues are not just the obvious ones of race and class, or of North vs. South, but also the more ephemeral issues surrounding the mythos Americans live by. Alexander is not a historian, and this is much more a literary work than a battle story. However, the immediacy with which Alexander tells his tale leads the reader to experience Five Forks the land, the smells, the cries as if present there in 1865. Thus, he does not just describe a battle; he captures the spirit of all battles, all wars.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6m9dBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mathematical Adventures for Students and Amateurs (Spectrum)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JMH2DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chief Joseph Country: Land of the Nez Perce","description":"From their meeting with Lewis and Clark in 1805 to the death of Chief Joseph in 1904, the story of the Nez Perce Indians is epic drama.

We live in a society where kids and parents are obsessed with early achievement, from getting perfect scores on SATs to getting into Ivy League colleges to landing an amazing job at Google or Facebook--or even better, creating a startup with the potential to be the next Google or Facebook or Uber. We see software coders becoming millionaires or even billionaires before age 30 and feel we are failing if we are not one of them. But there is good news. A lot of us--most of us--do not explode out of the gates in life. That was true for author Rich Karlgaard, who had a mediocre academic career at Stanford (which he got into by a fluke), and after graduating, worked as a dishwasher, nightwatchman, and typing temp before finally finding the inner motivation and drive that ultimately led him to start up a high-tech magazine in Silicon Valley, and eventually to become the publisher of Forbes magazine. There is a scientific explanation for why so many of us bloom later in life. The executive function of our brains doesn't mature until age 25--and later for some. In fact our brain's capabilities peak at different ages. We actually enjoy multiple periods of blooming in our lives. Based on several years of research, personal experience, and interviews with neuroscientists and psychologists, and countless people at different stages of their careers, Bloom reveals how and when we achieve full potential--and why an algorithmic acuity in math is such an anomaly in terms of career success.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U-8kEAAAQBAJ&dq=Late+Bloomer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vertebrate History","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gENFAQAAIAAJ&dq=Vertebrate+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Before Stalingrad","description":"Operation Barbarossa as this campaign is famously called was arguably the greatest land campaign mankind has ever fought.

Teaches beginners how to read and interpret Vedic astrology charts, based on their own birth chart as well as the birth charts of 112 notable people. ? Shows how to use Vedic astrology to anticipate upcoming events and direct the cosmic energies of one's life toward a positive future outcome. For over 5,000 years the people of India have used jyotish, or Vedic astrology, to anticipate future influences and make major decisions. Now Andrew Bloomfield brings this increasingly popular tool to the West in an easy-to-follow, comprehensive format, providing the reader with everything needed to practice the Indian art of predicting the future. Vedic astrology was codified by the ancient Maharishis to help people achieve the four basic goals of human existence: kama (desire), artha (wealth), dharma (life purpose), and moksha (spiritual growth). Unlike other forms of astrology, Vedic calculations focus more on the primal, unconscious, driving forces linking our thoughts and actions. How to Practice Vedic Astrology shows how to make accurate predictions on when to expect life's changes concerning one's career, love life, children, or spirituality.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jFsoDwAAQBAJ&dq=How+to+Practice+Vedic+Astrology:+A+Beginner%27s+Guide+to+Casting+Your+Horoscope+and+Predicting+Your+Future&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Last Place : A Novel","description":"In hot legal water and court-ordered therapy private investigator Tess Monaghan accepts an assignment with a local nonprofit organization to review police documents for inconsistencies and investigative blunders surrounding five unsolved Baltimore homicides.

But curiosity is soon pulling Tess off the paper trail and into dangerously unfamiliar territory, as she joins forces with a police officer obsessed with bringing a murderer down. Scant leads and intuitions are pointing the disgraced p.i. toward the most remote corners of Maryland, where a psychopath can hide as easily in the fabric of a tiny fishing community as in the alleys and shadows of Charm City.

Astonishingly unlike the New Testament as it has been handed down to us today, this remarkable new translation makes the story come alive as never before. Impelled by the latest archaeological and historical discoveries, eminent scholar Hugh J. Schonfield has returned the New Testament to its own time and place, relating its documents to contemporary literature, customs and beliefs. The first truly historical translation with no theological motivation or devotional purpose, The Original New Testament rediscovers the force and urgency of the original message. Dr. Schonfield systematically corrects mistakes in translation that have been compounded over time, and eradicates later theological developments that he believes were falsely ascribed to the original writers. Here is a work at once passionate in dedication and scholarly in execution. The fresh and very readable translation of The Original New Testament suggests to both Jews and Christians that they have missed something in the story of Jesus of Nazareth. In a very real sense, it re-emphasises the \\"Jewishness\\" of the New Testament. And to those of both faiths, it offers new opportunities for understanding and applying the Bible's message. Included are full historical and explanatory notes making this a vivid and inspiring translation which will also support the student of bible studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FnjAjwEACAAJ&dq=The+Original+New+Testament:+A+Radical+Translation+and+Reinterpretation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The architecture of Michelangelo: Catalogue (Studies in architecture)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9RzyzgEACAAJ&dq=The+architecture+of+Michelangelo:+Catalogue+(Studies+in+architecture)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The First Industrial Woman","description":"Why study women and the industrial revolution? Deborah Valenze's groundbreaking reassessment of this classic problem in European history reminds us that questions of gender and work are at the center of our experience in the modern world. Too often, the study of industrialization charts an inevitable and largely technological course. Valenze sets aside this approach in order to examine the underlying assumptions about gender and work that informed the transformation of English society, and in turn, our ideas about economic progress. How did England change from an agriculturally based nation, in which female labor played an active and acknowledged part, to an industrial power resting on a notion of male productivity? Through selective treatments of agriculture, spinning, and cottage industries, Valenze shows how the rise of values of productivity and rationality subordinated women of the working class and strengthened an emerging ethos of individualism. She also analyzes the influential ideas of Thomas Malthus, Hannah More, and other authors, whose publications reinforced these same tendencies in the early nineteenth century. In an elegant and compelling account, Valenze charts the birth of a new economic order resting on social and sexual hierarchies which remain a part of our contemporary lives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Spm6wAEACAAJ&dq=The+First+Industrial+Woman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Subculture","description":"First Published in 2002.

Once they arrive, Torie finds out that her aunt's invitation was not so innocent: Sissy has uncovered a 150-year-old diary in the attic of her home and is dying to find out who wrote it and where it came from. Certain she won't be able to find anything, Torie reluctantly dives in. She is immediately riveted by the author's story; a young Swedish woman living with her family in 1850s rural Minnesota, she had fallen in love with a man she couldn't have.

Whether you consider yourself a fan of popular media or whether you find yourself thinking of a particular fictional scene for inspiration, you are not alone. Though some assume that interest in a fictional world is a sign of psychological trouble, the authors enthusiastically disagree. Because story worlds are simulations of our social world, we use them to make sense of our experiences and even decide what kind of people we want to be. This makes fiction far from trivial. By exploring our relationship with fictional stories and characters, the authors will examine how we create mental models in our minds so we can understand stories and characters and how we differentiate between the identities of characters and the actors who play them. What story arcs, such as the hero's journey, are we drawn to again and again? How do the moments that strike us as important in a story change as we age and move through different stages in our life? Delving into these questions and many more, the authors conclude that being a fan is not just healthy, it's human.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PTTNDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Vintage Book of African American Poetry","description":"In The Vintage Book of African American Poetry, editors Michael S.

It is divided into three sections which address: the most influential theoretical traditions that have emerged from the legacy of the twentieth century the most important new and emerging frameworks of analysis today the major theoretical problems in recent social and political theory. The Routledge International Handbook of Contemporary Social and Political Theory encompasses the most up-to-date developments in contemporary social and political theory, and as such is an essential research tool for both undergraduate and postgraduate students, as well as researchers, working in the fields of political theory, social and political philosophy, contemporary social theory, and cultural theory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JHIHTHeJHucC&dq=Contemporary+Social+and+Political+Theory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Star Wars: Darkness","description":"From his first appearance as a mind-wiped amnesiac to his triumphant passage to the rank of Jedi Master, few Jedi had more brushes with the powers of the dark side and the evil of the underworld than Quinlan Vos.

It also continues to emphasize six basic editorial principles: Be lean but not mean, cases edited ruthlessly to produce a readable and concise result. Facts matter, so they are included in all their potential ambiguity. Bring a planner's perspective to the table through extensive use of transactionally-oriented problems. It's a casebook not a treatise. No long, stultifying textual passages. Provide the cases and let the individual teacher use them as he or she sees fit. Try to find cases that are fun to teach. Great facts or a clever analysis are always given first priority in case selection. Provide a teachers' manual that goes into great depth, with analysis of every case and, whenever applicable, offering the disparate views of each author. An exhaustive teachers' manual extensively discusses every case and provides answers to every question in the text. One feature that many adopters find especially helpful is that all three editors give their own approach to the cases, showing the different ways in which the same case can be taught.

It is not a comforting book but a book about disturbing and dangerous trends. The Quest for Cosmic Justice shows how confused conceptions of justice end up promoting injustice, how confused conceptions of equality end up promoting inequality, and how the tyranny of social visions prevents many people from confronting the actual consequences of their own beliefs and policies. Those consequences include the steady and dangerous erosion of fundamental principles of freedom -- amounting to a quiet repeal of the American revolution. The Quest for Cosmic Justice is the summation of a lifetime of study and thought about where we as a society are headed -- and why we need to change course before we do irretrievable damage.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5eU2KN9ChnEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ghost that Came Alive","description":"Mystery.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=frpGPwAACAAJ&dq=The+Ghost+that+Came+Alive&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"LADY KILLER","description":"Josie Schuller   uma esposa dedicada, uma m?e amorosa e... uma assassina de aluguel.

An intensification of this effort of man to attain a knowledge of the truth is one of the most salient features of the nineteenth century.

Warwick Anderson describes how American colonizers sought to maintain their own health and stamina in a foreign environment while exerting control over and  civilizing  a population of seven million people spread out over seven thousand islands. In the process, he traces a significant transformation in the thinking of colonial doctors and scientists about what was most threatening to the health of white colonists. During the late nineteenth century, they understood the tropical environment as the greatest danger, and they sought to help their fellow colonizers to acclimate. Later, as their attention shifted to the role of microbial pathogens, colonial scientists came to view the Filipino people as a contaminated race, and they launched public health initiatives to reform Filipinos  personal hygiene practices and social conduct. A vivid sense of a colonial culture characterized by an anxious and assertive white masculinity emerges from Anderson s description of American efforts to treat and discipline allegedly errant Filipinos. His narrative encompasses a colonial obsession with native excrement, a leper colony intended to transform those considered most unclean and least socialized, and the hookworm and malaria programs implemented by the Rockefeller Foundation in the 1920s and 1930s. Throughout, Anderson is attentive to the circulation of intertwined ideas about race, science, and medicine. He points to colonial public health in the Philippines as a key influence on the subsequent development of military medicine and industrial hygiene, U.S. urban health services, and racialized development regimes in other parts of the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=D_W1rXfhi-IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How To Be A Happy Parent","description":"An encouraging guide to helping parents find more happiness in their day-to-day family life, from the former lead editor of the New York Times' Motherlode blog and author of the Reese Witherspoon Book Club pick, The Chicken Sisters In all the writing and reporting KJ Dell'Antonia has done on families over the years, one topic keeps coming up again and again: parents crave a greater sense of happiness in their daily lives. In this optimistic, solution-packed book, KJ asks: How can we change our family life so that it is full of the joy we'd always hoped for?

That s the only option left for Reich, whose company is losing a 10-year death struggle with rival D Courtney Enterprises. Terrorized in his dreams by The Man With No Face and driven to the edge after D Courtney refuses a merger offer, Reich murders his rival and bribes a high-ranking telepath to help him cover his tracks. But while police prefect Lincoln Powell knows Reich is guilty, his telepath's knowledge is a far cry from admissible evidence. Alfred Bester was among the first important authors of contemporary science fiction. His passionate novels of worldly adventure, high intellect, and tremendous verve, The Stars My Destination and the Hugo Award winning The Demolished Man, established Bester as a s.f. grandmaster, a reputation that was ratified by the Science Fiction Writers of America shortly before his death. Bester also was an acclaimed journalist for Holiday magazine, a reviewer for the Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction and even a writer for Superman.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=89SCDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AppleScript in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference (Nutshell Handbook)","description":"Introduces AppleScript and Script Editor fundamentals while offering a core language reference and instructions for scripting Mac OS 9 and 9.1 programs as well as Mac's control panels and extensions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rW5k0w_wC3MC&dq=AppleScript+in+a+Nutshell:+A+Desktop+Quick+Reference+(Nutshell+Handbook)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Little Book Of Courage","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YVNXzQEACAAJ&dq=The+Little+Book+Of+Courage&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tiger Man","description":"Assigned to a ceremonial post in Mancreu, British consul and Afghanistan war veteran Lester Ferris is compelled to disregard widespread underworld activities while bonding with a comic-addicted youth who during a violent uprising desperately relies on him for help.

But what does love look like? Does it look the way it feels? The visual vocabulary of romance-its attendant comforts and vulnerabilities, ambivalences and unclarities-is the subject of Venus Inferred. This collection of 46 richly reproduced color photographs is Laura Letinsky's study of contemporary lovers as they are seen, as they show, and as they see themselves making love and inhabiting domestic space. Entering what might be called the intimate sphere, Letinsky's camera explores a space too personal to be termed public and yet whose cultural and emotional shape is uncannily recognizable. Over a seven-year period, Letinsky visited lovers in their homes, hotel rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, and kitchens and recorded in detail the promises, disharmonies, and disappointments that inhere in modern coupling. Accompanying the photographs is an essay by critic Lauren Berlant, which presents an aesthetic and cultural analysis of the contemporary images of romance and intimacy. Berlant contemplates the burden of clarity that sexuality bears, implicit both in conventional romantic ideals and in the \\"counterpolitics of the flesh\\" that desires to escape them. Thus arises the sublime ordinariness of Letinsky's couples, Berlant argues: \\"As 'normal' pleasures themselves become deemed modes of domination, the already destabilizing aspects of sexuality can feel even more unsettling.\\" An interview between Letinsky and Berlant unfolds the artist's intellectual formation while exploring the unsettling and pleasurable power of her images as they circulate through the domains of romance, sexuality, and contemporary culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M04xMdZKgwUC&dq=Venus+Inferred&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American: Beyond Our Grandest Notions","description":"Presents a contemporary portrait of the United States as the country enters the world arena armed with an extremely potent weapon: the collective notions Americans carry of America at its best.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FfIf26zSGWIC&dq=American:+Beyond+Our+Grandest+Notions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thurman Munson","description":"When in 2000 the Baseball Writers Association of America elected the ever-durable Carlton Fisk to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, many fans quietly pointed to the Hall's omission of Fisk' greatest American League contemporary, Thurman Munson. And when in 2001 the writers honored Kirby Puckett, the Twins star forced to retire with glaucoma after a brilliant but brief 12-year career, the same fans began to raise their voices in support of Munson, another short-timer who was once the toast of his team's hometown. In a position that requires the strapping on of hot, awkward equipment and the torturous alternation of standing and squatting, most catchers struggle to maintain electrolytes, let alone a respectable batting average. It is, in fact, a position so demanding, that men deemed good ball-handlers or pitcher confidants might hang on in the big leagues for years despite their drag on a team's offensive production. Munson, like Fisk and National Leaguer Johnny Bench, was a tough-as-nails backstop, a Gold Glove winner, and the unquestioned leader of his team. Like Bench and Fisk, too, though to a lesser degree, Munson had home run power. But the Yankee captain was in, at least one respect, an even rarer breed of catcher--one who manages despite the physical and mental demands of his position to finish each year somewhere near the .300 mark. Munson, who ranked in the top 10 among A.L. hitters five of the nine full seasons he played, was widely considered one of his generation's great clutch hitters. When the star catcher died at age 32, he was still in his prime, and it seems clear to many that on August 2, 1979, misfortune denied Munson his place in Cooperstown. Outlived by his contemporaries, who went on to post more impressive career numbers, and now overshadowed by the accomplishments of catchers from the current batter-biased era, Munson's chances for recognition grow increasingly faint. But for all the praiseworthy things he did on the field in his short career, Thurman Munson accomplished as much in between the innings and games he labored through. And it might be his influence for which he's ultimately remembered. In this work, author Chris Devine pays special attention to Munson as teammate, friend, husband, and father.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kFmzbUgSassC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A new frontier: The Peace Corps in Eastern Europe","description":"Describes the current work of Peace Corps volunteers in Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Romania","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EGNaAAAACAAJ&dq=A+new+frontier:+The+Peace+Corps+in+Eastern+Europe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Daily Rate: Classic Series 4","description":"The go-to guide to acing the Series 4 Exam!

The much-anticipated crewed mission failed to materialise, defeated by a combination of technological and political challenges. Four decades after Viking and almost half a century after Apollo technology has improved beyond recognition  as has politics. As private ventures like SpaceX seize centre stage from NASA, Mars has undergone a seismic shift  it s become the prime destination for future human expansion and colonisation.

Her inquiry into Marx s philosophy led her to a critical examination of the entire tradition of Western political thought, from its origins in Plato and Aristotle to its culmination and conclusion in Marx. The Promise of Politics tells how Arendt came to understand the failure of that tradition to account for human action. From the time that Socrates was condemned to death by his fellow citizens, Arendt finds that philosophers have followed Plato in constructing political theories at the expense of political experiences, including the pre-philosophic Greek experience of beginning, the Roman experience of founding, and the Christian experience of forgiving. It is a fascinating, subtle, and original story, which bridges Arendt s work from The Origins of Totalitarianism to The Human Condition, published in 1958. These writings, which deal with the conflict between philosophy and politics, have never before been gathered and published. The final and longer section of The Promise of Politics, titled  Introduction into Politics,  was written in German and is published here for the first time in English. This remarkable meditation on the modern prejudice against politics asks whether politics has any meaning at all anymore. Although written in the latter half of the 1950s, what Arendt says about the relation of politics to human freedom could hardly have greater relevance for our own time. When politics is considered as a means to an end that lies outside of itself, when force is used to  create  freedom, political principles vanish from the face of the earth. For Arendt, politics has no  end ; instead, it has at times beenand perhaps can be againthe never-ending endeavor of the great plurality of human beings to live together and share the earth in mutually guaranteed freedom. That is the promise of politics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=76Xh8rpdUAQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hot Sky at Midnight","description":" Intelligent and engaging science fiction  set against the backdrop of an environmental apocalypse from the SF Grand Master (The Washington Post). Not so very far in the future, the icecaps have melted and many coastal communities have been flooded out. The ozone layer is destroyed. Some areas are livable with breathing masks and injections that protect the skin from the now-deadly rays of the sun, but the only real refuge for those who can afford it has become the near-space orbital colonies built and run by private companies. Valparaiso Nuevo is one of these colonies a haven and a center of action for hustlers, conspirators, and people looking for an edge. It is also the target of a disillusioned group of humans who become embroiled in a scheme to overthrow it. Their goals are individually motivated but the deadly combination of ambition, distrust, greed, stupidity, and lust leads to a dramatic conclusion that replicates in miniature the history of man s destruction of his own living space on the planet. A bleak picture of future Earth and a complex plot peopled with dark, rich characters, comes together as one of Silverberg s finer novels.  Silverberg focuses on his characters and their ruined world, providing a convincing portrayal of life in a greenhouse effect-cursed future. . . . [He] delivers powerful images of a world blighted by ecological abuse, and a satisfying novel as well.

By addressing the significance of medical technology to the phenomenon of transsexualism, Bernice L. Hausman transforms current conceptions of transsexuality as a disorder of gender identity by showing how developments in medical knowledge and technology make possible the emergence of new subjectivities. Hausman's inquiry into the development of endocrinology and plastic surgery shows how advances in medical knowledge were central to the establishment of the material and discursive conditions necessary to produce the demand for sex change--that is, to both \\"make\\" and \\"think\\" the transsexual. She also retraces the hidden history of the concept of gender, demonstrating that the semantic distinction between \\"natural\\" sex and \\"social\\" gender has its roots in the development of medical treatment practices for intersexuality--the condition of having physical characteristics of both sexes-- in the 1950s. Her research reveals the medical institution's desire to make heterosexual subjects out of intersexuals and indicates how gender operates semiotically to maintain heterosexuality as the norm of the human body. In critically examining medical discourses, popularizations of medical theories, and transsexual autobiographies, Hausman details the elaboration of \\"gender narratives\\" that not only support the emergence of transsexualism, but also regulate the lives of all contemporary Western subjects. Changing Sex will change the ways we think about the relation between sex and gender, the body and sexual identity, and medical technology and the idea of the human.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7jYcktA6RhEC&dq=Changing+Sex:+Transsexualism,+Technology,+and+the+Idea+of+Gender&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Official Rules and Record Book: Billiard Games Pocket and Carom, 1974 Edition","description":"Contains essays concerning various sports or sports topics, from acrobatics to yachting, giving both American and international coverage","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q8NMAgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Official+Rules+and+Record+Book:+Billiard+Games+Pocket+and+Carom,+1974+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Homesick : A Memoir","description":"The coming of age story of an award-winning translator, HOMESICK is about learning to love language in its many forms, healing through words and the promises and perils of empathy and sisterhood.

Of his many works, The Belief of Catholics is his best-known book and his premiere piece of apologetics. While it deals extensively with Protestantism, its target is more the unchurched or lightly-church modern who, if he gives any thought at all to Catholicism, thinks it mildly foreign. As Knox knew, it is not the most difficult part of modern apologetics to convince the devoted Protestant that he has much of Christian truth but now needs to move on to the rest, which is found only in the Catholic Church. The most difficult part is convincing the nominal Protestant (or nominal Catholic), the vaguely religious person, or the person without any religious inclinations that God really does exist, that His existence matters, and that only knowledge of Him and obedience to Him can lead to answers to the questions that haunt everyone.

A tender tribute to the healing powers of love and music . . . Readers will be wowed.  Publishers Weekly (starred review) Concert pianist Diana is finally ready to marry her longtime fiance, Arie; she s even composing a beautiful love song for him, and finishes it while on tour. Before she can play it for him, though, tragedy strikes and Diana is lost to Arie forever. But her song might not be. In Australia, the world has gone quiet for Arie and he lives his life accordingly, struggling to cope with his loss. In Scotland, a woman named Evie is taking stock of her life after the end of another lackluster almost-relationship. Years of wandering the globe and failing to publish her poetry have taken their toll, and she might finally be ready to find what her travels have never been able to give her: a real home. And through a quirk of fate or circumstance, Diana s song is passed from musician to musician. By winding its way around the world, it just might bring these two lost souls together. With heart-wrenching emotion, The Last Love Song explores what it means to be lost, what it means to be found, and the power of music to bring people together.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8rrWDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Web of Knowledge : A Festschrift in Honor of Eugene Garfield (Asis Monograph Series)","description":"This new ASIST monograph is the first to comprehensively address the history, theory, and practical applications of citation analysis, a field which has grown from Garfield's seed of an idea, and to examine its impact on scholarly research forty years after its inception.

She was the sister of Harriet Beecher Stowe, Harriet Elisabeth Beecher Stowe ( June 14, 1811 - July 1, 1896) was an American abolitionist and author. She came from a famous religious family and is best known for her novel Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852). It depicts the harsh life for African Americans under slavery. It reached millions as a novel and play, and became influential in the United States and Great Britain. It energized anti-slavery forces in the American North, while provoking widespread anger in the South. She wrote 30 books, including novels, three travel memoirs, and collections of articles and letters. She was influential for both her writings and her public stands on social issues of the day.Harriet Elisabeth Beecher was born in Litchfield, Connecticut, on June 14, 1811.She was the seventh of 13 children born to outspoken Calvinist preacher Lyman Beecher and Roxana (Foote), a deeply religious woman who died when Stowe was only five years old. Roxana's maternal grandfather was General Andrew Ward of the Revolutionary War. Her notable siblings included a sister, Catharine Beecher, who became an educator and author, as well as brothers who became ministers: including Henry Ward Beecher, who became a famous preacher and abolitionist, Charles Beecher, and Edward Beecher.Harriet enrolled in the Hartford Female Seminary run by her older sister Catharine, where she received a traditional academic education usually reserved for males at the time with a focus in the classics, including study of languages and mathematics. Among her classmates was Sarah P. Willis, who later wrote under the pseudonym Fanny Fern.In 1832, at the age of 21, Harriet Beecher moved to Cincinnati, Ohio to join her father, who had become the president of Lane Theological Seminary. There, she also joined the Semi-Colon Club, a literary salon and social club whose members included the Beecher sisters, Caroline Lee Hentz, Salmon P. Chase (future governor of the state and Secretary of Treasury under President Lincoln), Emily Blackwell, and others.Cincinnati's trade and shipping business on the Ohio River was booming, drawing numerous migrants from different parts of the country, including many free blacks, as well as Irish immigrants who worked on the state's canals and railroads. Areas of the city had been wrecked in the Cincinnati riots of 1829, when ethnic Irish attacked blacks, trying to push competitors out of the city. Beecher met a number of African Americans who had suffered in those attacks, and their experience contributed to her later writing about slavery. Riots took place again in 1836 and 1841, driven also by native-born anti-abolitionists. It was in the literary club that she met Calvin Ellis Stowe, a widower who was a professor at the seminary. The two married on January 6, 1836.He was an ardent critic of slavery, and the Stowes supported the Underground Railroad, temporarily housing several fugitive slaves in their home. Most slaves continued north to secure freedom in Canada. The Stowes had seven children together, including twin daughters....","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MdBcDQEACAAJ&dq=The+American+Woman%27s+Home&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brand New Justice: The Upside of Global Branding","description":"Applying his observations on economic history and the development and impact of global marketing, Anholt presents in this book a cogent plan for developing nations to benefit from globalization. So long the helpless victim of capitalist trading systems, he shows that they can cross the divide and graduate from supplier nation to producer nation. Branding native produce on a global scale, making a commercial virtue out of perceived authenticity and otherness and fully capitalising on the 'last mile' benefits are key to this graduation and fundamental to forging a new global economic balance. Anholt argues with a forceful logic, but also backs his hypothesis with enticing glimpses of this process actually beginning to take place. Examining activities in India, Thailand, Russia and Africa among others, he shows the risks, challenges and pressures inherent in 'turning the tide', but above all he demonstrates the very real possibility of enlightened capitalism working as a force for good in global terms.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6AsqzgEACAAJ&dq=Brand+New+Justice:+The+Upside+of+Global+Branding&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Home Chiropractic Handbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=smwQAAAACAAJ&dq=Home+Chiropractic+Handbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Training lactate pulse rate","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k0uNswEACAAJ&dq=Training+lactate+pulse+rate&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Second Helping of Murder, A: More Diabolically Delicious Recipes from Contemporary Mystery Writers","description":"This eagerly-awaited follow-up to the Agatha and Macavity Award finalist, A Taste of Murder, features more crime and nourishment from today s foremost writers of crime fiction.

His major achievements--the New poems, the Sonnets to Orpheus, and the incomparable Duino Elegies--had a powerful impact on European literature and have been the subject of intense scrutiny and increasing acclaim since the poet's death. Only in recent years, however, with the emergence of key documentary material, has it become possible to present the full story of Rilke's life. In A Ringing Glass, Donald Prater's aim is not to add another stone to the mounting edifice of critical interpretation, but to provide a portrait of the man hmself, and to show the background in which Rilke's extraordinary vision developed. And it is an extraordinary background. Rilke's nomadic existence led him from his birthplace in Prague through Germany, Russian, Spain, Italy, France, and finally Switzerland, He visited Tolstoy at Yasnaya Polyana, acted for a time as secretary to Rodin, and was friend of Ramain Rolland, Leonid Pasternak, and Walter Rathenau. He was the protege of Princess Marie von Thurn und Taxis and the lover Lou Andreas-Salome and Baladine Klossawska (of whose son, the painter Balthus, he was an early patron). Financially and emotionally, Rilke needed these associations; yet he dedicated himself fully to his art and remained single-minded in his search for the solitude it required. In his correspondence, from which Prater draws extensively, Rilke reveals the tragic conflict between his needs as a man and his goals as a poet. \\"This above all,\\" he wrote a younger colleague, \\"ask yourself...must I write? Delve into yourself for a deep answer. And if this should be affirmative...then build your life according to this necessity.\\" With this comprehensive biography, readers can themselves delve deeply into the life Rilke built, a life as courageous and rare as the poetry it left behind. About the Author: Donald Prater is the author of European of Yesterday, a biography of Stefan Zweig, and his edition of the Rilke-Zweig correspondence will appear shortly in Germany.

Can we choose who to love? Is romantic love rational? Can we love more than one person at a time? And can we make ourselves fall out of love? In On Romantic Love, Berit Brogaard attempts to get to the bottom of love's many contradictions. This short book, informed by both historical and cutting edge philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience, combines a new theory of romantic love with entertaining anecdotes from real life and accessible explanations of the neuroscience underlying our wildest passions. Against the grain, Brogaard argues that love is an emotion; that it can be, at turns, both rational and irrational; and that it can be manifested in degrees. We can love one person more than another and we can love a person a little or a lot or not at all. And love isn't even always something we consciously feel. However, love -- like other emotions, both conscious and not -- is subject to rational control, and falling in or out of it can be a deliberate choice. This engaging and innovative look at a universal topic, featuring original line drawings by illustrator Gareth Southwell, illuminates the processes behind heartbreak, obsession, jealousy, attachment, and more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QEiPBQAAQBAJ&dq=Love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Plain English handbook","description":"A handbook of rules for English usage and grammar.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wty0zQEACAAJ&dq=Plain+English+handbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wilder Shores of Gastronomy: Twenty Years of Food Writing","description":"Presents a collection of articles from the journal \\"Petits Propos Culinaires,\\" by such writers as Elizabeth David, Claudia Roden, and Harold McGee, on a variety of food topics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_d8JngEACAAJ&dq=The+Wilder+Shores+of+Gastronomy:+Twenty+Years+of+Food+Writing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Beginning: A New Interpretation of Genesis","description":"Presents a new interpretation of the stories of Genesis, explaining how these ancient tales illuminate the human quest for meaning and the struggle between good and evil","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CCiODQAAQBAJ&dq=In+the+Beginning:+A+New+Interpretation+of+Genesis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New American Bible: Catholic Companion Edition","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aPIhnwEACAAJ&dq=The+New+American+Bible:+Catholic+Companion+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History Comes to Life: Collecting Historical Letters and Documents","description":"The book discusses the reasons why collectors acquire these tangible links to the people they admire; the material available on the market; the people who are attracted to the field; where manuscripts are to be found; the detection of forgeries; ways in which the value of documents is determined; and the care and preservation of collections.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HR3hAAAAMAAJ&dq=History+Comes+to+Life:+Collecting+Historical+Letters+and+Documents&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The far country ([Dell Books 35 cent series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MiQ0AAAAMAAJ&dq=The+far+country+(%5BDell+Books+35+cent+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The English wife","description":"\\"Brings to life old world New York City and London with all the splendor of two of my favorite novels, The Age of Innocence and The Crimson Petal and the White.

Draycos, a golden-scaled draconic K'da poet-warrior, was on a scout fleet ship when it was attacked, with him the lone survivor. Forced to find a new symbiotic humanoid host, he found Jack Morgan. Jack has been on his own, making his way by shipping interstellar cargo on the ship he's inherited from his Uncle Virgil, a con-man and thief who met with a fatal accident. Draycos has vowed to uncover those behind a vast conspiracy to wipe out his people, while Jack is determined to find out who framed him for a crime he didn't commit. Virgil, who survives as \\"Uncle Virge\\" in the ship's computer, is against their plan. But Draycos once saved Jack's life, so Jack feels an obligation to this strange creature who can slip onto the boy's skin, pressing against it like a living tattoo. Knowing that mercenaries were involved in the ambush that killed Draycos's fleet, Jack enlists in a mercenary outfit that practically enslaves adolescent recruits. But the soldier's life isn't exactly what Jack had bargained for, especially when a mysterious girl is recruited into his group.

With its cross-cultural stance, the book concerns itself with the unusual task of creating links between the symbolic representations of gender in the philosophy of Tibetan Buddhism, and contemporary western thinking in relation to identity politics and intersubjectivity. A wide range of sources are drawn upon in order to build up arguments concerning the complexities of individual gender roles in Tibetan society, alongside the symbolic spaces allocated to the male and female within its cultural forms, including its sacred institutions, its representations and in the enactment of ritual. And in the light of Tibetan Buddhisms popularity in the west, timely questions are raised concerning gender and the potential uses and abuses of power and secrecy in Tibetan Tantra, which, with its unique emphasis on guru-devotion and sexual ritual, is now being disseminated worldwide. What is made clear in this new edition, however, is that Campbell's ultimate aim is to elucidate, through the use of a psychoanalytical perspective, something of the dynamic inter-relationship between the inner lives of individuals, their gender identities in society, and the belief systems which they create in order to provide cohesion, continuity and meaning, whether it be in the east or the west.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=C8RbDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Day Before Sunrise","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GPHHAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Day+Before+Sunrise&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Condominium Concept: A Practical Guide for Officers, Owners and Directors of Florida Condominiums","description":"A practical and popular guide to operating a successful condominium association in Florida.

The saga of the Rolling Stones is the central epic in rock mythology. From their debut as the intermission band at London s Marquee Club in 1962 through their latest record setting Bridges to Babylon world tour, the Rolling Stones have defined a musical genre and experienced godlike adulation, quarrels, addiction, legal traumas, and descents into madness and death_while steadfastly refusing to fade away. Now Stephen Davis, the New York Times bestselling author of Hammer of the Gods and Walk This Way, who has followed the Stones for three decades, presents their whole story, replete with vivid details of the Stones  musical successes_and personal excesses. Born into the wartime England of air-raid sirens, bombing raids, and strict rationing, the Rolling Stones came of age in the 1950s, as American blues and pop arrived in Europe. Among London s most ardent blues fans in the early 1960s was a short blond teenage guitar player named Brian Jones, who hooked up with a lorry driver s only son, Charlie Watts, a jazz drummer. At the same time, popular and studious Michael Philip Jaggerwho, as a boy, bawled out a phonetic version of  La Bamba  with an eye-popping intensity that scared his parentsbegan sharing blues records with a primary school classmate, Keith  Ricky  Richards, a shy underachiever, whose idol was Chuck Berry. In 1962 the four young men, joined by Bill Perks (later Wyman) on bass, formed a band rhythm and blues band, which Brian Jones named the  the Rollin  Stones  in honor of the Muddy Waters blues classic. Using the biography of the Rolling Stones as a narrative spine, Old God Almost Dead builds a new, multilayered version of the Stones  story, locating the band beyond the musical world they dominated and showing how they influenced, and were influenced by, the other artistic movements of their era: the blues revival, Swinging London, the Beats, Bob Dylan s Stones-inspired shift from protest to pop, Pop Art and Andy Warhol s New York, the  Underground  politics of the 1960s, Moroccan energy and European orientalism, Jamaican reggae, the Glam and Punk subcultures, and the technologic advances of the video and digital revolution. At the same time, Old Gods Almost Dead documents the intense backstage lives of the Stones: the feuds, the drugs, the marriages, and the affairs that inspired and informed their songs; and the business of making records and putting on shows. The first new biography of the Rolling Stones since the early 1980s, Old Gods Almost Dead is the most comprehensive book to date, and one of the few to cover all the band s members. Illustrated throughout with photos of pivotal moments, it is a celebration of the Rolling Stones as an often courageous, often foolish gang of artists who not only showed us new worlds, but new ways of living in them. It is a saga as raunchily, vibrantly entertaining as the Stones themselves.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5-Nx8AUNAHIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Action!

Magnificent and bizarre, it is the story of how we got here, what we left behind, and what we brought with us. We all know about evolution, but it still seems absurd that our ancestors were fish. Darwin's idea of natural selection was the key to solving generation-to-generation evolution -- microevolution -- but it could only point us toward a complete explanation, still to come, of the engines of macroevolution, the transformation of body shapes across millions of years. Now, drawing on the latest fossil discoveries and breakthrough scientific analysis, Carl Zimmer reveals how macroevolution works. Escorting us along the trail of discovery up to the current dramatic research in paleontology, ecology, genetics, and embryology, Zimmer shows how scientists today are unveiling the secrets of life that biologists struggled with two centuries ago. In this book, you will find a dazzling, brash literary talent and a rigorous scientific sensibility gracefully brought together. Carl Zimmer provides a comprehensive, lucid, and authoritative answer to the mystery of how nature actually made itself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fxHrAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Speed Arabic: 4 One Hour Multi-Track CDs","description":"This pack consists of the Student's Book with answers with CD-ROM and Class Audio CDs.

People knew the basics: men and women had sex, and sometimes babies followed. But beyond that the origins of life were a colossal mystery. The Seeds of Life is the remarkable and rollicking story of how a series of blundering geniuses and brilliant amateurs struggled for two centuries to discover where, exactly, babies come from. Taking a page from investigative thrillers, acclaimed science writer Edward Dolnick looks to these early scientists as if they were detectives hot on the trail of a bedeviling and urgent mystery. These strange searchers included an Italian surgeon using shark teeth to prove that female reproductive organs were not 'failed' male genitalia, and a Catholic priest who designed ingenious miniature pants to prove that frogs required semen to fertilize their eggs. A witty and rousing history of science, The Seeds of Life presents our greatest scientists struggling-against their perceptions, their religious beliefs, and their deep-seated prejudices-to uncover how and where we come from.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6ki1DQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Plains of Abraham","description":"A huge, ambitious re-creation of the eighteenth century Battle of the Plains of Abraham, the pivotal battle in the Seven Years' War (1754-1763) to win control of the trans-Appalachian region of North America, a battle consisting of the British and American colonists on one side and the French and the Iroquois Confederacy on the other and that led directly to the colonial War of Independence and the creation of Canada. A stunning work of military history, by the authority on the Battle of the Plains of Abraham and curator of the Canadian War Museum. It was the culmination of a larger imperial conflict between Great Britain and France that began five years before . . . It was a battle that lasted twenty minutes and at its finish changed the course of a continent: the Generals leading the troops on either side--James Wolfe and the Marquis Louis-Joseph Montcalm--each died of gunshot wounds . . . France surrendered Quebec . . . the British soon after took control of most of North America . . . with France's defeat, Britain's maritime and colonial supremacy was assured and their hold on the thirteen American colonies tightened . . . The participation of the American Colonists in helping to oust the French as a North American power, and bearing the burden of the war's expenses, spurred the confidence of colonies such as New York, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts that soon began to agitate for independence from Great Britain. In Northern Armageddon, Peter MacLeod--using original research (diaries, journals, letters, and other personal accounts) and bringing to bear all of his knowledge and grasp of warfare and in particular the French and Indian War--tells the epic story from both sides and, for the first time, brilliantly casts this crucial battle on a human scale, from the first months of the campaign and the actual battle on the Plains of Abraham, to the French surrender and its large-scale ramifications on the shape of North America and, ultimately, Europe.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ClvQsgEACAAJ&dq=The+Plains+of+Abraham&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Potsdam to the Cold War: Big Three Diplomacy 1945 1947 (America in the Modern World) (American In Modern World)","description":"To find more information about Rowman and Littlefield titles, please visit www.rowmanlittlefield.com.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CDBnAAAAMAAJ&dq=From+Potsdam+to+the+Cold+War:+Big+Three+Diplomacy+1945+1947+(America+in+the+Modern+World)+(American+In+Modern+World)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Man's Game : Masculinity and the Anti-Aesthetics of American Literary Naturalism (Amer Lit Realism & Naturalism)","description":"Demonstrates the importance of physical pain to late-nineteenth century aesthetic sensibilities and, in particular, to American literary realism with a focus on the work of William Dean Howells, Henry James, Edith Wharton, Mark Twain, and Charles Chesnutt.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=stBGEAAAQBAJ&dq=A+Man%27s+Game+:+Masculinity+and+the+Anti-Aesthetics+of+American+Literary+Naturalism+(Amer+Lit+Realism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Exalted The Lunars","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Confederacy as a Revolutionary Experience","description":"Historian at the University of Georgia seeks causes of the breakdown of traditional patterns and way of life in the South before and during the Civil War.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jkMaAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Confederacy+as+a+Revolutionary+Experience&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"100 Miles from Baghdad","description":"This is the first personal account of a division in combat during Operation Desert Storm. It is an inside view of the French Division Daguet, which had the task of defeating a dug-in Iraqi Regular Division, taking a critical airfield and road junction, and protecting the entire left flank of the 18th Airborne Corp during the allied sweep to the left. The Daguet, made up of hard-hitting Foreign Legion and Marine units, achieved all of their objectives. General Norman Schwartzkopf described their actions as superb. This memoir tells the story of the Division Daguet and concludes that the French, like the Americans, had much to overcome--major defeats and national crises of confidence. The French had suffered defeats in Indochina (1946-1954) and Algeria (1954-1962); the U.S. had Vietnam. Both countries, fighting together, did much to wipe out those memories. Military historians, military professionals, and those interested in the Gulf War will find this personal, but highly informed, account fascinating.

In carefully edited selections from Ruffin's writings, Jack Temple Kirby presents an innovative, progressive agronomist and pioneering conservationist. Arranged in sections discussing southern agricultural history, Ruffin's observations of nature, his ideas about land reform, and his plans for soil rejuvenation, Nature s Management shows that Ruffin was a thinker far ahead of his time, recognizing our need to improve agriculture and to protect nature. Known as the \\"father of soil science\\" in the United States, Edmund Ruffin discovered and solved the problem of soil acidity while still in his twenties and published several papers on the subject. As the publication of his writing increased, Ruffin left his own farming business to pursue his studies. This volume contains a collection of Ruffin's essays on a variety of interrelated subjects. From the promotion of fencing and methods of malaria prevention to advocacy of a public works program and the recycling of waste, Ruffin's ideas paved the way for the early conservation movement associated with Theodore Roosevelt, Gifford Pinchot, and others. Nature's Management presents Ruffin's activism and innovative genius at its best, replacing the image of a southern firebrand with that of an outspoken reformer deserving of recognition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K9fDmrHztpcC&dq=Nature%27s+Management&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What is Literature?\\" and Other Essays","description":"Professor Robson considers particular works and authors in the light of the preceding discussion of critical principles.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tGY73moVykAC&dq=What+is+Literature%3F%22+and+Other+Essays&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Whitman and Nietzsche: A comparative study of their thought (University of North Carolina studies in the Germanic languages and literatures)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_C88AAAAIAAJ&dq=Whitman+and+Nietzsche:+A+comparative+study+of+their+thought+(University+of+North+Carolina+studies+in+the+Germanic+languages+and+literatures)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My First Spanish Animal Board Book/Mi Primer Libro de Animales en Espanol (My First series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xUDhAAAAMAAJ&dq=My+First+Spanish+Animal+Board+Book/Mi+Primer+Libro+de+Animales+en+Espanol+(My+First+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vision with a Capital V: Create the Business of Your Dreams","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=80zsEQpeSkMC&dq=Vision+with+a+Capital+V:+Create+the+Business+of+Your+Dreams&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dogs (Animal Ways)","description":"In a world where we usually measure animals by human standards, prize-winning author and MacArthur Fellow Carl Safina takes us inside their lives and minds, witnessing their profound capacity for perception, thought and emotion, showing why the word \\"it\\" is often inappropriate as we discover who they really are.

At age nine, Lucy Grealy was diagnosed with a potentially terminal cancer. When she returned to school with a third of her jaw removed, she faced the cruel taunts of classmates. It took her twenty years of living with a distorted self-image and more than thirty years of reconstructive procedures before she could come to terms with her appearance.

Born in 1926, Fest experienced firsthand the rise of the Nazis, the Second World War, and a catastrophically defeated Germany, thus becoming a vital witness to these difficult years. In this memoir of his childhood and youth, Fest offers a far-reaching view of how he experienced the war and National Socialism. True to the German Bildung tradition, Fest grows up immersed in the works of Goethe, Schiller, M?rike, Rilke, Kleist, Mozart, and Beethoven. His father, a conservative Catholic teacher, opposes the Nazi regime and as a result loses his job and status. Fest is forced to move to a boarding school in the countryside that he despises, and in his effort to come to terms with his father s strong political convictions, he embarks on a tireless quest for knowledge and moral integrity that will shape the rest of his life and writing career.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rYJ2AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sins of the fathers;: A study of the Atlantic slave traders, 1441-1807","description":"Adding perceptive commentary to the eyewitness accounts of slave traders, slaveholders and slaves themselves, James Pope-Hennessy affords the reader a broad view of the turbulent his tory of a disgraceful institution - three and a half centuries when the lives of Africans held little worth for their European captors beyond their cash value at auction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9p1IoupKgnMC&dq=Sins+of+the+fathers%3B:+A+study+of+the+Atlantic+slave+traders,+1441-1807&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kristin Lavransdatter II: The Wife (Penguin Classics)","description":" [Sigrid Undset] should be the next Elena Ferrante.   Slate A Penguin Classic Kristin Lavransdatter interweaves political, social, and religious history with the daily aspects of family life to create a colorful, richly detailed tapestry of Norway during the fourteenth-century. The trilogy, however, is more than a journey into the past. Undset's own life her familiarity with Norse sagas and folklore and with a wide range of medieval literature, her experiences as a daughter, wife, and mother, and her deep religious faith profoundly influenced her writing. Her grasp of the connections between past and present and of human nature itself, combined with the extraordinary quality of her writing, sets her works far above the genre of \\"historical novels.\\" This new translation by Tina Nunnally the first English version since Charles Archer's translation in the 1920s captures Undset's strengths as a stylist. Nunnally, an award-winning translator, retains the natural dialog and lyrical flow of the original Norwegian, with its echoes of Old Norse legends, while deftly avoiding the stilted language and false archaisms of Archer's translation. In addition, she restores key passages left out of that edition. Undset's ability to present a meticulously accurate historical portrait without sacrificing the poetry and narrative drive of masterful storytelling was particularly significant in her homeland. Granted independence in 1905 after five hundred years of foreign domination, Norway was eager to reclaim its national history and culture. Kristin Lavransdatter became a touchstone for Undset's contemporaries, and continues to be widely read by Norwegians today. In the more than 75 years since it was first published, it has also become a favorite throughout the world. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

Why do we like junk food more than fruit? Why is the road to romance so rocky? Why is happiness so elusive? What drives us into debt?

How far would you go to uncover the truth? One spring night in 1998 the beautiful Cressida Strauss plunges from a fourth-floor balcony at the Lyc e Internationale Suisse with catastrophic consequences. Loath to draw negative publicity to the school, a bastion of European wealth and glamour, officials quickly dismiss the incident as an accident, but questions remain: Was it a suicide attempt? Or was Cressida pushed? It was no secret that she had a selfish streak and had earned as many enemies as allies in her tenure at the school. For her best friend, scholarship student Kersti Kuusk, the lingering questions surrounding Cressida's fall continue to nag long after she leaves the Lyc e. Kersti marries and becomes a bestselling writer, but never stops wondering about Cressida's obsession with the Helvetian Society a secret club banned years before their arrival at the school and a pair of its members who were expelled. When Kersti is invited as a guest to the Lyc e's 100th Anniversary, she begins probing the cover-up, unearthing a frightening underbelly of lies and abuse at the prestigious establishment. And in one portentous moment, Kersti makes a decision that will connect her to Cressida forever and raise the stakes dangerously high in her own desire to solve the mystery and redeem her past. An unputdownable read as clever as it is compelling, The Finishing School offers a riveting glimpse into a privileged, rarefied world in which nothing is as it appears.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GgmwDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Right from wrong.","description":"A lively and entertaining guide to ethics in a technological age.

Many shifts in the right versus wrong pendulum are driven by advances in technology.

For many patients a diagnosis of MS has meant the end of a normally functioning life. Not any longer. Celeste Pepe was a vigorous 42, a busy chiropractor and naturopath, when she got an MS diagnosis. What does an expert in alternative medicine do when she gets seriously ill? Dr. Pepe realized it was time to put her deep belief in alternative medicine to the test. She resolved to find and employ effective natural ways to reverse this condition and restore her health. She did, and her multiple sclerosis is now a thing of the past. Dr. Pepe's remarkable healing odyssey took her through many disciplines, theories, and practices in the world of natural medicine, and into the depths of her own body and mind. In the end, she distilled her successful treatment into a program that any MS patient can follow to restore health. She explains this with clarity, medical precision and a strong measure of encouragement. Using her own healing experience, Dr. Pepe explains the steps that can help the MS patient turn the corner on this disease: detailed nutrient testing and fortification, bee venom treatment, allergy testing and dietary changes, personally tailored nutritional plans, the use of specialized supplements, chelation therapy, regular exercise, and the replacement of mercury amalgam dental fillings. \\"I truly believe that if you diligently apply these healing protocols, which I have learned, you will no longer be known as an 'MS victim,'\\" says Dr. Pepe.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GfrefW84Kd0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Art through the ages; an introduction to its history and significance","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W-p9zgEACAAJ&dq=Art+through+the+ages%3B+an+introduction+to+its+history+and+significance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Disabilities Sourcebook: Basic Consumer Health Information About Physical and Psychiatric Disabilities, Including Descriptions of Major Causes of Disability, Assistive and (Health Reference Series)","description":"Provides basic consumer health information on the nature and mechanism of pain and gives attention to common complaints associated with pain.

This first English translation of a series of twelve essays known as Alterity and Transcendence offers a unique glimpse of Levinas defining his own place in the history of philosophy. Published by a mature thinker between 1967 and 1989, these works exhibit a refreshingly accessible perspective that seasoned admirers and newcomers will appreciate. In today's world, where religious conceptions of exalted higher powers are constantly called into question by theoretical investigation and by the powerful influence of science and technology on our understanding of the universe, has the notion of transcendence been stripped of its significance? In Levinas's incisive model, transcendence is indeed alive -- not in any notion of our relationship to a mysterious, sacred realm but in the idea of our worldly, subjective relationships to others. Without presupposing an intimate knowledge of the history of philosophy, Levinas explores the ways in which Plotinus, Descartes, Husserl, and Heidegger have encountered the question of transcendence. In discourses on the concepts of totality and infinity, he locates his own thinking in the context of pre-Socratic philosophers, Aristotle, Leibniz, Spinoza, Kant, and Descartes. Always centering his discussions on the idea of interpersonal relations as the basis of transcendence, Levinas reflects on the rights of individuals (and how they are inextricably linked to those of others), the concept of peace, and the dialogic nature of philosophy. Finally, in interviews conducted by Christian Chabanis and Angelo Bianchi, Levinas responds to key questions not directly addressed in his writings. Throughout, Alterity and Transcendence reveals a commitment to ethics as first philosophy -- obliging modern thinkers to investigate not merely the true but the good.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GyU9wucIrz4C&dq=Alterity+and+Transcendence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Light Out of Shadows","description":"Conducting a nonthreatening and accessible conversation about an issue that is presently tearing many churches and denominations apart, Out of the Shadows, into the Light focuses on communication in hopes of creating reconciliation for the Christian community.

Situated on the Missouri River seventy-five miles above the present city of Omaha, it commanded a strategic location astride this major trade route to the northern plains. A host of traders and travelers, from Jean-Baptiste Truteau and James Mackay to Lewis and Clark and Father De Smet, left descriptions of the village. Although John Champe of the University of Nebraska carried out a comprehensive archaeological investigation of the site from 1939 to 1942 (the only intensive, systematic archaeological study of any Omaha site), the results of his work have heretofore remained unpublished. Now John M. O'Shea and John Ludwickson have combined Champe's findings with the major historical accounts of the Omahas, providing significant new insights into the course of Omaha history in the preservation period. The emphasis on material culture gives a unique view of the daily life of these people and illustrates clearly the integration of European trade items with traditional technologies. Here the fur trade is seen in a fresh perspective, that of the suppliers of furs and recipients of trade goods. An examination of Omaha demography rounds out this important new ethnohistorical sketch of the Omaha Indians.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HKd6npiLRuAC&dq=The+Otoes+and+Missourias%3B:+A+study+of+Indian+removal+and+the+legal+aftermath&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Over 75 Good Ideas for Promoting Your Book","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Points of departure: Zen Buddhism with a Rinzai view","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HQobnwEACAAJ&dq=Points+of+departure:+Zen+Buddhism+with+a+Rinzai+view&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Japanese in thirty hours;: First course in Japanese language for either class room use or for self study.

The pathogenesis of most diseases and their symptomatology and physical signs are well studied and understood. The management of patients is based on firm understanding of these disease processes. In contrast, Traditional Chinese Medicine came about through the experience of many generations of practitioners over thousands of years. Undoubtedly, many of these treatments have proved to be effective in their own way, however, firm scientific basis is still lacking. While most Western Medicine advocates control of disease by eradication of pathogens and surgical removal of diseased organs as in the case of cancer, Traditional Chinese Medicine seeks to improve resistance against disease. There is probably a great wealth of therapeutic value in Traditional Chinese Medicine, which has not been discovered or explored fully. By combining the knowledge of both Western and Traditional Chinese Medicine, one might be able to improve the results of efficacy of treatments and the survival of patients. The integration of Medicine from East and West will take time to evolve and will need interested physicians from different parts of the world to work closely together to realize such a possibility. This book is an attempt to bridge the medical world of two great and ancient civilizations in their approach to the treatment of disease. It is informative with a detailed account of the history of medical development. It is highly recommended for those medical practitioners from both East and West who are interested to explore alternative medicine and research new areas of the medical frontier.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rzRrAAAAMAAJ&dq=Bridging+Hippocrates+and+Huang+Ti,+Volume+1:+A+Comparative+Thesaurus+of+Traditional+Chinese+and+Western+Urology,+Andrology+and+Sexology+(v.+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Forest Friends' Five Senses","description":"Animal friends share their experiences with the five senses.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UcRaAAAAYAAJ&dq=Forest+Friends%27+Five+Senses&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Greek Treasure","description":"A fictionalized narrative of the derided but determined efforts of German traveler-archaeologist, Henry Schliemann, and his second wife, Sophia Engastronenos, to excavate the sites of Homeric Troy and ancient Mycenae","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jmlbAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Greek+Treasure&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The day we celebrate;: July 4th at Buck Hill falls, Pennsylvania;","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2hv1NAAACAAJ&dq=The+day+we+celebrate%3B:+July+4th+at+Buck+Hill+falls,+Pennsylvania%3B&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Work, Sex and Rugby","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pjudtwAACAAJ&dq=Work,+Sex+and+Rugby&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The CRB Commodity Yearbook 2002","description":"Screening the Market provides investors with a practical plan for finding market-beating stocks and building a portfolio to meet any investment goal.

Judith M. Bennett, who has been commenting on developments in women's and gender history since the 1980s, argues that the achievement of a more feminist future relies on a rich, plausible, and well-informed knowledge of the past, and she asks her readers to consider what sorts of feminist history can best advance the struggles of the twenty-first century. Bennett takes as her central problem the growing chasm between feminism and history. Closely allied in the 1970s, each has now moved away from the other. Seeking to narrow this gap, Bennett proposes that feminist historians turn their attention to the intellectual challenges posed by the persistence of patriarchy. She posits a \\"patriarchal equilibrium\\" whereby, despite many changes in women's experiences over past centuries, women's status vis- -vis that of men has remained remarkably unchanged. Although, for example, women today find employment in occupations unimaginable to medieval women, medieval and modern women have both encountered the same wage gap, earning on average only three-fourths of the wages earned by men. Bennett argues that the theoretical challenge posed by this patriarchal equilibrium will be best met by long-term historical perspectives that reach back well before the modern era. In chapters focused on women's work and lesbian sexuality, Bennett demonstrates the contemporary relevance of the distant past to feminist theory and politics. She concludes with a chapter that adds a new twist the challenges of textbooks and classrooms to viewing women's history from a distance and with feminist intent. A new manifesto, History Matters engages forthrightly with the challenges faced by feminist historians today. It argues for the radical potential of a history that is focused on feminist issues, aware of the distant past, attentive to continuities over time, and alert to the workings of patriarchal power.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YIykXytR8IEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shame and Its Sisters: A Silvan Tomkins Reader","description":"Silvan Tomkins (1911-1991) was one of the most radical and imaginative psychologists of the twentieth century.

No secret oral tradition as extensive as this has ever been recorded, and none has ever presented a Gnostic view of Mary Magdalene as she is portrayed in this groundbreaking work-as a powerful holy woman, the innermost disciple and beloved wife of Jesus, and a Christed woman who is coequal with Jesus in the Christ revelation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wmqr1BgNXnQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Skeletal Biology of Past Peoples: Research Methods","description":"A systematic compilation of the latest analytical and methodological approaches to prehistoric hard tissue analysis.

Everyone of us knows someone who runs. He is one of the symp-toms of our times from the little man who shoves you out of the way on the street to the go-getter who shoves you out of a job in the office to the Fuehrer who shoves you out of the world. And all of us have stopped to wonder, at some time or another, what it is that makes these people tick. What makes them run? This is the question Schulberg has asked himself, and the answer is the first novel written with the indignation that only a young writer with talent and ideals could concentrate into a manuscript. It is the story of Sammy Glick, the man with a positive genius for being a heel, who runs through New York's East Side, through newspaper ranks and finally through Hollywood, leaving in his wake the wrecked careers of his associates; for this is his tragedy and his chief characteristic his congenital incapacity for friendship. An older and more experienced novelist might have tempered his story and, in so doing, destroyed one of its outstanding qualities. Compromise would mar the portrait of Sammy Glick. Schulberg has etched it in pure vitriol, and dissected his victim with a precision that is almost frightening. When a fragment of this book appeared as a short story in a national magazine, Schulberg was surprised at the number of letters he received from people convinced they knew Sammy Glick's real name. But speculation as to his real identity would be utterly fruitless, for Sammy is a composite picture of a loud and spectacular minority bitterly resented by the many decent and sincere artists who are trying honestly to realize the measureless potentialities of motion pictures. To this group belongs Schulberg himself, who has not only worked as a screen writer since his graduation from Dartmouth College in 1936, but has spent his life, literally, in the heart of the motion-picture colony. In the course of finding out what makes Sammy run (an operation in which the reader is spared none of the grue-some details) Schulberg has poured out everything he has felt about that place. The result is a book which the publishers not only believe to be the most honest ever written about Hollywood, but a penetrating study of one kind of twentieth-century success that is peculiar to no single race of people or walk of life.

Written in the summer of 1932, when the twenty-six-year-old Beckett was poor and struggling to make ends meet, Dream of Fair to Middling Women offers a rare and revealing portrait of the artist as a young man. Later on, Beckett would call the novel  the chest into which I threw all my wild thoughts.  When he submitted it to several publishers, all of them found it too literary, too scandalous, or too risky, and it was sadly never published during his lifetime. In this stunning first novel, Belacqua a young version of Molloy, whose love is divided between two women, Smeraldina-Rima and Alba  wrestles with his lusts and learning across vocabularies and continents, before a final  relapse into Dublin ,  says the New Yorker. Youthfully exuberant and visibly influenced by Joyce, Dream of Fair to Middling Women is a work of extraordinary virtuosity. Beckett delights in the wordplay and sheer joy of language that mark his later work. Above all in this handsomely bound hardcover edition, the story brims with the black humor that, like brief stabs of sunlight, pierces the darkness of his vision.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ck7-DQAAQBAJ&dq=Dream+of+Fair+to+Middling+Women&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maria Meneghini Callas","description":"Maria Meneghini Callas is a moving account of the tumultuous and tragic life of one of this century's greatest divas. Callas was a fascinating, mysterious, and often contradictory figure who carefully created the myth that surrounded her. Michael Scott explores every aspect of that myth, detailing her battles with opera managers, her marriage to Giovanni Meneghini, her weight loss and inexorable decline, her tempestuous romance with Aristotle Onassis, and finally her early death in Paris. Michael Scott's extensive knowledge of the history of vocal music provides a unique reference point for measuring Callas's achievements. He is the only Callas biographer to have seen her frequently on stage. Drawing on his memories of her performances, his comprehensive knowledge of her recordings, and interviews with numerous singers, conductors, and producers, Scott examines each of Callas's major operatic performances and recordings. He offers penetrating, sometimes controversial insights into her genius, commenting on her choice of repertory, and speculating about the reasons behind the concert cancellations that brought her so much publicity. The book also features a discography, a complete list of Callas's performances, and 31 photographs, many previously unknown. With enthusiasm and vitality, Michael Scott has brilliantly captured Callas's life and artistic milieu in a fascinating exploration of one of this century's most beloved and influential operatic superstars.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6C86_Ws0bxEC&dq=Maria+Meneghini+Callas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Little Princess","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=c-JEAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Winter of Our Discontent","description":"The final novel of one of America s most beloved writers a tale of degeneration, corruption, and spiritual crisis A Penguin Classic In awarding John Steinbeck the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature, the Nobel committee stated that with The Winter of Our Discontent, he had  resumed his position as an independent expounder of the truth, with an unbiased instinct for what is genuinely American.  Ethan Allen Hawley, the protagonist of Steinbeck s last novel, works as a clerk in a grocery store that his family once owned. With Ethan no longer a member of Long Island s aristocratic class, his wife is restless, and his teenage children are hungry for the tantalizing material comforts he cannot provide. Then one day, in a moment of moral crisis, Ethan decides to take a holiday from his own scrupulous standards. Set in Steinbeck s contemporary 1960 America, the novel explores the tenuous line between private and public honesty, and today ranks alongside his most acclaimed works of penetrating insight into the American condition.

By the very act of restricting textile and apparel imports, the U.S. virtually compels foreign textile workers to migrate to the U.S. The European Union's tariff against East European exports provokes a flood of Eastern workers to Western Europe. In How Nations Grow Rich, Krauss dispatches both traditional and newer arguments for protection with unusual verve and clarity. Addressing the belief that protectionism boosts employment, he points out that import restrictions can destroy U.S. jobs when imposed on materials we use as parts.

We have felt time speed up and felt energies that are at times so chaotic and unpredictable that we have been thrown off our usual course. Some of us have been rocked to our very core. We are asking ourselves  what is this and why is this happening?  We each have chosen to come to earth during this time of great transition. We are all here sharing our lives with each other, helping Mother Earth move into the Golden Age, the spiritual Age of Aquarius. This transition will complete on the date that the Mayan civilization predicted some 26,000 years ago, December 21st, 2012. There is much work to be done as we realize the need for the shift that must occur in our personal lives so that we can be in sync with the new fifth dimensional energy on this planet. As our world resets itself, so too must we reset ourselves. What this means to each of us is that it is time to understand the meaning of how to live more fully in the fifth dimension. Each of us must identify where we currently stand and where we need to go in order to experience the wonderment of fifth dimensional living. Why? Many of us may be existing as a two or a three dimensional person. The energies that sustain those dimensions no longer exist on this planet. So, the old ways of thinking or operating that produced success at one time no longer exist. It is now necessary for us, if we are to exist in harmony with our planet, to transition as well. If we choose not to transition, then frustration and anger will become paramount in our lives. The choice is up to us. To live in the fifth dimension is not only to experience the energy of magic and miracles but to learn that we can create all the perfection we desire in our lives by simply shifting our thinking into fifth dimensional thinking. We are able to see the perfection where formerly we saw the illusion of imperfection. This new vantage point allows us to become the center of our own reality and easily navigate through difficult individuals and challenging events while maintaining a state of balance and harmony. We are then able to turn possibilities into probabilities and probabilities into actualities! This journey begins with describing and identifying all of the unseen, but certainly not unfelt, influences in our lives that have been given to each of us to help us live our life on earth in the best and easiest manner possible. Each reader will be able to identify their birthright gift as well as the other gifts available to tap into and expand one s energy thereby allowing this innate knowledge to grow and develop. All of the necessary techniques and tools are explained in detail in this book so that you can easily make the transition from your current dimension into the fifth dimension, allowing you to create a new future. You are able to learn and make friends with each of your bodies of consciousness and their respective inner child and together you begin a journey of healing. You, as parent of these inner children, learn how to set the stage and the rules so that everyone is playing by the same playbook. You learn that you may win as a team or you may lose as a team, but you are all on the same team working together to achieve that balance that allows you to maintain your newly found center. By removing fears one by one, each of us can transition from a place of fear into a place of love, learning to live from the heart. As we work towards this goal, we isolate and identify the negative emotions that have been growing and harvesting within. These negative emotions equate disease. This book is your guide to help acknowledge these fears, recognize and release them one by one creating a new you, a lighter you. We then experience a new energy, a more evolved energy, a higher vibrating energy, as we invite the energy of excellent health and balance into our bodies.

The Cheese Board was there, a hole in the wall with a line out the door, before Chez Panisse was so much as a gleam in my eye. When the restaurant was conceived, I wanted it to be in North Berkeley so the Cheese Board would be nearby, because I knew I would be among friends. -Alice Waters, from the Foreword When a tiny cheese shop opened in Berkeley, California, in 1967, there was little hint of what the store-and the neighborhood-would grow into over the next 30 years. The Cheese Board became a collective a few years later and Chez Panisse opened across the street, giving birth to one of the country's most vibrant food neighborhoods, the epicenter of California's culinary revolution. Equal parts bakery, cheese store, pizzeria, and gathering place, the Cheese Board is a patchwork of the local community, where a passion for good food runs deep. THE CHEESE BOARD presents over 100 recipes for the store's classic breads, pastries, and pizzas, along with a history of the collective and an extensive cheese primer.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yWizcibvpUgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Animatrix: A Female Animator - How Laughter Saved My Life","description":"What kind of childhood experiences helped Heidi to become a successful Disney Animator?

Even within this figure's own lifetime, his true story became obscured by a veil of myths. Vlad has been depicted as a national and Christian hero who bravely fought to defend his native land and all of Europe against the invading Turkish infidels. However, he has also been portrayed as a bloody tyrant -- whose reputation slowly transformed through the ages into the fictional vampire created by Bram Stoker at the end of the nineteenth century. Even in the twentieth century, the true history of Dracula has been obscured by communist and nationalist historiography.

In readings that bring philosophies of vision into dialogue with photography and film as well as the methods of observation used by the social sciences, Karen Jacobs identifies distinctly modernist kinds of observers and visual relationships. This important reconception of modernism draws upon American, British, and French literary and extra-literary materials from the period 1900-1955. These texts share a sense of crisis about vision's capacity for violence and its inability to deliver reliable knowledge. Jacobs looks closely at the ways in which historical understandings of race and gender inflected visual relations in the modernist novel. She shows how modernist writers, increasingly aware of the body behind the neutral lens of the observer, used diverse strategies to displace embodiment onto those \\"others\\" historically perceived as cultural bodies in order to reimagine for themselves or their characters a \\"purified\\" gaze. The Eye's Mind addresses works by such high modernists as Vladimir Nabokov, Virginia Woolf, and (more distantly) Ralph Ellison and Maurice Blanchot, as well as those by Henry James, Zora Neale Hurston, and Nathanael West which have been tentatively placed in the modernist canon although they forgo the full-blown experimental techniques often seen as synonymous with literary modernism. Jacobs reframes fundamental debates about modernist aesthetic practices by demonstrating how much those practices are indebted to the changing visual cultures of the twentieth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HlpuDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Eye%27s+Mind:+Literary+Modernism+and+Visual+Culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"When Perfect Isn't Good Enough: Strategies for Coping with Perfectionism","description":"This fully revised and updated edition of a best-selling classic offers the latest research and treatment methods - including cutting-edge acceptance-based strategies from a cognitive behavioural perspective, as well as the latest on medications - for readers who dread making mistakes and feel that nothing they do is quite good enough to help them overcome their need to be perfect.

In  Self-Reliance , Emerson explained that standing on one's own two feet against society was essential to forming a strong union with God. Once this essay was published, it received both wild praise and hurtful backlash from different factions of America. However, Emerson pushed through the negative criticism, stood against the crowd, and found himself stronger in his faith than he ever had before. Emerson found that self-reliance, no matter the situation, would always help the individual persevere and become stronger. Because Emerson wrote for the common man, many of his essays and poems are relatively simple and straight-forward; he wanted audiences to understand his thoughts and identify with his beliefs. He also wanted to wake them up from the conventional modern life that he believed had often placated them. Emerson's writings were meant to help the reader transcend to a more thoughtful mindset. His essays discuss themes of philosophy, poetry, history, politics, ethics, and literary criticism, all of which helped break people from what he believed were their mediocre lives. He saw that humanity could become stronger as a whole if people would take the steps to make themselves and their minds stronger.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=d0wAEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Long Fall: Poems, Texts, and Essays","description":"Poetry.

We see the wonders of nature but miss the symmetry beneath, framed as it is in ever stranger symbols and concepts. Roger Newton's accessible account of how physicists understand the world allows the expert and novice alike to explore both the mysteries of the universe and the beauty of the science that gives shape to the unseeable. In What Makes Nature Tick? we find engaging discussions of solitons and superconductors, quarks and strings, phase space, tachyons, time, chaos, and indeterminacy, as well as the investigations that have led to their elucidation. But Roger Newton does not limit this volume to late-breaking discoveries and startling facts. He presents physics as an expanding intellectual structure, a network of very human ideas that stretches back three hundred years from our present frontier of knowledge. Where does our unidirectional sense of time come from? What makes a particle elementary? How can forces be transmitted through empty space? In addition to providing these answers, and a host of others at the very heart of physics, Newton shows us how physicists formulate the questions--a process in which intuition, imagination, and aesthetics have a powerful influence.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N-Cak77H-EAC&dq=What+Makes+Nature+Tick%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Practical Buddhism","description":"As long as our minds are dominated by the conditions of the external world, we are bound to remain in a state of dissatisfaction, always vulnerable to grief and fear.

Many have found a practical answer to that question in the teachings of Tibetan Buddhism. Here at last is an organized overview of these teachings, beginning with the basic themes of the sutras--the general discourses of the Buddha--and continuing through the esoteric concepts and advanced practices of Tantra. Unlike other introductions to Tibetan Buddhism, this accessible, enjoyable work doesn't stop with theory and history, but relates timeless spiritual principles to the pressing issues of modern life, both in terms of our daily experience and our uniquely Western world view. This fascinating, highly readable book asks neither unquestioning faith nor blind obedience to abstract concepts or religious beliefs. Rather, it challenges us to question and investigate life's issues for ourselves in the light of an ancient and effective approach to the sufferings and joys of the human condition.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bKP0CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shocking new facts about marijuana (Spire books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ivv4AAAACAAJ&dq=Shocking+new+facts+about+marijuana+(Spire+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Special Report: A Doctor's Proven New Way to Conquer Rheumatism and Arthritis","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ScdiAAAACAAJ&dq=Special+Report:+A+Doctor%27s+Proven+New+Way+to+Conquer+Rheumatism+and+Arthritis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"William Joyce's Mother Goose","description":"An illustrated collection of traditional nursery rhymes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8E0AAgAACAAJ&dq=William+Joyce%27s+Mother+Goose&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Jack-o'-Lantern","description":"Gordie has to wait until Halloween to see how the pumpkin from his grandfather's farm will become a jack-o-lantern.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v6QBAAAACAAJ&dq=My+Jack-o%27-Lantern&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Worship Evangelism","description":"This practical manual details a culturally relevant, biblical alternative to both evanglistic and seeker sensitive worship models.

In more recent years, amateur naturalists have also turned their lenses to the world of butterflies, whose myriad species and fantastic shapes and colors offer an intriguing challenge to even the most seasoned birder. But while bird enthusiasts have always had the help of accurate and accessible handbooks, those observing butterflies have had no such advantage. Until now, that is.In this unique field guide, Jeffrey Glassberg has made butterfly watching a less frustrating and far more rewarding pastime, showing us how to find, identify, and enjoy the nearly 160 species that inhabit the Northeast. Butterflies Through Binoculars is the first butterfly guide to combine the immediacy and vividness of actual photographs of living butterflies with the traditional field guide format. While older guides cater to the collector, offering drawings that show the captured and mounted insect, this book shows butterflies in their natural poses and in the correct size relationship to related species. With Butterflies Through Binoculars in hand, the brilliant Tiger Swallowtail, the more dour Mourning Cloak, even the Rare Skipper itself will not elude identification by the beginning--or, for that matter, the more seasoned--observer. By focussing the guide on the Boston to Washington corridor, Glassberg has excluded the species from unrelated areas that have made older field guides so cumbersome. In addition, he provides entirely new field marks for butterfly identification, demonstrates how to identify subjects by way of the key characteristics butterflies are likely to display in their natural settings, shows how species can be recognized both from above and below, and explains how to differentiate between males and females.Besides being a handy guide to identification, Butterflies Through Binoculars also tells readers where to find particular species, giving a complete account of flight times, ranges, and seasonal patterns. Nine major locations for butterflying are described in great detail, and readers are directed to forty specific locations where uncommon--even rare--species can be found. And throughout the book, the basic natural history of each species is considered in a lively, readable fashion.For butterfly enthusiasts, for bird watchers who want to add a new dimension to their hobby, for anyone who is simply interested in exploring the wilds of their own back yard, Butterflies Through Binoculars will offer hours of delightful help and instruction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tEwgAQAAMAAJ&dq=Butterflies+through+Binoculars:+The+East+A+Field+Guide+to+the+Butterflies+of+Eastern+North+America+(Butterflies+Through+Binoculars+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The day they shook the plum tree","description":"The story of Hetty Green and one of the great American fortunes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zSkaAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+day+they+shook+the+plum+tree&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flash 8: Projects for Learning Animation and Interactivity (O'Reilly Digital Studio)","description":"Macromedia Flash is fast becoming the Web's most widely used platform for creating rich media with animation and motion graphics, but mastering Flash isn't easy. Most entry-level books teach through simple examples that concentrate on either animation or scripting, but rarely both together. To get the most from Flash 8, you not only need to be proficient in programming/interface design, you need the creativity for story telling and the artistic insights to design fluid animation. Flash 8: Projects for Learning Animation and Interactivity teaches Flash design rather than simply Flash itself. With a standalone series of walkthroughs and tutorials for Flash beginners coming from a graphics field, this book teaches Flash in the context of real-world projects. Rather than learn a Flash tool for the sake of it, you learn which areas of Flash are important, and which are less used, simply by seeing how typical content is actually created. And rather than a text-heavy approach, this graphically rich book leads you through hands-on examples by illustration. Each project in the book starts with goals and broad sketches before moving to design and scripting. This helps you understand design intent-the why of the process-rather than just learning the interfaces and the how of it all. Along the way, you'll create Flash content that includes traditional animation techniques (as seen in full-length animated features), and ActionScript-based interactive animation, such as custom web site interface designs. You also learn how to combine both traditional animation techniques and ActionScript to create feature-rich Flash assets from the ground up.

Pink","description":"Pink's biography, first written by Iain Murray in 1981, is here revised and enlarged with the benefit of new material, including some of Pink's own re-discovered manuscripts. It is the heart-stirring and compelling story of a strong, complex character a 'Mr Valiant-for-truth' who was also a humble Christian. In 1922 a small magazine Studies in the Scriptures began to circulate among Christians in the English-speaking world. It pointed its readership back to an understanding of the gospel that had rarely been heard since the days of C. H. Spurgeon. At the time it seemed as inconsequential as its author, but subsequently Arthur Pink's writings became a major element in the recovery of expository preaching and biblical living. Born in England in 1886, A. W. Pink was the little-known pastor of churches in the United States and Australia before he finally returned to his homeland in 1934. There he died almost unnoticed in 1952.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IK4BPgAACAAJ&dq=Life+of+Arthur+W.+Pink&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Collector's Encyclopedia of Knowles, Taylor & Knowles China: Identification & Values","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tv5nkgEACAAJ&dq=Collector%27s+Encyclopedia+of+Knowles,+Taylor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mama Drama (A Play)","description":"Shows women how to create new, healthy relationships with their mothers by avoiding old patterns, trying out a series of exercises to determine what the best mode of communication might be, and handling conflict in less stressful ways.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4L7brm7rJu4C&dq=Mama+Drama+(A+Play)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The voice of the desert,: A naturalist's interpretation","description":"This is a new release of the original 1954 edition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=18F5ngEACAAJ&dq=The+voice+of+the+desert,:+A+naturalist%27s+interpretation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Federated Suns: Battletech Field Manual (Battletech)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EfdiwgEACAAJ&dq=Federated+Suns:+Battletech+Field+Manual+(Battletech)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Liz: An Intimate Biography of Elizabeth Taylor","description":"Elizabeth Taylor's own story was more dramatic than any part she ever played on the screen. C. David Heymann brings her magnificently to life in this acclaimed biography--updated with a new chapter covering her final years. She was an icon, one of the most watched, photographed, and gossiped-about personalities of our time. Child star, daughter of a controlling stage mother, Oscar-winning actress, seductress and eight-time wife, mother of four children and grandmother of ten, champion of funding for AIDS research, purveyor of perfumes and jewelry, close friend of celebrities and tycoons Elizabeth Taylor, for almost eight decades, played most completely, beautifully, cunningly, flamboyantly, and scandalously her greatest role of all: herself. The basis of an Emmy Award-nominated miniseries, Liz portrays Taylor s life and career in fascinating, revealing detail and includes an additional new chapter, bringing her beloved fans up to date on her final years. By way of more than a thousand interviews with stars, directors, producers, designers, friends, family, business associates, and employees and through extensive research among previously disclosed court, business, medical, and studio documents, bestselling author Heymann reminds readers of her very public escapades and unveils her most private moments. Here are the highs and lows of her film career and the intimate circumstances of her marriages to Nicky Hilton, Michael Wilding, Mike Todd, Eddie Fisher, Richard Burton, Senator John Warner, and Larry Fortensky. Here, too, is the truth about Taylor s father and her friendships with leading men Montgomery Clift, James Dean, and Rock Hudson, as well as with the eccentric Malcolm Forbes and Michael Jackson. From her illnesses, injuries, weight issues, and battles against drug and alcohol, to her sexual exploits, diamond-studded adventures, and tumultuous love affairs, this is the enormously contradictory and glamorous life of Hollywood s last great star.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vjDqfZZNzosC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Funnybones (Storytime Giants)","description":"Storytime Giants provides large-format versions of favourite picture stories by well-known authors.

While various corpora have been compiled and a variety of corpora-based research has been attempted in African languages, no effort has been made towards corpus design. Additionally, although extensive analysis of the Setswana language has been done by missionaries, grammarians and linguists since the 1800s, none of this research is in corpus design. Most research has been largely on the grammatical study of the language. The recent corpora research in African languages in general has been on the use of corpora for the compilation of dictionaries and little of it is in corpus design. Pioneers of this kind of corpora research in African languages are Prinsloo and De Schryver (1999), De Schryver and Prisloo (2000 and 2001) and Gouws and Prisloo (2005). Because of a lack of research in corpora design particularly in African languages, this book attempts to fill that gap, especially for Setswana. It is hoped that the finding of this study will inspire similar designs in other languages comparable to Setswana. We explore corpus design by focusing on measuring a variety of text types for lexical richness at comparable token points. The study explores the question of whether a corpus compiled for lexicography must comprise a variety of texts drawn from different text types or whether the quality of retrieved information for lexicographic purposes from a corpus comprising diverse text varieties could be equally extracted from a corpus with a single text type. This study therefore determines whether linguistic variability is crucial in corpus design for lexicography.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k5gnBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Letters from Home: Loving Messages from the Family (Kryon, Book 7)","description":"this seventh Kryon book of the bestselling Kryon series is the last channelled one before the turn of the century.

On a nightly basis, as the community s electricity was turned on, he observed crowds of people lining up outside open windows or doors of the few homes possessing TV sets, intent on catching a glimpse of this fascinating novelty. Stoic, mute, and completely absorbed, they stood for hours contemplating every message and image presented. So begins the cultural turning point that is the basis of Amazon Town TV, a rich analysis of Gurup  in the decades during and following the spread of television. Pace worked with sociologist Brian Hinote to explore the sociocultural implications of television s introduction in this community long isolated by geographic and communication barriers. They explore how viewers change their daily routines to watch the medium; how viewers accept, miss, ignore, negotiate, and resist media messages; and how television s influence works within the local cultural context to modify social identities, consumption patterns, and worldviews.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WYNDyfNxUzMC&dq=Tv+Towns&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crime of Passion, A","description":"Thirty real-life accounts of passion gone lethally wrong Celebrated mystery writer Howard Engel traces the history of the crime of passion through France, England, Canada, and the United States in his first nonfiction book.

Under the general editorship of Peter Burian and Alan Shapiro, each volume includes a critical introduction, commentary on the text, full stage directions, and a glossary of the mythical and geographical references in the plays. Brought boldly to life by Herbert Golder and Richard Pevear's translation and contextualized by Herbert Golder's eloquent introduction, this early Sophoclean tragedy tells the story of the Homeric hero better known as Ajax, who was second only to Achilles among the Greek warriors. In Greek tradition, Aias figures as the archaic warrior who dies in shame after his betrayal by the Greeks. Sophocles turns tradition inside out, portraying Aias' suicide not as a disgrace but as heroism. He endows Aias suicide with a meaning radically different from previous versions of the Aias myth--Aias is not the hero whom time has passed by, but rather the man who steps beyond time. Most previous versions and interpretations have equivocated over Sophocles' bold vision. This edition of Aias translates precisely that transformation of the hero from the bygone figure to the man who transcends time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=81_nCwAAQBAJ&dq=Aias+(Greek+Tragedy+in+New+Translations)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Analyzing Complex Survey Data (Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences)","description":"This book examines ways to analyze complex surveys, and focuses on the problems of weights and design effects.

But wilderness is not only a place. It is also one of the most powerful and troublesome ideas in American environmental thought, representing everything from sublime beauty and patriotic inspiration to a countercultural ideal and an overextension of government authority. The Promise of Wilderness examines how the idea of wilderness has shaped the management of public lands since the passage of the Wilderness Act in 1964. Wilderness preservation has engaged diverse groups of citizens, from hunters and ranchers to wildlife enthusiasts and hikers, as political advocates who have leveraged the resources of local and national groups toward a common goal. Turner demonstrates how these efforts have contributed to major shifts in modern American environmental politics, which have emerged not just in reaction to a new generation of environmental concerns, such as environmental justice and climate change, but also in response to changed debates over old conservation issues, such as public lands management. He also shows how battles over wilderness protection have influenced American politics more broadly, fueling disputes over the proper role of government, individual rights, and the interests of rural communities; giving rise to radical environmentalism; and playing an important role in the resurgence of the conservative movement, especially in the American West.

Jong's Spiritual Growth Series 3: The First Epistle of John (I)","description":"If you are a true Christian, you should know God's love more than just abstractly. Those who know and believe Jesus as their Savior must know God's love concretely in their remission of sins that was accomplished through the gospel Word of the water and the Spirit. We have to become true believers of this true gospel in order to know God's love in depth. In this true gospel, the love of God manifests itself concretely and in detail. If we are to know God as love, our knowledge has to come from God's concrete love for us that is revealed in the gospel Truth of the water and the Spirit. Only then can we lead others to the true love of God. The Apostle John testifies that Jesus Christ, who came by the water, the blood, and the Holy Spirit, is the Savior and God Himself. The essence of his testimony is the Truth of the remission of sin, which belongs to the water, the blood, and the Holy Spirit. As it is written in the Word of God, the water signifies Jesus' baptism that He received from John the Baptist, and the blood signifies the judgment He received for all our sins. Again, the evidence of our salvation lies in the Holy Spirit, the water, and the blood (1 John 5:8). The ministries of the water, the blood, and the Holy Spirit are those of God through which He has delivered sinners from all their sins.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=U4gkEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Literatura Y Arte (Spanish Edition)","description":"One of three volumes in the highly successful INTERMEDIATE SPANISH series, LITERATURA Y ARTE introduces students to literary works by both Spanish and Spanish-American writers and the rich and diverse contributions of Hispanic artists to the fine arts.

Isabel and her husband, Dr. Samuel Ziegler, and their two young sons moved to Espanola in early 1946 as a result of Dr. Ziegler s having been invited to help build a local hospital. The Zieglers soon became involved in their community. Isabel helped start a local library, was a member of the noted local trio, Las Conquistadoras, and became the first woman president of the Espanola Chamber of Commerce. Dr. Ziegler carried on a busy medical practice as general surgeon and physician, and also served on the Espanola City Council for over twenty years even running for State Senator against northern New Mexico Democratic boss, Emilio Naranjo. Included are stories about Arthur and Phoebe Pack of the Ghost Ranch in Abiquiu who were the original donors for the hospital; Carolyn Dozier, a helper and friend of Isabel s from Santa Clara Pueblo; and Ben Talachi, a San Juan Indian who worked for the Zieglers at their home. There are also accounts of the Zieglers  experiences with Hamilton and Jean Garland of the fabled Swan Lake Ranch in Alcalde, and with the retired concert pianist John Marsh and his wife, Mary, from nearby Quartales. Lastly, there is a memorable portrait of Georgia O Keeffe who was a patient of Dr. Ziegler s for over 30 years, and a friend of the family. The book also reveals accounts of local politics and business, always with attention given to local people who participated. All in all, an important insight into the working and development of a local community.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=818-BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New World utopias: A photographic history of the search for community","description":"Here is a surprising photographic survey of communal life in the American West from 1870 to the present. Many of the nearly three hundred photographs assembled here have never before been published. Some were discovered by Paul Kagan among the remains of vanished communities. Others, taken by Kagan himself, depict the present-day ruins of once thriving communes. The communities that these photographs and the accompanying text bring so vividly to life include the political, the religious, and the occult - from Fountaingrove and Icaria Speranza to Pisgah Grande and the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center. All of them hold valuable lessons for the world of the future. As Paul Kagan writes: \\"Much of the life, and much of the story, is in the photographs. The photographs that I made represent my feelings about the communal remains, and the historical photographs show a little of the daily life of the groups. The accompanying text tells the communal history and, hopefully, raises some pertinent questions. The search for community is generally directed toward someplace 'over there.' Can the vision of the utopians be pursued here, in the context of life in the world?\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OG9PAAAAMAAJ&dq=New+World+utopias:+A+photographic+history+of+the+search+for+community&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arthur, a pilgrim","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UxAkzwEACAAJ&dq=Arthur,+a+pilgrim&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On the Town With the League of Gentlemen (League of Gentlemen Vol 1)","description":"The hilarious scripts of the BBC multi-award winning comedy series are presented here in one volume along with early drafts of the scripts, mini biographies of each character, unseen pictures, and early drawings from the writers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VALsAAAAMAAJ&dq=On+the+Town+With+the+League+of+Gentlemen+(League+of+Gentlemen+Vol+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Walk On!: A Guide for Babies of All Ages","description":"Tired of sitting on the floor all day long, a little baby makes his first attempts at standing up, taking a first step, and seeing the world from a different view.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=topAo6PhMmYC&dq=Walk+On!:+A+Guide+for+Babies+of+All+Ages&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dawn and the Impossible Three (The Baby-Sitters Club #5)","description":"The megahit series returns to charm and inspire another generation of baby-sitters!

Ting-Xing Ye s riveting first book, A Leaf in the Bitter Wind, is a memoir of growing up in Maoist China. It was an astonishing coming of age through the turbulent years of the Cultural Revolution (1966 - 1974). In the wave of revolutionary fervour, peasants neglected their crops, exacerbating the widespread hunger. While Ting-Xing was a young girl in Shanghai, her father s rubber factory was expropriated by the state, and he was demoted to a labourer. A botched operation left him paralyzed from the waist down, and his health deteriorated rapidly since a capitalist s well-being was not a priority. He died soon after, and then Ting-Xing watched her mother s struggle with poverty end in stomach cancer. By the time she was thirteen, Ting-Xing Ye was an orphan, entrusted with her brothers and sisters to her Great-Aunt, and on welfare. Still, the Red Guards punished the children for being born into the capitalist class. Schools were being closed; suicide was rampant; factories were abandoned for ideology; distrust of friends and neighbours flourished. Ting-Xing was sent to work on a distant northern prison farm at sixteen, and survived six years of backbreaking labour and severe conditions. She was mentally tortured for weeks until she agreed to sign a false statement accusing friends of anti-state activities. Somehow finding the time to teach herself English, often by listening to the radio, she finally made it to Beijing University in 1974 as the Revolution was on the wane   though the acquisition of knowledge was still frowned upon as a bourgeois desire and study was discouraged. Readers have been stunned and moved by this simply narrated personal account of a 1984-style ideology-gone-mad, where any behaviour deemed to be bourgeois was persecuted with the ferocity and illogic of a witch trial, and where a change in politics could switch right to wrong in a moment. The story of both a nation and an individual, the book spans a heady 35 years of Ye s life in China, until her eventual defection to Canada in 1987   and the wonderful beginning of a romance with Canadian author William Bell. The book was published in 1997. The 1990s saw the publication of several memoirs by Chinese now settled in North America. Ye s was not the first, yet earned a distinguished place as one of the most powerful, and the only such memoir written from Canada. It is the inspiring story of a woman refusing to  drift with the stream  and fighting her way through an impossible, unjust system. This compelling, heart-wrenching story has been published in Germany, Japan, the US, UK and Australia, where it went straight to #1 on the bestseller list and has been reprinted several times; Dutch, French and Turkish editions will appear in 2001.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-lPuQuwQ-iMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Echoes of Eagles: A Son, a Father and America's First Fighter Pilots","description":"Documents the heroic achievements of the fighter pilots of World War I, exploring the military experiences of the author's father as a member of the newly created U.S. Air Service.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I6jvAAAAMAAJ&dq=Echoes+of+Eagles:+A+Son,+a+Father+and+America%27s+First+Fighter+Pilots&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"German at a Glance: Phrase Book & Dictionary for Travelers (Barron's Languages at a Glance)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-_MQuAEACAAJ&dq=German+at+a+Glance:+Phrase+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Walk Through the Year (Edwin Way Teale Library of Nature Classics)","description":"Shares daily observations of nature during walks about the author's New England homestead","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hqBXAAAACAAJ&dq=A+Walk+Through+the+Year+(Edwin+Way+Teale+Library+of+Nature+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secret Teachings in the Art of Japanese Gardens: Design Principles, Aesthetic Values","description":"The art of the Japanese garden is a 1,500-year-old landscape design tradition that is still evolving, still instructive. Secret Teachings in the Art of Japanese Gardens explains the fundamental principles of this tradition and describes how those principles may be applied to a much wider range of environments than exists in Japan. In the first section the author draws on his own experience as an apprentice to a master gardener in Kyoto, as well as his considerable knowledge of Japanese classical texts, to present the garden design process in terms of three primary aesthetic considerations: Scenic effects--reproductions of appealing natural landscape forms. Sensory effects--varieties of scale, framing, rhythm, motion, and spatial quality. Cultural effects--the incorporation of allusions to classical literature, poetry, and painting. The final section comprises a complete translation of a classic gardening manual used by Buddhist monks in medieval Japan. Its rules for planting trees and setting rocks still make good design sense today, and the author includes numerous garden descriptions as examples of how ancient masters practiced their craft. This clear, authoritative work, fully illustrated with diagrams and photographs, elucidates much about the Japanese compositional sense. But at the same time it is a plea for a more holistic approach to landscape design-a recognition that a garden should conform to certain natural principles as well as meet the emotional needs of those who view it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BaNNEAAAQBAJ&dq=Secret+Teachings+in+the+Art+of+Japanese+Gardens:+Design+Principles,+Aesthetic+Values&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Querelle","description":"Jean Genet, French playwright, novelist and poet, turned the experiences in his life amongst pimps, whores, thugs and other fellow social outcasts into a poetic literature, with an honesty and explicitness unprecedented at the time. Widely considered an outstanding and unique figure in French literature, Genet wrote five novels between 1942 and 1947, now being republished by Faber & Faber in beautiful new paperback editions. Querelle of Brest is widely considered to be Jean Genet's most accomplished novel, which was made into a film by Rainer Werner Fassbinder in 1982. Querelle, a young sailor at large in the port of Brest, is an object of illicit desire to his diary-keeping superior officer, Lieutenant Seblon. He is coveted, too, by corrupt policeman Mario. He gives himself freely both to brothel-keeper Madame Lysiane and to her husband. But Querelle is a thief and a murderer -- not a man to be trusted or trifled with . . .

Recently, progress has been made in reducing involuntary exposure to secondhand smoke through legislation banning smoking in workplaces, restaurants, and other public places. The effect of legislation to ban smoking and its effects on the cardiovascular health of nonsmoking adults, however, remains a question. Secondhand Smoke Exposure and Cardiovascular Effects reviews available scientific literature to assess the relationship between secondhand smoke exposure and acute coronary events. The authors, experts in secondhand smoke exposure and toxicology, clinical cardiology, epidemiology, and statistics, find that there is about a 25 to 30 percent increase in the risk of coronary heart disease from exposure to secondhand smoke. Their findings agree with the 2006 Surgeon General's Report conclusion that there are increased risks of coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality among men and women exposed to secondhand smoke. However, the authors note that the evidence for determining the magnitude of the relationship between chronic secondhand smoke exposure and coronary heart disease is not very strong. Public health professionals will rely upon Secondhand Smoke Exposure and Cardiovascular Effects for its survey of critical epidemiological studies on the effects of smoking bans and evidence of links between secondhand smoke exposure and cardiovascular events, as well as its findings and recommendations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QoBjAgAAQBAJ&dq=Secondhand+Smoke&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Founders of Anne Arundel and Howard Counties, Maryland.

We are witnessing the decline and dissolution of the old order, the tumult and uncertainty of a new birth. Against this background, there is an urgent need for a coherent framework of meaning to lead us beyond the growing fragmentation of culture, belief and personal identity. Keiron Le Grice argues that the developing insights of a new cosmology could provide this framework, helping us to discover an underlying order shaping our life experiences. In a compelling synthesis of the ideas of seminal thinkers from depth psychology and the new paradigm sciences, Le Grice positions the new discipline of archetypal astrology at the centre of an emerging world view that reunifies psyche and cosmos, spirituality and science, mythology and metaphysi, and enables us to see mythic gods, heroes and themes in a fresh light. He draws especially on the work of C. G. Jung, Joseph Campbell, Richard Tarnas, Fritjof Capra, David Bohm and Brian Swimme. Heralding a 'rediscovery of the gods' and the passage into a new spiritual era, The Archetypal Cosmos presents a new understanding of the role of myth and archetypal principles in our lives, one that could give a cosmic perspective and deeper meaning to our personal experiences.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pmRrBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Use Your Business Cards for Success","description":"Your business card is usually the first tangible thing a customer/client will take with him or her after meeting you.

In more recent years, amateur naturalists have also turned their lenses to the world of butterflies, whose myriad species and fantastic shapes and colors offer an intriguing challenge to even the most seasoned birder. But while bird enthusiasts have always had the help of accurate and accessible handbooks, those observing butterflies have had no such advantage. Until now, that is.In this unique field guide, Jeffrey Glassberg has made butterfly watching a less frustrating and far more rewarding pastime, showing us how to find, identify, and enjoy the nearly 160 species that inhabit the Northeast. Butterflies Through Binoculars is the first butterfly guide to combine the immediacy and vividness of actual photographs of living butterflies with the traditional field guide format. While older guides cater to the collector, offering drawings that show the captured and mounted insect, this book shows butterflies in their natural poses and in the correct size relationship to related species. With Butterflies Through Binoculars in hand, the brilliant Tiger Swallowtail, the more dour Mourning Cloak, even the Rare Skipper itself will not elude identification by the beginning--or, for that matter, the more seasoned--observer. By focussing the guide on the Boston to Washington corridor, Glassberg has excluded the species from unrelated areas that have made older field guides so cumbersome. In addition, he provides entirely new field marks for butterfly identification, demonstrates how to identify subjects by way of the key characteristics butterflies are likely to display in their natural settings, shows how species can be recognized both from above and below, and explains how to differentiate between males and females.Besides being a handy guide to identification, Butterflies Through Binoculars also tells readers where to find particular species, giving a complete account of flight times, ranges, and seasonal patterns. Nine major locations for butterflying are described in great detail, and readers are directed to forty specific locations where uncommon--even rare--species can be found. And throughout the book, the basic natural history of each species is considered in a lively, readable fashion.For butterfly enthusiasts, for bird watchers who want to add a new dimension to their hobby, for anyone who is simply interested in exploring the wilds of their own back yard, Butterflies Through Binoculars will offer hours of delightful help and instruction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tEwgAQAAMAAJ&dq=Butterflies+through+Binoculars:+The+West+A+Field+Guide+to+the+Butterflies+of+Western+North+America+(Glassberg+Field+Guide+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blowing Bubbles ELT Edition (Cambridge Storybooks)","description":"This series of delightful storybooks is a flexible resource designed to help teachers engage and motivate young learners in the classroom.

Alzheimer's Disease: The Dignity Within: A Handbook for Caregivers, Family, and Friends was written in a workbook format aimed at increasing the caregiver's knowledge of the disease. As a result, these caregivers - whether family members, friends or health professionals - will be better equipped to nurture the dignity within people living with Alzheimer's and feel more confident doing so. The book is a tool for caregivers that will impact not only the way they relate to persons with Alzheimer's disease, but other relationships as well. It contains information on how to take care of a person with Alzheimer's disease by mapping out each stage of the disease and showing what can be done from a caregiving standpoint at these various stages. In addition, the book discusses how important it is for caregivers to take care of themselves. It educates readers with easy-to-understand charts and sketches on what physically happens to the brain during the progression of Alzheimer's. Its five sections focus on the nature of Alzheimer's disease and on being a caregiver, covering topics such as tips for caregivers; challenges and solutions; changes in the brain that are responsible for the problems associated with the disease; and much, much more. However, the most important tenet of the book is that we can better care for people with Alzheimer's by recognizing and nurturing the essence within a person living through the different stages of the disease. Both caregivers and people affected by Alzheimer's can live with a sense of dignity, importance, and self-esteem.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=abTSCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Illustrated History of Europe: A Unique Portrait of Europe's Common History (Henry Holt Reference Book)","description":"A history of Europe from prehistoric times to the present looks at the individuals, events, and cultures that have shaped it","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hZMQHAAACAAJ&dq=The+Illustrated+History+of+Europe:+A+Unique+Portrait+of+Europe%27s+Common+History+(Henry+Holt+Reference+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nightwatch: An Equinox Guide to Viewing the Universe","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7MupswEACAAJ&dq=Nightwatch:+An+Equinox+Guide+to+Viewing+the+Universe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adventures in the Big Bend: A Travel Guide","description":"This book will help turn every trip to Big Bend National Park into a memorable adventure.

Leadership \\"tools\\" are usually defined as computers, spreadsheets, data, and even experience, but in reality, leaders need thinking tools that are hard to come by, so they find themselves hunting and pecking for answers in books, at seminars, through on-the-job training programs, from mentors, and at business schools, and still, they're left with gaps. Surely, most leaders are good at what they do, but the daily challenges of their jobs, like accelerating growth, increasing productivity, driving innovation, doing more with less, and balancing work with life don't come with some sort of leadership toolkit...until now. In Paid to Think, international consultant David Goldsmith presents his groundbreaking approach to leadership and management based on research revealing the twelve specific activities that all leaders perform on a daily basis, and he provides you with each activity's accompanying tools and instructions proven to boost your performance and that of your entire organization. Take the uncertainty out of everyday leading, convert ideas to realities, and maximize your intellectual value.

The plot centres on Lizzie Greystock, a fortune-hunter who ensnares the sickly, dissipated Sir Florian Eustace and is soon left a very wealthy widow and mother. While clever and beautiful, Lizzie has several character flaws; the greatest of these is an almost pathological delight in lying, even when it cannot benefit her. (Trollope comments that Lizzie sees lies as \\"more beautiful than the truth.\\") Before he dies, the disillusioned Sir Florian discovers all this, but does not think to change the generous terms of his will.The diamonds of the book's title are a necklace, a family heirloom that Sir Florian gave to Lizzie to wear. Though they belong to her husband's estate (and thus eventually will be the property of her son), Lizzie refuses to relinquish them. She lies about the terms under which they were given to her, leaving their ownership unclear. The indignant Eustace family lawyer, Mr Camperdown, strives to retrieve the necklace, putting the Eustaces in an awkward position. On the one hand, the diamonds are valuable and Lizzie may not have a legal claim to them, but on the other, they do not want to antagonise the mother of the heir to the family estate (Lizzie having only a life interest).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M8MCzgEACAAJ&dq=The+Eustace+Diamonds+(Large+Print)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mystery of Godliness","description":"In The Mystery of Godliness, W.

Kate, the local cat lady, comes to the rescue, and Dave returns home with an ally: Cat, the stray tom that becomes Dave's confidante and his key to new friendships and experiences. Cat inadvertently leads Dave to Tom, a troubled 19-year-old who needs help, and Mary, a shy girl who opens Dave's eyes and ears to music and theater.

In that it is to some degree incomprehensible, the soul shares in the incomprehensibility of its Creator.

Her descriptions are so detailed, informed and analytical that her appreciation of Italian culture, history and art are evident. Also evident is her desire to educate her readers as to the importance of such details to travelers. Wharton includes readers in her travel dilemmas: should she continue to travel in the Swiss Alps or to go to the cities where there is art and architecture? She describes the geography she sees in terms of painter's landscapes. She sees a meadow as a perfect place for one of \\"Bonifazio's sumptuous picnics\\" while one drive looks out on a \\"pastoral of Giorgione's.\\" She provides a historical, spiritual and artistic view of hermits and their hermitages. Some of the sights Wharton took in no longer exist, at least as they were when she visited. The Farnesse Theatre was bombed during WWII. Its present restoration does not do the original justice, even though it was in disrepair when Wharton saw it. Wharton's tours of Italy, taken almost yearly during the span of her marriage, probably contributed to her creation of The Decoration of Houses with architect Ogden Codman, as she dedicates a whole chapter to the pleasing qualities of the Baroque architectural style. Many traditional Baroque elements were a critical part of the curriculum of the  cole des Beaux-Arts.

He soon finds himself caught up in the two tales of passion and intrigue that his Franciscan guide, a refugee like himself, relates. One is the story of Enzo Strecci, a Renaissance poet from Lombardy who has the ill fortune of falling in love with the wife of Francesco Mardi, his host and protector during a time of Hapsburg incursions and espionage. The other is the story of the Franciscan's own ill-fated passion for the local Communist police commander's daughter during Tito's rupture with Stalinism. Between Rimini, Italy, in 1535 and the Croatian island of Rab in 1948, lives and fates become intertwined, history repeats itself, and nostalgia for home proves itself to be bittersweet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OWv30WYPk8sC&dq=A+Castle+in+Romagna&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Calculus of Angels (The Age of Unreason, Book 2)","description":"In an alternate eighteenth-century Europe devastated by alchemical disaster, Sir Isaac Newton and his able assistant, Benjamin Franklin, confront enemies who seek humankind s destruction Sir Isaac Newton s discovery of philosopher s mercury in 1681 gave rise to a remarkable new branch of alchemical science.

In the annals of American literature, there has never been a character quite like Doctor Rat, PhD. From one of the most indispensable storytellers in speculative fiction, this biting satire introduces a narrator of learned charm and humor, and a twisted logic that is absolutely chilling. Doctor Rat is a credit to his species. A survivor of the most refined scientific experiments, now removed from the maze, he has become a valued and productive member of the academic community. When he must administer a lethal dose, he comforts his fellow rats with his compassionate slogan:  Death is freedom.  But everything changes when animals worldwide begin to rebel, refusing to accept their proper places in the natural order of things: as test subjects, pets, or food. And only Doctor Rat has the courage to defend mankind from the ungrateful animal kingdom. Hailed by the Los Angeles Times as  dazzlingly original  and  occasionally quite beautiful,  Doctor Rat is a sly and stylish indictment of fanaticism in mice and men.  A truly imaginative impresario . . . [Doctor Rat] teases your conscience with educated wit and versatile improvisation, not to mention the casual flick of the tail about to be cut off.

Horst Ruthrof argues, by contrast, that the body is an integral part of this hermeneutic activity. Strictly language-based theories, and theories which conflate formal and natural languages, run into problems when they describe how we communicate in cultural settings. Semantics and the Body proposes that language is no more than a symbolic grid which does not signify at all unless it is brought to life by non-linguistic signs. Ruthrof reviews and analyses various 'orthodox' theories of meaning, from the views of Gottlob Frege at the beginning of the twentieth century to those of theorists in the postmodern period, then offers an alternative approach of his own. His theory features 'corporeal semantics,' and holds that meaning has ultimately to do with the body and that the meaning of linguistic expressions is indeterminate without the aid of visual, tactile, olfactory, and other bodily signs. This approach also remedies what Ruthrof sees also as a loss of interpretive will in the postmodern era. Pedagogy in many fields could be enriched by a systemic integration of non-verbal semiosis into the linguistically dominated syllabus. Those involved in discourse analysis, literature, art criticism, film theory, pedagogy, and philosophy will find the implications of Ruthrof's study considerable.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RgTmDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Am a Woman by God's Design","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SxfXAAAACAAJ&dq=I+Am+a+Woman+by+God%27s+Design&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Islam in Focus (WAMY Studies on Islam)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FMUkKQAACAAJ&dq=Islam+in+Focus+(WAMY+Studies+on+Islam)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Storm Warriors","description":"Driven from his home by the Ku Klux Klan and still reeling from the death of his mother, Nathan moves with his father and grandfather to the desolate Pea Island on the Outer Banks of North Carolina to start a new life.

Because little music criticism in foreign languages is accessible to English- speaking readers, Harry Haskell has made a special point of exemplifying regional traditions of critical writing from throughout the Western world. Included in The Attentive Listener are articles not only from England, Western Europe, and the United States, but also from Russia, Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, Latin America, and Canada. Each of the one hundred articles here relates to one or more topics of central importance in music history, such as the nature of musical taste and criticism, operatic reform, cultural nationalism, the value of tradition, and the impact of modern technologies on composers, performers, and audiences. The Attentive Listener differs from previous anthologies of musical writings in its emphasis on journalistic criticism, its broadly international scope, and the thematic organization of the articles, most of which have not been translated or anthologized before. The writers represented include not only professional critics and scholars but also composers such as Debussy, Berlioz, Tchaikovsky, Janacek, and Virgil Thomson, and literary figures such as Heine, Boito, and Shaw.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Pn5xQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Attentive+Listener+-+Three+Centuries+of+Music+Criticism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cultivating the Ch'I (Chen Kung)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CzkUPQAACAAJ&dq=Cultivating+the+Ch%27I+(Chen+Kung)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Know your child","description":"Today's parents are faced with a wealth of exciting but often confusing new ideas about child development and parent-child relationships. In this liberating and enlightening book, Stella Chess and Alexander Thomas, whose pioneering studies have earned them a worldwide reputation, draw on their own and others' research to systematically sort out fact from fantasy about how children develop. In lively layman's language they provide authoritative and timely answers to the questions parents most often ask, such as How crucial are my child's first three years?, Can IQ be changed?, and Is adolescent rebellion inevitable'.

It follows the trials of a parent of a special needs child and the struggles of raising her while making life choices that affect not only her life but also the lives of her three children. Her narrative will guide you through failed relationships and bad decisions, all while exploring what the child would have said if only her mother had been listening. The writer uses letters written from the children's perspective and the mother s ultimate response of what was done and perhaps what maybe should ve been done instead. Her daughter s condition and ultimate quality of life were always predetermined by physicians who would diagnose the worst-case scenarios with extreme confidence in their tones. This tale goes through the process of a child deemed to never walk, talk, or see to a child who would ultimately prove everybody wrong. In our current climate, this book may act as a guide for the lost Christian. It shines a light on somebody that may not be a theologian, saint, or studious academic but more so the average Joe (or Joyce) who is just beginning their travels back to a faith-filled life. Dear Mommy has been written to empower those like the writer who feel unworthy and ill equipped to start believing and begin learning about their faith. It takes the reader down a path of self-loathing and disappointment and guides to the ideals of repentance and self-forgiveness using the simplest of instruction to love.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bWd9EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Public relations, (Vocational and professional monographs)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i-k_nQEACAAJ&dq=Public+relations,+(Vocational+and+professional+monographs)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"King Blood (Armchair Detective Library)","description":"A world list of books in the English language.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ggo0AAAAMAAJ&dq=King+Blood+(Armchair+Detective+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crisp: Sales Training Basics, Third Edition: What You Need to Know About Selling (Crisp Fifty-Minute Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GpMgAQAAMAAJ&dq=Crisp:+Sales+Training+Basics,+Third+Edition:+What+You+Need+to+Know+About+Selling+(Crisp+Fifty-Minute+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fool's Errand Bookmark","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5xsCAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Too Many Rabbits and Other Fingerplays: About Animals, Nature, Weather, and the Universe","description":"Twenty fingerplays teach young readers about nature and science by imitating blinking fireflies, sprouting seeds, spinning planets, and other simple scientific concepts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aCU9HAAACAAJ&dq=Too+Many+Rabbits+and+Other+Fingerplays:+About+Animals,+Nature,+Weather,+and+the+Universe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Claudia And Mean Janine (Baby-Sitters Club #7)","description":"Claudia and her sister, Janine, may as well be from two different planets.

The market was large and contested, encompassing not just what might today be considered pornographic material but also sexually explicit fiction of authors such as James Joyce, Theodore Dreiser, and D.H. Lawrence; mail-order manuals; pulp romances; and \\"little dirty comics.\\" Bookleggers and Smuthounds vividly brings to life this significant chapter in American publishing history, revealing the subtle, symbiotic relationship between the publishers of erotica and the moralists who attached them and how the existence of both groups depended on the enduring appeal of prurience. By keeping intact the association of sex with obscenity and shameful silence, distributors of erotica simultaneously provided the antivice crusaders with a public enemy. Jay Gertzman offers unforgettable portrayals of the \\"pariah capitalists\\" who shaped the industry, and of the individuals, organizations, and government agencies that sought to control them. Among the most compelling personalities we meet are the notorious publisher Samuel Roth, \\"the Prometheus of the Unprintable,\\" and his nemesis, John Sumner, head of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, a man aggressive in his pursuit of pornographers and in his quest for a morally united and ethnically homogeneous America.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eUZL1_zoMWcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"That They May Be Won","description":"A reasonably priced, quality black hardcover pew and ministry Bible featuring a large 12-point font.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rbQ4MAEACAAJ&dq=That+They+May+Be+Won&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mistaken Wedding (Harlequin Presents #1142)","description":"Mistaken wedding: Theirs was a holiday romance which should never have led to the altar but, when circumstances forced her to ask Luis for help, she rediscovered just how dangerous his attraction could be.

Included are popular myths and legends from all six Celtic cultures of Western Europe Irish, Scots, Manx, Welsh, Cornish, and Breton. Here for the modern reader are the rediscovered tales of cattle raids, tribal invasions, druids, duels, and doomed love that have been incorporated into, and sometimes distorted by, European mythology and even Christian figures. For example, there is the story of Lugh of the Long Hand, one of the greatest gods in the Celtic pantheon, who was later transformed into the faerie craftsman Lugh-Chromain, and finally demoted to the lowly Leprechaun. Celtic Myths and Legends also retells the story of the classic tragic love story of Tristan and Iseult (probably of Cornish origin there was a real King Mark and a real Tristan in Cornwall) and the original tale of King Arthur, a Welsh leader who fought against the invading Anglo-Saxons. In the hands of Peter Berresford Ellis, the myths sung by long-dead Celtic bards come alive to enchant the modern reader. \\"The casual reader will be best entertained by ... the legends themselves ...colored with plenty of swordplay, ... quests, shape-shiftings, and druidic sorcery.\\" Publishers Weekly","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=07jcswEACAAJ&dq=Celtic+Myths+(Legendary+Past)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Interest Group Society (3rd Edition)","description":"This book describes a great change in the interest groups in American politics and includes analysis of the legal limits of non-profit politics.

A Biography.","description":"Washington Irving's Life of George Washington (published in five volumes in 1856-59) was the product of his last years and remains his most personal work. Christened with the name of the great general, Irving was blessed by Washington while still a boy of seven, and later came to know many of the prominent figures of the Revolution. In these pages he describes them using firsthand source material and observation. The result is a book which is fascinating not only for its subject (the American Revolution), but also for how it reveals in illuminating detail the personality and humanity of a now remote, towering icon. Here is an intimate portrait of Washington the man, from Virginia youth to colonial commander to commander-in-chief of the patriot army to first president and great guiding force of the American federation. But one cannot read Irving's Life without marveling at the supreme art behind it, for his biography is foremost a work of literature. Charles Neider's abridgment and editing of Irving's long out-of-print classic has created a literary work comparable in importance and elegance to the original. George Washington, A Biography, Neider's title for his edition of Irving's Life, makes the work accessible to modern audiences. The extensive introduction provides a detailed analysis of Irving's life and times, and the difficulties he faced as he worked against his own failing health to finish what he felt was his masterpiece.

Benchmarks for Science Literacy takes this one step further. Created in close consultation with a cross-section of American teachers, administrators, and scientists, Benchmarks elaborates on the recommendations to provide guidelines for what all students should know and be able to do in science, mathematics, and technology by the end of grades 2, 5, 8, and 12. These grade levels offer reasonable checkpoints for student progress toward science literacy, but do not suggest a rigid formula for teaching. Benchmarks is not a proposed curriculum, nor is it a plan for one: it is a tool educators can use as they design curricula that fit their student's needs and meet the goals first outlined in Science for All Americans. Far from pressing for a single educational program, Project 2061 advocates a reform strategy that will lead to more curriculum diversity than is common today. IBenchmarks emerged from the work of six diverse school-district teams who were asked to rethink the K-12 curriculum and outline alternative ways of achieving science literacy for all students. These teams based their work on published research and the continuing advice of prominent educators, as well as their own teaching experience. Focusing on the understanding and interconnection of key concepts rather than rote memorization of terms and isolated facts, Benchmarks advocates building a lasting understanding of science and related fields. In a culture increasingly pervaded by science, mathematics, and technology, science literacy require habits of mind that will enable citizens to understand the world around them, make some sense of new technologies as they emerge and grow, and deal sensibly with problems that involve evidence, numbers, patterns, logical arguments, and technology--as well as the relationship of these disciplines to the arts, humanities, and vocational sciences--making science literacy relevant to all students, regardless of their career paths. If Americans are to participate in a world shaped by modern science and mathematics, a world where technological know-how will offer the keys to economic and political stability in the twenty-first century, education in these areas must become one of the nation's highest priorities. Together with Science for All Americans, Benchmarks for Science Literacy offers a bold new agenda for the future of science education in this country, one that is certain to prepare our children for life in the twenty-first century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SKb94qXqOnQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Dry Spell","description":"Nina is worried about her son; he has a strange new girlfriend, and it looks like he's on drugs.

For Warford, renewal is not a matter of restoring what already has been, but being committed to thoughtful, faith-based innovation.

Born in Arthur Conan Doyle was born on 22 May 1859 at 11 Picardy Place, Edinburgh, Scotland. From 1876 - 1881 he studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh following which he was employed as a doctor on the Greenland whaler Hope of Peterhead in 1880 and, after his graduation, as a ship's surgeon on the SS Mayumba during a voyage to the West African coast in 1881. Arriving in Portsmouth in June of that year with less than 10 (700 today) to his name, he set up a medical practice at 1 Bush Villas in Elm Grove, Southsea. The practice was initially not very successful. While waiting for patients, Conan Doyle again began writing stories and composed his first novel The Mystery of Cloomber. Although he continued to study and practice medicine his career was now firmly set as a writer.

She has held senior marketing positions at Kraft General Foods and the Pittsburgh Brewing Company; was in product management for Ralston Purina, HJ Heinz, and Frito-Lay; worked as a sales representative for Proctor and Gamble; and managed her own part-time marketing consultant business.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gKlRigUZl_wC&dq=The+Wall+Between+Women:+the+Conflict+Between+Stay-at-home+and+Employed+Mothers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Remarkable Woman","description":"An account of the life and times of Beatrice Marguerite","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MXlnzgEACAAJ&dq=A+Remarkable+Woman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oracle8 Pl/SQL Black Book","description":"Oracle professionals can use this book to quickly learn the features of the latest Oracle release. \\"Oracle8 PL/SQL Black Book\\" presents the formal syntax, usage, and actual examples for every declaration, command, and error handler.

Standing alongside Norman Mailer s The Naked and the Dead and James Jones s From Here to Eternity, The Young Lions is one of the most powerful American novels to tackle the Second World War. Ambitious in its scope and robust in its prose, Irwin Shaw s work is also deeply humanistic, presenting the reality of war as seen through the eyes of ordinary soldiers on both sides. The story follows the individual dramas and ultimately intertwined destinies of Christian Diestl, a Nazi sergeant; Noah Ackerman, a Jewish American infantryman; and Michael Whitacre, an idealistic urbanite from the New York theatrical world. Diestl first appears as a dashing ski instructor in Austria, mouthing his loyalty to Nazi ideals. As the war progresses, Diestl s character continues to erode as he descends into savagery. Ackerman must endure domestic anti-Semitism and beatings in boot camp before proving himself in the European theater. Eventually, as part of the liberating army, he comes face-to-face with the unimaginable horrors of the death camps. Whitacre, trading cocktail parties for Molotov cocktails, confronts the barbarism of war, and in fighting simply to survive, finds his own capacity for heroism. Shaw s sweeping narrative is at once vivid, exciting, and brutally realistic as well as poignant in its portrayal of the moral devastation and institutional insanity of war. Penned by a master storyteller at the height of his craft, The Young Lions stands the test of time as a classic novel of war and the human experience. This ebook features an illustrated biography of Irwin Shaw including rare images and never-before-seen documents from the author s estate.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=baJMV9qRvoQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"El Asirio (Spanish Edition)","description":"An extraordinary historical epic of love and war in ancient Assyria during a time of dreadful omens, tortures, invasions, and a bloody civil war, from the bestselling author of Chain Reaction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=onQMngEACAAJ&dq=El+Asirio+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction To Anthony Robbins Personal Power II","description":"Emotions are the driving force behind all human action and experience.

Alan Flusser's name is synonymous with taste and style. With his new book, he combines his encyclopedic knowledge of men's clothes with his signature wit and elegance to address the fundamental paradox of modern men's fashion: Why, after men today have spent more money on clothes than in any other period of history, are there fewer well-dressed men than at any time ever before? According to Flusser, dressing well is not all that difficult, the real challenge lies in being able to acquire the right personalized instruction. Dressing well pivots on two pillars -- proportion and color. Flusser believes that \\"Permanent Fashionability,\\" both his promise and goal for the reader, starts by being accountable to a personal set of physical trademarks and not to any kind of random, seasonally served-up collection of fashion flashes. Unlike fashion, which is obliged to change each season, the face's shape, the neck's height, the shoulder's width, the arm's length, the torso's structure, and the foot's size remain fairly constant over time. Once a man learns how to adapt the fundamentals of permanent fashion to his physique and complexion, he's halfway home. Taking the reader through each major clothing classification step-by-step, this user-friendly guide helps you apply your own specifics to a series of dressing options, from business casual and formalwear to pattern-on-pattern coordination, or how to choose the most flattering clothing silhouette for your body type and shirt collar for your face. A man's physical traits represent his individual road map, and the quickest route toward forging an enduring style of dress is through exposure to the legendary practitioners of this rare masculine art. Flusser has assembled the largest andmost diverse collection of stylishly mantled men ever found in one book. Many never-before-seen vintage photographs from the era of Cary Grant, Tyrone Power, and Fred Astaire are employed to help illustrate the range and diversity of authentic men's fashion. Dressing the Man's sheer magnitude of options will enable the reader to expand both the grammar and verbiage of his permanent-fashion vocabulary. For those men hoping to find sartorial fulfillment somewhere down the road, tethering their journey to the mind-set of permanent fashion will deliver them earlier rather than later in life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hBnCNOhoh1sC&dq=Dressing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shadows of Empire: Colonial Discourse and Javanese Tales","description":"Shadows of Empire explores Javanese shadow theater as a staging area for negotiations between colonial power and indigenous traditions. Charting the shifting boundaries between myth and history in Javanese Mahabharata and Ramayana tales, Laurie J. Sears reveals what happens when these stories move from village performances and palace manuscripts into colonial texts and nationalist journals and, most recently, comic books and novels. Historical, anthropological, and literary in its method and insight, this work offers a dramatic reassessment of both Javanese literary/theatrical production and Dutch scholarship on Southeast Asia. Though Javanese shadow theater (wayang) has existed for hundreds of years, our knowledge of its history, performance practice, and role in Javanese society only begins with Dutch documentation and interpretation in the nineteenth century. Analyzing the Mahabharata and Ramayana tales in relation to court poetry, Islamic faith, Dutch scholarship, and nationalist journals, Sears shows how the shadow theater as we know it today must be understood as a hybrid of Javanese and Dutch ideas and interests, inseparable from a particular colonial moment. In doing so, she contributes to a reenvisioning of European histories that acknowledges the influence of Asian, African, and New World cultures on European thought and to a rewriting of colonial and postcolonial Javanese histories that questions the boundaries and content of history and story, myth and allegory, colonialism and culture. Shadows of Empire will appeal not only to specialists in Javanese culture and historians of Indonesia, but also to a wide range of scholars in the areas of performance and literature, anthropology, Southeast Asian studies, and postcolonial studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UHBBal6w30wC&dq=Shadows+of+Empire:+Colonial+Discourse+and+Javanese+Tales&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strange Days Morrison","description":"The wife of Jim Morrison offers a thorough portrait of the enigmatic leader of the Doors, discussing the shy, private, complex man he was, plus Woodstock, the Miami obscenity trial, and other rock celebrities. 75,000 first printing.

Jose Fonseca proposes that the concepts behind the innovation experiences cannot be traced to any particular time, space or individual, even if one person has figured prominently. The innovative ideas in the examples considered did not occur as a direct product of a purposeful search triggered by the perception of some problem to solve, nor did they result from a sequential process that was laid out in advance. Instead, innovative ideas were a product of streams of conversations that extended over long periods of time and were characterized by critical degrees of misunderstanding and redundancy. Fonseca's book presents innovation as new meaning potentially emerging in ongoing, every-day conversations. Drawing on the theory of complex responsive process, developed in the first two volumes of this series, Fonseca presents a particular way of understanding innovation. The experiences of innovation studied in this book suggest that innovations do not start with a match between a need to be satisfied and a set of competencies and tools purposefully brought together to meet the need. On the contrary, identification of need is a consequence of success, rather than a pre-condition. The innovations studied in this book (a selection of innovation experiences from Portugal are considered) were subject to constant and never ending redefinition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yOW1GjJhZXoC&dq=Complexity+and+Management+(Complexity+and+Emergence+in+Organizations)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shipwreck","description":"Sir Ernest Shackleton and his expedition team's journey to the Antarctic continent in 1914 goes terribly wrong after their boat is trapped and crushed by ice, leaving them stranded in the most harsh conditions and fighting for their very lives with every step they took.

Lewis Tour in Oxford","description":"For anyone who is interested in the life of this celebrated author. Ronald K. Brind has combined his own life-long interest with extensive research to produce a comprehensive guide of the Oxford area, taking in all the sites of significance in the story of C. S. Lewis. The guide can be used in isolation or as a companion publication to the C. S. Lewis Tours run by this author. Clive Staples Lewis was a prolific writer in many fields; some of his most notable titles, such as The Screwtape Letters, Mere Christianity and The Problem of Pain discuss religion and his own passionate commitment after a period of uncertainty. He is perhaps best known among children for the books in his Chronicles of Narnia series. Yet, during his time at the Kilns, the Oxford home he moved to in 1930 and he lived until his death in 1963, the magnitude of his contribution to literature was scarcely recognised. He and his older brother Warnie were simply known as the Professor and the Major, respectively. This account of C. S. Lewis life is both detailed and intensely personal. Ronald K. Brind was a boyhood friend of one of Lewis step-sons, Dougie, and was a regular visitor to the Lewis household. Indeed, this makes the feeling of the author all the more acute that the lifetime surroundings of this great literary figure should be valued and afforded more respect and attention than is currently the case.

The situation is not helped by the strict and narrow-minded interpretation of the religion by a number its adherents. However, those who are willing to scratch below the surface and look further will see that nothing is further from the truth; that Islam does not teach anything except universal love, mercy, compassion, peace & benevolence. Dr Muhammad Tahir-ul-Qadri is an eminent and internationally renowned Islamic scholar, orator and author. In this book, he presents numerous quotations from the Qur'an and authentic hadith to help the reader discover the prime position of the qualities of mercy and compassion in the Islamic faith. Dr Tahir-ul-Qadri has meticulously referenced all quotations to ensure accuracy and clarity in order to dispel any doubts about the matter. Through his distinctive solid scholarship and methodology, Dr Tahir-ul-Qadri demonstrates how Islam promotes spiritual endeavour, moderation, ease and tolerance, and is not merely concerned with ritualism and outward forms of piety. For Muslims, this book is essential reading to help reclaim Islam back from those who portray it as merely a socio-political enterprise devoid of compassion for humanity and the rest of creation. Non-Muslims, on the other hand, will be able to appreciate these lesser known aspects of Islam, which in fact form its core philosophy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S7HcngEACAAJ&dq=10-7+double+bonus+video+poker:+A+complete+%22how+to+beat+the+casino%22+discussion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Art & Life in Renaissance Venice (Abrams Perspectives)","description":"Depicts five hundred paintings and sculptures from the Middle Ages to the present, each by a different artist, in alphabetical order by artist, with a brief description of the work and its place in art history and in the artist's career.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bltTPgAACAAJ&dq=Art&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Morte Darthur (York Medieval Texts)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9T_3zQEACAAJ&dq=Morte+Darthur+(York+Medieval+Texts)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Last Love","description":"THE LAST LOVE begins as Napoleon, defeated and a prisoner, arrives at the island of St. Helena to begin his exile.

Welcome to southeast Michigan and the small town of Carlson where faith, hope, and struggle are defined by the different faces of those who live there. An addict that sits at a bar to forget. A mother whose five-year-old boy has leukemia. Two doctors. An atheist haunted by his past and a brilliant young oncologist that places all her hope in the power of modern medicine. A blind pastor whose son hasn t spoken a single word in thirty-eight years. But the minister sees by faith. He knows there are answers and believes that someone who cares is watching someone with a greater purpose. Yet there is something he doesn t know... that none of them know. In the midst of the ordinary and the devastat- ing, there is a reason these lives will be changed forever. Lightning is about to strike. The Reason opens with a thunderbolt and never lets up as it introduces us to everyday characters who are wrestling with questions: Where is God when bad things happen? Does God ignore the prayers of the faithful? The answer each character receives will astound readers while offering an unforgettable call to hope, to change, and to believe.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XSZgDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Practical PostgreSQL (O'Reilly Unix)","description":"Arguably the most capable of all the open source databases, PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system first developed in 1977 by the University of California at Berkeley. In spite of its long history, this robust database suffers from a lack of easy-to-use documentation. Practical PostgreSQL fills that void with a fast-paced guide to installation, configuration, and usage. This comprehensive new volume shows you how to compile PostgreSQL from source, create a database, and configure PostgreSQL to accept client-server connections. It also covers the many advanced features, such as transactions, versioning, replication, and referential integrity that enable developers and DBAs to use PostgreSQL for serious business applications. The thorough introduction to PostgreSQL's PL/pgSQL programming language explains how you can use this very useful but under-documented feature to develop stored procedures and triggers. The book includes a complete command reference, and database administrators will appreciate the chapters on user management, database maintenance, and backup & recovery. With Practical PostgreSQL, you will discover quickly why this open source database is such a great open source alternative to proprietary products from Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=52ENWgsOWLUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Max the Minnow (Eyeball Animation): Board Book Edition","description":"Like most little guys, Max wants to be a big fish too!

Teubal peels away millenia of patriarchal distortion to reveal the lost tradition of biblical matriarchs. In Ancient Sisterhood: The Lost Traditions of Hagar and Sarah (originally published as Hagar the Egyptian), she shows that Hagar, the mother of Ishmael, was actually lady-in-waiting to the priestess Sarah and participated in an ancient Near Eastern custom of surrogate motherhood. Ancient Sisterhood cites evidence that Hebrew women actually enjoyed the privileges and sanctity of their own religious practices. These practices, however, were gradually eroded and usurped by the establishment of patriarchal monarchies that were based on militaristic conquest and power. Teubal examines the figures of Hagar and Sarah from a feminist perspective that combines thorough scholarship with an informed and detailed understanding of the cultural and religious influences from which the mysterious biblical figure of Hagar emerged. She looks at Hagar's important role in the genesis of Hebrew culture, her role as mother of the Islamic nations, and her power as a matriarch as opposed to her apparent status as a concubine. Teubal posits two distinct sources for the Hagar episodes: Hagar as companion to Sarah and an unknown woman whom she refers to as the desert matriarch. She explores whether Hagar was a slave to Abraham or Sarah, the differences between Hagar and the desert matriarch, and the obscurantism of these important elements in biblical texts. Teubal sheds considerable light on two central figures of these world religions and \\"the disassociation of woman from her own female religious experience.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BIYDAAAACAAJ&dq=Ancient+Sisterhood:+Lost+Traditions+Of+Hagar&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Enciclopedia Salvat de la Fauna Obra Completa 16 vols.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iWJlS8NXXWQC&dq=Enciclopedia+Salvat+de+la+Fauna+Obra+Completa+16+vols.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Head Rush Ajax (Head First)","description":"Provides information on using Ajax in building Web applications.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LkO6MMTwx5kC&dq=Head+Rush+Ajax+(Head+First)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crossroad (Star Trek, Book 71)","description":"The crew of the Nautilus,a battered Starship of mysterious origin, is beamed aboard the Starship Enterprise?.The group claims they are freedom fighters from the future working to save the Federation from the Consilium -- a group of corrupt power-seekers.

Controversial on the left and the right for his critiques of objectivity and political radicalism, Rorty experienced a renown denied to all but a handful of living philosophers. In this masterly biography, Neil Gross explores the path of Rorty s thought over the decades in order to trace the intellectual and professional journey that led him to that prominence. The child of a pair of leftist writers who worried that their precocious son  wasn t rebellious enough,  Rorty enrolled at the University of Chicago at the age of fifteen. There he came under the tutelage of polymath Richard McKeon, whose catholic approach to philosophical systems would profoundly influence Rorty s own thought. Doctoral work at Yale led to Rorty s landing a job at Princeton, where his colleagues were primarily analytic philosophers. With a series of publications in the 1960s, Rorty quickly established himself as a strong thinker in that tradition but by the late 1970s Rorty had eschewed the idea of objective truth altogether, urging philosophers to take a  relaxed attitude  toward the question of logical rigor. Drawing on the pragmatism of John Dewey, he argued that philosophers should instead open themselves up to multiple methods of thought and sources of knowledge an approach that would culminate in the publication of Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature, one of the most seminal and controversial philosophical works of our time. In clear and compelling fashion, Gross sets that surprising shift in Rorty s thought in the context of his life and social experiences, revealing the many disparate influences that contribute to the making of knowledge. As much a book about the growth of ideas as it is a biography of a philosopher, Richard Rorty will provide readers with a fresh understanding of both the man and the course of twentieth-century thought.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0x3T3fPCqzcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Star Trek 3","description":"No one on the Enterprise can believe that Mr. Spock is gone...

The author feels strongly that, in order to reverse the presently destructive impacts of Human Technology on the Global Biosphere, a Transformative Revolution in Human Consciousness must first take place. Such a \\"Magnificent Revolution\\" would take the form of Twelve Futuristic MetaStrategies...each of which would represent a Key SocioEcological Paradigm in itself. Each chapter of the book is developed around a MetaStrategy, providing examples of the Major Problems, as well as Innovative Solutions for reversing these Destructive Trends...through selected applications of Unique Alternative Technologies and Strategies. Dr. Maynard's Twelve MetaStrategies for Planetary Management are essentially a set of enlightened, yet effective, tools for Creative Thinking and Action. They are designed to promote environmentally sustainable future scenarios for the maximum benefit for Humans, their Planetary Homeworld, and for the Generations Yet to Come. In spite of the mounting evidence of environmental damage and disturbance to our Natural Planetary Systems, Dr. Maynard contends that solutions to these problems are available through insightful applications of Alternative Technologies, which can provide Clean Renewable Energy, Efficient Non-Polluting Transportation, Hi-Energy Nutrition, and Ecologically Appropriate Lifestyles for everyone on Earth. To achieve such a meaningful and lasting transformation, the author feels we must move rapidly and efficiently beyond the entanglements of 20th Century Thinking, and blaze adventurous new pathways into the Future. Together we must find the courage to explore the promising applications of alternative leading-edge Technologies, which often exist outside the boundaries of the Mainstream Scientific Thought. -- Elliott Maynard Blog.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AXkjj2lvlu0C&dq=Transforming+The+Global+Biosphere&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The last days of the British raj","description":"Controversial account of the blunders during the year that ended British rule in India, 1946-1947.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cDkdywEACAAJ&dq=The+last+days+of+the+British+raj&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lords of the Middle Dark/Book One of the Rings of the Master","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Sk-uPwAACAAJ&dq=Lords+of+the+Middle+Dark/Book+One+of+the+Rings+of+the+Master&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heather the Violet Fairy (Rainbow Magic #7)","description":"When the evil Jack Frost sends the Rainbow Fairies away, Rachel and Kirsty hope that a merry-go-round that transports them to a magical world will lead them to Heather.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q5YDUzCjIigC&dq=Heather+the+Violet+Fairy+(Rainbow+Magic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Julie (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","description":"A common enemy draws together Jered Marcus Benton, the arrogant Duke of Bradford, and Caroline Richmond, a beautiful woman from Boston with a mysterious past","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m6o3YgEACAAJ&dq=Julie+(G+K+Hall+Large+Print+Book+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Two Brothers and Their Magic Gourds (Korean Folk Story for Children, Series II)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mc5HGQAACAAJ&dq=Two+Brothers+and+Their+Magic+Gourds+(Korean+Folk+Story+for+Children,+Series+II)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Susan Rothenberg","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wWK4zgEACAAJ&dq=Susan+Rothenberg&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Zen Eye: A Collection of Zen Talks by Sokei-An (Zen in Your Ear)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YgEQAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Zen+Eye:+A+Collection+of+Zen+Talks+by+Sokei-An+(Zen+in+Your+Ear)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"HERCULES, MY SHIPMATE","description":"The author of I, Claudius puts his own twist on the myth of the Argonauts  quest for the Golden Fleece:  A tour de force . . . A richly tapestried epic  (Kirkus Reviews). An inventive reimagining of the story of Jason and the Argonauts, this novel by renowned poet and classicist Robert Graves brings heroic figures of Hellenistic myth to life. Graves s Jason is belligerent, energetic, and full of life, and the society Graves builds for him is outlandish and deeply invested in ancient cults. Against this primitive, religious backdrop, the charismatic Jason assembles a crew and sets out to retrieve the sacred gold-trimmed fleece that is sacred to Zeus, and that has been stolen by worshippers of the Triple Goddess. Accompanying him is Hercules, a brave warrior known more for his brawn, and his astonishingly good luck, than his brains. Robert Graves builds a compelling world that sets Hellenistic magic and mystery in a surprisingly gritty, realistic setting, a fascinating read for fans of Greek mythology.  A witty historical novel with much insider s lore on cult and ritual.   The New York Review of Books  Richly readable, thoroughly classical yet individually interpreted, this is a labor of love important to students, culture-seekers and readers.

If we take the time to listen very closely to our children speak about their experiences beyond our front doors, we hear an entirely different story about their lives than the one we adults tell.  Unlike many other books about difficult kids that reflect the wisdom of adults, this one explores the truth of adolescence. It builds on recent explorations of youth such as Mary Pipher s Reviving Ophelia, Judith Rich Harris  The Nurture Assumption, and William Pollack s Real Boys. It examines emerging trends in psychology, as well as recent innovations in work with our most unhealthy young people. Playing at Being Bad offers particular insight for parents, teachers, and caregivers of troubled youth just beginning, or already stuck in, patterns of delinquency, drug or alcohol addiction, sexual promiscuity, violence, suicide, depression, and truancy. This book tells the story of the teens Ungar worked with for more than fifteen years, taking a close look at the crises kids face, while exploring the important role that adults can play in keeping dangerous and delinquent youth from drifting further into trouble.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uJDUhZigiskC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Empire of Unreason (The Age of Unreason, Book 3)","description":"On an eighteenth-century Earth crippled by alchemical disaster, a secret American cabal led by Benjamin Franklin strives to prevent the annihilation of humankind The dark magic that the great alchemist Sir Isaac Newton inadvertently unleashed with his discovery of philosopher s mercury has taken a devastating toll on Earth: The destruction of Europe and the advent of eternal winter have aided the mysterious malakim in their apparent quest for the annihilation of the human race.

At times people are truthful with what they reveal about themselves. But more often than not, a person's innermost thoughts, desires, and dilemmas remain hidden from others-including close family and friends. People rarely reveal their past mistakes, but in The Dandelions of Woodlawn Avenue, author Jo Singel shares her unsent letters and her journal and diary entries with the world. If you have ever felt alone-emotionally in the dark, afraid and with no one to turn to-her story will connect you, soul-to-soul, with the everyday struggles, discoveries, joys, and challenges of an ordinary woman who wants to free herself of the imposed restrictions of society, culture, family, relationships and work demands. Jo's world is inhabited by disturbing portraits of people and relationships that go beyond the surface and explore the basic emotions of love, fear, anger, shame, and denial. The Dandelions of Woodlawn Avenue examines life and looks at what happens, what doesn't happen, and what might have been.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oDi0mAEACAAJ&dq=The+Dandelions+of+Woodlawn+Avenue:+%22A+woman%27s+search+for+meaning+and+purpose+in+life%22&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Four Courts Murder","description":"Justice Sidney Piggott was, everyone in Dublin's law professions agreed, designer-made for being throttled. If ever there was a judge more disliked---make that hated---in the courts of Ireland's capital city, no one knew his (or her) name. So when it comes to finding out who is responsible for the judge's demise, the number of possible suspects makes the task more difficult. However, Inspector Denis Lennon and his sergeant, Molly Power, are given a lead. On the day of the murder, more than one person saw a mysterious young visitor lurking in the courtroom where Piggott was presiding over a thoroughly boring trial. Who was he? Why was he there? For whatever reason, Inspector, you have your killer. Except that neither Denis nor Molly feel right about jumping to that conclusion. The young man himself, whose thoughts the reader is privy to, is unsure whether he killed Piggott or only imagined it. With tongue lightly in cheek, Nugent takes his reader from the Four Courts, Dublin's center of law, to rural Ireland, where a local priest has been killed, either by the young man or by a horse. The author introduces us to a married couple who specialize in stolen art and are somehow involved with Piggott. Bring in a series of high and low Irish characters, add a delightful young German student who gives Molly unexpected assistance, stir them together, and you have a highly seasoned story in unusual settings, told with a small twinkle that will endear readers to this new author.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1ePVml6jDYAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Canonical Metrics in Khler Geometry (Lectures in Mathematics.

He has had a profound influence on modern art ever since; Andr  Breton described his work as \\"one of the three or four most important oeuvres of the twentieth century.\\" The Art of Adolf W?lfli offers a fresh vantage point on the artist's remarkably intricate drawings and astonishing collages, as well as his newly translated writings, which are justly celebrated for their dizzying blend of mythology and humor. Also included are illuminating essays by leading specialists on his art and life. W?lfli's youth was one of deprivation. His alcoholic father ran off when W?lfli was five, and his mother died soon after. Despite these travails, he managed to complete his education, acquiring the sophisticated literacy so evident in his later work. However, beginning at age twenty-six, his repeated attempts to molest young girls landed him first in jail and, in 1894, in the asylum. Though violent at first, by 1899 he calmed down--and began to draw. Working primarily in pencil on newsprint, W?lfli created a dense, stunningly detailed medley of wildly imaginative prose texts interwoven with poems, musical compositions, color illustrations, and collages. His five-part magnum opus, \\"St. Adolf-Giant-Creation,\\" comprises 45 large volumes and 16 notebooks--25,000 pages in all--containing 1,620 drawings and 1,640 collages. Sure to be the authoritative resource for this remarkable oeuvre, this striking book represents compelling testimony that great torment does not preclude great art.

Each section contains several problems, which are not purely drill exercises, but are intended to introduce a sense of \\"play\\" in mathematics, and inculcate appreciation of the elegance and beauty of geometric results. There is an abundance of colour pictures illustrating results and their proofs. A section on hints and a further section on detailed solutions to all the exercises appear at the end of the book, making the book ideal also for self-study.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TolIDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Preludes & Etudes: For Solo Piano","description":"This volume collects Scriabin's finest, the complete etudes and preludes for the solo piano.

Spender was one of his generation's most celebrated poets, a writer living at the intersection of literature and politics in Europe between the two world wars. His portraits of his friends--Virginia Woolf, T. S. Eliot, W. H. Auden, W. B. Yeats, and Christopher Isherwood--render a romantic world of literary genius. Spender uses a poet's language to create an honest and tender exploration of amity and the many possibilities of love. First published in 1951, World Within World simultaneously shocked and bedazzled the literary establishment for its frank discussion of Eros in the modern world. Out of print for several years, this Modern Library edition includes a new Introduction by the critic John Bayley and an Afterword Spender wrote in 1994 describing his reaction to the charges that David Leavitt plagiarized this autobiography in a novel.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wLqLtwEACAAJ&dq=World+within+world:+The+autobiography+of+Stephen+Spender&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of Theatre (Hamlyn Reference)","description":"In this sweeping chronicle of plays and performances, key dramatists, major actors, and important critics take their bows, backed up by memorable quotations and more than 150 illustrations.

What did your father tell you, that has stayed with you throughout your life? Was there a lesson from him, a story, or a moment that helped to make you who you are? Is there a special memory that makes you smile when you least expect it? After the publication of Tim Russert s number one New York Times bestseller about his father, Big Russ & Me, he received an avalanche of letters from daughters and sons who wanted to tell him about their own fathers, most of whom were not superdads or heroes but ordinary men who were remembered and cherished for some of their best momentsof advice, tenderness, strength, honor, discipline, and occasional eccentricity. Most of these daughters and sons were eager to express the gratitude they had carried with them through the years. Others wanted to share lessons and memories and, most important, pass them down to their own children. This book is for all fathers, young or old, who can learn from the men in these pages how to get it right, and to understand that sometimes it is the little gestures that can make the big difference for your child. For some in this book, the appreciation came later than they would have liked. But as Wisdom of Our Fathers reminds us, it is never too late to embrace it. From the father who coached his daughter in sports (and life), attending every meet, game, performance, and tournament, to the daughter who, after a fifteen-year estrangement, learned to make peace with her difficult father just before he died, to the son who came, at last, to appreciate the silent way his father could show affection, Wisdom of Our Fathers shares rewarding lessons, immeasurable gifts, and lasting values. Heartfelt, humorous, engaging, irresistibly readable, and bound to bring back memories of unforgettable moments with our own fathers, Tim Russert s new book is not only a fitting companion to his own marvelous memoir, but also a celebration of the positive qualities passed down from generation to generation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Wx3wh8vHybIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book of Vegetarian Cooking","description":"\\"The Hare Krishna Book of Vegetarian Cooking is more than just a collection of 120 Indian recipes: it is a taste of that special fusion of wisdom and beauty that is Ancient India.

I'm arriving to relieve your tedium. And bringing a very big surprise... The surprise is Montague Bridgeman -- and, courtesy of Fallon Gilchrist's dear friend, he's hers to do with whatever she pleases for one week. An inexperienced widow, Fallon is shocked at the idea of a private plaything. Shy and repressed, she decides to use him as her model and start painting again; he is a rather spectacular specimen of a man. Bridge, however, is hell-bent on awakening the reclusive Fallon to the sensual world, and she soon quivers under the force of his desire -- and her own. Yet even more intense than these heady pleasures of the flesh is the haunted look in Bridge's eyes -- a look that suggests he's much more than a lover-for-hire, and that seven days and seven nights might not be enough...for either of them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fy4RygEACAAJ&dq=Taboo+:+A+Novel+of+Forbidden+Sensual+Delights.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sherlock Holmes and the Strange Events at the Bank of England with a supplement \\"The Bank of England: Its Origin and Development: a lecture given by Maberley Phillips\\"","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BcBQNgAACAAJ&dq=Sherlock+Holmes+and+the+Strange+Events+at+the+Bank+of+England+with+a+supplement+%22The+Bank+of+England:+Its+Origin+and+Development:+a+lecture+given+by+Maberley+Phillips%22&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Patricide in the House Divided","description":"Argues that Lincoln came to office at a time when American politicians, uncertain that the Union could survive its sectional differences, appealed to sentiment and urged Americans to think of the Union as an extended family","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UgOSQgAACAAJ&dq=Patricide+in+the+House+Divided&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"British Tokens and Their Values","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZeL7AAAACAAJ&dq=British+Tokens+and+Their+Values&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to the Theory of Relativity","description":"Comprehensive coverage of special theory (frames of reference, Lorentz transformation, more), general theory (principle of equivalence, more) and unified theory (Weyl's gauge-invariant geometry, more.)

Authority over the Australian Constitution Act lies not with the Australian government, nor with the Australian people. It rests solely with the UK. Only they have the authority to repeal this legislation....  - The late Professor G. Clements, UK QC and emeritus Professor in Law at Cambridge University This book is the first of its type to be written in the last 114 years. Nobody has done so since Quick and Garran in 1901. The British Colony of Australia Act (1900) represents Australia's primary law. It is still used today as our Constitution. That Act controls all our lives. The British Government added the first eight parts of this Act and the ninth part is the draft Constitution. That draft was changed by the British Government before they would allow the Act to be presented to their Parliament. This amended Constitution was never presented to the  people  of Australia for their approval. The document is steeped in nineteenth century colonial thinking, and has never been brought up to date. It remains antiquated and bears very little relationship to the way we are governed. It is a myth that the referendums in 1899 and 1900 asked the  people  to approve the draft Constitution. The few selected  people  were asked if they wanted  union of the Colonies or disunion . The acceptance of the original draft Constitution was taken for granted. The draft Constitution was never about democracy or Australian sovereignty. Another of the myths this book debunks is that the Constitution can only be changed by a referendum of the Australian people. The fifty colonial representatives; referred to as our  the founding fathers , saw fit to include thirty nine provisions allowing Parliament to change the Constitution any time the ruling party wished. They have done this so many times in the last 114 years that no one has kept count. Read this book and find out why this primary law of the land is never taught in our schools, and how it controls your life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xhnbCQAAQBAJ&dq=AUSTRALIA%27S+CONSTITUTION&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Abingdon Pottery Artware 1934-1950: Stepchild of the Great Depression","description":"The Abingdon Sanitary Manufacturing Company coped with the Great Depression by cleverly making artware using \\"industrial strength\\" materials and processes developed for their sanitaryware.

The second, Pornografia, explores the sinister effect the young can have on the old. To serve their own secret eroticism, two aging intellectuals encourage a young couple to commit murder.

The rules of register in Japanese are far more complicated than they are in English, but until now there hasn t been a book that lays it all out in an accessible format. Japanese for All Occasions is a much-needed introduction to this bewildering aspect of the language, aimed at intermediate students and above. Through 57 dialogues, veteran teacher Taeko Kamiya shows learners how the Japanese change their way of speaking according to the social setting or their relationship with the listener, with examples ranging from casual to superpolite. Chapters are organized by function (\\"Introducing People,\\" \\"Identifying Things,\\" etc.) so that learners can absorb the most common sentence patterns used in daily life at the same time that they study casual, polite, and honorific styles. Each chapter presents three similar dialogues that show contrasting styles of speech. Detailed notes explain the grammar or usage at work in the dialogues, and quizzes at the end of each chapter allow learners to test their understanding. Best of all, the book comes with a free CD containing all the dialogues, narrated by professional Japanese actors.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_6BNEAAAQBAJ&dq=Japanese+for+All+Occasions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ghost Belonged to Me","description":"Only Alexander knows why the barn is haunted -and by what When Alexander notices an eerie light coming out of the barn,.

Depictions of women as timid and fearful creatures baffled by machinery have alternated with images of them as being fully capable of technological mastery and control -- and of lending sex appeal to machines as products. In Women and the Machine, historian Julie Wosk maps the contradictory ways in which women's interactions with -- and understanding of -- machinery has been defined in Western popular culture since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. Drawing on both visual and literary sources, Wosk illuminates popular gender stereotypes that have burdened women throughout modern history while underscoring their advances in what was long considered the domain of men. Illustrated with more than 150 images, Women and the Machine reveals women rejoicing in their new liberties and technical skill even as they confront society's ambivalence about these developments, along with male fantasies and fears.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bxcL8PmV_ZwC&dq=Women+and+the+Machine:+Representations+from+the+Spinning+Wheel+to+the+Electronic+Age&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trail of Tears: The Rise and Fall of the Cherokee Nation","description":"A sixth-generation North Carolinian, highly-acclaimed author John Ehle grew up on former Cherokee hunting grounds. His experience as an accomplished novelist, combined with his extensive, meticulous research, culminates in this moving tragedy rich with historical detail. The Cherokee are a proud, ancient civilization. For hundreds of years they believed themselves to be the \\"Principle People\\" residing at the center of the earth. But by the 18th century, some of their leaders believed it was necessary to adapt to European ways in order to survive. Those chiefs sealed the fate of their tribes in 1875 when they signed a treaty relinquishing their land east of the Mississippi in return for promises of wealth and better land. The U.S. government used the treaty to justify the eviction of the Cherokee nation in an exodus that the Cherokee will forever remember as the  trail where they cried.  The heroism and nobility of the Cherokee shine through this intricate story of American politics, ambition, and greed.

Now he has updated this groundbreaking volume, taking current declines in circulation and the number of dailies into consideration and offering a greater variety of ways to save journalism. Meyer s  influence model  is based on the premise that a newspaper s main product is not news or information, but influence: societal influence, which is not for sale, and commercial influence, which is. The model is supported by an abundance of empirical evidence, including statistical assessments of the quality and influence of the journalist s product, as well as its effects on business success. Meyer now applies this empirical evidence to recent developments, such as the impact of Craigslist and current trends in information technologies. New charts show how a surge in newsroom employment propped up readership in the 1980s, and data on the effects of newsroom desegregation are now included. Meyer s most controversial suggestion, making certification available for reporters and editors, has been gaining ground. This new edition discusses several examples of certificate programs that are emerging in organizations both old and new. Understanding the relationship between quality and profit probably will not save traditional newspapers, but Meyer argues that such knowledge can guide new media enterprises. He believes that we have the tools to sustain high-quality journalism and preserve its unique social functions, though in a transformed way.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KGl7-ZQE-IIC&dq=The+Vanishing+Newspaper:+Saving+Journalism+in+the+Information+Age&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New York 1926: Facsimile of a sketchbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=It65jgEACAAJ&dq=New+York+1926:+Facsimile+of+a+sketchbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making Doll's Clothes","description":"An accessible guide to creating and sewing doll's clothes for budding designers and crafty kids","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y5gdrgEACAAJ&dq=Making+Doll%27s+Clothes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kaleidoscope: Five Views of Life","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SUVGxEDgsyAC&dq=Kaleidoscope:+Five+Views+of+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Samurai Leader: Winning Business Battles with the Wisdom, Honor and Courage of the Samurai Code","description":"Proven strategies for modern business leaders.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZU915HGzz6sC&dq=The+Samurai+Leader:+Winning+Business+Battles+with+the+Wisdom,+Honor+and+Courage+of+the+Samurai+Code&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ashes in the Wilderness","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iA3poAEACAAJ&dq=Ashes+in+the+Wilderness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Schaum's Outline of Computer Graphics","description":"This title gives examples and problems to allow students to develop and hone their computer graphics skills.

Ralph Munroe first went to Biscayne Bay in 1887. Soon after that time he and his friends built his home, The Barnacle, in Coconut Grove, where he has lived ever since. From this center his influence has been felt for almost fifty years during the vivid and exciting period of early exploration and settlement, during the slow development which led up to Flagler and the railroad, through the boom, the disastrous hurricanes against which the Commodore s warnings went unheeded, down to the present time. No one interested in southern Florida or in the sea can afford to miss this picturesque story of a Biscayne Bay pioneer who is today so widely and affectionately known. One of Florida s earliest lovers, the Commodore has been unswervingly devoted to the best interests of the region and has been close to the most significant incidents of its growth.

The author argues that the image question played a large role in the divisions within European Protestantism and was intricately connected with the Eucharist controversy. He analyses the positions of the major Protestant reformers - Luther, Zwingli, Calvin and Karlstadt - on the legitimacy of religious paintings and investigates iconoclasm both as a form of religious and political protest and as a complex set of mock-revolutionary rites and denigration rituals. The book also contains new research on relations between Protestant iconoclasm and the extreme icon-worship of the Eastern Orthodox churches, and provides a brief discussion of Eastern protestantizing sects, especially in Russia.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PM2sDPFP9dEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Making Camp: The Complete Guide for Hikers, Mountain Bikers, Paddlers & Skiers (Backpacker Magazine)","description":"Provides advice, checklists, suggestions, priorities, rules of thumb, and special considerations for making camp","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zL1Vw_km_rMC&dq=Making+Camp:+The+Complete+Guide+for+Hikers,+Mountain+Bikers,+Paddlers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hard-Boiled Men","description":"This study examines masculinity and individualism in four American novels of the 1920s and 1930s usually regarded as belonging to the genre of hard-boiled fiction. The novels under study are Red Harvest by Dashiell Hammett, The Postman Always Rings Twice by James M. Cain, They Shoot Horses, Don't They? by Horace McCoy, and To Have and Have Not by Ernest Hemingway. In this first full-length study of gender in hard-boiled fiction the genre is discussed as a representation of the ideologies of masculinity and individualism. Hard-boiled fiction is located in its historical and cultural context and it is argued that the genre, with its explicit emphasis on masculinity and masculine virtues, attempts to reaffirm a masculine order. The study argues that this emphasis is a counter-reaction to more general changes in the gender relations of the period. Indeed, hard-boiled fiction is argued to be an attempt to reconstruct a masculine identity based on anti-modern values generally accepted in the cultural context of the genre.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7w5xBSIA-NAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deuces wild video poker : a complete \\"how to beat the casino\\" discussion","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G1BrPAAACAAJ&dq=Deuces+wild+video+poker+:+a+complete+%22how+to+beat+the+casino%22+discussion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rebelin","description":"This controversial text speaks to us with intriguing relevance to the problems of today.

If an action is wrong, what reason does that give us not to do it? Why should we give such reasons priority over our other concerns and values? In this book, T. M. Scanlon offers new answers to these questions, as they apply to the central part of morality that concerns what we owe to each other. According to his contractualist view, thinking about right and wrong is thinking about what we do in terms that could be justified to others and that they could not reasonably reject. He shows how the special authority of conclusions about right and wrong arises from the value of being related to others in this way, and he shows how familiar moral ideas such as fairness and responsibility can be understood through their role in this process of mutual justification and criticism. Scanlon bases his contractualism on a broader account of reasons, value, and individual well-being that challenges standard views about these crucial notions. He argues that desires do not provide us with reasons, that states of affairs are not the primary bearers of value, and that well-being is not as important for rational decision-making as it is commonly held to be. Scanlon is a pluralist about both moral and non-moral values. He argues that, taking this plurality of values into account, contractualism allows for most of the variability in moral requirements that relativists have claimed, while still accounting for the full force of our judgments of right and wrong.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9OPsDwAAQBAJ&dq=What+We+Owe+to+Each+Other&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Your Retirement, Your Way: Why It Takes More Than Money to Live Your Dream","description":"Create a new life plan to thrive in your retirement \\"In Your Retirement, Your Way, Alan and John lead the way to a new and dynamic definition of retirement.

What is the book in a digital age? Is it a physical object containing pages encased in covers? Is it a portable device that gives us access to entire libraries? The codex, the book as bound paper sheets, emerged around 150 CE. It was preceded by clay tablets and papyrus scrolls. Are those books? In this volume in the MIT Press Essential Knowledge series, Amaranth Borsuk considers the history of the book, the future of the book, and the idea of the book. Tracing the interrelationship of form and content in the book's development, she bridges book history, book arts, and electronic literature to expand our definition of an object we thought we knew intimately. Contrary to the many reports of its death (which has been blamed at various times on newspapers, television, and e-readers), the book is alive. Despite nostalgic paeans to the codex and its printed pages, Borsuk reminds us, the term  book  commonly refers to both medium and content. And the medium has proved to be malleable. Rather than pinning our notion of the book to a single form, Borsuk argues, we should remember its long history of transformation. Considering the book as object, content, idea, and interface, she shows that the physical form of the book has always been the site of experimentation and play. Rather than creating a false dichotomy between print and digital media, we should appreciate their continuities.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VRdZDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The 20th Century Children's Poetry Treasury","description":"A collection of more than 200 poems by such modern poets as Nikki Grimes, John Ciardi, Karla Kuskin, Ted Hughes, e.e. cummings, Eve Merriam, Deborah Chandra, Arnold Adoff, and more than 100 others.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jOIKjhtVyEUC&dq=The+20th+Century+Children%27s+Poetry+Treasury&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Secret of Stalingrad","description":"A revelation of the circumstances that snatched victory from a doomed defense and sowed the seeds of the Cold War.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K5V1AAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Secret+of+Stalingrad&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Armour of light,: A television play in four parts from the award-winning CBS-TV series, Look up and live","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gugnAQAAIAAJ&dq=Armour+of+light,:+A+television+play+in+four+parts+from+the+award-winning+CBS-TV+series,+Look+up+and+live&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"C Programming","description":"Software -- Programming Languages.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9f9uAQAAQBAJ&dq=C+Programming&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spring Water","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VFKZAAAACAAJ&dq=Spring+Water&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Minnesota Rag","description":"Minnesota Rag takes the reader on a tour of the underside of a dark period in Minnesota's past, one filled with crooked public officials, vengeful gangsters, and yellow journalists.

However, this paper lays claim to be one of the early few that take a more rational approach to the subject by analyzing the realistic profit potential of online business models. Furthermore, future success factors for finance portals will be discussed and their respective value proposition thoroughly examined. Since the fast moving Internet hype has had to give way to an almost equally swift consolidation of the market, this will prove to be crucial information for any company of the finance industry. Additionally, when taking into account that the oncoming second wave of customers is to be divided amongst the remaining online players, the findings of this thesis will be of eminent relevance for any provider of a financial website. Towards the end of my internship with AOL I was asked to research the required success factors for finance portals as a basis for AOL s finance channel content strategy. Inexperienced Internet-users such as those of the Second Wave are likely to utilize the user-friendly and convenient service of AOL as an ISP. Therefore, it will be of vital importance for AOL to incorporate the above mentioned success factors within their service in order to increase the usage of its finance channel. At this point I would like to thank AOL, not only for the financial, but especially for the professional support, which both have simplified my task to a substantial degree as well as all others who have been kind enough to let me benefit from their knowledge in the field.

Here H. E. Goemans brings theoretical rigor and empirical depth to a long-standing question of securities studies. He explores how various government leaders assess the cost of war in terms of domestic politics and their own postwar fates. Goemans first develops the argument that two sides will wage war until both gain sufficient knowledge of the other's strengths and weaknesses so as to agree on the probable outcome of continued war. Yet the incentives that motivate leaders to then terminate war, Goemans maintains, can vary greatly depending on the type of government they represent. The author looks at democracies, dictatorships, and mixed regimes and compares the willingness among leaders to back out of wars or risk the costs of continued warfare. Democracies, according to Goemans, will prefer to withdraw quickly from a war they are not winning in order to appease the populace. Autocracies will do likewise so as not to be overthrown by their internal enemies. Mixed regimes, which are made up of several competing groups and which exclude a substantial proportion of the people from access to power, will likely see little risk in continuing a losing war in the hope of turning the tide. Goemans explores the conditions and the reasoning behind this \\"gamble for resurrection\\" as well as other strategies, using rational choice theory, statistical analysis, and detailed case studies of Germany, Britain, France, and Russia during World War I. In so doing, he offers a new perspective of the Great War that integrates domestic politics, international politics, and battlefield developments.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JCLRCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"GREAT PRETENDER","description":"\\"One of America's most courageous young journalists\\" and the author of the #1 New York Times bestselling memoir Brain on Fire investigates the shocking mystery behind the dramatic experiment that revolutionized modern medicine (NPR). Doctors have struggled for centuries to define insanity--how do you diagnose it, how do you treat it, how do you even know what it is? In search of an answer, in the 1970s a Stanford psychologist named David Rosenhan and seven other people--sane, healthy, well-adjusted members of society--went undercover into asylums around America to test the legitimacy of psychiatry's labels. Forced to remain inside until they'd \\"proven\\" themselves sane, all eight emerged with alarming diagnoses and even more troubling stories of their treatment. Rosenhan's watershed study broke open the field of psychiatry, closing down institutions and changing mental health diagnosis forever.

USA Today Winner of the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Literary Achievement One of the most dynamic and globally recognized entertainment forces of our time opens up fully about his life, in a brave and inspiring book that traces his learning curve to a place where outer success, inner happiness, and human connection are aligned. Along the way, Will tells the story in full of one of the most amazing rides through the worlds of music and film that anyone has ever had. Will Smith s transformation from a West Philadelphia kid to one of the biggest rap stars of his era, and then one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood history, is an epic tale but it s only half the story. Will Smith thought, with good reason, that he had won at life: not only was his own success unparalleled, his whole family was at the pinnacle of the entertainment world. Only they didn't see it that way: they felt more like star performers in his circus, a seven-days-a-week job they hadn't signed up for. It turned out Will Smith's education wasn't nearly over. This memoir is the product of a profound journey of self-knowledge, a reckoning with all that your will can get you and all that it can leave behind. Written with the help of Mark Manson, author of the multi-million-copy bestseller The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, Will is the story of how one person mastered his own emotions, written in a way that can help everyone else do the same. Few of us will know the pressure of performing on the world's biggest stages for the highest of stakes, but we can all understand that the fuel that works for one stage of our journey might have to be changed if we want to make it all the way home. The combination of genuine wisdom of universal value and a life story that is preposterously entertaining, even astonishing, puts Will the book, like its author, in a category by itself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S2ZNEAAAQBAJ&dq=Will+Smith&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Choose the Best House for You: The Feng Shui Checklist","description":"\\"Using a checklist format, a home can be evolution using the ancient chinese art & science of feng shui.

Among the Paxtun, an Islamic, Paxto-speaking group living in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, these stories of grief or sadness (gham) are a vital medium of exchange, through which relationships are formed and maintained. Indeed, as Benedicte Grima asserts in this engrossing study, performing these rituals of grief and suffering largely defines what it means to be an honorable Paxtun woman. Drawing on fieldwork conducted over the period 1978-1987, Grima shows how the performance of gham is the female counterpart of better-known male obligations (such as revenge killing) that maintain family standing and honor. Her research includes both life histories (\\"the misfortunes which have befallen me\\") and illness and misfortune narratives, as well as the contexts in which these stories are normally recounted. Her access to different levels of Paxtun society provides a broad picture of how this ritual grieving is performed throughout the culture. Based on the premise that emotions are not spontaneous and involuntary, but rather culturally taught and performed, this work uses emotion to illuminate the construction of female identity in Paxtun and Islamic culture. In addition to its obvious audiences in Middle Eastern and women's studies, it will be important to everyone working in the ethnography of communication, performance analysis, and the anthropology of emotion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YzraAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Performance+of+Emotion+Among+Paxtun+Women:+%22The+Misfortunes+Which+Have+Befallen+Me%22+(Modern+Middle+East+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Occult in Early Modern Europe: A Documentary History (Documents in History)","description":"This collection of translated documents, many of which have never before appeared in English, presents a survey of the vibrant, complex, stimulating, perilous world of magic, witchcraft, astrology, alchemy, and other related occult themes.

S. Army in the second half of the twentieth century was a passageway to every conceivable locale, hospitable and decidedly otherwise. Henry Gole's experiences lead the reader through the geography of one such career. The recollections of a professional soldier, Henry Gole's account is a humorous and interesting tale of a man who loved soldiering but not necessarily the organization in which he soldiered. He feels the gratification of having served in the U. S. Army during an era when, personal doubts and political controversy notwithstanding, the world depended on America and its armed forces to preserve freedom. He offers the unique perspective of a member of the \\"silent generation,\\" those who immediately followed the World War II generation but find themselves often overlooked by historians and the media. From 1952 through 1988, covering the ordinary rifleman's view in Korea to the Green Beret's war in Vietnam, Gole also provides fascinating insight into the professional military at war and how these professionals relate to each other, both under great stress and during periods of decompression. Containing a wealth of leadership lessons that will serve as an invaluable guide for junior NCOs and officers alike, this thoughtful and introspective warrior has also written a moving tribute to the brave soldiers with whom he served.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GOE9crFONC4C&dq=Soldiering:+Observations+from+Korea,+Vietnam,+and+Safe+Places&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Celtic Warrior 400 B.C. - 1600 AD","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VYlKywAACAAJ&dq=Celtic+Warrior+400+B.C.+-+1600+AD&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Selected Writings","description":"Jos  Mart  (1853-1895) is the most renowned political and literary figure in the history of Cuba. A poet, essayist, orator, statesman, abolitionist, and the martyred revolutionary leader of Cuba's fight for independence from Spain, Mart  lived in exile in New York for most of his adult life, earning his living as a foreign correspondent. Throughout the 1880s and early 1890s, Mart 's were the eyes through which much of Latin America saw the United States. His impassioned, kaleidoscopic evocations of that period in U.S. history, the assassination of James Garfield, the opening of the Brooklyn Bridge, the execution of the Chicago anarchists, the lynching of the Italians in New Orleans, and much more, bring it rushing back to life. Organized chronologically, this collection begins with his early writings, including a thundering account of his political imprisonment in Cuba at age sixteen. The middle section focuses on his journalism, which offers an image of the United States in the nineteenth century, its way of life and system of government, that rivals anything written by de Tocqueville, Dickens, Trollope, or any other European commentator. Including generous selections of his poetry and private notebooks, the book concludes with his astonishing, hallucinatory final masterpiece, \\"War Diaries\\", never before translated into English.

This provides a critical foundation for lifelong progress, and the adults who provide for the care and the education of young children bear a great responsibility for their health, development, and learning. Despite the fact that they share the same objective - to nurture young children and secure their future success - the various practitioners who contribute to the care and the education of children from birth through age 8 are not acknowledged as a workforce unified by the common knowledge and competencies needed to do their jobs well. Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth Through Age 8 explores the science of child development, particularly looking at implications for the professionals who work with children. This report examines the current capacities and practices of the workforce, the settings in which they work, the policies and infrastructure that set qualifications and provide professional learning, and the government agencies and other funders who support and oversee these systems. This book then makes recommendations to improve the quality of professional practice and the practice environment for care and education professionals. These detailed recommendations create a blueprint for action that builds on a unifying foundation of child development and early learning, shared knowledge and competencies for care and education professionals, and principles for effective professional learning. Young children thrive and learn best when they have secure, positive relationships with adults who are knowledgeable about how to support their development and learning and are responsive to their individual progress. Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth Through Age 8 offers guidance on system changes to improve the quality of professional practice, specific actions to improve professional learning systems and workforce development, and research to continue to build the knowledge base in ways that will directly advance and inform future actions. The recommendations of this book provide an opportunity to improve the quality of the care and the education that children receive, and ultimately improve outcomes for children.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VEdmCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Art and Photography (Themes & Movements)","description":"Art and Photography is the first book of its kind to survey the presence of photography in artistic practice from the 1960s onwards. The photographic image is central to contemporary art and the debates that surround it, yet it took most of the last century for it to acquire this status. Despite the extensive exploration of photography as an independent art in the Modernist era, it was not until the late twentieth century that artists, museums and galleries began to explore its social roles as a medium of representation. This volume provides a comprehensive survey of photography's place in recent art history, further contextualized in the Documents section by original artists' statements and interviews, together with critical and theoretical reflections on the photographic and the art of the photograph.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=My_rAAAAMAAJ&dq=Art+and+Photography+(Themes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Christmas Shoes","description":"Sometimes, the things that can change your life will cross your path in one instant-and then, in a fleeting moment, they're gone.

In this one encounter, their lives are forever altered as Robert learns an important lesson: sometimes the smallest things can make all the difference.

When the Americans make an offer to buy Icelandic land to build an atomic war base, a storm of protest is provoked throughout the country, and it is here that Laxness finds the catalyst for his story. Told by a country girl from the north, the novel follows her experiences upon taking up employment as a maid in the house of her Member of Parliament. She finds herself in a world very different to that of her upbringing and, marvelling at the customs and behaviour of the people around her, she emerges as the one obstinate reality in a world of fantasy. Her observations and experiences expose the intellectual society of the south as rootless and shallow and in stark contrast to the ancient culture of the solid and less fanciful north. The colourful, yet at times dark, cast of characters she meets personifies the southern fantasy world. In this black comedy Laxness has painted a masterpiece of social commentary as relevant today as when it was first written in 1948.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XWhqCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Edge of Doom","description":"Academic sleuth Kate Fansler and her family confront a troubling mystery when a man arrives claiming to be Kate's true father, an encounter that reveals a series of life-threatening secrets and dark deceptions that could unleash potentially dangerous repercussions for Kate's entire family.

A Production Line's Success Story Through the Use of Designed Experiments","description":"Profitability is the key to any production line's existence, and to maintain profitability, production processes must continually improve. As products change, the production lines must adapt quickly, often drastically. This stressful metamorphosis leads to one inevitable result: drastic inefficiencies. To assure the success of a new production line, one must optimize the production processes as quickly as possible. But how do you optimize a world with dozens of factors in a matter of a few weeks? The key is methodology, and specifically, a methodology called Design of Experiments (DOE). This \\"art\\" is the result of years of research by ingenious statisticians, and its application is finding uses in varied fields such as advertising, marketing and product design. This book narrates the story of Luc, an orchid farmer that finds that his orchid greenhouses are continually less profitable. After much contemplation, Luc decides to change his principal crop from the standard orchid to the highly praised 'African Sunset' orchid. Unfortunately, this beautiful flower is a headache to cultivate and requires completely different growing conditions than his previous orchids. After a couple of disastrous attempts to characterize the cultivation of this exotic orchid with what might be considered \\"conventional\\" experimental techniques (changing one variable at a time and seeing what happens), Luc decides to get help for his project. Help comes thanks to Stefan, an experienced statistician, who helps Luc over the pitfalls of characterizing a complex multi-variable process. Through their amusing dialogues and experiences, the reader is lead through the practice of the art of Design of Experiments.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ONGRpN8wWqkC&dq=Path+of+Ascent!+A+Production+Line%27s+Success+Story+Through+the+Use+of+Designed+Experiments&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Absolutely Rotten Jokes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3svUcwrHVVEC&dq=Absolutely+Rotten+Jokes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Berenstain Bears and Too Much Junk Food","description":"Come for a visit in Bear Country with this classic First Time Book? from Stan and Jan Berenstain.

During his academic years, Lee Strobel became convinced that God was obsolete, a belief that colored his journalism career. Science had made the idea of a Creator irrelevant--or so Strobel thought. But today science points in a different direction. A diverse and impressive body of research has increasingly supported the conclusion that the universe was intelligently designed. At the same time, Darwinism has faltered in the face of concrete facts and hard reason. Has science discovered God? At the very least, it's giving faith an immense boost, as new findings emerge about the incredible complexity of our universe. Join Strobel as he reexamines the theories that once led him away from God.

Rather than finding the impetus he so craves, he becomes increasingly alienated from those around him. Sickened by the condition of his times, he chooses to reject a life of morality. A probing study of a man--and a society--in crisis, A Hero of Our Time was to become a seminal work of its era. Poet and novelist Mikhail Yurevich Lermontov was a leading figure in Russian Romantic literature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wzQYAQAAIAAJ&dq=A+Hero+of+Our+Time+(Hesperus+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cigars of the pharaoh (The adventures of Tintin)","description":"Tintin sets off across Egypt and India, on the hunt for an Egyptologist and a mysterious ancient pharaoh.
