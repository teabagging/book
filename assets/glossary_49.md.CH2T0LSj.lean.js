In this book, Susan Schuppli introduces a new operative concept: material witness, an exploration of the evidential role of matter as both registering external events and exposing the practices and procedures that enable matter to bear witness. Organized in the format of a trial, Material Witness moves through a series of cases that provide insight into the ways in which materials become contested agents of dispute around which stake holders gather. These cases include an extraordinary videotape documenting the massacre at Izbica, Kosovo, used as war crimes evidence against Slobodan Milo?evi?; the telephonic transmission of an iconic photograph of a South Vietnamese girl fleeing an accidental napalm attack; radioactive contamination discovered in Canada's coastal waters five years after the accident at Fukushima Daiichi; and the ecological media or  disaster film  produced by the Deep Water Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Each highlights the degree to which a rearrangement of matter exposes the contingency of witnessing, raising questions about what can be known in relationship to that which is seen or sensed, about who or what is able to bestow meaning onto things, and about whose stories will be heeded or dismissed. An artist-researcher, Schuppli offers an analysis that merges her creative sensibility with a forensic imagination rich in technical detail. Her goal is to relink the material world and its affordances with the aesthetic, the juridical, and the political.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=saXODwAAQBAJ&dq=Material+Witness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pandas 2006 Calendar","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZzceAgAACAAJ&dq=Pandas+2006+Calendar&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The World of Christopher Robin","description":"The world of Christopher Robin is a world of childhood-gay, rollicking, imaginative-a world of reality and enchanting make-believe.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PxZ2CTT6txIC&dq=The+World+of+Christopher+Robin&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The school for dictators","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sfbF-cR6HMgC&dq=The+school+for+dictators&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lent: The Daily Readings : Reflections and Stories (v. 2)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YBdKuAAACAAJ&dq=Lent:+The+Daily+Readings+:+Reflections+and+Stories+(v.+2)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Challenging Lateral Thinking Puzzles","description":"Lateral thinking is the key to solving these tantalizing puzzles.

Why? Well, in 1969, when Roberta Flack's first album came out, First Take, it was not as well received by record buyers of the time, as The Beatles were still a rage, as well as the continuous British Invasion. But in fact, Miss Roberta Flack's first album, and later ones, have been so influential, there would be no overrated songs like Evergreen, Endless Love, and The Greatest Love Of All, which have become the standard for weddings. Even more to note, The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face from First Take lifted off three years later as the #1 single of the year in 1972 in the USA. That was more of the proof that Roberta Flack's style was ahead of the times. Her soft, mellow voice would dominate the charts through out the 1970s, 80s, and 90s. As for Boy George, he made glamour rock the best example to the world.

The purpose of this study was to determine the success rate of a comprehensive, evidence-based 6-step program for weight management when applied to an obese sample population. This retrospective, observational study takes place in an outpatient private clinic. The participants include 16 obese patients chosen based on prior enrollment in the 6-step program and having a BMI of 30 or greater. The 6 steps include: medical screening, patient education, diet selection/exercise, cognitive restructuring, behavioral therapy, and a plan for weight maintenance. Patient visits occurred about every three weeks and lasted about 30 minutes. The major outcome measured was weight lost over a minimum 3-month period. Patients initially underwent a medical screening to ensure no medical or psychological barriers for weight loss were present. Patients were educated about basic elements on the physiology of weight loss and weight maintenance. A structured diet was individualized for each patient based on prior success/failure with a particular diet and also patient preference of qualitative vs quantitative diet. Most chose a diet based on low glycemic index foods. Cognitive and behavioral therapy were given during patient sessions focusing on goal setting, understanding obesity as a disease with medical consequences, activity modification, and identifying environmental eating cues. A plan for weight maintenance was employed based on a 5-10% weight loss over 3 months followed by a 3-month weight maintenance cycle. All enrolled patients lost weight. Weight loss ranged from 6 to 42 lbs with an average loss of 16.4 lbs (p","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=U9BpAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Skinny+Book:+The+6-Step+Methodology+for+Weight+Management&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"O PARADISE","description":"The staggering story of an unlikely band of mothers in the 1970s who discovered Hooker Chemical's deadly secret of Love Canal exposing one of America s most devastating toxic waste disasters and sparking the modern environmental movement as we know it today. Lois Gibbs, Luella Kenny, and other mothers loved their neighborhood on the east side of Niagara Falls. It had an elementary school, a playground, and rows of affordable homes. But in the spring of 1977, pungent odors began to seep into these little houses, and it didn t take long for worried mothers to identify the curious scent. It was the sickly sweet smell of chemicals. In this propulsive work of narrative storytelling, NYT journalist Keith O Brien uncovers how Gibbs and Kenny exposed the poisonous secrets buried in their neighborhood. The school and playground had been built atop an old canal Love Canal, it was called that Hooker Chemical, the city s largest employer, had quietly filled with twenty thousand tons of toxic waste in the 1940s and 1950s. This waste was now leaching to the surface, causing a public health crisis the likes of which America had never seen before and sparking new and specific fears. Luella Kenny believed the chemicals were making her son sick. O Brien braids together previously unknown stories of Hooker Chemical s deeds; the local newspaperman, scientist, and congressional staffer who tried to help; the city and state officials who didn t; and the heroic women who stood up to corporate and governmental indifference to save their families and their children. They would take their fight all the way to the top, winning support from the EPA, the White House, and even President Jimmy Carter. By the time it was over, they would capture America s imagination. Sweeping and electrifying, Paradise Falls brings to life a defining story from our past, laying bare the dauntless efforts of a few women who years before Erin Brockovich took up the mantle  fought to rescue their community and their lives from the effects of corporate pollution and laid foundation for the modern environmental movement as we know it today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FxIxEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lone Wolf and Cub Volume 20: A Taste of Poison (Lone Wolf and Cub (Dark Horse))","description":"A quest for vengeance wouldn't be complete without a little poison.

Vibration Analysis and Structural Dynamics for Civil Engineers: Essentials and Group-Theoretic Formulations is relevant to instances that involve significant time-varying effects, including impact and sudden movement. It explains the basic theory to undergraduate and graduate students taking courses on vibration and dynamics, and also presents an original approach for the vibration analysis of symmetric systems, for both researchers and practicing engineers. Divided into two parts, it first covers the fundamentals of the vibration of engineering systems, and later addresses how symmetry affects vibration behavior. Part I treats the modeling of discrete single and multi-degree-of-freedom systems, as well as mathematical formulations for continuous systems, both analytical and numerical. It also features some worked examples and tutorial problems. Part II introduces the mathematical concepts of group theory and symmetry groups, and applies these to the vibration of a diverse range of problems in structural mechanics. It reveals the computational benefits of the group-theoretic approach, and sheds new insights on complex vibration phenomena. The book consists of 11 chapters with topics that include: The vibration of discrete systems or lumped parameter models The free and forced response of single degree-of-freedom systems The vibration of systems with multiple degrees of freedom The vibration of continuous systems (strings, rods and beams) The essentials of finite-element vibration modelling Symmetry considerations and an outline of group and representation theories Applications of group theory to the vibration of linear mechanical systems Applications of group theory to the vibration of structural grids and cable nets Group-theoretic finite-element and finite-difference formulations Vibration Analysis and Structural Dynamics for Civil Engineers: Essentials and Group-Theoretic Formulations acquaints students with the fundamentals of vibration theory, informs experienced structural practitioners on simple and effective techniques for vibration modelling, and provides researchers with new directions for the development of computational vibration procedures.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HVW3BgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Idee und Modell /Idea and Model: 30 Jahre Architekturmodelle /30 Years of Architectural Models","description":"Meinhard von Gerkan and Volkwin Marg are considered to be among the most acclaimed architects worldwide. Their projects and completed works have in fact attracted international attention. The present book focuses on the models produced over the years and therefore offers a unique look into the creative process of the architects. Of primary importance is the quality of the designs and buildings which is already easily discernible in the models. What is also perceptible is the need to maintain and further develop the high standards which had already distinguished the early projects. The architects seek no short-lived trends or superfluous effects; on the contrary, what they consider of utmost importance is their sense of social responsibility which, in a firm of such dimensions, is translated into no shallow pathos but rather into a daily commitment. \\"Architecture is an art that is applied in society. The result is the product of a dialogue.\\" (Meinhard von Gerkan) Given the large number of the buildings and competition designs (from among 256 award-winning works, 98 have received first prize) not everything can be included in the annals of architectural history, but the essential components of their work and that of their staff cannot be overlooked: namely, the attention to structural details, the material-oriented design and a simplicity based on usefulness - all elements which, in the best examples cited, have attained a level of self-evident naturalness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q95PAAAAMAAJ&dq=Idee+und+Modell+/Idea+and+Model:+30+Jahre+Architekturmodelle+/30+Years+of+Architectural+Models&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Syntax and Semantics of the Verb in Classical Greek: An Introduction","description":"The verb is, in any language, the motor of all communication: no verb, no action.

The legacy of this elaborate art forms a comprehensive yet cohesive whole which has both assimilated and adapted to the cultural differences that exist over the vast distances separating the regions of the Islamic world. In this beautifully illustrated book Khader Salameh shows how the art has developed over time as he studies a selection of Qur'an manuscripts held in the al-Haram al-Sharif Islamic Museum in the al-Aqsa Mosque, Jerusalem. These preserved copies of the Qur'an have been donated to the Mosque during various successive Islamic periods by individual Muslims, rulers, sultans, princes, ulama and others. They differ in size, calligraphy and ornamentation - such as gold inlaying - according to the technical and material resources available. The entries are arranged chronologically and identified by the name of the donor, if known, and by a museum registration number. Salameh gives a detailed account of each manuscript, including its date, dimensions, binding, illuminated opening pages and body text. He summarizes the contents of any notations, endowment texts or colophons and identifies any Qur'anic verses that feature in the illuminated panels. The book is richly illustrated with colour photographs showing every decorative element worthy of study. As well as a detailed study of the selected manuscripts, the book presents a general overview of the Museum's holdings and provides a textual history of the Qur'an. It describes the four types of script used in Qur'an manuscripts, and also the different types of binding and illumination. Many rare pieces of note are included in the collection: the calligraphic kufic copy of the Qur'an dating back to the third/fourth century is the earliest example of this type of calligraphy and ornamentation; and the thirty-part Maghribi Rab'ah, bequeathed by Sultan Abu al-Hasan al-Marini of Morocco in AH 750, is the only manuscript remaining from the three collections that he dispatched to the mosques of the three most holy cities of Islam (Mecca, Madina and Jerusalem). In bringing these fascinating manuscripts to the attention of the world, Khader Salameh hopes to generate concern for their preservation before the passage of time takes its toll upon them. In conjunction with UNESCO, the director of the Islamic Museum and director of the al-Aqsa Mosque library Khader Salameh has written this book with the aim of drawing international attention to these fascinating manuscripts, in the hope that this will lead to concern for their preservation before the passage of time destroys them completely. He is also the author of several indexes of other Jerusalem manuscripts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vckRtGOVf3YC&dq=Qur%27an+Manuscripts+in+the+Al-haram+Al+Sherif+Islamic+Museum+Jerusalem&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The life of Nephi: The son of Lehi, who emigrated from Jerusalem, in Judea, to the land which is now known as South America, about six centuries before the coming of our Savior","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LgtOAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Temple, its ministry and services: As they were at the time of Jesus Christ","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LHT6a0E909QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Harvie/Harvey family of Hants County, Nova Scotia","description":"James Harvie (d.1786/1792) and his family immigrated in 1760 from Scotland to Newport, Hants County, Nova Scotia.

Times Critics Top Books of 2021 New York Times Bestseller Best Books of the Year ? Washington Post, TIME, NPR, Oprah Daily, Boston Globe, Christian Science Monitor, Kansas City Independent, Los Angeles Public Library, Washington Independent Review of Books, Spy, Audile, Biblioracle, AbeBooks The essential, sweeping story of Juneteenth s integral importance to American history, as told by a Pulitzer Prizewinning historian and Texas native. Weaving together American history, dramatic family chronicle, and searing episodes of memoir, Annette Gordon-Reed s On Juneteenth provides a historian s view of the country s long road to Juneteenth, recounting both its origins in Texas and the enormous hardships that African-Americans have endured in the century since, from Reconstruction through Jim Crow and beyond. All too aware of the stories of cowboys, ranchers, and oilmen that have long dominated the lore of the Lone Star State, Gordon-Reed herself a Texas native and the descendant of enslaved people brought to Texas as early as the 1820s forges a new and profoundly truthful narrative of her home state, with implications for us all. Combining personal anecdotes with poignant facts gleaned from the annals of American history, Gordon-Reed shows how, from the earliest presence of Black people in Texas to the day in Galveston on June 19, 1865, when Major General Gordon Granger announced the end of legalized slavery in the state, African-Americans played an integral role in the Texas story. Reworking the traditional  Alamo  framework, she powerfully demonstrates, among other things, that the slave- and race-based economy not only defined the fractious era of Texas independence but precipitated the Mexican-American War and, indeed, the Civil War itself. In its concision, eloquence, and clear presentation of history, On Juneteenth vitally revises conventional renderings of Texas and national history. As our nation verges on recognizing June 19 as a national holiday, On Juneteenth is both an essential account and a stark reminder that the fight for equality is exigent and ongoing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FwwDEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guy Time (Regular Guy)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zQyQi8EXbiMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Logic and Language","description":"This Festschrift was published in honor of Andre Scedrov on the occasion of his 65th birthday.

At first, Bennett was able to convince authorities and even Marcia's relatives that her drowning death was a tragic fishing accident in a fall from a partially built bridge over the Arkansas River on a cold, windy, rainy night. It would be another 17 years before her case was closed officially when Bennett died in prison while serving a life sentence for first degree murder. He might have gotten away completely without the efforts of Marcia's brother-in-law, Dr. Lowell Good, who hired his own investigators, and her nephew, David Zoll, who successfully fought a civil wrongful death suit against Bennett. It also took the tenacious work of Arkansas State Police Investigator Doug Stephens, who worked with Dr. Good and Zoll, and compiled the evidence that finally resulted in successful criminal prosecution. Even at that, it took three murder convictions before Bennett went to prison because the Arkansas Supreme Court reversed the first two jury verdicts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WWgjoNqlbZwC&dq=The+Deadly+Groom:+An+Ohio-Arkansas+True+Crime+Saga&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Real-Time Concepts for Embedded Systems","description":"'... a very good balance between the theory and practice of real-time embedded system designs.'

But then he is assigned to kill his former professor, now in exile, to demonstrate his loyalty to the Fascist state, and falls in love with a strange, compelling woman; his life is torn open - and with it the corrupt heart of Fascism. Moravia equates the rise of Italian Fascism with the psychological needs of his protagonist for whom conformity becomes an obsession in a life that has included parental neglect, an oddly self-conscious desire to engage in cruel acts, and a type of male beauty which, to Clerici's great distress, other men find attractive.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yANPEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Conformist&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Bowl","description":"Offers easy, accessible baking recipes, including cinnamon sugar snickerdoodles, fluffy yellow sheet cake, and lemon Bundt cake.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DX4fAQAAQBAJ&dq=One+Bowl&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pill Book, Eleventh Edition (Pill Book (Mass Market Paper))","description":"Revised for its tenth edition, \\"The Pill Book\\" remains the bestselling and and most trusted consumer reference to the most-prescribed drugs in the United States. 32-page color insert.

This study in social history was alternatively praised and damned by contemporary critics. As historian Thomas D. Clark notes in his introduction, the novel \\"opened wider a vein of racial hatred which was to poison further an age already in social and political upheaval.

In A House on Fire, John A. Jackson takes us inside the musical empire created by Kenny Gamble, Leon Huff, and Thom Bell, the three men who put Philadelphia Soul on the map. Here is the eye-opening story of three of the most influential and successful music producers of the seventies. Jackson shows how Gamble, Huff, and Bell developed a black recording empire second only to Berry Gordy's Motown, pumping out a string of chart-toppers from Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes, the Spinners, the O'Jays, the Stylistics, and many others. The author underscores the endemic racism of the music business at that time, revealing how the three men were blocked from the major record companies and outlets in Philadelphia because they were black, forcing them to create their own label, sign their own artists, and create their own sound. The sound they created--a sophisticated and glossy form of rhythm and blues, characterized by crisp, melodious harmonies backed by lush, string-laden orchestration and a hard-driving rhythm section--was a glorious success, producing at least twenty-eight gold or platinum albums and thirty-one gold or platinum singles. But after their meteoric rise and years of unstoppable success, their production company finally failed, brought down by payola, competition, a tough economy, and changing popular tastes. Funky, groovy, soulful--Philly Soul was the classic seventies sound. A House on Fire tells the inside story of this remarkable musical phenomenon.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-O1cCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mountaineering The Freedom of the Hills","description":" The definitive guide to mountains and climbing . . .

Not so with such products as cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, gambling, pornography, and firearms. For these particular products the environment can be actually hostile, and this poses special problems for marketers. It is these unusual marketing challenges that Dr. Davidson explores in this new study. Offering a unique cross-industry comparison of marketing tactics, strategies, and hurdles to be overcome to counter the lack of legitimacy for these products in the marketplace, his book will be fascinating reading for marketing, advertising, and sales professionals as well as for academicians and students in these fields. Readers will gain insights into the difficulties of marketing these five product categories why there is antagonism to these products, how marketers deal with this antagonism, and what specific marketing practices lead to increased social criticism. The study of these problems leads to a better understanding of the marketing of any product or service where the environment is unfriendly. Dr. Davidson discusses in some detail the different circumstances surrounding each of these product categories but points out that what they have in common is a high level of controversy at this point in their history. Hostility toward the products comes not from consumers. Buyers, and of course, sellers, enter into the exchange relationship quite willingly and enthusiastically. The hostility stems from some segments of society often advocacy groups who are opposed to the products and who gain a large enough membership or audience to impede and force changes in normal marketing practices. Marketers thus face the unusual situation of working with products that are perfectly legal, although heavily regulated, but which are socially unacceptable. In addition to the predictable challenges and risks encountered in marketing any product competitive pressures, changing economic conditions, shifts in consumer behavior marketers must develop special tactics and strategies to counter the opposition which these products face. These methods are explored here in a book that will make a unique contribution to our understanding of the marketing enterprise overall.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=okHROjGi2D8C&dq=Selling+Sin:+The+Marketing+of+Socially+Unacceptable+Products+Second+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Texas Gun Owners Guide: Who Can Bear Arms?

Instead of placing top priority on the role of tools, the pressure for their skillful use, and the related importance of interpersonal communication as a means for enhanced cooperation, this volume explores quite a different idea-- that the driving force in the evolution of human intellect was social expertise--a force which enabled the manipulation of others within the social group, who themselves are seen as posing the most challenging problems faced by primitive humans. The need to outwit one's clever colleagues then produces an evolutionary spiraling of \\"Machiavellian intelligence.\\" The book forms a complete and self-contained text on this fast-growing topic. It includes the origins of the basic premise and a wealth of exciting developments, described by an international team of authors from the fields of anthropology, psychology, and zoology.

Though the Graf Spee was outnumbered, it inflicted serious damage to the British ships before taking refuge in the harbor at Montivideo, Uruguay. Four days later her commander, assuming a much superior force waited for him, scuttled his ship and then committed suicide. This controversial story of risk and naval strategy has been told before, but Grove has unearthed previously unpublished sources to provide a definitive account of the battle and throw new light on the motivation of the Graf Spee's captain.

In this spirited work, Lasch calls out for a return to community, schools that teach history not self-esteem, and a return to morality and even the teachings of religion. He does this in a nonpartisan manner, looking to the lessons of American history, and castigating those in power for the ever-widening gap between the economic classes, which has created a crisis in American society. The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy is riveting social commentary.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RKuYjUeiCWgC&dq=The+Revolt+of+the+Elites+and+the+Betrayal+of+Democracy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"John Adams (2 Volume Set)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lVwqAAAAYAAJ&dq=John+Adams+(2+Volume+Set)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ping: A Frog in Search of a New Pond","description":"A parable about adapting to change in the tradition of Who Moved My Cheese? and Fish! follows the transformative journey a frog in search of a pond that will help him with his long-distance jumping ambitions, a quest that is aided by a wise owl mentor.

Did you ever worry that there might be goblins in the woods? Have you ever seen a moth fly by and wondered if it just might be a pixie? Have you stepped inside a ring of mushrooms and experienced the magic of the mushroom circle? Step into the circle now. Off the coast of Maine lies Terrapin Island, shaped like a tortoise whose seaweed-covered head disappears at high tide. Rings of Marasmius Oreades mushrooms have been growing on the island for hundreds of years. Each year the rings grow larger, like droplets in a puddle, until they reach the boundary of rocks that lets them go no further. The entire island lies within the magic circle. Terrapin Island is inhabited by giants, who are people rather like yourself, and by wee folk, who are tiny fairies and goblins of the sort most giants cannot see, and certainly do not believe in. The wee folk, however, are very aware of the giants, and for the most part, take a dim view of the way they live. You will be introduced to Fearbabe, the mesmerizing king of the goblins. His dysfunctional band of hooligans includes Obsequia, Hotspur, and Whipcad, the trio most recently banished to goblinhood by the fairies. You will meet the fairy architect, Aerial Fog, an ethereal pale green sprite who glows with the power of love, and who has a friend among the giants: Marian Fuller, an eccentric and ageless artist, winters in Mexico and spends her summers as librarian on Terrapin Island. Marian provides Aerial Fog with building materials in exchange for information about the wee folk. You will get to know Marian s seven-and-a-half-year-old friend, Dawn McKay, who suspects that Marian is a witch. Dawn loses a tooth in Marian s kitchen early one morning. That night two fairies, Featherbell and Fiddlehead, are sent to fetch the tooth from under Dawn s pillow.

She finds shelter with an old friend, Anna Zenner, but it is not the haven of security she needs when she discovers that Anna has been sub-poenaed to appear before a Grand Jury which is investigating Scarpetta for murder. Kay knows she is being framed and she also knows she can trust no-one. Meanwhile it appears that Chandonne killed a woman in New York before his murderous spree in Virginia, but when Scarpetta looks more closely into that case with the NY prosecutor Jaime Berger, proof of his guilt is far from certain - in fact she begins to believe that he may not be the perpetrator of any of the crimes he is accused of. As she follows the forensic trail to the real killer she gradually realises that someone has been spinning a web for years with the aim of entrapping her. Who is it, and why are they so desperate to be rid of her?

No matter how debilitating the medical procedures, Lehman wrote every day during chemotherapy and in the aftermath of radical surgery. With characteristic riffs of wit and imagination, he transmutes the details of his inner life into a prose narrative rich in incident and mental travel. The reader journeys with him from the first dreadful symptoms to the sunny days of recovery. This \\"fake memoir,\\" as he refers ironically to it, features one-hundred short vignettes that tell a life story. One Hundred Autobiographies is packed with insights and epiphanies that may prove as indispensable to aspiring writers as Rilke's Letters to a Young Poet. Set against the backdrop of Manhattan, Lehman summons John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch, Edward Said, and Lionel Trilling among his mentors. Dostoyevsky shows up, as does Graham Greene. Keith Richards and Patti Hansen put in an appearance, Edith Piaf sings, Clint Eastwood saves the neighborhood, and the Rat Pack comes along for the ride. These and other avatars of popular culture help Lehman to make sense of his own mortality and life story. One Hundred Autobiographies reveals a stunning portrait of a mind against the ropes, facing its own extinction, surviving and enduring.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IEKNDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Work of Michelangelo","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RaI1vgEACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Work+of+Michelangelo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teachings of the Hindu Mystics","description":"An anthology of the most lyrical, passionate, illuminating writings of the Hindu mystical tradition.

That's how long the routine analysis of data took with pencil, paper, and logarithmic tables. Thus when Wilhelm Olbers discovered the minor planet Vesta in 1807 and gathered the necessary observations, his friend Gauss needed almost 10 hours to hand calculate its orbit. That achievement astonished many less gifted astronomers of the time, who might have labored days to work out the orbit of a newfound comet. How different things are today! Gauss's method of orbit determination, presented in Chap. 11 of this book, runs to completion on a home computer in a few seconds at most. The machine will issue its accurate results in less time than it takes to key in the observations. In this book, a landmark in the youthful literature of astronomical com puter algorithms, Oliver Montenbruck and Thomas Pfleger cover many topics of keen interest to the practical observer. For me its most remarkable feature is the library of interrelated program modules, all elegantly written in PAS CAL. Anyone who has tried to create such modules in interpreted BASIC soon runs into trouble: too few letters for variable names, not enough signifi cant digits, and so on. These PASCAL routines are invoked one after another in coordinate transformations and calendar conversions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hpbsCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"little tuppen","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GUZqjwEACAAJ&dq=little+tuppen&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Chose to Climb","description":"The early climbing years of Britain's greatest living mountaineer, from his schooldays to his ascent of the Eiger in 1962.

The Best War Ever is about a war that was devised in fantasy and lost in delusion. It highlights the futility of lying to oneself and others in matters of life and death. And it offers lessons to the current generation so that, at least in our time, this never happens again. As the team of Rampton and Stauber show in their first new book since President Bush's reelection, the White House seems to have fooled no one as much as itself in the march toward a needless (from a security perspective) war in Iraq. As the authors argue, one of the most tragic consequences of the Bush administration's reliance on propaganda is its disdain for realistic planning in matters of war. Repeatedly, when faced with predictions of problems, U.S. policymakers dismissed the warnings of Iraq experts, choosing instead to promulgate its version of the war through conservative media outlets and PR campaigns. The result has been too few troops on the ground to maintain security; failure to anticipate the insurgency; and oblivious disregard, even contempt, for critics in either party who attempted to assess the human and economic costs of the war. Even now that withdrawal seems imminent, however, the administration and its allies continue their cover-ups: downplaying civilian deaths and military injuries; employing marketing buzzwords like \\"victory\\" repeatedly to shore up public opinion; and botched attempts, through third-party PR firms, at creating phony news. The Bush administration entered Iraq believing that its moral, technological, and military superiority would ensure victory abroad, and that its mastery of the politics would win support at home. Instead, it found a morass of problems that do not lend themselves to moralistic, technological, or propaganda-based solutions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PeteYqdPBZAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Genesis Factor","description":"Praise for the Emily Tempest series: \\"Beguiling first mystery . . . wonderful. -The New York Times Book Review  Startling turns of phrase, vivid Outback setting, and rich rendering of cultural differences. . . .

Virtually every part of this story revolves around race. More than 50 years after the publication of An American Dilemma, Gunnar Myrdal's 1944 classic about race relations in the USA, An American Health Dilemma presents a comprehensive and groundbreaking history and social analysis of race, race relations and the African-American medical and public health experience. Beginning with the origins of western medicine and science in Egypt, Greece and Rome the authors explore the relationship between race, medicine, and health care from the precursors of American science and medicine through the days of the slave trade with the harrowing middle passage and equally deadly breaking-in period through the Civil War and the gains of reconstruction and the reversals caused by Jim Crow laws. It offers an extensive examination of the history of intellectual and scientific racism that evolved to give sanction to the mistreatment, medical abuse, and neglect of African Americans and other non-white people. Also included are biographical portraits of black medical pioneers like James McCune Smith, the first African American to earn a degree from a European university, and anecdotal vignettes,like the tragic story of \\"the Hottentot Venus\\", which illustrate larger themes. An American Health Dilemma promises to become an irreplaceable and essential look at African-American and medical history and will provide an invaluable baseline for future exploration of race and racism in the American health system.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xLBzqlwN66gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Soldiers Of Summer","description":"After his father goes off to war during the summer of 1918, eleven-year-old Joe, along with his friends, contends with the town bullies and tries to figure out the meaning of courage.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5kwCAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Soldiers+Of+Summer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sister Noon","description":"Loosely based in historical fact, Sister Noon is a wryly funny, playfully mysterious, and totally subversive novel from the New York Times bestselling author of The Jane Austen Book Club.

While Benedict Anderson is best known for his classic book on nationalism, Imagined Communities, many of his most telling and incisive interventions have been made in his essays. Those collected in this new book span a range of subjects: from Aquino's Philippines, where the horses on the haciendas ate better than the stable-hands, to political assassination in contemporary Thailand, where government posts have become so lucrative that to gain them candidates will kill their rivals. In these writing, the subtle imbrication of politics, national imaginings, bureaucracy, modernization and its agents (particularly print culture) is brought out in all its complexity and richness. \\"The spectre of comparisons\\" was a phrase used by the celebrated Filipino nationalist and novelist Jose Rizal (1861-96), whose work and fate in the national imagination are discussed in these pages. In his finely wrought observations on Southeast Asian societies, Anderson raises deep questions concerning this spectre, about how, for instance, Manila is changed when it can no longer be seen through a comparison with European capitals, and how, more broadly, nationalism is produce by the process of increasing global connection. The Spectre of Comparisons is an indispensable resource for those interested in South-East Asia. But it also contains important theoretical and historical considerations about nationalism, national literature and memory, modernization, and the prospects for the Left in what Anderson dubs 'The New World Disorder'.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w8eypkzAcNoC&dq=The+Spectre+of+Comparisons:+Nationalism,+Southeast+Asia,+and+the+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Roman Hat Mystery: A Problem in Deduction","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=su-JtwEACAAJ&dq=The+Roman+Hat+Mystery:+A+Problem+in+Deduction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Develop Self-Confidence and Influence People By Public Speaking","description":"\\"...

The Crystal Cave The Hollow Hills The Last Enchantment Born the bastard son of a Welsh princess, Myrddin Emrys -- or, as he would later be known, Merlin -- leads a perilous childhood in The Crystal Cave, haunted by portents and visions.

In The Last Enchantment, Arthur Pendragon is king at last. Unchallenged on the battlefield, he melds the country together in a time of promise as Merlin works to keep safe the once and future king. But sinister powers plot to destroy Camelot, and when the witch-queen Morgause -- Arthur's own half sister -- ensnares him in an incestuous liaison, a fatal web of love, betrayal, and bloody vengeance is woven. Extensively researched and beautifully written, The Merlin Trilogy is the epic culmination of an acclaimed career, a legend in and of itself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9D43X7Bxa00C&dq=The+Merlin+Trilogy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great circle,","description":"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER ? A TODAY SHOW #ReadWithJenna BOOK CLUB PICK ? WOMEN'S PRIZE FOR FICTION NOMINEE ? The unforgettable story of a daredevil female aviator determined to chart her own course in life, at any cost: an  epic trip through Prohibition and World War II, from Montana to London to present-day Hollywood and you ll relish every minute  (People). After being rescued as infants from a sinking ocean liner in 1914, Marian and Jamie Graves are raised by their dissolute uncle in Missoula, Montana. There--after encountering a pair of barnstorming pilots passing through town in beat-up biplanes--Marian commences her lifelong love affair with flight. At fourteen she drops out of school and finds an unexpected and dangerous patron in a wealthy bootlegger who provides a plane and subsidizes her lessons, an arrangement that will haunt her for the rest of her life, even as it allows her to fulfill her destiny: circumnavigating the globe by flying over the North and South Poles. A century later, Hadley Baxter is cast to play Marian in a film that centers on Marian's disappearance in Antarctica. Vibrant, canny, disgusted with the claustrophobia of Hollywood, Hadley is eager to redefine herself after a romantic film franchise has imprisoned her in the grip of cult celebrity. Her immersion into the character of Marian unfolds, thrillingly, alongside Marian's own story, as the two women's fates--and their hunger for self-determination in vastly different geographies and times--collide. Epic and emotional, meticulously researched and gloriously told, Great Circle is a monumental work of art, and a tremendous leap forward for the prodigiously gifted Maggie Shipstead.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Cw76DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thoughts to Share With a Wonderful Son: A Collection from Blue Mountain Arts (\\"the Language of ...\\" Series)","description":"Created by the bestselling poet and artist team of Susan Polis Schutz and Stephen Schutz, this distinctive series of hardcover books has a perfect title for every customer.

One comes from Silicon Valley. There's never been a better time to be an artist, it goes. If you've got a laptop, you've got a recording studio. If you've got an iPhone, you've got a movie camera. And if production is cheap, distribution is free: it's called the Internet. Everyone's an artist; just tap your creativity and put your stuff out there. The other comes from artists themselves. Sure, it goes, you can put your stuff out there, but who's going to pay you for it? Everyone is not an artist. Making art takes years of dedication, and that requires a means of support. If things don't change, a lot of art will cease to be sustainable. So which account is true? Since people are still making a living as artists today, how are they managing to do it? William Deresiewicz, a leading critic of the arts and of contemporary culture, set out to answer those questions. Based on interviews with artists of all kinds, The Death of the Artist argues that we are in the midst of an epochal transformation. If artists were artisans in the Renaissance, bohemians in the nineteenth century, and professionals in the twentieth, a new paradigm is emerging in the digital age, one that is changing our fundamental ideas about the nature of art and the role of the artist in society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xP2qDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dyeing to Knit","description":"Hand-dyed yarns are so sensuous, with their custom hues and rich blends of colors, that every knitter longs to work with them.

Trumpeted as a means to promote the general welfare, mass consumption quickly outgrew its economic objectives and became synonymous with patriotism, social equality, and the American Dream. Material goods came to embody the promise of America, and the power of consumers to purchase everything from vacuum cleaners to convertibles gave rise to the power of citizens to purchase political influence and effect social change. Yet despite undeniable successes and unprecedented affluence, mass consumption also fostered economic inequality and the fracturing of society along gender, class, and racial lines.

The Darker the Night, The Brighter the Stars weaves a scientist s understanding of the mind  its logic, its nuance, how we think about what makes a person  with a poet s approach to humanity, that crucial and ever-elusive why. It s a story that unfolds through the centuries, along the path of humankind s constant quest to discover what makes us human, and the answers that consistently slip out of our grasp. It s modern medicine and psychology and ancient tales; history and myth combined; fiction and the stranger truth. But, most importantly, it s Broks  story, grounded in his own most fascinating cases as a clinician patients with brain injuries that revealed something fundamental about the link between the raw stuff of our bodies and brains and the ineffable selves we take for who we are. Tracing a loose arc of loss, acceptance, and renewal, he unfolds striking, imaginative stories of everything from Schopenhauer to the Greek philosophers to jazz guitarist Pat Martino in order to sketch a multifaceted view of humanness that is as heartbreaking at it is affirming.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qt84DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Social Welfare: Politics and Public Policy (Study Edition) (5th Edition)","description":"Note: This is the bound book only and does not include access to the Enhanced Pearson eText.

With her slyly humorous novel, Herland (1915), she created a fictional utopia where not only is face powder obsolete, but an all-female population has created a peaceful, progressive, environmentally-conscious country from which men have been absent for two thousand years. Gilman was enormously prolific, publishing five hundred poems, two hundred short stories, hundreds of essays, eight novels, and seven years' worth of her monthly magazine, The Forerunner. She emerged as one of the key figures in the women's movement of her day, advocating equality of the sexes, the right of women to work, and socialized child care, among other issues. Today Gilman is perhaps best known for the chilling depiction of a woman's mental breakdown in her unforgettable short story, \\"The Yellow Wall-Paper\\".

The Forest Ranger has been essential reading for generations of professionals and scholars in forestry, public administration, and organizational behavior who are interested in the administration of public lands and how the top managers of a large, dispersed organization with multiple objectives like the Forest Service shape the behavior of its field officers into a coherent, unified program. Published as a special reprint in conjunction with the 100th anniversary of the U.S. Forest Service, The Forest Ranger is as relevant and timely today as when it was first issued in 1960. In addition to the original text, this special reprint of The Forest Ranger includes two new forewords and an afterword that highlight how much we have learned from Herbert Kaufman. The first foreword, by Harold K. (Pete) Steen, former president of the Forest History Society, considers the book's impact on the forestry community and explains its continued relevance in light of changes in the culture and mission of today's Forest Service. The second, by Richard P. Nathan, co-director of the Rockefeller Institute of Government, considers the book's contribution to our understanding of administrative and organizational behavior. A new afterword by author Herbert Kaufman describes how his landmark study came into being and offers a candid assessment of how his theories about the agency's operations and its future have held up over time. In 1960, the Forest Service had a welldeserved reputation for excellence, and The Forest Ranger was a seminal analysis of the how's and why's of its success. Kaufman also warned, however, that an organization so unified and well adapted to its environment would have difficulties navigating social change. He was right in his concerns: The environmental, civil rights, and women's movements have all presented challenges to the character and purpose of the Forest Service, ultimately changing the organization in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. Now, as then, The Forest Ranger is a striking and prescient case study of how a complex organization operates and evolves over time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eIhYnZqsQEYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Without a home","description":"Homeless women and their children who reside in a transitional housing facility or shelter have experienced multiple traumas and disruptions in their earliest attachments.

Beginning with tutorials and a few touches of history to position residential broadband today, this essential guide examines how competing technologies will struggle for supremacy in a chaotic market. It stakes out the battles between ADSL and cable modems, IP and ATM, telephone companies and CATV companies, televisions and personal computers, and professional applications and consumer applications. It does so with reverence for none-some will win and some will lose as the market emerges over the next decade or so. Our guide is kim Maxwell, an entrepreneur and executive who has spent twenty-five years inventing ways to make communications technologies and markets fit together. His analysis takes some surprising turns: * The Internet will not be the dominant network for residential broadband. * Despite its current power, IP may over time give way to ATM for residential broadband. * Cable modems have the early lead, but the DSL tortoise will catch up. * Fiber to the Home and the Information Superhighway are at least fifteen years away and depend upon HDTV. * Despite regulatory intentions, residential networking will return to a monopoly within thirty years. * Computers and televisions will not converge. * Ethernet will dominate home networking. * Video-on-demand will not be a viable market for at least five years. * In the long run. Consumer applications such as shopping and entertainment will dominate the more near-term applications for Internet access and telecommuting. * But, the market can only begin with the personal computer and its natural applications-Internet access and telecommuting.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uzLvAAAAMAAJ&dq=Residential+Broadband:+An+Insider%27s+Guide+to+the+Battle+for+the+Last+Mile&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Name Is Izzy","description":"Courageous memoir of a successful business woman who loses much before finding balance & a new focus for life.

Despite this, a significant number of kills fell to future aces such as Cvitan Galic and Mato Dubovak during this time, and when the units re-equipped with Bf 109G-10s in 1943, battle-seasoned Croat pilots started to rack up impressive scores.

Bush and his White House advisers secretly employed a celebrity magazine editor and his team of scrappy paparazzi to capture Saddam Hussein on December 13, 2003. HOLLYWOOD HUSSEIN features a plot twist so amusingly plausible that it should give readers legitimate cause to doubt whether previously published accounts of Saddam Husseins capture in a spider hole south of Tikrit, Iraq, were true or just a U.S.-manufactured propaganda stunt. The end of the story leaves readers left laughing all the way to the voting booth.Featuring the left-leaning political satire of Our Gang (Philip Roths 1972 comic take on the Nixon White House), HOLLYWOOD HUSSEIN is also a ripped-from-the-headlines political tale in the spirit of Primary Colors. The Bush White House in HOLLYWOOD HUSSEIN is one that uses newsstand sales of weekly celebrity rags rather than opinion polls to gauge public opinion; that is beset by petty personality clashes among advisers; that hires a sexy hotel heiress as its press secretary; that trusts the Hollywood paparazzi more than U.S. special forces; that is run by an ADD-plagued Texan whos more interested in jogging than discussing public policy; and that employs the nations reality-TV craze in its foreign policy efforts. The result is a critically amusing portrait of two of the nations most powerful institutions: the popular media and presidential politics. Told through the first-person accounts of those who conspired to pull off Operation Hollywood, the story is told in the imagined words of a diverse cast of both fictional and real-life characters, including George Bush, Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and last but not least Saddam Hussein. Most of the events recounted in the book are to have taken place between October 2003 and December 2003. The first-person accounts are presented as having come from transcripts, previously classified documents and firsthand interviews conducted by journalist Ken Baker.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Yxt_AAAACAAJ&dq=Hollywood+Hussein:+How+the+U.S.+Really+Captured+Saddam&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marvel Masterworks: Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 3","description":"Spider-Man battles a variety of villains, including the Master Planner, the Molten Man, the Looter, Kraven the Hunter and the Green Goblin, whose identity he learns after his own identity as Peter Parker is revealed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GdrkPAAACAAJ&dq=Marvel+Masterworks:+Amazing+Spider-Man+Vol.+3&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Metaphase","description":"As J.D.

Ever-bigger print runs of increasingly grotesque photos of women in every imaginable position have edged out emotion and reduced erotica to mere physical sex appeal. Only in the late 1970s did great men like Helmut Newton and Mapplethorpe come to the fore with high-quality art photography. As leading expert and collector of erotic art Alexandre Dupouy points out, \\"\\"In the past 40 years, most photographers captured women's bodies in sexually arousing positions, with only a handful of true artists trying to capture the erotic aura that women radiate.\\"\\" This book is a journey through a century of collector's photographs that set forth how our perception of woman has developed over time and how the erotic dimensions of modesty and tenderness find expression on celluloid. The author goes on to provide a tightly reasoned rationale that stakes out the hallmarks of a true \\"\\"French School of Erotic Art Photography.\\"\\" The models have a distinctly natural appeal that dates back to a time when there were no plastic surgeons around to reshape models before they faced the shutter. This alone makes each photo a sincerely emotional experience.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=incLAAAACAAJ&dq=Erotic+Art+Photography+(Temporis)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Born to wander: An autobiography of Peter Rivera and his story of Rare Earth","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bixpGwAACAAJ&dq=Born+to+wander:+An+autobiography+of+Peter+Rivera+and+his+story+of+Rare+Earth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lachlan McGillivray, Indian Trader: The Shaping of the Southern Colonial Frontier","description":"Lachlan McGillivray knew firsthand of the frontier's natural wealth and strategic importance to England, France, and Spain, because he lived deep within it among his wife's people, the Creeks.

He was both a consultant to the leaders of colonial Georgia and South Carolina and their emissary to the great chiefs of the Creeks, Cherokees, Choctaws, and Chickasaws. Cashin discusses the aims and ambitions of the frontier's many interest groups, profiles the figures who catalyzed the power struggles, and explains events from the vantage points of traders and Native Americans. He also offers information about the rise of the southern elite, for in the decade before he left America, McGillivray was a successful planter and slave trader, a popular politician, and a member of the Savannah gentry.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2ZmquZKe6PwC&dq=Lachlan+McGillivray,+Indian+Trader:+The+Shaping+of+the+Southern+Colonial+Frontier&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sherlock Holmes and the Mysterious Friend of Oscar Wilde","description":"Stumped by a pair of particulary puzzling cases involving blackmail and death threats against Holmes himself, the noted detective reluctantly accepts the help of Oscar Wilde","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5MqbQgAACAAJ&dq=Sherlock+Holmes+and+the+Mysterious+Friend+of+Oscar+Wilde&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"CROSSING INFINITY","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GoHpzgEACAAJ&dq=CROSSING+INFINITY&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Multilingual Dictionary of Agronomic Plants","description":"The Dictionary contains the names of nearly 2500 plant species, in some cases including subspecies and varieties.

In this ground-breaking book, the author questions this assumption and advances the debate through an empirical analysis of masculinity in the revealing contexts of same-sex (football and polo) and cross-sex (tango) relations. Because of its rich history, Argentina provides the ideal setting in which to study the intersection of masculine and national constructs: hybridization, creolization and a culture of performance have all informed both gender and national identities. Further, the author argues that, counter to claims made by globalization theorists, the importance of performance to Argentinian men and women has a long history and has powerfully shaped the national psyche. But this book takes the analysis far beyond national boundaries to address general arguments in anthropology which are not culture-specific, and the discussion poses important comparative questions and addresses central theoretical issues, from the interplay of morality and ritual, to a comparison between the popular and the aristocratic, to the importance of  othering' in national constructions - particularly those relating to sport. This book represents a major contribution, not only to anthropology, but to the study of gender, nationalism and culture in its broadest sense.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BcsQEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ruthless.com (Tom Clancy's Power Plays)","description":"Encryption technology keeps the codes for the world's security and communication systems top secret.

Grant (Great commanders)","description":"General Grant's personal memoirs are a must read for all Civil War buffs and those even remotely interested in history. This book, which includes both Volume I and II, articulately spells out the military career of one of the United States' greatest generals. Grant's memoirs are well-written, thoughtful, insightful, and offer more than a glimpse into the mind of U.S. Grant. Volume I opens with a heartfelt preface where Grant explains how his diminishing health pushed him to complete this work and \\"asking no favor but hoping (his remarks) will meet the approval of the reader.\\" They most definitely do. Following the preface, the reader is given a (very) short review of his early childhood, life at West Point, and early Army life. The next one hundred pages are dedicated to the Mexican War followed by his resignation from the military and civilian life in Illinois. The remainder of Volume I and all of Volume II extensively deal with the war between the states. Volume I (written before Grant realized he was critically ill) is rich in detail of the various military campaigns and his ascension through the military ranks. Volume II hurls the reader into the conflict, reads rapidly, and is rife with Grant's personal observations and insights. This second volume picks up where the first left off--following Vicksburg to the campaigns in Tennessee to the Battle of the Wilderness to Sherman's March to the Sea to the Battle of Franklin right up to Appomattox and all the events of April and May 1865. These campaigns are told from the commanding general's perspective with great overview and detail. However, what really makes Volume II special are all the personal observations and insightful comments about those Grant served with and against. Grant is thoughtful and displays much about himself as this great book draws to a close. An eloquently written, detailed, first-person account of the Civil War that offers much to those who read it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bI0ykwEACAAJ&dq=Personal+memoirs+of+Ulysses+S.+Grant+(Great+commanders)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quiet Time (Sesame Street Toddler Books)","description":"The Muppets wind down the noisy activities of evening and begin the quiet time to get ready for sleep.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uq1oDIxhpj0C&dq=Quiet+Time+(Sesame+Street+Toddler+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The song of Hiawatha (Professor Meiklejohn's series)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zv05AAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome","description":"-No other publication currently available offers such a comprehensive overview of the care required by a child with hypoplasia of the left heart -Address the needs of the families of children born with this condition, and is the first to includes insight from parents -Authors are acknowledged world leaders in the diagnostic, medical and social needs of children born with this condition","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t5fxg9T1ezAC&dq=Hypoplastic+Left+Heart+Syndrome&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Claiming Georgia Tate","description":"\\"It s rare and exciting to discover a talented new writer like Gigi Amateau.\\"   Judy Blume Twelve-year-old Georgia Tate wishes she could stay home in Mississippi forever with her preacher granddaddy and her best friend Ginger.

It is a book that takes a close look at MacArthur, his failings and brilliance, and a hard look at the idea of limited war.

While recent political and philosophical movements have recognized that cognition, the self, and politics are embedded in culture, most fail to appreciate the deep changes in rationalism and liberal theory this implies, others leap directly into relativism, and nearly all fail to define culture. Cultural Revolutions systematically defines culture, gauges the consequences of the ineradicably cultural nature of cognition and action, yet argues that none of this implies relativism. After showing where other & new culturalists&  have gone wrong, Cahoone offers his own definition of culture as teleologically organized practices, artifacts, and narratives and analyzes the notion of cultural membership in relation to race, ethnicity, and & primordialism.&  He provides a theory of culture& s role in how we form our sense of reality and argues that the proper conception of culture dissolves & the problem&  of cultural relativism. Applying this perspective to Islamic fundamentalism, Cahoone identifies its conflict with the West as representing the break between two of three historically distinctive forms of reason. Rather than being & irrational,&  he shows, fundamentalism embodies a rationality only recently devalued& but not entirely abandoned& by the West. The persistence of plural forms of reason suggests that modernization in various world cultures is compatible with continued, even magnified, cultural differences.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NSTh12R4YioC&dq=Cultural+Revolutions:+Reason+Versus+Culture+In+Philosophy,+Politics,+And+Jihad&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Subaru 1600 and 1800 1980 Thru 1989 Automotive Repair Manual (Book No 681)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ooEtAQAAIAAJ&dq=Subaru+1600+and+1800+1980+Thru+1989+Automotive+Repair+Manual+(Book+No+681)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Classic Lanterns (Schiffer Book for Collectors)","description":"The first photographic investigation of the history, companies, people, places, uses, prices, and the kerosene lanterns themselves.

Members of what came to be known among faculty, students, and diverse community members as the Mountains & Rivers Workshop met regularly to read and discuss Snyder's epic poem. Here the poem served as a commons that turned the multiversity into a university once again, if only for a moment. The Workshop invited writers, teachers and scholars from Northern California and Japan to speak on various aspects of Snyder's great accomplishment. This book captures the excitement of these gatherings and invites readers to enter the poem through essays and talks by David Abram, Wendell Berry, Carl Bielefeldt, Tim Dean, Jim Dodge, Robert Hass, Stephanie Kaza, Julia Martin, Michael McClure, Nanao Sakaki, and Katsunori Yamazato. It includes an interview with Gary Snyder, appendices, and other resources for further study. Snyder once introduced a reading of this work with reference to whitewater rapids, saying most of his writing is like a Class III run where you will do just fine on your own, but that Mountains and Rivers is more like Class V: if you're going to make it to takeout, you need a guide.

But its ignorance is not bliss. Opening the door between worlds, Clive Barker delivers his characters into the heart of the human mystery; into a place of revelation, where the forces which have shaped our past and are ready to destroy our future are at work. It's back to the shores of Quiddity, the undulant dream sea that separates worldly Cosm from the trippy Metacosm, for a restaging of the epic struggle for the Art, major magic that was last coveted by the infinitely wicked Kissoon, who sponsored the previous battle to control this transcendental force. Itinerant biker chick Tesla Bombeck leads the way to Everville, a sleepy small town in Oregon about to be savaged by the passage of the Iad Uroboros a mindless, evil juggernaut bent to Kissoon's will through a rip in the veil between Cosm and Metacosm.

By grasping the symbolic language of dreams, Fromm explains, we can then also understand the deeper wisdom of myths, art, and literature. This also gives us access to what we, and our society, usually repress. Fromm shares the history of dream interpretations, and demonstrates his analysis of many types of dreams.

It was during this period that the Babylonian Talmud came to prominence through the efforts of the Babylonian rabbinic schools. The Talmud continues to govern the life of traditional Jewry, orthodox and conservative, throughout the world and to provide important guidance for reform Jews as well. Because of the Talmud's continuing influence, an understanding of this period is crucial to any understanding of present-day Judaism. Dr. Neusner centers his study on three key words applied to rabbinic Judaism: power - the way in which one man caused another to do his will; myth - the stories people told and the beliefs they held to account for and justify the power-relationships they experienced; and function - how things worked. This important book deals with complex materials in a clear, nontechnical manner that will prove useful to those persons who are not familiar with Hebraic studies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pIFLAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Neat Ideas Daybook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hUs8FKGiL3UC&dq=The+Neat+Ideas+Daybook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Winged Gospel: America's Romance with Aviation, 1900-1950","description":"Reconstructs the early years of aviation and discusses famous and lesser-known aviators, ranging from Charles Lindbergh and Amelia Earhart to Calbraith P.

Wall Street Journal A suspense filled tale of murder on the American frontier shedding new light on a family of serial killers in Kansas, whose horrifying crimes gripped the attention of a nation still reeling from war. In 1873 the people of Labette County, Kansas made a grisly discovery. Buried by a trailside cabin beneath an orchard of young apple trees were the remains of countless bodies. Below the cabin itself was a cellar stained with blood. The Benders, the family of four who once resided on the property were nowhere to be found. The discovery sent the local community and national newspapers into a frenzy that continued for decades, sparking an epic manhunt for the Benders. The idea that a family of seemingly respectable homesteaders one among the thousands relocating farther west in search of land and opportunity after the Civil War were capable of operating \\"a human slaughter pen\\" appalled and fascinated the nation. But who the Benders really were, why they committed such a vicious killing spree and whether justice ever caught up to them is a mystery that remains unsolved to this day. Set against the backdrop of postbellum America, Hell s Half-Acre explores the environment capable of allowing such horrors to take place. Drawing on extensive original archival material, Susan Jonusas introduces us to a fascinating cast of characters, many of whom have been previously missing from the story. Among them are the families of the victims, the hapless detectives who lost the trail, and the fugitives that helped the murderers escape. Hell s Half-Acre is a journey into the turbulent heart of nineteenth century America, a place where modernity stalks across the landscape, violently displacing existing populations and building new ones. It is a world where folklore can quickly become fact and an entire family of criminals can slip through a community s fingers, only to reappear in the most unexpected of places.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=I1g2EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Engaging Reader (3rd Edition)","description":"In this new edition of their groundbreaking book Strategies That Work, Stephanie Harvey and Anne Goudvis share the work and thinking they've done since the second edition came out a decade ago and offer new perspectives on how to explicitly teach thinking strategies so that students become engaged, thoughtful, independent readers. Thirty new lessons and new and revised chapters shine a light on children's thinking, curiosity, and questions. Steph and Anne tackle close reading, close listening, text complexity, and critical thinking in a new chapter on building knowledge through thinking-intensive reading and learning. Other fully revised chapters focus on digital reading, strategies for integrating comprehension and technology, and comprehension across the curriculum. The new edition is organized around three sections: Part I provides readers with a solid introduction to reading comprehension instruction, including the principles that guide practice, suggestions for text selection, and a review of recent research that underlies comprehension instruction. Part II contains lessons to put these principles into practice for all areas of reading comprehension. Part III shows you how to integrate comprehension instruction across the curriculum and the school day, particularly in science and social studies. Updated bibliographies, including the popular \\"Great Books for Teaching Content,\\" are accessible online. Since the first publication of Strategies That Work, more than a million teachers have benefited from Steph and Anne's practical advice on creating classrooms that are incubators for deep thought.

Here is the awkward child who grew up amid material wealth and emotional isolation; the young bride who watched her brilliant, charismatic husband - a confidant to John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson - plunge into the mental illness that would culminate in his suicide. And here is the widow who shook off her grief and insecurity to take on a president and a pressman's union as she entered the profane boys' club of the newspaper business. As timely now as ever, Personal History is an exemplary record of our history and of the woman who played such a shaping role within them, discovering her own strength and sense of self as she confronted - and mastered - the personal and professional crises of her fascinating life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gs5MDwAAQBAJ&dq=Personal+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The 12 Leadership Principles of Dean Smith","description":"Drawing on his coach's winning program on the court, Tar Heels forward David Chadwick recalls the secret of Dean Smith's success in basketball, transforming his philosophy into a \\"people-first\\" formula for winning in life as well. 30,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J8_ZAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+12+Leadership+Principles+of+Dean+Smith&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nuclear Power Reactor Safety","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QRojAAAAMAAJ&dq=Nuclear+Power+Reactor+Safety&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rosa Mexicano: A Culinary Autobiography with 60 Recipes","description":"The author presents sixty distinctive, authentic Mexican dishes, along with photographs and personal reminiscences","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7R0uDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Devil Wind (Harlequin Historicals Ser., No. 089)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O3pYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Devil+Wind+(Harlequin+Historicals+Ser.,+No.+089)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ayrton Senna Pb","description":"Com a mesma velocidade que mostrou nas pistas, sua vida o transformou no maior piloto de F rmula 1 de sua  poca.

She also regularly published stories in The New Yorker for close to two decades. For all that, her work, as steely as it is delicate, remains the secret of a small number of intensely devoted readers. The publication of her finest novel, A Game of Hide and Seek, long unavailable in the United States, should help to change that. This is an unabashed love story, capturing all the uncertainty and inevitability and deceptiveness of true love, tracking the shifting currents of emotional life, and never yielding to melodrama. Set in Britain between the wars a time of transition between old convention and new ways the book s heroine is Harriet, the only child of a suffragette, whom we meet as a shy and domestic and not especially smart or pretty girl. At eighteen she falls in love with Vesey, but after Vesey must go away, she marries another man, Charles, and bears a child. Then Vesey returns. Love is at the center of the book, but so too is Taylor s extraordinary knack for depicting characters. The minor figures in the book from Harriet s mother s friend Caroline, with her progressive politics, to Charles, his coworkers, and his mother, to Betsy with her schoolgirl crush on her Greek teacher are as memorable as the passion and heartache of Harriet and Vesey.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1y8eAUDHDTwC&dq=Hide+or+seek&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reframing Paul: Conversations in Grace & Community","description":"Mark Strom unveils Paul in his original context and invites us to engage with him in new terms.

However, again like Germany, the new state of Hungary created an air arm in secret during the 1930s. Hungarian fighter pilots first saw action against their Slovakian neighbours in early 1939, following the annexation of Czechoslovakia by Germany. In June 1941, Hungarian armed forces joined the Germany in the invasion of Russia, and pilots from the I/I Fighter Group saw continuous action into 1942. Flying CR.42s, Re.2000s and Bf 109Es, pilots scored a modest number of kills. However, when the Bf 109G-equipped Hungarian 101 ?Puma1 Fighter Regiment was committed to action over Kharkov in April 1943, numerous aces started to rapidly build there scores. One year later the unit returned home in order to defend Hungarian cities from American heavy bombers, and pilots such as Dezs? Szentgy?rgyi and Gy?rgy Debr?dy scored the bulk of their kills in desperate battles against American fighters and bombers. Unlike most of Germany1s Eastern European allies, Hungary did not capitulate during the Russian advances of 1944, and its fighter pilots fought on until May 1945.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uDgUvgAACAAJ&dq=Hungarian+Aces+of+World+War+2&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Optimal Thinking: 100-Day Audio-CD Program for Permanent Results","description":"Donors, leaders of nonprofits, and public policy makers usually have the best of intentions to serve society and improve social conditions. But often their solutions fall far short of what they want to accomplish and what is truly needed. Moreover, the answers they propose and fund often produce the opposite of what they want over time. We end up with temporary shelters that increase homelessness, drug busts that increase drug-related crime, or food aid that increases starvation. How do these unintended consequences come about and how can we avoid them? By applying conventional thinking to complex social problems, we often perpetuate the very problems we try so hard to solve, but it is possible to think differently, and get different results. Systems Thinking for Social Change enables readers to contribute more effectively to society by helping them understand what systems thinking is and why it is so important in their work. It also gives concrete guidance on how to incorporate systems thinking in problem solving, decision making, and strategic planning without becoming a technical expert. Systems thinking leader David Stroh walks readers through techniques he has used to help people improve their efforts to end homelessness, improve public health, strengthen education, design a system for early childhood development, protect child welfare, develop rural economies, facilitate the reentry of formerly incarcerated people into society, resolve identity-based conflicts, and more. The result is a highly readable, effective guide to understanding systems and using that knowledge to get the results you want.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N1uZCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Above Mexico City","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=C0c_AAAACAAJ&dq=Above+Mexico+City&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Be Prepared for the AP Calculus Exam","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0cC7DAEACAAJ&dq=Be+Prepared+for+the+AP+Calculus+Exam&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death of a Pilgrim","description":"A murder in Israel has repercussions in New York & Florence, Italy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ldoDAAAACAAJ&dq=Death+of+a+Pilgrim&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Second Saint Omnibus","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1XdYPwAACAAJ&dq=The+Second+Saint+Omnibus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sea of Galilee and its fishermen in the New Testament","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qDrTGAAACAAJ&dq=The+Sea+of+Galilee+and+its+fishermen+in+the+New+Testament&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Practical Reusable UNIX Software","description":"Over the past few years, researchers working at AT&T Bell Laboratories have developed a set of powerful new tools and software libraries that significantly streamline the job of software development by enhancing software reuse.

In considering French-speaking authors from France, Belgium, the United States, the Maghreb, and Sub-Saharan Africa, this collection delineates a rich international perspective on some of the most disturbing events of our time. Each essay testifies to the urgency expressed in works of fiction to give an account of human catastrophes, from the Shoah and the Rwandan genocide to the terrorist attacks of September 11, and the ongoing oppression of women in Islamic nations. Themes underlying this volume include an investigation into the origins of evil, its representations in writing, and the ethical responsibilities of authors who write on human suffering. Contemporary fiction on evil confronts us with fundamental questions: Can evil be attributed to intentionality, is evil  subconscious,  or is it the result of impersonal forces? Which styles of writing are ethically appropriate or effective for depicting evil? Can we speak of a veritable  poetics of evil  shared by contemporary authors? When does a literary text on evil become  evil ? In providing informed and nuanced answers to these important questions, the scholars engage in crucial theories of psychoanalysis, post-structuralism, and post-modernism, address a number of issues raised by trauma and genocide studies, and draw from critical frameworks in literary theory on testimony, the limits of representing the extreme, and  transgressive  writing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v44nBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Confederate agent: A discovery in history","description":"With never-before published contemporary photographs, facsimile documents and other illustrations...

California's version of the \\"three strikes\\" law, enacted in 1994, was broader and more severe than measures considered or passed in any other state. Punishment and Democracy is the first examination of the actual impact this law has had. Franklin Zimring, Sam Kamin, and Gordon Hawkins look at the origins of the law in California, compare it to other crackdown laws, and analyze the data collected on crime rates in Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco in the year before and the two years after the law went into effect. They show that the \\"three strikes\\" law was a significant development in criminal justice policy making, not only at the state level, but also at the national level. They conclude with an examination of the trend toward populist initiatives driving penal policy. The importance of the subject and the stature of the authors make this book required reading for policy analysts, criminal justice scholars, elected officials, and indeed any American seeking to know more about \\"get-tough\\" criminal sentencing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yoA_ZwmTcakC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MEDICINE.

His analysis of the texts becomes profoundly personal as he reflects on his own spiritual and intellectual odyssey from determined skeptic to devout Christian. Ultimately, Limbaugh concludes that the words Christians have treasured for centuries stand up to his exhaustive enquiry including his examination of historical and religious evidence beyond the gospels and thereby affirms Christian faith, spirituality, and tradition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_-gHDAAAQBAJ&dq=Genesis+for+Today+3rd+Edition:+The+relevance+of+the+creationevolution+debate+to+today%27s+society&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lloyd Rees: The Last Twenty Years","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9pOCZwEACAAJ&dq=Lloyd+Rees:+The+Last+Twenty+Years&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Futurians: The story of the science fiction \\"family\\" of the 30's that produced today's top SF writers and editors","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z6EctAEACAAJ&dq=The+Futurians:+The+story+of+the+science+fiction+%22family%22+of+the+30%27s+that+produced+today%27s+top+SF+writers+and+editors&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Never Call Retreat: Lee and Grant: The Final Victory","description":"New York Times bestselling authors Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen conclude their inventive trilogy with this remarkable answer to the great \\"what if\\" of the American Civil War: Could the South have indeed won? After his great victories at Gettysburg and Union Mills, General Robert E. Lee's attempt to bring the war to a final conclusion by attacking Washington, D.C., fails. However, in securing Washington, the remnants of the valiant Union Army of the Potomac, under the command of the impetuous General Dan Sickles, is trapped and destroyed. For Lincoln there is only one hope left: that General Ulysses S. Grant can save the Union cause. It is now August 22, 1863. Lincoln and Grant are facing a collapse of political will to continue the fight to preserve the Union. Lee, desperately short of manpower, must conserve his remaining strength while maneuvering for the killing blow that will take Grant's army out of the fight and, at last, bring a final and complete victory for the South. Pursuing the remnants of the defeated Army of the Potomac up to the banks of the Susquehanna, Lee is caught off balance when news arrives that General Ulysses S. Grant, in command of more than seventy thousand men, has crossed that same river, a hundred miles to the northwest at Harrisburg. As General Grant brings his Army of the Susquehanna into Maryland, Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia maneuvers for position. Grant first sends General George Armstrong Custer on a mad dash to block Lee's path toward Frederick and with it control of the crucial B&O railroad, which moves troops and supplies. The two armies finally collide in Central Maryland, and a bloody week-long battle ensues along the banks of Monocacy Creek. This must be the \\"final\\" battle for both sides. In Never Call Retreat, Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen bring all of their critically acclaimed talents to bear in what is destined to become an immediate classic.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Pe3e8Jo6hRoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Role Call: A Generational Anthology of Social and Political Black Literature and Art (English and English Edition)","description":"Teaching Black: The Craft of Teaching on Black Life and Literature presents the experiences and voices of Black creative writers who are also teachers.

Although Christians did not invent the kiss Jewish and pagan literature is filled with references to kisses between lovers, family members, and individuals in relationships of power and subordination Christians kissed one another in highly specific settings and in ways that set them off from the non-Christian population. Christians kissed each other during prayer, Eucharist, baptism, and ordination and in connection with greeting, funerals, monastic vows, and martyrdom. As Michael Philip Penn shows in Kissing Christians, this ritual kiss played a key role in defining group membership and strengthening the social bond between the communal body and its individual members. Kissing Christians presents the first comprehensive study of the ritual kiss and how controversies surrounding it became part of larger debates regarding the internal structure of Christian communities and their relations with outsiders. Penn traces how Christian writers exalted those who kissed only fellow Christians, proclaimed that Jews did not have a kiss, prohibited exchanging the kiss with potential heretics, privileged the confessor's kiss, prohibited Christian men and women from kissing each other, and forbade laity from kissing clergy. Kissing Christians also investigates connections between kissing and group cohesion, kissing practices and purity concerns, and how Christian leaders used the motif of the kiss of Judas to examine theological notions of loyalty, unity, forgiveness, hierarchy, and subversion. Exploring connections between bodies, power, and performance, Kissing Christians bridges the gap between cultural and liturgical approaches to antiquity. It breaks significant new ground in its application of literary and sociological theory to liturgical history and will have a profound impact on these fields.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZRhBAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dialogues concerning natural religion, (The Library of Liberal Arts)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ng2FbIHTAtYC&dq=Dialogues+concerning+natural+religion,+(The+Library+of+Liberal+Arts)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Kid from Tomkinsville","description":"As the newest addition to the Brooklyn Dodgers, young Roy Tucker's pitching helps pull the team out of a slump; but, when a freak accident ends his career as a pitcher, he must try to find another place for himself on the team.

During the antebellum era, slave owners ate the greens from the pot and set aside the leftover potlikker broth for the enslaved, unaware that the broth, not the greens, was nutrient rich. After slavery, potlikker sustained the working poor, both black and white. In the South of today, potlikker has taken on new meanings as chefs have reclaimed it. Potlikker is a quintessential Southern dish, and The Potlikker Papers is a people s history of the modern South, told through its food. Beginning with the pivotal role cooks and waiters played in the civil rights movement, noted authority John T. Edge narrates the South s fitful journey from a hive of racism to a hotbed of American immigration. He shows why working-class Southern food has become a vital driver of contemporary American cuisine. Food access was a battleground issue during the 1950s and 1960s. Ownership of culinary traditions has remained a central contention on the long march toward equality. The Potlikker Papers tracks pivotal moments in Southern history, from the back-to-the-land movement of the 1970s to the rise of fast and convenience foods modeled on rural staples. Edge narrates the gentrification that gained traction in the restaurants of the 1980s and the artisanal renaissance that began to reconnect farmers and cooks in the 1990s. He reports as a newer South came into focus in the 2000s and 2010s, enriched by the arrival of immigrants from Mexico to Vietnam and many points in between. Along the way, Edge profiles extraordinary figures in Southern food, including Fannie Lou Hamer, Colonel Sanders, Mahalia Jackson, Edna Lewis, Paul Prudhomme, Craig Claiborne, and Sean Brock. Over the last three generations, wrenching changes have transformed the South. The Potlikker Papers tells the story of that dynamism and reveals how Southern food has become a shared culinary language for the nation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yOVFDwAAQBAJ&dq=Barbeque%27N+With+Bobby:+Righteous,+Down-Home+Barbeque+Recipes+by+Bobby+Seale&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Building","description":"Urban and rural children alike will enjoy discovering the ins and outs and daily routines of life in a metropolitan high-rise.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9FiaPQAACAAJ&dq=My+Building&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Health Care Provider's Guide to Facing the Malpractice Deposition","description":"An anesthesiologist chips a patient's tooth during a difficult intubation.

Yet what differentiates regionalism's claims of authenticity, derived from blood and soil, from those of nationalism? Through close readings and theoretical elaborations, Roberto M. Dainotto reveals the degree to which regionalism mimics nationalism in valorizing ethnic purity. He interprets regionalism not as a genre in the pastoral tradition but as a rhetorical trope, a way of reading in which regionalism figures as the \\"other\\" against a historical process that disrupts the organic wholeness of place. Dainotto traces the genealogy of the idea of place in literature, examining European texts from Victorian England to Fascist Italy. He finds, for example, in Thomas Hardy's The Return of the Native a virtual thesaurus of regionalist commonplaces. Elizabeth Gaskell's North and South mediates between Madame de Stal's privileging of the sophisticated north and Jean-Jacques Rousseau's nostalgia for the naive south. The regionalism of the Sicilian philosopher Giovanni Gentile exhibits a deep longing for the humanities as they define Italy and Western culture. Dainotto concludes with a close look at the rhetoric of Nazism and Fascism, dramatizing the convergence of regionalist aesthetics and nationalist ideology in Italy and Germany between the two World Wars.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ppc2NFr6LN8C&dq=Place+in+Literature:+Regions,+Cultures,+Communities&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rough Guide to Dutch Dictionary Phrasebook (Rough Guide Phrasebooks)","description":"The Rough Guide Dutch Phrasebook is the definitive phrasebook to help you make the most of your time in The Netherlands.

This is a new and freshly published edition of this culturally important work, which is now, at last, again available to you. Enjoy this classic work today. These selected paragraphs distill the contents and give you a quick look inside: From there his parents moved when he was only four to settle in the far northern district of Lofoden--that land of extremes, where the year, and not the day, is evenly divided between darkness and light; where winter is a long dreamless sleep, and summer a passionate dream without sleep; where land and sea meet and intermingle so gigantically that man is all but crushed between the two--or else raised to titanic measures by the spectacle of their struggle. ...But when Kareno, the irreconcilable rebel of At the Gates of the Kingdom, the heaven-storming truth-seeker of The Game of Life, and the acclaimed radical leader in the first acts of Sunset Glow, surrenders at last to the powers that be in order to gain a safe and sheltered harbor for his declining years, then another man of 29 stands ready to denounce him and to take up the rebel cry of youth to which he has become a traitor. Hamsuns ironical humor and whimsical manner of expression do more than the plot itself to knit the plays into an organic unit, and several of the characters are delightfully drawn, particularly the two women who play the greatest part in Karenos life: his wife Eline, and Teresita, who is one more of his many feminine embodiments of the passionate and changeable Northland nature. ...From 1897 to 1912 Hamsun produced a series of volumes that simply marked a further development of the tendencies shown in his first novels: Siesta, short stories, 1897; Victoria a novel with a charming love story that embodies the tenderest note in his production, 1898; In Wonderland, travelling sketches from the Caucasus, 1903; Brushwood, short stories, 1903; The Wild Choir, a collection of poems, 1904; Dreamers, a novel, 1904; Struggling Life, short stories and travelling sketches, 1905; Beneath the Autumn Star a novel, 1906; Benoni, and Rosa, two novels forming to some extent sequels to Pan, 1908; A Wanderer Plays with Muted Strings, a novel, 1909; and The Last Joy, a shapeless work, half novel and half mere uncoordinated reflections, 1912. ...I turned to a shop window and stopped in order to give him an opportunity of getting ahead, but when, after a lapse of some minutes, I again walked on there was the man still in front of me--he too had stood stock still, --without stopping to reflect I made three or four furious onward strides, caught him up, and slapped him on the shoulder.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j_lmLwEACAAJ&dq=Hunger+(Penguin+Twentieth+Century+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Miracle in a Shoe Box, A Christmas Gift of Wonder","description":"Jay Kelly and his sister Leesa send a shoebox full of toys and supplies, and one small miracle, to the Vacek family in war-torn Bosnia.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y8AyKTsal_cC&dq=Miracle+in+a+Shoe+Box,+A+Christmas+Gift+of+Wonder&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oeuvres - Collected Papers: Volume 2: 1960 - 1971 (French and English Edition)","description":"Publisher description: This book is a reference for librarians, mathematicians, and statisticians involved in college and research level mathematics and statistics in the 21st century.

The book begins by providing a great deal of guidance on how to approach definitions, examples, and theorems in mathematics and ends with suggested projects for independent study. Students will follow P lya's four step approach: analyzing the problem, devising a plan to solve the problem, carrying out that plan, and then determining the implication of the result. In addition to the P lya approach to proofs, this book places special emphasis on reading proofs carefully and writing them well. The authors have included a wide variety of problems, examples, illustrations and exercises, some with hints and solutions, designed specifically to improve the student's ability to read and write proofs. Historical connections are made throughout the text, and students are encouraged to use the rather extensive bibliography to begin making connections of their own. While standard texts in this area prepare students for future courses in algebra, this book also includes chapters on sequences, convergence, and metric spaces for those wanting to bridge the gap between the standard course in calculus and one in analysis.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iX3HDAEACAAJ&dq=Reading,+Writing,+and+Proving:+A+Closer+Look+at+Mathematics+(Undergraduate+Texts+in+Mathematics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Surgeon","description":"In her most masterful novel of medical suspense, New York Times bestselling author Tess Gerritsen creates a villain of unforgettable evil--and the one woman who can catch him before he kills again. He slips into their homes at night and walks silently into bedrooms where women lie sleeping, unaware of the horrors they soon will endure. The precision of the killer's methods suggests he is a deranged man of medicine, propelling the Boston newspapers and the frightened public to name him \\"The Surgeon.\\" The cops' only clue rests with another surgeon, the victim of a nearly identical crime. Two years ago, Dr. Catherine Cordell fought back and killed her attacker before he could complete his assault. Now she hides her fears of intimacy behind a cool and elegant exterior and a well-earned reputation as a top trauma surgeon. Cordell's careful facade is about to crack as this new killer recreates, with chilling accuracy, the details of Cordell's own ordeal. With every new murder he seems to be taunting her, cutting ever closer, from her hospital to her home. Her only comfort comes from Thomas Moore, the detective assigned to the case. But even Moore cannot protect Cordell from a brilliant hunter who somehow understands--and savors--the secret fears of every woman he kills. Filled with the authentic detail that is the trademark of this doctor turned author . . . and peopled with rich and complex characters--from the ER to the squad room to the city morgue--here is a thriller of unprecedented depth and suspense. Exposing the shocking link between those who kill and cure, punish and protect, The Surgeon is Tess Gerritsen's most exciting accomplishment yet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BDbTCwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Surgeon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Picasso: his life and work (Schocken paperbacks)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M2YvyQEACAAJ&dq=Picasso:+his+life+and+work+(Schocken+paperbacks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Against A Dark Background","description":"A former combat leader during a series of commercial wars orbiting the planet Golter, Sharrow is targeted by a religious cult that believes she is a final obstacle to the faith's apotheosis, a situation that forces her to seek out the last of the apocalyptically powerful Lazy Guns.

This line, the final one in G. K. Chesterton s poem  The English Graves,  serves for Richard M. Gamble as an interpretive key to a peculiarly important moment in American history: the time of the First World War, when progressive Christian leaders in America transformed themselves from principled pacifists to crusading interventionists. The consequence of this momentous shift, says Gamble, was the triumph of the idea that America has been destined by divine Providence to bring salvation to the less enlightened nations of the world. In The War for Righteousness, Gamble reconstructs the inner world of the social gospel clergy, tracing the evolution of the clergy s interventionist ideology from its roots in earlier efforts to promote a modern, activist Christianity. He shows how these clergy eventually came to see their task as world evangelization for the new creed of democracy and internationalism, and ultimately for the redemption of civilization itself through the agency of total war. World War I thus became a transcendent moment of fulfillment. In the eyes of the progressive clergy, the years from 1914 to 1918 presented an unprecedented opportunity to achieve their vision of a world transformed the ancient dream of a universal and everlasting kingdom of peace, justice, and righteousness. American sacrifice was necessary not only to save the country, but to save the entire world. Vividly narrating how the progressive clergy played a surprising role in molding the public consensus in favor of total war, Gamble engages the broader question of religion s role in shaping the modern American mind and the development, at the deepest levels, of the logic of messianic interventionism both at home and abroad. This timely book not only fills a significant gap in our collective memory of the Great War, it also helps demonstrate how and why that war heralded the advent of a different American self-understanding.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uOJ6CgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The exploits of Xenophon (World landmark books [W18])","description":"A cumulative list of works represented by Library of Congress printed cards.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PI4uAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+exploits+of+Xenophon+(World+landmark+books+%5BW18%5D)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"LYB: Love You, Baby","description":"I have been writing poetry my whole life.

They have long been recognized as centres of biodiversity and hotspots of evolution. During recent decades, speciation in ancient lakes has emerged as an important and exciting topic in evolutionary biology. The contributions in this volume deal with patterns and processes of biological diversification in three prominent ancient lake systems. Of these, the famous East African Great Lakes already have a strong tradition of evolutionary studies, but the two other systems have so far received much less attention. The exceptional biodiversity of the European sister lakes Ohrid and Prespa of the Balkans has long been known, but has largely been neglected in the international literature until recently. The rich biota and problems of its evolution in the two central lake systems on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, in turn, have only lately started to draw scientific attention. This volume aims at deepening the awareness of the unusual biological diversity in ancient lakes in general, and of the role of these lakes as natural laboratories for the study of speciation and diversification in particular. It should stimulate further research that will lead to a better understanding of key evolutionary processes in these lakes, and to knowledge that might help in mitigating the deterioration of their diversity in the future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gqRToWKR8xkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Building the Data Warehouse, 2nd Edition","description":"The data warehousing bible updated for the new millennium Updated and expanded to reflect the many technological advances occurring since the previous edition, this latest edition of the data warehousing \\"bible\\" provides a comprehensive introduction to building data marts, operational data stores, the Corporate Information Factory, exploration warehouses, and Web-enabled warehouses.

The Great Depression years finally behind them, the entire Coleman family of Pittsburgh has been looking forward to this Christmas for almost the entire year. For the first time in more than a decade, Gerald and Irene Coleman have tucked away enough extra money to make up for all the lean years of disappointingly modest Christmas gifts for their children. But December 7, 1941 has changed everything, and for the past two weeks the entire family has followed with despair the Japanese advances all over the Pacific as well as America finally being dragged into the two-year old European war. Though a few glimmers of hope can be found amidst the ominous war news, both parents fear not only for the country s fate as this new war begins but also, more personally, for the fate of their sons who will likely soon be joining the fighting in one war theater or another. Still, despite the sense of dread hanging over almost every aspect of the family s daily affairs, Irene Coleman is determined that if indeed this will be the last Christmas that the family spends togetherat least until after the war, or perhaps even foreverthen she will do everything in her power to make Christmas, 1941, the first Christmas of the war, a happy one for her children and her entire family. Come spend the week leading up to Christmas, 1941 with the Coleman family including: JonathanThe eldest son at nineteen, Jonathan fatalistically realizes the inevitability of his military days arriving very soon, whether he succumbs to the pressure to enlist or if he waits until he is drafted. But Jonathan has other problems on his mind as well. His long-time girlfriend Francine Donner, whom only days from now he plans to ask to marry him, broke a date with him this past weekend to go out with one of Jonathan s best friends from high school (and one of her own former boyfriends), because he is headed off to boot camp right after Christmas.

At a time when France, after decades of denial, has finally acknowledged responsibility for its role in the deportation and murder of 75,000 Jews from France during the Holocaust, Richard H. Weisberg here provides us with a comprehensive and devastating account of the French legal system's complicity with its German occupiers during the dark period known as 'Vichy'. As in Germany, the exclusionary laws passed during the Vichy period normalized institutional antisemitism. Anti-Jewish laws entered the legal canon with little resistance, and private lawyers quickly absorbed the discourse of exclusion into the conventional legal framework, expanding the laws beyond their simple intentions, their literal sense, and even their German precedents. Drawing on newly-available archival sources, personal interviews, and historical research, Weisberg reveals how legalized persecution actually operated on a practical level, often exceeding German expectations. Further, he presents a persuasive argument for Vichy law as an acquired Catholic response to a flase notion of Jewish Talmudism. The book also compares Vichy experience to American legal precedents and practices and opens up the possibility that postmodern modes of thinking ironically adopt the complexity of Vichy reasoning to a host of reading and thinking strategies. Vichy Law and the Holocaust in France raises fundamental and disturbing questions about the ease with which democratic legal systems can be subverted.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EeKOAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Poems of St. John of the Cross (Midway Reprints)","description":"San Juan de la Cruz, the great sixteenth-century Spanish mystic, is regarded by many as Spain's finest poet.

He was also at the center of some of the century's darkest, most complex historical events, for he chose to remain in his native Germany in the 1930s, neither supporting Hitler nor actively opposing him, but negotiating instead an unpolitical position that allowed him to continue his philosophical work. In this magisterial book, Jean Grondin appraises Gadamer's life and achievement. Drawing on countless interviews with Gadamer and his contemporaries, Gadamer's personal correspondence, and extensive archival research, Grondin traces Gadamer's life as an academician and the development of his ideas, placing them in the context of his times. He sheds light on the genesis and accomplishment of Gadamer's major opus, Truth and Method, the bible of modern-day hermeneutics. And he addresses the question of Gadamer's attitude and actions amid the catastrophe of Nazi Germany, painting a balanced portrait of a scholar who tried to preserve German culture and tradition in the face of an invasive menace.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5MELfAEACAAJ&dq=Hans-Georg+Gadamer:+A+Biography+(Yale+Studies+in+Hermeneutics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dancer's Foot Book (A Dance Horizons Book)","description":"A complete guide to the common foot injuries of dancers in ballet, modern, jazz, and aerobic dance.

By examining the ways Americans creatively adapted their automobiles, Tinkering takes a fresh look at automotive design from the bottom up, as a process that included manufacturers, engineers, advice experts, and consumers in various guises. Franz argues that automobile ownership opened new possibilities for ingenuity among consumers even as large corporations came to control innovation. Franz weaves together a variety of sources, from serial fiction to corporate documents, to explore tinkering as a form of authority in a culture that valued ingenuity. Women drivers represented one group of consumers who used tinkering to advance their claim to social autonomy. Some canny drivers moved beyond modifying their individual cars to become independent inventors, patenting and selling automotive accessories for the burgeoning national demand for aftermarket products. Earl S. Tupper was one such tinkerer who went on to invent Tupperware. These savvy tinkerers worked in a changing landscape of invention shaped increasingly by automotive giants. By the 1930s, Ford and General Motors worked to change the popular discourse of ingenuity and used the world's fairs of the Depression as a stage to promote a hierarchy of innovation. Franz not only demonstrates the entrepreneurial spirit of American consumers but she engages larger historical questions about gender, consumption and ingenuity while charting the impact corporate expansion on tinkering during the first half of the twentieth century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mbB9ionyCWgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pilgrims Progress","description":"A masterpiece of the English Puritan tradition, The Pilgrim's Progress is renowned for the simple beauty of its language, the abundance of its biblical references, and its vivid characterisations.

The Grammar is divided into two parts. Part A covers grammatical categories such as word order, nouns, verbs and adjectives. Part B is organised according to language functions and notions such as: making introductions asking for something to be done delivering a speech possibility satisfaction. The book addresses learners  practical needs and presents grammar in both a traditional and a communicative setting. New to this edition, and building on feedback from the previous edition: The rules of the latest (and so far final) spelling reform have been implemented throughout. Examples of usage have been updated and consideration given to Swiss and Austrian variants. The chapter on register has been expanded and now includes youth language and frequently used Anglicisms in German. The Index now has even more key words; it has also been redesigned to differentiate between German words, grammar terms, and functions, thus making it more user-friendly. The Grammar assumes no previous grammatical training and is intended for all those who have a basic knowledge of German, from intermediate learners in schools and adult education to undergraduates taking German as a major or minor part of their studies. The Grammar is accompanied by a third edition of Modern German Grammar Workbook (ISBN 978-0-415-56725-1) which features exercises and activities directly linked to the Grammar.

Edo is flooded, and by flooded, we mean crazy-flooded. Bridges are crumbling, rivers are washing past retaining walls, and everything in Edo is floating away, including our vengeful ronin, his foe, and his little boy. In an ironic show of samurai respect, little Cub Daigoro gets saved by the conniving Retsudo Yagyu. And proving he can lend a hand, too, Lone Wolf Ogami pulls someone to safety as well   but maybe he should have let him drown. Eventually, the two opposing master swordsmen dry off and go head to head in a sword fight of a thousand stances and couple of days length. This seems like it could be the deciding bout between the two, unless that nasty, Abeno Kaii gets in the way, and he seems to do that a lot lately.The true meaning of Bushido, the warrior code, oozes from every page of this volume. A little boy desperately attempts to drag his ronin father to safely, even if it costs him his own life; that same wandering samurai and his mortal enemy work together to save the frostbitten fingers of the same little boy, knowing they will eventually match swords again in a battle to the death; another samurai bites his own tongue, killing himself and locking a dark secret in his grave. The code of the samurai is complex and rich with irony, which is why so few carry this code through life.

Now Faith wanted to hate Gray Rouillard...not to feel a powerful surge of desire.

This extensively illustrated book is the first to draw almost exclusively on primary sources in family collections, public archives, and other depositories. Frankie Morris examines Tenniel's life and work, producing a book that is not only a definitive resource for scholars and collectors but one that can be easily enjoyed by everyone interested in Victorian life and art, social history, journalism and political cartoons, and illustrated books. In the first part of the book, Morris looks at Tenniel the man. From his sunny childhood and early enthusiasm for sports, theater, and medievalism to his flirtation with high art and fifty years in the close brotherhood of the London journal Punch, Tenniel is shown to have been the sociable and urbane humorist revealed in his drawings. According to his countrymen Tenniel's work and his Punch cartoons in particular would embody for future historians the \\"trend and character\\" of Victorian thought and life. Morris assesses to what extent that prediction has been fulfilled. The biography is followed by three parts on Tenniel's work, consisting of thirteen independent essays in which the author examines Tenniel's methods and his earlier book illustrations, the Alice pictures, and the Punch cartoons. She addresses such little-understood subjects as Tenniel's drawings on wood, his relationship with Lewis Carroll, and his controversial Irish cartoons, and inquires into the salient characteristics of his approximately 4,500 drawings for books and journals. For lovers of Alice, Morris offers six chapters on Tenniel's work for Carroll. These reveal demonstrable links with Christmas pantomimes, Punch and Judy shows, nursery toys, magic lanterns, nineteenth-century grotesques, Gothic revivalism, and social caricatures. In five probing studies, Morris demonstrates how Tenniel's cartoons depicted the key political questions of his day--the Eastern Question, which brought into opposition the great rivals Gladstone and Disraeli; trade-union issues and franchise reform; Irish resistance to British rule; and Lincoln and the American Civil War examining their assumptions, devices, and evolving strategies. An appendix identifies some 1,500 unmonogrammed drawings done by Tenniel in his first twelve years on Punch. The definitive study of both the man and the work, Artist of Wonderland gives an unprecedented view of the cartoonist whose adroit adaptations of elements from literature, art, and above all the stage succeeded in mythologizing the world for generations of Britons.

Mascall ;","description":"Charles Miller's rigorous and sensitive examination of Richard Hooker's theology makes a valuable addition to the field of study of the cleric, one of the founding theologians of modern Anglicanism. Miller examines Hooker's works in detail, leading the reader through different facets of his vision of God: creation, Scripture, the sacraments, and practices of Christian devotion. Hooker's theology challenges an increasingly time-bound, relativistic approach to doctrine and truth; his sources were as wide, as ancient, and as modern as Hooker could make them. Miller's thoughtful analysis is informed throughout by an understanding of the context of Hooker's theological development against the backdrop of continental Calvinism and the remnants of Roman Catholicism in England. The growth of interest in Hooker among specialists has been accompanied by an abandonment of the serious study of Hooker's thought among theological students, clergy and theologians. Miller's work addresses thislack; Hooker's insights must not be forgotten in the daily distribution of theological food to Christian people. A study which attunes readers to Hooker's particular theological 'voice' and teaches its value both in his own context and as a present-day interlocutor, this volume will be of great interest to Christians and theological students alike.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i-bkDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Casa Susanna","description":"This is an album of snapshots taken roughly the mid-1950s and mid- 1960s, depicting a group of cross-dressers united around a place called Casa Susanna.

After his great victories at Gettysburg and Union Mills, General Robert E. Lee's attempt to bring the war to a final conclusion by attacking Washington, D.C., fails. However, in securing Washington, the remnants of the valiant Union Army of the Potomac, under the command of the impetuous General Dan Sickles, is trapped and destroyed. For Lincoln there is only one hope left: that General Ulysses S. Grant can save the Union cause. It is now August 22, 1863. Lincoln and Grant are facing a collapse of political will to continue the fight to preserve the Union. Lee, desperately short of manpower, must conserve his remaining strength while maneuvering for the killing blow that will take Grant's army out of the fight and, at last, bring a final and complete victory for the South. Pursuing the remnants of the defeated Army of the Potomac up to the banks of the Susquehanna, Lee is caught off balance when news arrives that General Ulysses S. Grant, in command of more than seventy thousand men, has crossed that same river, a hundred miles to the northwest at Harrisburg. As General Grant brings his Army of the Susquehanna into Maryland, Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia maneuvers for position. Grant first sends General George Armstrong Custer on a mad dash to block Lee's path toward Frederick and with it control of the crucial B&O railroad, which moves troops and supplies. The two armies finally collide in Central Maryland, and a bloody week-long battle ensues along the banks of Monocacy Creek. This must be the \\"final\\" battle for both sides. In Never Call Retreat, Newt Gingrich and William R.

At its heart is the story of two relationships: that between settler and native in Louth, and that between the settlers and England. An important part of the story is the comparison with parts of Britain which witnessed similar English colonization. Fifty years before the arrival of the English, Louth was incorporated into the Irish kingdom of Airgialla, experiencing rapid change in the political and ecclesiastical spheres under its dynamic ruler Donnchad Ua Cerbaill. The impact of this legacy on English settlement is given due prominence. The book also explores the reasons why well-to-do members of local society in the West Midlands of England in the reigns of Henry II and his sons were prepared to become involved in the Irish adventure.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0fBHLF9pgnAC&dq=Colonisation+and+Conquest+in+Medieval+Ireland:+The+English+in+Louth,+1170-1330+(Cambridge+Studies+in+Medieval+Life+and+Thought:+Fourth+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nina Won't Tell (Making Out (Avon Paperback))","description":"Nina is terrified to reveal her love for Ben for two reasons--he is her sister's former boyfriend, and she is terrified that he will not reciprocate her feelings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YD_aINliBaAC&dq=Nina+Won%27t+Tell+(Making+Out+(Avon+Paperback))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chess fundamentals","description":"Capablanca's Masterpiece now in Algebraic Notation Written with the novice chess player in mind, Chess Fundamentals equips you with the essential opening, middlegame, and endgame techniques needed to advance your game.

Gertner's book offers fascinating evidence for those seeking to understand how a society should best invest its research resources.   The Wall Street Journal From its beginnings in the 1920s until its demise in the 1980s, Bell Labs-officially, the research and development wing of AT&T-was the biggest, and arguably the best, laboratory for new ideas in the world. From the transistor to the laser, from digital communications to cellular telephony, it's hard to find an aspect of modern life that hasn't been touched by Bell Labs. In The Idea Factory, Jon Gertner traces the origins of some of the twentieth century's most important inventions and delivers a riveting and heretofore untold chapter of American history. At its heart this is a story about the life and work of a small group of brilliant and eccentric men-Mervin Kelly, Bill Shockley, Claude Shannon, John Pierce, and Bill Baker-who spent their careers at Bell Labs. Today, when the drive to invent has become a mantra, Bell Labs offers us a way to enrich our understanding of the challenges and solutions to technological innovation.

For decades Jason Wilson was losing the war within the internal battle that many men wage daily but were never taught how to win. As a result, he could not combat his toxic thoughts and emotions. Instead, he was conquered by them and communicated without composure hurting those he loved and himself. This went on until he renewed his mind by releasing years of past trauma. His life and relationships were transformed when he learned how to master his emotions and express them with self-control. In the process, Jason became a better husband, father, and leader. In Battle Cry, Jason equips you with the mental and spiritual weapons needed to wage and win your inner war by showing you how to master your emotions rather than be ruled by them; win internal battles before they become external wars; reject the world s definition of masculinity and embrace comprehensive manhood; communicate more effectively with the people in your life; and release trauma from your past so you can live fully to your potential in the present.

Forster and Mohammed el Adl in which Mohammed s story collides with his own, blending fact and fiction. In 1919, Mohammed el Adl, the young Egyptian lover of British author E. M. Forster, spent six months in a jail cell. A century later, Kip Starling has locked himself in his Brooklyn basement study with a pistol and twenty-one gallons of Poland Spring to write Mohammed s story. Kip has only three weeks until his publisher s deadline to immerse himself in the mind of Mohammed who, like Kip, is Black, queer, an Other. The similarities don't end there. Both of their lives have been deeply affected by their confrontations with Whiteness, homophobia, their upper crust education, and their white romantic partners. As Kip immerses himself in his writing, Mohammed s story  and then Mohammed himself  begins to speak to him, and his life becomes a Proustian portal into Kip's own memories and psyche.

In truth, one out of every four juveniles arrested is female and the population of women in prison has tripled in the past decade. Co-authored by Meda Chesney-Lind, one of the pioneers in the development of the feminist theoretical perspective in criminology, the subject matter of The Female Offender: Girls, Women and Crime, Third Edition redresses the balance by providing critical insight into these issues. In an engaging style, authors Meda Chesney-Lind and Lisa Pasko explore gender and cultural factors in women's lives that often precede criminal behavior and address the question of whether female offenders are more violent today than in the past. The authors provide a revealing look at how public discomfort with the idea of women as criminals significantly impacts the treatment received by this offender population.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xtx-53h7vKMC&dq=The+Female+Offender:+Girls,+Women,+and+Crime&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lynching in the West: 1850&ndash;1935 (a John Hope Franklin Center Book)","description":"This visual and textual study of lynchings that took place in California between 1850 and 1935 shows that race-based lynching in the United States reached far beyond the South.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Brtdets-U0kC&dq=Lynching+in+the+West:+1850&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heir to the Shadows (The Black Jewels Trilogy, Book II)","description":"In the second novel set in the  darkly fascinating world  (SF Site) of Anne Bishop s Black Jewels Trilogy, ambitions unfurl as the realm s dreams of a liberator have finally been made flesh...

Set in the turbulent decades of the Cultural Revolution and the Tian'anmen Square incident, A Private Life exposes the complex and fantastical inner life of a young woman growing up during a time of intense social and political upheaval. At the age of twenty-six, Ni Niuniu has come to accept pain and loss. She has suffered the death of her mother and a close friend and neighbor, Mrs. Ho. She has long been estranged from her tyrannical father, while her boyfriend a brilliant and handsome poet named Yin Nan was forced to flee the country. She has survived a disturbing affair with a former teacher, a mental breakdown that left her in a mental institution for two years, and a stray bullet that tore through the flesh of her left leg. Now living in complete seclusion, Niuniu shuns a world that seems incapable of accepting her and instead spends her days wandering in vivid, dreamlike reveries where her fractured recollections and wild fantasies merge with her inescapable feelings of melancholy and loneliness. Yet this eccentric young woman caught between the disappearing traditions of the past and a modernizing Beijing, a flood of memories and an unknowable future, her chosen solitude and her irrepressible longing discovers strength and independence through writing, which transforms her flight from the hypocrisy of urban life into a journey of self-realization and rebirth. First published in 1996 to widespread critical acclaim, Chen Ran's controversial debut novel is a lyrical meditation on memory, sexuality, femininity, and the often arbitrary distinctions between madness and sanity, alienation and belonging, nature and society. As Chen leads the reader deep into the psyche of Ni Niuniu into her innermost secrets and sexual desires the borders separating narrator and protagonist, writer and subject dissolve, exposing the shared aspects of human existence that transcend geographical and cultural differences.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=za0X4Kjf3REC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Holy Bible King James Version","description":"\\"If you are looking for a Bible that's easy to use and to give away, this is the Bible for you \\" The world is hungry for eternal truth.

And yet, with an eye toward the French Revolution and its regicides and deicides, he shows how inevitably the course of revolution leads to tyranny. As old regimes throughout the world collapse, The Rebel resonates as an ardent, eloquent, and supremely rational voice of conscience for our tumultuous times.

Feminism has thus far failed to transcend critiques of essentialism and currently offers only two inadequate positions against it. One response reifies the category \\"women,\\" representing the experience of oppression of privileged women as archetypal for feminism, and the other denies the category because it unjustly overgeneralizes, thus undercutting the possibility of a robust theory of gender oppression. To spur anti-essentialist methods and practice around such issues as sexual violence, feminist theory crucially needs a constructive and politically powerful strategy for defining women. Cressida J. Heyes deftly elucidates and then travels beyond the essentialism debates to rescue the efficacy of feminist theory for activism and research. She offers a genealogy of essentialism, specifically as it applies to the work of Carol Gilligan and Catharine MacKinnon, and employs a Wittgensteinian approach to feminism that understands similarities between women as family resemblances and political decisions about inclusion and exclusion as contextual and purposive. Line Drawings argues for an anti-essentialist method that enables generalizing feminist discourse but insists on paying close attention to the operations of power in constructing claims about women. This is a fresh and vitally important step past stymied debate on what is arguably the most pressing issue in cross-disciplinary feminist theory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7JRlDwAAQBAJ&dq=Line+Drawings:+Defining+Women+Through+Feminist+Practice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One With Nineveh: Politics, Consumption, and the Human Future","description":"Annotation Named a Notable Book for 2005 by the American Library Association, One with Nineveh is a fresh synthesis of the major issues of our time, now brought up to date with an afterword for the paperback edition.

Brandom is one of the most original philosophers of our day, whose book Making It Explicit covered and extended a vast range of topics in metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of language--the very core of analytic philosophy. This new work provides an approachable introduction to the complex system that Making It Explicit mapped out. A tour of the earlier book's large ideas and relevant details, Articulating Reasons offers an easy entry into two of the main themes of Brandom's work: the idea that the semantic content of a sentence is determined by the norms governing inferences to and from it, and the idea that the distinctive function of logical vocabulary is to let us make our tacit inferential commitments explicit. Brandom's work, making the move from representationalism to inferentialism, constitutes a near-Copernican shift in the philosophy of language--and the most important single development in the field in recent decades. Articulating Reasons puts this accomplishment within reach of nonphilosophers who want to understand the state of the foundations of semantics. Table of Contents: Introduction 1. Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism 2. Action, Norms, and Practical Reasoning 3. Insights and Blindspots of Reliabilism 4. What Are Singular Terms, and Why Are There Any? 5. A Social Route from Reasoning to Representing 6. Objectivity and the Normative Fine Structure of Rationality Notes Index Displaying a sovereign command of the intricate discussion in the analytic philosophy of language, Brandom manages successfully to carry out a program within the philosophy of language that has already been sketched by others, without losing sight of the vision inspiring the enterprise in the important details of his investigation ' Using the tools of a complex theory of language, Brandom succeeds in describing convincingly the practices in which the reason and autonomy of subjects capable of speech and action are expressed. --J'rgen Habermas","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=T1C2g9ZJJ3gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chronological aspects of the life of Christ (Contemporary evangelical perspectives)","description":"\\"Jesus Christ entered into the history of our world.

In Signs in the Sky, Gilbert brings his acute understanding of esoteric astrology to his investigations of ancient Egypt, the pyramids, and the Bible. He explains how the constellation Orion, known to the ancients as the primary symbol for \\" the Son of Man in heaven, \\" is the key to understanding many of the prophecies contained in the Book of Revelation as well as other books in the Bible. In this startlingly original book, he provides answers to some of the most profound questions of our time such as: Are we now at the end of one of history's great ages?

The early epistolary novel Lady Susan depicts an unscrupulous coquette, toying with several men. The Watsons is a delightful fragment, whose spirited heroine finds her marriage opportunities restricted by poverty and pride. Written in the last months of Austen's life, the tantalising incomplete novel Sanditon features a glorious cast of hypochondriacs and speculators in a newly established seaside resort, and shows the author contemplating a changing society with scepticism and amusement. 'In [Sanditon] she exploits her greatest gifts ... The book feels open and modern ... as vigorous and inventive as her earlier work' Carol Shields If you enjoyed Lady Susan, The Watsons and Sanditon, you may like Charlotte Bront?'s Tales of Angria, also available in Penguin Classics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Fnj8LLZYAmQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Stone House, A Blues Legend","description":"Biographical story of Americans in Cairo in the 1960's","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xrSppwAACAAJ&dq=The+Stone+House,+A+Blues+Legend&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hemingway,: The writer as artist","description":"Critically evaluates Hemingway's published workings, including Islands in the Stream, and provides a narrative on his literary life","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yP-cgVNr55wC&dq=Hemingway,:+The+writer+as+artist&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ruthless Charmer (The Rogues of Regent Street, Book 2)","description":"No woman could resist Julian Dane.

Arguably the most famous woman of the twentieth century, certainly one of its most photographed, Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis lived an astonishing life; her popularity and the fascination she held for people the world over during her nearly sixty years in the spotlight can hardly be overestimated. And while that has led to a number of books about her, none has told her life story in the way this one does--entirely in photographs, from birth to death, with lively, anecdotal extended captions. Of the 251 photographs in Jackie: Her Life in Pictures, 165 have never been published, 58 have rarely been published (in newspapers or magazines but never in book form), and 28 are inescapable images that have been seared into the memories of everyone. Together with the text by James Spada that runs alongside them, these pictures tell the story of an American life that became legendary even while it was being lived, a story that will speak afresh to the hearts of all Americans.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0ziuAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Whence Cometh My Help; the African American Community at Hollins College","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=foGdRJT3FFoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God's Beautiful World: Lord Our Lord, How Excellent Is Thy Name in All the Earth! Psalm 8:1","description":"The Principles God Respects: Living by Faith is the Key to Success \\"And without faith it is impossible to please God because anyone who comes to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek Him\\" (Hebrews 11:6 NIV). Whether you are a young believer or have walked with the Lord for years, God expects you to walk in faith-that is, to walk according to the principles God sets forth in Hebrews 11:6. The important idea to remember here is to believe God exists and to keep Him foremost in your mind and actions. He cares for you, but at the same time, unless you exercise faith (trust and confidence) in Him and His Word, your Christian life will not prosper as it should. Although there are many ways you can live for the Lord and serve Him, unless you perform these acts by faith, they won't count for much in your Christian life. In fact, Hebrews 11:6 spells out what God requires of us: that is, to live and walk by faith. The great reformer, Martin Luther, discovered this truth back in 1517 when God showed him how to obtain peace with God. Luther was a Catholic monk who spent hours on his knees trying to find forgiveness for his sins. Then, the Lord revealed Romans 1:17 to him: \\"The just shall live by faith.\\" From that moment on, Luther knew his sins were forgiven and he had peace with God.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Oi38AwAAQBAJ&dq=God%27s+Beautiful+World:+Lord+Our+Lord,+How+Excellent+Is+Thy+Name+in+All+the+Earth!+Psalm+8:1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Focke-Wulf Fw 190 (Osprey Production Line to Frontline 5)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=REOJuGqlfbAC&dq=Focke-Wulf+Fw+190+(Osprey+Production+Line+to+Frontline+5)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Linguistic Ecology (The Politics of Language)","description":"In this book, the author examines the transformation of the Pacific language region under the impact of colonization, westernization and modernization. By focusing on the linguistic and socio-historical changes of the past 200 years, it aims to bring a new dimension to the study of Pacific linguistics, which up until now has been dominated by questions of historical reconstruction and language typology. In contrast to the traditional portrayal of linguistic change as a natural process, the author focuses on the cultural and historical forces which drive language change. Using the metaphor of language ecology to explain and describe the complex interplay between languages, speakers and social practice, the author looks at how language ecologies have functioned in the past to sustain language diversity, and, at what happens when those ecologies are disrupted. Whilst most of the examples used in the book are taken from the Pacific and Australian region, the insights derived from this area are shown to have global applications. The text should be useful for linguists and all those interested in the large scale loss of human language.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=41OIAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Another Such Victory: President Truman and the Cold War, 1945-1953 (Stanford Nuclear Age Series)","description":"This book is a provocative and thoroughly documented reassessment of President Truman's profound influence on U.S. foreign policy and the Cold War.

Not only has Ben chosen Rick over his beloved family, but he's supported his boyfriend both financially and emotionally the entire time. Unable to remain in their shared apartment, Ben moves and spends a miserable holiday season alone. With the New Year, however, he's determined to make a fresh start, so he manages to obtain Rick's address and sends him a card asking if Rick ever plans to return. Somehow, the card winds up in the wrong mailbox. Jason Prescott is a genius, having obtained his first master's degree at twenty-one and now working on his second. When he receives a card in error, he returns both the card and a card of his own to be courteous, expressing his hopes Ben can get in touch with his boyfriend. This begins a correspondence that leads to friendship, and ... the start of something more? Jason introduces Ben to his family and reunites him with his own. But will Jason, who's even smarter than Rick, be satisfied with someone as ordinary as blue-collar Ben feels himself to be?

Originally published in 1994 -- and never before available in the United States -- Sleep, Pale Sister is a hypnotically atmospheric story set in nineteenth century London. When puritanical artist Henry Chester sees delicate child beauty Effie, he makes her his favorite model and, before long, his bride. But Henry, volatile and repressed, is in love with an ideal. Passive, docile, and asexual, the woman he projects onto Effie is far from the woman she really is. And when Effie begins to discover the murderous depths of Henry's hypocrisy, her latent passion will rise to the surface. Sleep, Pale Sister combines the ethereal beauty of a Pre-Raphaelite painting with a chilling high gothic tale and is a testament to Harris's brimming cornucopia of talents.

A woman of charm and integrity, she summons up the courage to burn her bridges and defect from her marriage to the Grace Presbyterian Church s minister, only to be stunned by the complete lack of flame, smoke or hubbub of any kind that follows. Here is an inner-directed, sensuous, self-liberated woman impelled to make a place for herself in a society where church-centered propriety (embodied in her preacher-husband, whose constricting bed and board she leaves) mingles with country-style macho (in the person of Andy, her long-lost high school sweetheart and hug-dancing partner, who resurfaces and reclaims her)  and with the eternal Dallas dash (Andy s bandbox-stylish wife). It is a new world where superconducting supercolliders, threatening famlands, have brought into the area a global mix of superscientists (including the beautiful Korean who may be moving toward the marriage Cile has vacated), where the rumble of money appears to underlie almost every mysterious action and where Cile s two daughters, young Amazons with a passion to save the world from exological disaster, are already charting their own independent courses.

Throughout, he demonstrates how activism and leadership can come from any experience at any age. Comprehensive and intimate, Stride Toward Freedom emphasizes the collective nature of the movement and includes King s experiences learning from other activists working on the boycott, including Mrs. Rosa Parks and Claudette Colvin. It traces the phenomenal journey of a community and shows how the 28-year-old Dr. King, with his conviction for equality and nonviolence, helped transform the nation and the world.

As a brand we have a strong idea of what makes up a good pet care book. We consult with multiple experts in each animals field to allow us to create a book filled with cumulative opinions and best practices. The experts we consult range from veterinarians to every day pet keepers who have had years of experience caring for the specific animal each book is on. Our aim, and mission, is to produce the best possible pet care books that are a great value for money. This care manual will instruct you on the best practices for caring for a Corn Snake as a pet. The corn snake (scientifically known as Pantherophis guttatus) is a species of nonvenomous rat snake that subdues its prey through constriction. The species gained the name 'corn snake' due to the fact that they regularly hunt around grain stores to catch mice and rats who are attracted by the harvest. However some people argue that the species is named after 'corn' due to the fact that the patterning on the snakes body somewhat resembles the kernels of variegated corn. This resemblance is furthered due to the fact that the species most common colour morph is a mixture of oranges and yellows. Unfortunately the corn snake resembles the venomous copperhead and is therefore often killed as a result of this. The corn snake is a North American species but can also be commonly found throughout the southeastern and more central states of the United States.

A. Cohen's Gifford Lectures, delivered at the University of Edinburgh in 1996. Focusing on Marxism and Rawlsian liberalism, Cohen draws a connection between these thought systems and the choices that shape a person's life. In the case of Marxism, the relevant life is his own: a communist upbringing in the 1940s in Montreal, which induced a belief in a strongly socialist egalitarian doctrine. The narrative of Cohen's reckoning with that inheritance develops through a series of sophisticated engagements with the central questions of social and political philosophy. In the case of Rawlsian doctrine, Cohen looks to people's lives in general. He argues that egalitarian justice is not only, as Rawlsian liberalism teaches, a matter of rules that define the structure of society, but also a matter of personal attitude and choice. Personal attitude and choice are, moreover, the stuff of which social structure itself is made. Those truths have not informed political philosophy as much as they should, and Cohen's focus on them brings political philosophy closer to moral philosophy, and to the Judeo-Christian ethical tradition, than it has recently been.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=K3AM9VyP2gEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hal Borland's Twelve Moons of the Year","description":"A full year's worth of the brief essays written by the late, admired nature writer for the editorial page of The New York Times, and selected by Borland just before his death, carry us through the Indian lunar calendar","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=htFmAAAACAAJ&dq=Hal+Borland%27s+Twelve+Moons+of+the+Year&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Norma Vocal Score","description":"Vocal score, in Italian, of Bellini's bel canto opera Norma in two acts, including the famous Casta diva.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=At07vgAACAAJ&dq=Norma+Vocal+Score&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"8 Steps to a Healthy Heart: The Complete Guide to Heart Disease Prevention and Recovery from Heart Attack and Bypass Surgery","description":"The best-selling author of The 8-Week Cholesterol Cure shows his readers how to incorporate cardiovascular activity in their lives and eat a more healthy diet, increase physical activity, choose the right doctor, and more.

This new collection   her most personal to date   is no exception. Alice Munro s stories are always wonderful and so ingrained with truths about life that readers always want to know where they came from. In this book, Alice Munro tells us. In her Foreword (an unusual feature in itself), she explains how she, born Alice Laidlaw in Ontario, in recent years became interested in the history of her Laidlaw ancestors. Starting in the wilds of the Scottish Borders, she learned a great deal about a famous ancestor, born around 1700, who, as his tombstone records,  for feats of frolic, agility and strength, had no equal in his day.  She traced the family s history with the help of that man s nephew, the famous writer James Hogg, finding to her delight that each generation of the family had produced a writer who wanted to record what had befallen them. In this way, she was able to follow the family s voyage to Canada in 1818, and their hard times as pioneers   once a father dies on the same day that a daughter is born in the same frontier cabin.  I put all this material together over the years,  Alice tells us,  and almost without my noticing what was happening, it began to shape itself, here and there, into something almost like stories. Some of the characters gave themselves to me in their own words, others rose out of their situations.  As the book goes down through the generations, we come to Robert Laidlaw, Alice s father, and then, at the book s heart, the stories become first-person stories, set during her lifetime. So is this a memoir? No. She drew on personal experiences,  but then I did anything I wanted to with this material, because the chief thing I was doing was making a story.  The resulting collection of stories range from the title story   where through a haze of whiskey Alice s ancestors gaze north from Edinburgh Castle at the Fife coast, believing that it is North America   all the way to the final story, where we travel with  Alice Munro  today. In the author s words, these stories  pay more attention to the truth of a life than fiction usually does. But not enough to swear on.  All of them are Alice Munro stories. There could be no higher praise.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1nbuP1yK1g4C&dq=The+View+from+Castle+Rock&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Being Bilingual Is Fun!","description":"Describes the wide variety of languages in the world and how children learn to speak them, and depicts how a girl with parents who speak different languages, a brother and sister whose parents speak only Hmong, and Philippine twins who study English in school became bilingual.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y0wtAAAACAAJ&dq=Being+Bilingual+Is+Fun!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lilly Cullen: Helena, Montana 1894","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TMqoswEACAAJ&dq=Lilly+Cullen:+Helena,+Montana+1894&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Iroquois (Indians of North America)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZQnEwUaPAegC&dq=Iroquois+(Indians+of+North+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mother Teresa","description":"Presents the life of Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu, known as Mother Teresa, who spent most of her life serving the poorest of the poor in Calcutta, India.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fgs4DwAAQBAJ&dq=Mother+Teresa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Carving Classic Female Figures in Wood: A How-To Reference for Carvers and Sculptors","description":"This thorough reference demonstrates how to creatively and realistically portray aspects of the nude female figure in wood.

The potent effica cy of BMPs in almost all crucial developmental events as well as during regenera tion of various organs such as bone, kidney, brain, liver, heart etc. , has positioned BMPs at the center of scientific interest. Many of these aspects are covered in this new PIR volume. Their role in development, biology, signal transduction, kidney regeneration, eNS functions, craniofacial skeleton reconstruction, joint and carti lage repair, long bone non-unions and acute fractures, and spinal fusion is reviewed by experts in the field.

I wiped away a tear with which the north wind blowing over the quay had obscured my vision. A bright fire was leaping in the chimney of my study. Ice-crystals, shaped like fern-leaves, were sprouting over the windowpanes and concealed from me the Seine with its bridges and the Louvre of the Valois. I drew up my easy-chair to the hearth, and my table-volante, and took up so much of my place by the fire as Hamilcar deigned to allow me. Hamilcar was lying in front of the andirons, curled up on a cushion, with his nose between his paws. His think find fur rose and fell with his regular breathing. At my coming, he slowly slipped a glance of his agate eyes at me from between his half-opened lids, which he closed again almost at once, thinking to himself, \\"It is nothing; it is only my friend.\\" \\"Hamilcar,\\" I said to him, as I stretched my legs?\\"Hamilcar, somnolent Prince of the City of Books?thou guardian nocturnal! Like that Divine Cat who combated the impious in Heliopolis?in the night of the great combat?thou dost defend from vile nibblers those books which the old savant acquired at the cost of his slender savings and indefatigable zeal. Sleep, Hamilcar, softly as a sultana, in this library, that shelters thy military virtues; for verily in thy person are united the formidable aspect of a Tatar warrior and the slumbrous grace of a woman of the Orient. Sleep, thou heroic and voluptuous Hamilcar, while awaiting the moonlight hour in which the mice will come forth to dance before the Acta Sanctorum of the learned Bolandists!\\" The beginning of this discourse pleased Hamilcar, who accompanied it with a throat-sound like the song of a kettle on the fire. But as my voice waxed louder, Hamilcar notified me by lowering his ears and by wrinkling the striped skin of his brow that it was bad taste on my part so to declaim. \\"This old-book man,\\" evidently thought Hamilcar, \\"talks to no purpose at all while our housekeeper never utters a word which is not full of good sense, full of significance?containing either the announcement of a meal or the promise of a whipping. One knows what she says. But this old man puts together a lot of sounds signifying nothing.\\" So thought Hamilcar to himself. Leaving him to his reflections, I opened a book, which I began to read with interest; for it was a catalogue of manuscripts. I do not know any reading more easy, more fascinating, more delightful than that of a catalogue. The one which I was reading?edited in 1824 by Mr. Thompson, librarian to Sir Thomas Raleigh?sins, it is true, by excess of brevity, and does not offer that character of exactitude which the archivists of my own generation were the first to introduce into works upon diplomatics and paleography. It leaves a good deal to be desired and to be divined. This is perhaps why I find myself aware, while reading it, of a state of mind which in nature more imaginative than mine might be called reverie. I had allowed myself to drift away this gently upon the current of my thoughts, when my housekeeper announced, in a tone of ill-humor, that Monsieur Coccoz desired to speak with me.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iIHOCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Already Dead: A California Gothic","description":"A contemporary noir, Already Dead is the tangled story of Nelson Fairchild Jr., disenfranchised scion to a northern California land fortune.

Well, sometimes rather impatiently), for the thought of the advanced thinkers to unfold so that I could put this book before them with the assurance that they were ready for the \\"last things,\\" the actual science of actuality; and not merely a science of physical harmony. This book is not for general distribution at this time (1925), for the general public has not yet awakened to where they can appreciate the facts stated here. They, like those who have entered this work before them, will need to take the necessary preliminary steps; and through study of my lesser writings, or through being taught the lesser things by my teachers, unfold their thought to a state where this work can be assimilated, understood and demonstrated. The price I ask for this work does not interest the public at all, for it will not be sold to the public at this time; and those to whom it will be sold, will gladly give twice the price I ask for it. If there be some who would gladly pay the price but have it not, this is positive proof that they have not applied the primary lessons sufficiently; and consequently, are not ready for this work. I would advise such as these to spend their time on \\"The Sickle,\\" until their thought regarding supply has been mastered and the necessary supply is bountifully forthcoming. In the science of Eschatology, fruitage is a sure sign of actual understanding. When Jesus told the multitude that henceforth they would need to work out their own salvation, that the free bread line was abolished, many turned their back on his leadership. Noting this, the Master Mind turned to his disciples and asked, \\"Will ye not also go away?\\" Then Simon Peter answered him saying, \\"Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life.\\" Simon Peter had some understanding of the actual; those who turned back had not. The same holds true to this day; and this should explain the actions of those who leave this science and go hither and thither seeking an easier way. This book, as well as the predecessor, The Sickle, have more or less been artificially suppressed for nearly 100 years. Now is the time for these volumes to be made available to the general public and those seeking the truth. As Walter states in the preface of The Sickle, these books are not for the trifler or those on a casual search. The journey is well worth the effort and the time is right with the expanding of human consciousness worldwide to re introduce these volumes into the collective consciousness.

Lawson's classic Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo appears in an enhanced reprint edition for the sixtieth anniversary of the legendary Doolittle Raid on Japan. \\"One of the worst feelings about that time,\\" Ted W. Lawson writes, \\"was that there was no tangible enemy. It was like being slugged with a single punch in a dark room, and having no way of knowing where to slug back.\\" He added, \\"And, too, there was a helpless, filled-up, want-to-do-something feeling that [the Japanese] weren't coming -- that we'd have to go all the way over there to punch back and get even.\\" Which is what \\"the Tokyo Raiders\\" did. Lawson gives a vivid eyewitness account of the unorthodox assignment that eighty-five intrepid volunteer airmen under the command of celebrated flier James H. Doolittle executed in April 1942. The plan called for sixteen B-25 twin-engine medium bombers of the Army Air Forces to take off from the aircraft carrier Hornet, bomb industrial targets in Japan, and land at airfields in China. While the raid came off flawlessly, completely surprising the enemy, bad weather, darkness, and a shortage of fuel caused by an early departure took a heavy toll on the raiders. For many, the escape from China proved a greater ordeal. This anniversary edition features a foreword by noted aviation writer Peter B. Mersky and an introduction by Mrs. Ellen R. Lawson, Ted Lawson's widow, as well as twice as many photographs as the original book, several published here for the first time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G7kSgP-QI0UC&dq=Thirty+Seconds+Over+Tokyo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strange Objects","description":"The 25th anniversary edition of this landmark novel, in which a chilling modern mystery is entwined with one of Australia's most brutal and intriguing historical atrocities.

So did many Mormon nightmares. The Missouri period--especially from the summer of 1838 when Joseph took over vigorous, personal direction of this new Zion until the spring of 1839 when he escaped after five months of imprisonment--represents a moment of intense crisis in Mormon history. Representing the greatest extremes of devotion and violence, commitment and intolerance, physical suffering and terror--mobbings, battles, massacres, and political  knockdowns --it shadowed the Mormon psyche for a century. Leland Gentry was the first to step beyond this disturbing period as a one-sided symbol of religious persecution and move toward understanding it with careful documentation and evenhanded analysis. In Fire and Sword, Todd Compton collaborates with Gentry to update this foundational work with four decades of new scholarship, more insightful critical theory, and the wealth of resources that have become electronically available in the last few years. Compton gives full credit to Leland Gentry's extraordinary achievement, particularly in documenting the existence of Danites and in attempting to tell the Missourians  side of the story; but he also goes far beyond it, gracefully drawing into the dialogue signal interpretations written since Gentry and introducing the raw urgency of personal writings, eyewitness journalists, and bemused politicians seesawing between human compassion and partisan harshness. In the lush Missouri landscape of the Mormon imagination where Adam and Eve had walked out of the garden and where Adam would return to preside over his posterity, the towering religious creativity of Joseph Smith and clash of religious stereotypes created a swift and traumatic frontier drama that changed the Church.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uxJoEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jim Davis, (Every child's library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eTtCxgEACAAJ&dq=Jim+Davis,+(Every+child%27s+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Biblical Foundations for Freedom: Destroying Satan's Lies with God's Truth","description":"As Christians, we have an active part to play in this temporal life.

However, they are often constrained by lack of adequate resources, sound policies, and national support. It is clear that change and advancements, both systematic and scientific, are needed in a number of forensic science disciplines to ensure the reliability of work, establish enforceable standards, and promote best practices with consistent application. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward provides a detailed plan for addressing these needs and suggests the creation of a new government entity, the National Institute of Forensic Science, to establish and enforce standards within the forensic science community. The benefits of improving and regulating the forensic science disciplines are clear: assisting law enforcement officials, enhancing homeland security, and reducing the risk of wrongful conviction and exoneration. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States gives a full account of what is needed to advance the forensic science disciplines, including upgrading of systems and organizational structures, better training, widespread adoption of uniform and enforceable best practices, and mandatory certification and accreditation programs. While this book provides an essential call-to-action for congress and policy makers, it also serves as a vital tool for law enforcement agencies, criminal prosecutors and attorneys, and forensic science educators.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4VH5FhgTXxoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Stannic Oxide Gas SensorPrinciples and Applications","description":"The Stannic Oxide Gas Sensor presents a comprehensive overview of the background science and technology of the subject, including practical information on its applications and the electronic circuits with which it is associated.

The Queene s Cure transports us into the shadowy world of sixteenth-century medicine, as an enlightened young queen seeks the cures that could heal a realm and transform a land.... In late summer of 1562, within a bedchamber at Whitehall Palace, Elizabeth Tudor prays for the recovery of the delirious, fever-racked friend who has served her for twenty-six of her twenty-nine years. Ten days later, with loyal, handsome Lord Robert Dudley by her side, the queen leads her retinue to London s Royal College of Physicians to enlist two learned doctors in the raging battle against disease and pestilence. She knows she has no trusted allies in Peter Pascal and John Caius, ardent Papist sympathizers with long-standing grievances against the Tudors. Yet even the stalwart queen is shaken when a frighteningly lifelike effigy of herself ravaged by pox turns up in her royal coach. Elizabeth s fear that the counterfeit corpse is a harbinger of impending tragedy comes to fruition when ever more terrifying transgressions penetrate the very heart of her royal precincts. With the help of her Privy Plot Council and an intriguing healer whose curative arts are at odds with the dangerous Royal College, Elizabeth resolves to unmask a murderer who wears a false face and is beset by the vilest humours of the soul. But when she herself falls ill, an entire realm is caught in the grip of a treasonous conspiracy to take a queen s life and throne. Peopled by a rich cast of fascinating figures from the swirling mists of history, The Queene s Cure brings a vibrant, violent age unforgettably to life. Racing to a chilling climax where ordinary men play God and where Elizabeth Tudor could meet the same fate as her mother, Anne Boleyn, this is a gripping and captivating story of an indomitable young monarch...fighting for her life, her realm, and her rightful crown.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-HGyUIFFE7kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"BMW 3 & 5 Series '82'92 (Haynes Manuals)","description":"Walton chronologically explores the series, with details on every 3 Series platform, including the E21, E30, E36, and E46.

Three more came gliding from under the trees. LOOK! On the hill. Those are squirrels on skis! Below lay the town, snow-covered and still. Not a sound could be heard. All was silent, until . . . Swwwishhhh swooped the skiers, all dressed for play. Eighty-five squirrels and more on the way!\\" As you can imagine, the townsfolk are NOT amused. Can intrepid reporter Sally Sue Breeze find out where the squirrels are getting their skis-and make them stop skiing long enough to eat lunch-before pest-control guy Stanley Powers sucks them up in his vacuum device? (Don't worry Sally triumphs in a most unexpected way.) With delightfully understated, funny illustrations by Pascal Lemaitre, this is the perfect book for beginning readers to curl up and chill out with on a snow day or any day!

In 1998, something new and inexplicable began occurring in the graveyard. Visitors encountered 'cold spots', strange smells and banging noises. They found themselves overcome by nausea, or cut and bruised by something they could not see. Over the space of two years, twenty-four people were knocked unconscious. Homes next to the graveyard wall became plagued by crockery smashing, objects moving and unidentified laughter. Witnesses to these attacks ran into the hundreds. There were two exorcisms of the area. Both failed. The section of Greyfriars where the attacks occurred is now chained shut. The entity responsible has been named the 'Mackenzie Poltergeist'. It has become one of the best-documented and most conclusive paranormal cases in history. The Poltergeist is still growing stronger.

Often thought of as unnecessary verbal fringe or simply linguistic decoration, interjections (ahem, howdy, mamma mia, pshaw, tally-ho, whoop-de-do) may well be the most overlooked part of speech in the English language. ZOUNDS! A Browser's Dictionary of Interjections focuses the spotlight on this most deserving (and sometimes most demented) grammatical group. A light-hearted look at more than 500 interjections, ZOUNDS! explores the origins of these essential words and highlights the contributions of these previously unheralded parts of speech. Perfect for both word lovers and the casual reader, ZOUNDS! brings together the linguistic talents of Mark Dunn, author of the award-winning novel Ella Minnow Pea, and the graphic hilarity of Sergio Aragon s, the legendary cartoonist and contributor to Mad Magazine, for a delightful romp through grammar, culture, and the English language.

Our fascination is obvious  and the technology is quickly moving from books and films to real life. In a lab at MIT, scientists and technicians have created an artificial being named COG. To watch COG interact with the environment  to recognize that this machine has actual body language  is to experience a hair-raising, gut-level reaction. Because just as we connect to artificial people in fiction, the merest hint of human-like action or appearance invariably engages us. Digital People examines the ways in which technology is inexorably driving us to a new and different level of humanity. As scientists draw on nanotechnology, molecular biology, artificial intelligence, and materials science, they are learning how to create beings that move, think, and look like people. Others are routinely using sophisticated surgical techniques to implant computer chips and drug-dispensing devices into our bodies, designing fully functional man-made body parts, and linking human brains with computers to make people healthier, smarter, and stronger. In short, we are going beyond what was once only science fiction to create bionic people with fully integrated artificial components  and it will not be long before we reach the ultimate goal of constructing a completely synthetic human-like being. It seems quintessentially human to look beyond our natural limitations. Science has long been the lens through which we squint to discern our future. Although we are rightfully fearful about manipulating the boundaries between animate and inanimate, the benefits are too great to ignore. This thoughtful and provocative book shows us just where technology is taking us, in directions both wonderful and terrible, to ponder what it means to be human.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PtvCwgEACAAJ&dq=Digital+People:+From+Bionic+Humans+to+Androids&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Design and Development of Medical Electronic Instrumentation: A Practical Perspective of the Design, Construction, and Test of Medical Devices","description":"Design and Development of Medical Electronic Instrumentation fills a gap in the existing medical electronic devices literature by providing background and examples of how medical instrumentation is actually designed and tested.

Thomas E. Ricks The rise and fall of ancient Rome has been on American minds since the beginning of our republic. Depending on who s doing the talking, the history of Rome serves as either a triumphal call to action or a dire warning of imminent collapse. In this  provocative and lively  book, Cullen Murphy points out that today we focus less on the Roman Republic than on the empire that took its place, and reveals a wide array of similarities between the two societies (The New York Times). Looking at the blinkered, insular culture of our capitals; the debilitating effect of bribery in public life; the paradoxical issue of borders; and the weakening of the body politic through various forms of privatization, Murphy persuasively argues that we most resemble Rome in the burgeoning corruption of our government and in our arrogant ignorance of the world outside two things that must be changed if we are to avoid Rome s fate.  Are We Rome? is just about a perfect book. . . . I wish every politician would spend an evening with this book.

In this memoir, the voice of innocence is heard. \\"This is great stuff,\\" exclaims Stephen E. Ambrose. \\"I love this book.\\" In this gripping account, a boy and his mother are wrenched from their tranquil lives to forge a path through the storm of war and the rubble of its aftermath. In the past there has been a spectrum of books and films that share other German World War II experiences. However, told from the perspective of a ten-year-old, this book is rare. The boy and his mother must prevail over hunger and despair, or die. In the Third Reich, young Wolfgang Samuel and his family are content but alone. The father, a Luftwaffe officer, is away fighting the Allies in the West. In 1945 as Berlin and nearby communities crumble, young Wolfgang, his mother Hedy, and little sister Ingrid flee the advancing Russian army. They have no inkling of the chaos ahead. In Strasburg, a small town north of Berlin where they find refuge, Wolfgang begins to comprehend the evils the Nazi regime brought to Germany. As the Reich collapses, mother, son, and daughter flee again just ahead of the Russian charge. In the chaos of defeat they struggle to find food and shelter. Death stalks the primitive camps that are their temporary havens, and the child becomes the family provider. Under the crushing responsibility, Wolfgang becomes his mother's and sister's mainstay. When they return to Strasburg, the Communists in control are as brutal as the Nazis. In the violent atmosphere of arbitrary arrest, rape, hunger, and fear, the boy and his mother persist. Pursued by Communist police through a fierce blizzard, they escape to the West, but even in the English zone, the constant search for food, warmth, and shelter dominates their lives, and the mother's sacrifices become the boy's nightmares. Although this is a time of deepest despair, Wolfgang hangs on to the thinnest thread of hope. In June 1948 with the arrival of the Americans flying the Berlin Airlift, Wolfgang begins a new journey.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QLVwc_QlQ9kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hitman: Contracts (Prima's Official Strategy Guide)","description":"Anyone can kill . . . but can you make the perfect hit?

As far back as 4,000 BC, the Sumerians consulted sages who would pronounce on important matters and advise on courses of action. The predictions of the most famous sages and seers from the dawn of civilization are looked at in detail. One of the best known of these visionaries was Nostradamus, and his prophecies and predictions. The world today is in the period of yuga-sandhi -the junction of two world ages that marks the historical transformation from one dharmic world to another. Yuga-sandhi is the period of stress, turmoil, and general degeneration which is very evident today all around us. Interestingly, sages and prophets of ancient ages had the vision to predict many notable developments in current history. Nostradamus' prophecies are more widely known-but even the predictions of Indian sages are equally impressive, notably those of Vira Brahmendra Yogi, a contemporary of Nostradamus.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Lv2AzgEACAAJ&dq=Visions+of+Nostradamus+and+Other+Prophets&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Out-of-doors in the Holy Land;: Impressions of travel in body and spirit, (Works of Henry Van Dyke.

The book is chock full of simple, child-friendly advice--including everything from pep talks (it's not your fault if there's tension between your parents) to easy-to-play games to make that plane or train or bus trip less stressful. These include riddles, brain teasers, puzzles, and anagrams. But maybe more important are simple, yet helpful exercises for kids to identify their feelings, hopes, and perceptions about themselves, their families and their situations. These include sample letters to write to family, identifying family conflict that might make you upset and how to deal with them; advice on how to help your parents; clarifying values, etc. These are all written in child-friendly language and in an upbeat format. Unfortunately, kids today live in a complicated world with lots of adults vying for their love and attention, and they too often get caught in the middle. This little book can help children during those potentially stressful moments--perhaps best of all, it can make them understand they are not alone in their situation regardless of the fact that sometimes competing family agendas make them feel that way.The book has several different focuses which include: 1. Things that children wish their divorced parents would do and not do. 2. Things that children wish the other people in their lives would do and not do. 3. Affirmations to deal with fears about visitations and other scary subjects. 4. Advice on how to handle the trip with the most pleasure and least risk. 5. Lists to help organize for the trip. 6. Activities to do while traveling and during the visitation. 7. Solace that others have done this before and survived just fine. In that sense, this isn't a book designed to be read and memorized from beginning to end. It's more like a book to dip into selectively when one needs objective support. It might especially come in handy when a child cannot reach a parent by telephone to talk about her or his feelings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OXWRV45HEk4C&dq=How+to+Go+to+Visitation+without+Throwing+Up&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Woman Who Pretended to Be Who She Was: Myths of Self-Imitation","description":"Many cultures have myths about self-imitation, stories about people who pretend to be someone else pretending to be them, in effect masquerading as themselves. This great theme, in literature and in life, tells us that people put on masks to discover who they really are under the masks they usually wear, so that the mask reveals rather than conceals the self beneath the self.In this book, noted scholar of Hinduism and mythology Wendy Doniger offers a cross-cultural exploration of the theme of self-impersonation, whose widespread occurrence argues for both its literary power and its human value. The stories she considers range from ancient Indian literature through medieval European courtly literature and Shakespeare to Hollywood and Bollywood. They illuminate a basic human way of negotiating reality, illusion, identity, and authenticity, not to mention memory, amnesia, and the process of aging. Many of them involve marriage and adultery, for tales of sexual betrayal cut to the heart of the crisis of identity.These stories are extreme examples of what we common folk do, unconsciously, every day. Few of us actually put on masks that replicate our faces, but it is not uncommon for us to become travesties of ourselves, particularly as we age and change. We often slip carelessly across the permeable boundary between the un-self-conscious self-indulgence of our most idiosyncratic mannerisms and the conscious attempt to give the people who know us, personally or publicly, the version of ourselves that they expect. Myths of self-imitation open up for us the possibility of multiple selves and the infinite regress of self-discovery.Drawing on a dizzying array of tales-some fact, some fiction-The Woman Who Pretended to Be Who She Was is a fascinating and learned trip through centuries of culture, guided by a scholar of incomparable wit and erudition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mdqPDgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Woman+Who+Pretended+to+Be+Who+She+Was:+Myths+of+Self-Imitation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trashed Life","description":"Living her life is like driving by a car crash.

Excerpt: Norton is a British motorcycle marque, originally from Birmingham, founded in 1898 as a manufacturer of \\"fittings and parts for the two-wheel trade.\\" By 1902, they had begun manufacturing motorcycles with bought-in engines. In 1908, a Norton-built engine was added to the range. This began a long series of production of single and eventually twin-cylinder motorcycles, and a long history of racing involvement. Wartime WW2 production of the military Model 16 H and Big 4 sidevalve motorcycles was Nortons contribution to the war effort, almost 100,000 being manufactured. When major shareholders started to leave Norton in 1953, the company declined and Associated Motor Cycles bought the shares. Although motorcycle sales went through a recession in the 1950s, and Norton Motors Ltd was only a small manufacturer, Norton sales flourished. A series of Norton Dominator Twins of 500cc, then 600cc, then 650cc and then the 750cc Norton Atlas kept sales buoyant, especially with sales to the USA. In 1968, the new 750cc Norton Commando Model appeared, with the engine/gearbox/swingarm unit \\"isolastically\\" insulated from the frame with a series of rubber mountings. This kept the vibrations from the rider, giving a smooth comfortable ride. The Commando was a best seller, and voted #1 Motorcycle of the Year a number of times in Britain. 850cc Models appeared for 1973, giving more torque.

A conspiracy. An assassination. A hanging. These events, starting with the crushing of Jacobite rebels at Culloden in 1746 and culminating six years later in the so-called Appin Murder, provided Robert Louis Stevenson with the plot of his enduringly popular novel Kidnapped. But truth can be every bit as dramatic as fiction. And never more so than in this account of what lay behind the killing of government officer Colin Campbell by a hidden gunman on a May afternoon in 1752. Campbell was on his way to evict rebels from the Ardshiel estate near Appin, and Britain's rulers saw in his murder a terrorist act committed by Jacobite survivors of Culloden. When the alleged killer evaded a Scotland-wide manhunt and escaped abroad, politicians insisted someone had to pay for Campbell's death.The sacrificial lamb was James Stewart, a Culloden veteran who had been organising resistance to Campbell's evictions. James was found guilty in the show trial that followed and was hanged close to the murder scene. His body was left suspended there for years as a grim warning to anyone else thinking of challenging the new order the British state had imposed on the Jacobite Highlands.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j-AOnlnWAP4C&dq=Culloden+and+the+Last+Clansman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Overcome Email Overload with Microsoft Outlook 2000 and Outlook 2002: Get Through Your Electronic Mail Faster","description":"Overcome Email Overload with Microsoft Outlook and Outlook shows how to get through electronic mail faster.

Only African Americans were excluded or segregated in the audience, though they were overrepresented in parodic form on stage.

This is a view increasingly held, as adherents of mainstream religions come to recognize what indigenous peoples knew centuries ago that the sacred inheres in nature itself. What such a trend means and how it involves the forces of culture, religion, and constitutional law (especially First Amendment clauses concerning the free exercise of religion) are considered with a remarkable breadth and depth of understanding in this important new work. Drawing on case studies of national parks and monuments, national forests, and other public lands and resources, Lloyd Burton gives a clear and comprehensive account of how the intertwining influences of culture, religion, and law have affected the management of public lands and resources in the recent past and how they may do so in the future. In a unique and unprecedented way, his book weaves together teachings on nature and the sacred among indigenous and immigrant culture groups in the United States; the relevant constitutional history of religion and government action; and analysis of contemporary conflicts over culture, religion, and public lands management. As such, Worship and Wilderness is essential reading not only for public land managers and environmental policy makers but also for anyone interested in the growing significance of religious interests in the use of resources that constitute our national commons and our common natural heritage.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1eoriiOX-icC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"That Terrible Halloween Night","description":"Grandpa tells Louie and Mary Ann of the dreadful Halloween night that turned him into an old man.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j23hAAAAMAAJ&dq=That+Terrible+Halloween+Night&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"W.B.

Now, half a century after Waugh s death in 1966, with Evelyn Waugh, Philip Eade has delivered a hugely entertaining biography that is both authoritative and full of new information, some of it sensational. Drawing on extensive unseen primary sources, Eade s book sheds new light on many of the key phases and themes of Waugh s life: his difficult relationship with his embarrassingly sentimental father; his formative homosexual affairs at Oxford; his unrequited love for various Bright Young Things; his disastrous first marriage; his momentous conversion to Roman Catholicism; his unconventional yet successful second marriage; his checkered wartime career; and his shattering nervous breakdown. Along the way, we come to understand not only Waugh s complex relationship with the aristocracy, but also the astonishing power of his wit, and the love, fear, and loathing that he variously inspired in others. Waugh was famously difficult, and Eade brilliantly captures the myriad facets of his character, even as he casts new light on the novels that have dazzled generations of readers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=paM7DwAAQBAJ&dq=EVELYN+WAUGH:+A+BIOGRAPHY&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One of Us: Richard Nixon and the American Dream.","description":"America's leading liberal journalist revisits the case of Richard Nixon, taking a fresh look at this political enigma and offering a rereading of contemporary history","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d6AkyeXlbN8C&dq=One+of+Us:+Richard+Nixon+and+the+American+Dream.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ladies in the Laboratory?

A legend he has become one firmly fixed in the popular imagination. But in his own time W.B. Masterson was a man, a less-than-perfect creature subject to the same temptations and vices as his fellows, albeit one who, through circumstance and inclination, led an exciting life in an exciting time and place. As buffalo hunter, army scout, peace officer, professional gambler, sportsman, promoter, and newspaperman, Masterson's career was stormy and eventful. Surprising to many readers will be the account of Masterson's career after his peace officer days, during his employment as a sports writer and columnist. The gun-toting western peace officer reputed to have killed more men than Billy the Kid (not so, says DeArment) spent his last years happily in New York City, writing for a nationally known newspaper. This book, the product of more than twenty years of research, separates fact from fiction to extricate the story of his life from the legend that has enmeshed it. It is the most complete biography of Bat Masterson ever written.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KslcAwAAQBAJ&dq=Bat+Masterson,+The+Man+and+the+Legend&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diane Arbus: Magazine Work (ISBN: 0893812331","description":"Gathers a chronological selection of portraits Arbus produced on assignment for Esquire, Harper's Bazaar, the Sunday Times magazine of London, and other magazines.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aMcqIcdhXd8C&dq=Diane+Arbus:+Magazine+Work+(ISBN:+0893812331&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lost Race Tracks: Treasures of Automobile Racing","description":"Americans have raced on more than 6,000 racetracks, road courses and drag strips, at home and abroad, since an American Duryea and a German Benz met in the snow in Chicago in 1895.

Overseas, Mack Bolan was dubbed  Sgt. Mercy  for the compassion he showed the innocent. On the home front, they re calling him the Executioner for what he s doing to the guilty. In the jungles of Southeast Asia, American sniper Mack Bolan honed his skills. After twelve years, with ninety-five confirmed hits, he returns home to Massachusetts. But it s not to reunite with his family, it s to bury them victims in a mass murder/suicide. Even though Bolan s own father pulled the trigger, he knows the old man was no killer.

It also deals with constructions of gender during periods of social and political change. Social change is usually described in terms of modernization, revolution, cultural challenges, and social movements. Much of the standard literature on these topics does not examine women or gender, and thus [the author] hopes this study will contribute to an appreciation of the significance of gender in the midst of change. Neither are there many sociological studies on MENA and Afghansitan or studies on women in MENA and Afghanistan from a sociological perspective. Myths and stereotypes abund regarding women, Islam, and the region, and the sevents of September 11 and since have only compounded them. This book is intended in part to \\"normalize\\" the Middle East by underscoring the salience of structural determinants other than religion. It focuses on the major social-change processes in the region to show how women's lives are shaped not only by \\"Islam\\" and \\"culture\\", but also by economic development, the state, class location, and the world system. Why the focus on women? It is [the autor's] contention that middle-class women are consciously and unconsciously major agents of social change in the region, at the vanguard of movements for modernity, democratization and citizenship.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hOVjBzQrdxkC&dq=Modernizing+Women:+Gender+and+Social+Change+in+the+Middle+East+(Women&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Words","description":"Masonry is permeated with powerful verbal and pictorial symbolism that arouses the mental, spiritual and intellectual life.

Abandoned by his parents as a toddler, Jesse Thistle and his two brothers were cut off from all they knew when they were placed in the foster care system. Eventually placed with their paternal grandparents, the children often clashed with their tough-love attitude. Worse, the ghost of Jesse s drug-addicted father seemed to haunt the memories of every member of the family.

Their story is at once compelling, controversial, and remarkable. Part detective story, part medical history, The Proteus Effect recounts the events leading up to the discovery of stem cells and their incredible potential for the future of medicine. What exactly are these biological wonders a\\" these things called stem cells? They may be tiny, but their impact is earth shaking, generating excitement among medical researchers a\\" and outright turmoil in political circles. They are reported to be nothing short of miraculous. But they have also incited fear and mistrust in many. Indeed, recent research on stem cells raises important questions as rapidly as it generates new discoveries. The power of stem cells rests in their unspecialized but marvelously flexible nature. They are the clay of life waiting for the cellular signal that will coax them into taking on the shape of the beating cells of the heart muscle or the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. With a wave of our medical magic wand, ita?s possible that stem cells could be used to effectively treat (even cure) diseases such as Parkinson's disease, diabetes, heart disease, autoimmune disorders, and even baldness. But should scientists be allowed to pick apart four-day-old embryos in order to retrieve stem cells? And when stem cells whisper to us of immortality a\\" they can divide and perpetuate new cells indefinitely a\\" how do we respond? Stem cells are forcing us to not only reexamine how we define the beginning of life but how we come to terms with the end of life as well. Meticulously researched, artfully balanced, and engagingly told, Ann Parson chronicles a scientific discovery in progress, exploring the ethical debates, describing the current research, and hinting of a spectacular new era in medicine.

Tomorrow Will Be Better tells the story of Margy Shannon, a shy but joyfully optimistic young woman just out of school who lives with her parents and witnesses how a lifetime of hard work, poverty, and pain has worn them down. Her mother's resentment toward being a housewife and her father's inability to express his emotions result in a tense home life where Margy has no voice. Unable to speak up against her overbearing mother, Margy takes refuge in her dreams of a better life. Her goals are simple to find a husband, have children, and live in a nice home one where her children will never know the terror of want or the need to hide from quarreling parents. When she meets Frankie Malone, she thinks her dreams might be fulfilled, but a devastating loss rattles her to her core and challenges her life-long optimism. As she struggles to come to terms with the unexpected path her life has taken, Margy must decide whether to accept things as they are or move firmly in the direction of what she truly wants. Rich with the flavor of its Brooklyn background, and filled with the joys and heartbreak of family life, Tomorrow Will Be Better is told with a simplicity, tenderness, and warmhearted humor that only Betty Smith could write.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qrWdDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ten Sacks of Rice","description":"\\"Donald and Penny's story is like their life - swashbuckling, funny and compassionate.\\" - Jackie Pullinger-To Author of Chasing the Dragon \\"They had asked me to pray with one of their sons.

Even countries in the earlier stages of industrialization are starting to get caught up in the battle of the bulge.

At best, these body-image issues can be unpleasant and distracting from the goal of being healthy and happy. At worst they can lead to serious mental health problems like body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) or eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia nervosa.This revised edition of a classic workbook presents a complete approach to dealing with body image issues.

Now in Real Politics, Elshtain gives further proof of her willingness to speak her mind, courting disagreement and even censure from those who prefer their ideologies neat. At the center of Elshtain's work is a passionate concern with the relationship between political rhetoric and political action. For Elshtain, politics is a sphere of concrete responsibility. Political speech should, therefore, approach the richness of actual lives and commitments rather than present impossible utopias. In her essays, Elshtain finds in the writings of V clav Havel, Hannah Arendt, and Albert Camus a language appropriate to the complexity of everyday life and politics, and she critiques philosophers and writers who distance us from a concrete, embodied world. She argues against those repressive strains within contemporary feminism which insist that families and even sexual differentiation are inherently oppressive. Along the way, she challenges an ideology of victimization that too often loses sight of individual victims in its pursuit of abstract goals. Elshtain reaffirms the quirky and by no means simple pleasures of small-town life as a microcosm of the human condition and considers the current crisis in American education and its consequences for democracy. Beyond exploring the details of political life over the past two decades, Real Politics advocates a via media politics that avoids unacceptable extremes and serves as a model for responsible political discourse. Throughout her diverse and insightful writings, Elshtain champions a civic philosophy that tends to the dignity of everyday life as a democratic imperative of the first order. \\"Jean Bethke Elshtain is a person of rare intellect. The moral wisdom that pervades these essays reminds us that when all is said and done politics is about the life and death of real people who are anything but abstractions. Her erudition is remarkable, but equally stunning is her eye for the significant. What she is so good at is helping us see the moral and political significance of the everyday.\\" -- Stanley Hauerwas, Duke University \\" Real Politics serves as a forceful reminder that Jean Elshtain has been dealing with the real world in twenty-five years of powerful essaying. Transcending ideological categories, she writes out of hope that human beings can enjoy those capacities of reason and faith which make them human. It is a pleasure to be reintroduced to her sustained intelligence.\\" -- Alan Wolfe, Boston University","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SGkCTtr8qFsC&dq=Real+Politics:+At+the+Center+of+Everyday+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Max Weber: Classic Monographs: From Hist To Sociology V1 (Max Weber Classic Monographs, V. 1)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WOouAQAAIAAJ&dq=Max+Weber:+Classic+Monographs:+From+Hist+To+Sociology+V1+(Max+Weber+Classic+Monographs,+V.+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Masters of Painting: Their Works/Their Lives/Their Times","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2gKKwgEACAAJ&dq=Masters+of+Painting:+Their+Works/Their+Lives/Their+Times&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Children's Rights in the United States: In Search of a National Policy","description":"The authors of this volume provide discussion on vital issues related to the rights of children in the United States, including: the historical and contextual perspective on the rights of children; the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child; the differing views on children's rights and competencies; and the rights of children within the family, the social service system, the health care system, the educational system, the juvenile justice system and in employment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mIE5DQAAQBAJ&dq=Children%27s+Rights+in+the+United+States:+In+Search+of+a+National+Policy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living Details","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6ykzAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Deaf Experience: Classics in Language and Education (Gallaudet Classics in Deaf Studies Series, Vol. 5)","description":"Oxford Handbooks offer authoritative and up-to-date reviews of original research in a particular subject area. Specially commissioned chapters from leading figures in the discipline give critical examinations of the progress and direction of debates, as well as a foundation for future research. Oxford Handbooks provide scholars and graduate students with compelling new perspectives upon a wide range of subjects in the humanities, social sciences, and sciences. The adage Those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it is a powerful one for parents, teachers, and other professionals involved with or interested in deaf individuals or the Deaf community. Myths grown from ignorance have long dogged the field, and faulty assumptions and overgeneralizations have persisted despite contrary evidence. A study of the history of deaf education reveals patterns that have affected educational policy and legislation for deaf people around the world; these patterns are related to several themes critical to the chapters of this volume. One such theme is the importance of parental involvement in raising and educating deaf children. Another relates to how Deaf people have taken an increasingly greater role in influencing their own futures and places in society. In published histories, we see the longstanding conflicts through the centuries that pertain to sign language and spoken communication philosophies, as well as the contributions of the individuals who advocated alternative strategies for teaching deaf children. More recently, investigators have recognized the need for a diverse approach to language and language learning. Advances in technology, cognitive science, linguistics, and the social sciences have alternately led and followed changes in theory and practice, resulting in a changing landscape for deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals and those connected to them. This second volume of the The Oxford Handbook of Deaf Studies, Language, and Education (2003) picks up where that first landmark volume left off, describing those advances and offering readers the opportunity to understand the current status of research in the field while recognizing the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. In Volume 2, an international group of contributing experts provide state-of-the-art summaries intended for students, practitioners, and researchers. Not only does it describe where we are, it helps to chart courses for the future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0mmJAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adonis: The Male Physique Pin-Up 1870-1940","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ENxLAQAAIAAJ&dq=Adonis:+The+Male+Physique+Pin-Up+1870-1940&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Photos of Jeff (Euros) (No.16)","description":"Jeff is a phenomenon.

He was so well read, and had such a photographic memory, that he could give you the page and column in a host of reference works and commentaries. This book shocked the Christian world in 1919 when he published it. He fiercely defends the sovereignty of God, and all the cognate doctrines such as the Doctrines of Grace. It is THE book to give to those just after conversion, and a prime book to give to anyone who defends the free will of man. Pink was a Baptist preacher who held pulpits in England, America, and Australia. His early training was in scientology. His conversion was instant, and complete dedication to the cause of God and truth quickly became evident. This early book by Pink lays Scripture end to end to prove God's control over all persons and events. It is uncompromising, and as such it raises the hackles on the necks of many new students of this doctrine. Persons who knew Pink seldom objected to anything he taught, because he could literally quote hundreds of verses of Scripture verbatim on the subject under discussion. This book may be overwhelming, but it is certain that its many printings have been used of God to convince people of His sovereignty. The Banner of Truth has an edition of this book, but they have abridged their edition by deleting the chapter on Reprobation. If Pink were still alive, he certainly would not have allowed this misrepresentation of his doctrinal belief: that God both elects and reprobates, as Romans 9:21?23 clearly teaches.

Shawn and a squad of detectives investigate this dire prediction and try to avert the millionaire businessman from meeting his ordained end at the stroke of midnight. One of Cornell Woolrich's most influential novels, this classic noir tale of a man struggling with his ability to see the future is arguably the author's best in its depiction of a doomed vision of predestination.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9P9BEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Smythe Sewn Address Books French Ornate Vert Mini","description":"An anniversary edition of an influential book that introduced a groundbreaking approach to the study of science, technology, and society. This pioneering book, first published in 1987, launched the new field of social studies of technology. It introduced a method of inquiry social construction of technology, or SCOT that became a key part of the wider discipline of science and technology studies. The book helped the MIT Press shape its STS list and inspired the Inside Technology series. The thirteen essays in the book tell stories about such varied technologies as thirteenth-century galleys, eighteenth-century cooking stoves, and twentieth-century missile systems. Taken together, they affirm the fruitfulness of an approach to the study of technology that gives equal weight to technical, social, economic, and political questions, and they demonstrate the illuminating effects of the integration of empirics and theory. The approaches in this volume collectively called SCOT (after the volume's title) have since broadened their scope, and twenty-five years after the publication of this book, it is difficult to think of a technology that has not been studied from a SCOT perspective and impossible to think of a technology that cannot be studied that way.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nL34DwAAQBAJ&dq=Smythe+Sewn+Address+Books+French+Ornate+Vert+Mini&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Particulars of my life","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rybYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Particulars+of+my+life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Psychic Politics (A Reward Book)","description":"A psychic known as a medium for a trance personality named Seth describes her visions of a library of knowledge associated with a higher level of experience and records her discoveries concerning the psyche and consciousness","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GS64AAAACAAJ&dq=Psychic+Politics+(A+Reward+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rome Then and Now: In Overlay","description":"A wonderful find is this book, reconstructing the ingenious architecture of ancient Rome.

The cases examined begin in 1638, extend to the Salem outbreak in 1692, and document for the first time the extensive Stamford-Fairfield, Connecticut, witch-hunt of 16921693. Here one encounters witch-hunts through the eyes of those who participated in them: the accusers, the victims, the judges. The original texts tell in vivid detail a multi-dimensional story that conveys not only the process of witch-hunting but also the complexity of culture and society in early America. The documents capture deep-rooted attitudes and expectations and reveal the tensions, anger, envy, and misfortune that underlay communal life and family relationships within New England s small towns and villages. Primary sources include court depositions as well as excerpts from the diaries and letters of contemporaries. They cover trials for witchcraft, reports of diabolical possessions, suits of defamation, and reports of preternatural events. Each section is preceded by headnotes that describe the case and its background and refer the reader to important secondary interpretations. In his incisive introduction, David D. Hall addresses a wide range of important issues: witchcraft lore, antagonistic social relationships, the vulnerability of women, religious ideologies, popular and learned understandings of witchcraft and the devil, and the role of the legal system. This volume is an extraordinarily significant resource for the study of gender, village politics, religion, and popular culture in seventeenth-century New England.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-l9djvCETvwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The calling of Dan Matthews","description":"This is a story about a young man's journey into manhood and the discovery of his true calling in life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NcUyxQEACAAJ&dq=The+calling+of+Dan+Matthews&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tourist","description":"In Olen Steinhauer's explosive New York Times bestseller, Milo Weaver has tried to leave his old life of secrets and lies behind by giving up his job as a \\"tourist\\" for the CIA an undercover agent with no home, no identity and working a desk at the CIA's New York headquarters.

When, two centuries later, the Normans seized control of the island, they found a Muslim state just entering its cultural prime. Rather than replace the practices and idioms of the vanquished people with their own, the Normans in Sicily adopted and adapted the Greco-Arabic culture that had developed on the island. Yet less than a hundred years later, the cultural and linguistic mix had been reduced, a Romance tradition had come to dominate, and Sicilian poets composed the first body of love lyrics in an Italianate vernacular. Karla Mallette has written the first literary history of the Kingdom of Sicily in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Where other scholars have separated out the island's literature along linguistic grounds, Mallette surveys the literary production in Arabic, Latin, Greek, and Romance dialects, in addition to the architectural remains, numismatic inscriptions, and diplomatic records, to argue for a multilingual, multicultural, and coherent literary tradition. Drawing on postcolonial theory to consider institutional and intellectual power, the exchange of knowledge across cultural boundaries, and the containment and celebration of the other that accompanies cultural transition, the book includes an extensive selection of poems and documents translated from the Arabic, Latin, Old French, and Italian. The Kingdom of Sicily, 1100-1250 opens up new venues for understanding the complexity of a place and culture at the crossroads of East and West, Islam and Christianity, tradition and innovation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5I11Ey3CO4MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Neale Donald Walsch on Holistic Living","description":"Explains how to gain health and wellness through a connection to God and the surrounding environment by recognizing your place in the universe as part of a whole system","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tVpxD_4eMvoC&dq=Neale+Donald+Walsch+on+Holistic+Living&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Twenty Something and Breast Cancer: Images in Healing","description":"The author's courageous battle with cancer helps the reader to understand the control that each of us can exercise over our own destiny.

The Macedonian king, Ptolemy Ceraunnos, was slain and the army that, less than two generations before, had conquered the known world for Alexander the Great was swept aside. The Athenians were likewise defeated and the great sanctuary of Delphi was looted and destroyed. The Celtic invasion left an indelible impression on Greek literature and art.\\" \\"This is the first popular account of the Celts of Eastern Europe and their relationship with the Hellenic states, a relationship which started in the 6th Century BC.

What is embarrassment? What really causes it, and when does it stop being an emotion that can just be brushed away with the fleeting hope that no real harm has been done? In I Can't Believe I Just Did That, David Allyn reveals how the feelings of confusion and self-doubt associated with embarrassment can powerfully affect the overall quality of our lives. With a complete program for identifying and managing embarrassment and repairing the harm it can inflict, Allyn's book shows how to: - decipher the underlying fears of embarrassment that are holding you back - admit to others when embarrassment leads you to behave in a way that you didn't intend - find the courage to say what you really think - manage the emotions associated with embarrassment as you are experiencing them; and - gain the confidence to be free of embarrassment in every area of your life. A revolutionary look at a commonplace emotion that we shouldn't simply learn to ignore, this book will dramatically improve how you live your life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hpT-bJKLLrQC&dq=I+Can%27t+Believe+I+Just+Did+That&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Hard Bargain (Silhouette Special Edition #139)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-qb0swEACAAJ&dq=A+Hard+Bargain+(Silhouette+Special+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Reader of Gentlemen's Mail: Herbert O.

The outcome could easily have been very different, as Peter Tsouras shows in this masterful and devastating account in which plans, missions and landings go horribly wrong. Tsouras firmly bases his narrative on facts but introduces minor adjustments at the opening of the campaign-the repositioning of a unit, bad weather and misjudged orders-and examines their effect as they gather momentum and impact on all subsequent events. Without deviating from the genuine possibilities of the situation, he presents a scenario that keeps the reader guessing and changes the course of history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mc47DAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tea of the Sages: The Art of Sencha","description":"The Japanese tea ceremony is generally identified with chanoyu and its bowls of whipped, powdered green tea served in surroundings influenced by the tenets of Zen Buddhism. Tea of the Sages is the first English language study of the alternate tea tradition of sencha. At sencha tea gatherings, steeped green leaf tea is prepared in an atmosphere indebted to the humanistic values of the Chinese sages and the materialistic culture of elite Chinese society during the Ming and Qing dynasties. Although sencha once surpassed chanoyu in popularity, it is now overshadowed by chanoyu, despite the existence of more than a hundred sencha schools throughout Japan. This exceptionally well-illustrated volume explores sencha's philosophy and arts from the seventeenth century to the present. Introduced by Chinese merchants and scholar-monks, sencha first gained favor in Japan among devotees of the Chinese literati. By the early nineteenth century, it had become popular with a wide spectrum of urban and rural residents. Some took up sencha as a subversive activity in opposition to the mandated protocol of chanoyu. Others enjoyed sencha because of its connections with elite Chinese culture, knowledge of which indicated intellectual and cultural refinement. Still others relished it simply as a fine tasting beverage. Sencha inspired painters and poets and fostered major advances within craft industries from ceramics to metalwork and basketry. Sencha aficionados, many of whom became serious connoisseurs of Chinese art and antiquities, hosted some of the earliest public art exhibitions. Tea of the Sages opens with a chronological overview of tea in China and its transmission to Japan before situating sencha within the rich milieu of Chinese material culture available in early modern Japan. Subsequent chapters outline the multifaceted history of the formalization of the sencha tea ceremony, drawing upon sources such as treatises and less formal writings as well as analysis of tea gathering records, utensils and their prescribed arrangements, paintings, prints, and sencha architecture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z_4kk_xcJ5cC&dq=Tea+of+the+Sages:+The+Art+of+Sencha&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brain Puzzlers","description":"A compilation of activities emphasizing creative-thinking strategies.

Riding through France with his master, the servant Jacques appears to act as though he is truly free in a world of dizzying variety and unpredictability. Characters emerge and disappear as the pair travel across the country, and tales begin and are submerged by greater stories, to reveal a panoramic view of eighteenth-century society. But while Jacques seems to choose his own path, he remains convinced of one philosophical belief: that every decision he makes, however whimsical, is wholly predetermined. Playful, picaresque and comic, Diderot's novelis a compelling exploration of Enlightment philosophy. Brilliantly original in style, it is one of the greatest precursors to post-modern literature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Rrf_eSfyE-kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Funk & Wagnalls New International Dictionary of the English Language Millennium 2000 Edition r","description":"Explores the presence of jazz, pop, rap, and hip-hop in the music noted for its syncopation and improvisational freedom","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xS9dwaa_gSgC&dq=Funk&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Order of Mass","description":"A pastoral instrument for liturgical formation [on the Order of Mass] of the People of God","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DjhjJZQE5FgC&dq=Order+of+Mass&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thirty-one years on the plains and in the mountains; or, The last voice from the plains: An authentic record of a life time of hunting, trapping, scouting and Indian fighting in the far West","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6-pM6_19CgAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Same-Sex Affairs: Constructing and Controlling Homosexuality in the Pacific Northwest","description":"Same-Sex Affairs is a path-breaking history of male homosexuality in the Pacific Northwest from 1890 to 1930.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=26YwDwAAQBAJ&dq=Same-Sex+Affairs:+Constructing+and+Controlling+Homosexuality+in+the+Pacific+Northwest&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rock of Chickamauga","description":"General George H.

In works such as The Sound and the Fury, As I Lay Dying, Light in August, and Absalom, Absalom! Faulkner drew powerfully on Southern themes, attitudes, and atmosphere to create his own world and place--the mythical Yoknapatawpha County--peopled with quintessential Southerners such as the Compsons, Sartorises, Snopes, and McCaslins. Indeed, to a degree perhaps unmatched by any other major twentieth-century novelist, Faulkner remained at home and explored his own region--the history and culture and people of the South. Now, in William Faulkner and Southern History, one of America's most acclaimed historians of the South, Joel Williamson, weaves together a perceptive biography of Faulkner himself, an astute analysis of his works, and a revealing history of Faulkner's ancestors in Mississippi--a family history that becomes, in Williamson's skilled hands, a vivid portrait of Southern culture itself. Williamson provides an insightful look at Faulkner's ancestors, a group sketch so brilliant that the family comes alive almost as vividly as in Faulkner's own fiction. Indeed, his ancestors often outstrip his characters in their colorful and bizarre nature. Williamson has made several discoveries: the Falkners (William was the first to spell it \\"Faulkner\\") were not planter, slaveholding \\"aristocrats\\"; Confederate Colonel Falkner was not an unalloyed hero, and he probably sired, protected, and educated a mulatto daughter who married into America's mulatto elite; Faulkner's maternal grandfather Charlie Butler stole the town's money and disappeared in the winter of 1887-1888, never to return. Equally important, Williamson uses these stories to underscore themes of race, class, economics, politics, religion, sex and violence, idealism and Romanticism--\\"the rainbow of elements in human culture\\"--that reappear in Faulkner's work. He also shows that, while Faulkner's ancestors were no ordinary people, and while he sometimes flashed a curious pride in them, Faulkner came to embrace a pervasive sense of shame concerning both his family and his culture. This he wove into his writing, especially about sex, race, class, and violence, psychic and otherwise. William Faulkner and Southern History represents an unprecedented publishing event--an eminent historian writing on a major literary figure. By revealing the deep history behind the art of the South's most celebrated writer, Williamson evokes new insights and deeper understanding, providing anyone familiar with Faulkner's great novels with a host of connections between his work, his life, and his ancestry.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0nZ93-IKIeoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Work It!

Like celebrities of today, she toured the world, endorsed beauty products and department stores, appeared in fashion magazines, and even made a Hollywood movie. But her passion was always ballet, which she sought to bring to as wide an audience as possible. Many of the works she brought with her from Russia are regarded as the foundation of today's classic ballet repertoire. Created to celebrate the centenary of the founding of Pavlova's English dance company, this book offers an intimate look at the legendary ballerina whose name still resonates 80 years after her death. This richly illustrated book has now been revised to include an entirely new chapter on Pavlova's tours to North and South America, as well as new images of Pavlova with Charlie Chaplin. Anna Pavlova: Twentieth-Century Ballerina takes a fascinating look at the iconic star whose career spanned Russia and the West in the first half of the century, showing how she became the most influential dancer of the time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DoJ_MAEACAAJ&dq=(Anna)+Pavlova:+Portrait+of+a+Dancer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"old john","description":"After being told by numerous psychics that he had walked with Jesus two thousand years ago, John Davis, a professional comedy performer decides to find a regression therapist to help shed some light on the mystery of his past.
