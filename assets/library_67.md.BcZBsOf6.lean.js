This is the kind of story that you hear over and over growing up in poverty. It is almost in the category of Robin Hood, but this is the real thing in the flesh and blood. The old man in the cemetery scene still plays over and over in my mind. I should have read everything written by Charles Dickens by now, but yet I haven't. I started A Tale of Two Cities a little while ago and I have it on my night stand. I think that I'll get back to it tonight. I don't know who beats Dickens in superb phrasing and style.

I found that the reason I had such difficulties beginning it, was due to its monotonous and dull beginning. Once past that section, Great Expectations dramatically lifts.

I hear that word coming out of the mouth of many teenagers.

(So is A Tale of Two Cities, a great story, but not much like other Dickens works.) If you can stick with them, I recommend even more highly Dickens' Bleak House, Our Mutual Friend, David Copperfield, and Little Dorrit--they're long but they are great, well-written stories with fully developed characters and (sometimes mysteriously long) plot and description that turns out to be crucial (you get a hint of that in GE).

The illustrated Kindle edition by Top Five Books is easy to navigate, formatted well, free of errors, and contains a variety of illustrations. It is free, and there is nothing about this version that recommends choosing an alternative."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great Expectations is widely regarded as one of Charles Dickens' finest works and I have to agree; it is one of my favorites, second to A Tale of Two Cities. The story of a young boy's growth to manhood, and his rise to unexpected prosperity and subsequent fall, is strongly written and captivating. Great Expectations captures the attention from the first page and, unlike some of Dickens' other works, it never has a dull moment. Like all of Dickens' works, it is peopled with a large cast of unique and quirky characters whose relationships to each other, as the story unfolds, end up being as intertwined as a plate of spaghetti. Some of the scenes and characters in Great Expectations are downright bizarre; the scenes involving Miss Havisham and the Pocket family felt distinctly Alice in Wonderland-ish in their weirdness.What makes Great Expectations so strong is the main character, Pip. He is that rarity among Dickens' characters, one that has depth and more than one dimension and mood. He tells his own story and, as an adult reflecting back on his own childhood and adolescence, he reveals his own youthful selfishness with a poignancy that surely every listener can connect with. Haven't we all been Pip, selfish and unappreciative of the goodness of others and unworthy of their admiration?I did not listen to this particular audio edition, although I know that Brilliance Audio produces top-notch audio books and Michael Page is an excellent narrator. I highly recommend the edition I listened to, produced by BBC Audio. It is a no-frills production, but the narrator (Martin Jarvis) is outstanding. He truly has a gift for voices (I especially loved his rendition of The Aged), and adds color and personality to the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I enjoyed reading this book in high school and also enjoy watching one of the old B&W; movie versions if it happens to come on TV.

His nagging sister and weakling of a brother-in-law are raising him. He doesn't have much, yet is compelled to help an escaped convict with food and drink. (More out of fear than compassion, mind.) He knows no other way of life, so he doesn't expect anything... until he meets Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham is an old recluse who still mourns after the man who broken her heart on her wedding day. One day, she invites Pip over to \\"play,\\" and that is where he meets young and beautiful Estella. The pretty girl intrigues and irritates him in equal parts. Proud and cruel, she makes him feel like a nobody. And that is how his desires to become a gentleman emerge. So imagine his surprise when a secret benefactor grants his biggest wish, a stranger with \\"Great Expectations.\\" Pip soon moves to London, abandons his old acquaintances for new ones, and reunites with mean girl Estella, now older and more beautiful. Will he be good enough for her now?Great Expectations is my favorite Dickens novel. Granted, I have only read this one and Bleak House (I've also read A Christmas Carol and another novella of his), but it is my favorite one of the two. This novel contains beautiful storytelling, lots of irony and Dickens's signature eccentric characters and hilarious dialogue. This is my second time reading this after over a decade, and I enjoyed it more the second time around. (I enjoyed this as much as the other novel I read at the same time as this one, which, to my surprise, brought up Dickens and Great Expectations.) Pip is a wonderful character. He does, however, get on my nerves when he wants to be around people that to me aren't worth it. Estella is such a snob, a total beyotch, but I can see why Pip would want her to think well of him. One thing I've always found interesting is that Dickens always depicts lawyers as greedy and callous. Bleak House illustrates this even more. Perhaps Dickens disliked lawyers. Could his father's stay at a debtors' prison have to do with this? Well, one thing is clear: Great Expectations is a beautiful novel, one of the best out there, even with its altered ending. I've read both endings and like them both (though I prefer his original ending). Two endings are great because they give you a choice. Anyway, a great summer reread. I have A Tale of Two Cities and look forward to reading it soon."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I love listening to audiobooks while I work out and have a special fondness for the classics, so I was very excited by the excellent reviews this audio version received. I had read that each disk contained 90+ brief tracks, which is fine with me as I have never had a problem importing audiobooks into iTunes. Well, there is always a first time. I don't know what iTunes uses to find CD info or track names, but not a single disk came up identified as Great Expectations, nor did the tracks have any type of logical naming system. I had to type in a name for 93-94 tracks on every single disk (eg. disk01track01, etc).The audiobook itself is quite good of course, thankfully. I just need to warn those who plan to import for their iPod that it will not be a simple process. Better have a couple of hours to type. Had I known this would be a problem, I would not have purchased this version."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"As usual with Dickens, improbable coincidences abound. They are artfully presented however and Dickens does offer one or two surprises.For one thing, the novel is quite violent. Dickens graphically describes one character dying from burns. He presents a ruffian or two. Even one of the better gentlemen manhandles his maid.Also as usual with Dickens, we find a full cast of memorable well-defined characters. Mr Jaggers, the lawyer to beat all lawyers, and his assistant Mr. Wemmick who never mixes business and home matters, except under exceptional circumstances. We find Miss Havesham a wealthy but bitter spinster left at the altar years before. We meet Joe Gargery, a wise well-meaning blacksmith who lovingly raises Pip, the novel's main character, taking him on as his apprentice. Pip leaves him when fortune mysteriously smiles on him. An unknown benefactor gives our hero a substantial income so that he may fulfill his Great Expectations and become a gentleman of means and of leasure.And there you have Pip in a nutshell: he leaves a loving home, a kind man and a good position to become a man of the world, a man about town, in short a bit of a parasite.But then to become a man of means is for Dickens to have attained heaven on earth and he only lets the truly good enjoy their fortune. Jaggers is rich and cannot be called good, at worst he is amoral, but he is a man of action. On the other hand the thoughtless and ungrateful Pip doesn't deserve heaven. Not just yet.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"My only real complain about this bookis that Orlick seems to be an annoying intrusion. Both of the \\"Great Expectations\\" movies I saw deleted the role of Orlick, and I can't say I missed him. Along with \\"Oliver Twist,\\" \\"Great Expectations\\" was one of my father's favorites.Onto the text. Pip (who is still a child and a literary reincarnation of Oliver Twist)) has a frightening experience in a graveyard when the escaped convict Magwitch (kind of a literary reincarnation of Fagin) threatens him and demands a file and some food. When Pip goes to get these things, we meet his sister who is not so nice to him. Though her husband Joe is. (Undoubtedly, this tense marriage reflects Dickens's divorce.) Moving on, Pip delivers the file and food to Magwitch who is of course grateful. sadly, Magwitch is captured, but he remains grateful to Pip.Later, Pip meets the tragic Miss Havisham. Havisham was left at the altar, and she never quite forgave the male sex for this. Interestingly, she has no concept of time. She has friends who visit her on her birthday, they do not mention it. Havisham trains her adopted daughter Estella to hate all men. Pip continues to visit Havisham and Estella for sometime. Soon, some good news comes from lawyer Mr. Jaggers. Pip learns that he is to be trained as a gentleman. Pip knows that Jaggers is Havisham's lawyer, so he assumes this gift is from her. (Why not?)Pip is accompanied by Herbert Pocket who is the son of Miss Havisham's cousin. Herbert tells Pip of Havisham's tragic past. We are permitted some sympathy for her. Pip (who is falling love with Estella) knows that Estella resembles someone, but he can't quite place who.There is a sad, but true to life scene when Joe comes to visit Pip, and because this kind man is not so educated, he turns out to be an embarrassment to Pip. In a scene of self sacrifice, Joe decides to let Pip go his own way.Later there is a disturbing scene between Havisham and Estella. While we may feel sorry for Havisham, she tried to plant her hatred in Estella, and naturally, Estella could only take living for hate so long. The real drama is still to come. Pip finds out that his benefactor was indeed Magwitch. (The man from the graveyard!) While we may share Pip's horror to some extent, we later learn that Magwitch is a sympathetic character. Basically, Compeyson was a kind of Uriah Heep who manipulated Magwitch. To make matters worse, it is punishable by death for Magwitch to be in England.I don't want to give away the ending, but this is easily one of Dickens's greatest books."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"After reading a bunch of these reviews, I've come to the conclusion that this book should not be pushed on high school students or younger. It's almost sad to read a review from someone who just read the cliff notes. Come on now, do we really need to hear from you? This is my favorite Dickens novel so far, and though I haven't read them all, I loved everything about it. Though the ending is happy, it is by no means a Hollywood ending.

The character of Miss Havisham is genius, and a character like none I have ever met before in literature. The images of her sitting corpse like in her decaying house will stick with me for all time. Everyone should read this book for this fascinating character.While the first part of the book delighted me with wicked satire, and dark humor, the last quarter of the book was too morally right for me. Every character saw the error of his ways, and strove to be a better person, and here the book lost much of the original feel it had going for it. I suppose maybe in Dickens' time, he couldn't get away with a book that did not have a morally uplifting ending.However, I say this is a must-read for the characters of Miss Havisham and the beautiful Estella alone. Also the lawyer Jaggers is a great character."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great Expectations is filled with ambition, greed, cruelty, and love.

However, it still hasa very interesting storyline that is very very detailed :D"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great Expectations is one of Dickens's later novels, a work of his artistic maturity. The narrative is symbolic rather than realistic. Although, as in most of Dickens and in Victorian literature in general, the plot relies heavily on coincidence, it is acceptable here because the events are true to the internal, psychological, logic of the story.Great Expectations tells the story of Pip, a boy who starts as an orphan who moves on to apprenticeship in the business world of nineteenth-century England. Along the way, he falls in love with a girl from a wealthy family, and gains a mysterious patron.The book is heavy on character development and descriptive detail, but relatively light on action and suspense. The orphan Pip, the convict Magwitch, the beautiful Estella and her guardian, the embittered and vengeful Miss Havisham, the master lawyer Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick his secretive assistant - all play their part in this story which is a memoir, a mystery, and a romance.Great Expectations never loses sight of the social mishaps of the time and is often on the teacher's list in literature classics. Most people who read it will like it and will be able to identify with the characters, but impatient readers will drown in the details, extended descriptions and explanations, and deep characterizations."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Dickens is to me the most obvious of writers. Most of his novels are to various extents semi autobiographical. Most are populated by people with amusing names who, aside from the main characters, seem to be caricatures more than humans who think and feel with any semblance of subtlety or complexity. Most are deeply concerned with social injustice and class struggle. Most are filled with plot twists, and almost all are very enjoyable reads. Dickens is nothing if not a master storyteller who loves to manipulate the emotions of his reading public. His stories are theatrical more than novelistic. It is no wonder he is the most popular author of the Victorian age, and maybe second only to Shakespeare in the history of English literature.GREAT EXPECTATIONS and DAVID COPPERFIELD are my 2 favorite Dickens novels, probably because they both have more overtly autobiographical elements than his other works. I also love BLEAK HOUSE. GREAT EXPECTATIONS is the story of Pip.. of his rise and fall, and ultimate redemption. This novel gives us a clear window into the heart and mind of Dickens himself. The story itself held my interest from beginning to end, had important themes to explore, and despite it's lack of introspection in examining personality issues, made you care about the main characters. Dickens was one of the great writers but he is not my favorite novelist of that period. I prefer George Eliot's style as a novelist. To me, Dickens power was in connecting emotionally with his audience and it must have been some experience hearing him tell his marvelous tales in person."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This is an excellent coming-of-age book with which many people will be able to relate.

Until you read the book you don't realize just how influential this story is in western literature."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great Expectations didn't meet my expectations. I was a little bored throughout the begining and middle of the story. I think what kept me reading on was the desire to read a \\"classic\\" (I usually read biography or history).I continued reading because I wanted to find out if Magwitch would meet his daughter. In addition, I was interested in Pip's strong desire to be a gentleman. Other than help his friend in business and dawdle about thinking about an emotionally deadweight chic, Pip didn't seem interested in obtaining a job or taking real advantage of his opportunities. I'll give Pip credit for helping his friend attain stature in business, and eventually going on to operate with his friend after losing his unearned wealth. But the lazy part is 19th century gentleman, huh?Maybe Dicken's purpose was to show the benefits of wealth and the slothfullness of one who didn't have to work himself to attain it. Maybe it hit me at the wrong time, as my fiancee just took a hike and left me after I just sold my house (and now have no place to go). Trust you me, I won't be wasting my life away like Ms. Havisham though. I haven't reached gentlemanly status and need to continue working . . . .I've only read Charles Dicken's Nicholas Nickleby and Oliver Twist in addition to \\"Great Expectations\\". Of these, I thoroughly enjoyed Nicholas Nickleby. In the future, I'll look for Kates and Madellines and not Estellas.

Some parts I never really caught on to were at the beginning when he was a little kid then he had grown up I never caught on to that right away. But when I finally did it was good and interesting to find out.I do think Charles Dickens did bring the story alive. I think also he should have had so many characters because then it was hard to understand who was who and where did they come from. At some points I wish he would have had explained himself more then what he did.

Dickens is one of my favorite novelists, and normally I am passionately enthusiastic about his books, but I could only manage to get slightly warmer than lukewarm about this middling novel. Overall, it wasn't bad- it is, in fact, one I wouldn't mind rereading in future. However, I didn't think it was quite as good as many of Dickens' other works. The plot, while not bad or boring, was not as suspenseful and intriguing as that of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, as slowly but enjoyably developing as that of &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, or as wonderfully tantalizing and gripping as that of &quot;Bleak House.&quot; The characters, while not hopelessly mediocre or bland, were not nearly as likeable and were much more forgettable than those of other Dickens novels. Although Pip was not a bad protagonist, I did not enjoy or like him as much as I did, say, Oliver Twist or Esther Summerson. Likewise, his character development, while interesting, was not, to my mind, as good or as interesting as that which is undergone by David Copperfield, a hero who I liked better than, and with whom I could sympathize more than with Pip. Estella and Miss Havisham, while interesting, did not add much to the plot, and when it comes to criminals those of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, are, in my opinion, more memorable, and in many ways, more sympathetic than Magwitch. While not a thoroughly forgettable or bad book, I wouldn't reccommend it to first time Dickens readers- it may discourage them from reading more. Wait until you've read one or two of his better novels, such as &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; or &quot;Bleak House.&quot; Then come to this one- only don't come with expectations that are TOO terribly great."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"this book was good and had many irony. its just didn't like it much because was boring for the early part.only the suspence kick up it was really nice to read..but the ending i didn't like cause it left me knowing that estela won't get with pip"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Reading for me is boring, but I was not bored for one second while reading this book.

It contains a cogent introduction to the novel and an exhaustive appendix. Although the price will keep many, if not all, from purchasing the book it is definetly look for from a library--looking in a university's library is probably the best bet for finding a copy."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"The reason that I chose this book was because I saw the play at my high school.I thought that this play was performed really good by the student body,so i decided to read the book, and the book was pretty good. I felt bad for Pip because he was living as an orphan with an abusive sister. That must have been very exhausting mentally and physically. I admire Pip because he is very young and the fact that he has to travel,work, and take care of his sick sister, he is a very good rolemodel. I also admire him because if a ex-convict came up to me, I would be so scared that I would run away. The fact that he trusted Magwitch with a lot of things really amazed me. Pip has gone through a lot of things with his family and his own personal life in a considerable amount of time and I admire him for that. Hopefully him and Estella get together because Pip is a very nice guy and I think that they would have a lot of fun together."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"if there is ever a person i feel sorry for: it's Pip. we have all looked up to the pretty girl (or boy) at school, and had that utter pain of knowing that it is impossible. pip is the patron saint of the rejected male.i have two problems with this book: one is the deus ex machina-esqe conclusion in the final 50 pages, where everything falls into place. when i say everything falls into place, i don't mean neatly. the ending is anti-climatic and pensivly moody. but things seem to work out in a weird way that i have some problems withsecondly- the whole plot of the book is one whole huge coincidence.with that said... i didn't mind the two faults whatsoever. there are few books that i have enjoyed so thuroughly as GE.anyone that has read Dickens in the past already knows about his prowess as a writter. and for people who have yet to read him (or highschool students who have just recieved their copy of GE, with a frown) will realize why he has remained contemporary, and still enjoyed.when i was in highschool, and i had to read a tale of two cities... my teacher exhausted the book, going over every minute symbol that was in it... in the end, it bored me. so, with that said, i love two cities regardless cause i read it independantly, and enjoyed it on my own pace. i recomend to all highschool studends to read the book at their own pace and bugger what your teacher tells you (yeah, i'm a good rolemodel). school tends to destroy great works of literature, don't fall into the trap.... whooops i thought this was a book review...great book, beautiful characters, a classic and well worth 5 stars... nuff said(i shed a tear or two at the end)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"When his magazine, All the Year Round, began failing due to an unpopular serial, Dickens was forced to begin publishing installments of a story of his own. The resulting work, Great Expectations, was published weekly from December 1, 1860 to August 3, 1861. This was his second semi-autobiographical work, but where David Copperfield was a confident expression of faith in middle class values, Great Expectations offers a bleaker view of whether those values will lead to happiness. In fact, Dickens own marriage had just come to an end after many unhappy years. Indeed he had recently changed the name of the magazine from the more bucolic Household Words. Despite, or because, of this ambivalence, Great Expectations became one of his greatest achievements.Pip, a boy of the marshes, is being &quot;raised by hand&quot; by his shrieking harridan of an older sister and her seemingly doltish husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery. One day, while visiting his parents' gravesite, Pip is accosted by an escaped convict who demands that he bring him a file and some &quot;wittles&quot;. When the convict, Abel Magwitch, is later captured, he accepts the blame for stealing the file and food before being carted back to prison.Shortly thereafter, Pip is invited up to Miss Havisham's manor house to play with her beautiful ward Estella. Miss Havisham's life came to a halt when she was jilted at the altar, all clocks are stopped at the hour of her betrayal, the feast lies rotting on tables &amp; she wanders about in the decaying wedding gown. Estella is to be the instrument of her revenge upon men.Eventually, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are settled upon Pip when a secret benefactor sets up a trust in his name and sends him to London to be educated and become a gentleman. Pip assumes, and Havisham allows him to believe, that she is his benefactress and that he is being elevated to a position that will make him worthy of Estella.As Pip rises in society, he leaves Joe behind, despite the many kindnesses Joe had shown him growing up. He becomes a shallow arrogant middle class climber. So he is stunned when he discovers that he is actually benefiting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems his debts and brings him home. Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together, that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love. But at the urging of others, he changed the ending and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her experiences and her wretched marriages.This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers. It has everything you could ask for in a novel: central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's in here. I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Now I'll admit that when all is said and done I am a newborn to the world of so called classic literature. So when I was assigned to read Great Expectations for English class, I'll admit to being a little more than skeptical. However once I began to read the novel I discovered something. The novel wasn't that hard to understand. While it did take a while to get fully immersed in the novel, once you were in you really wanted to see the novel to its resolution. The prose was easy to understand, and the plot crossed generations easily. Maybe classics just have a bad reputation with the younger generation, but Great Expectations went a long way to helping to shorten that gap. I think the driving force that leads me to recommend this book is the fact that we all have great expectations of life, and that we all dream of improving our status in the world. People will always share a common bond, and in this novel Dicken's truly shows us that."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This is one of my favorite Dickens books, detailing a lifelong love story between Pip and Estella. So sometimes the circumstances aren't realistic - so what? TV shows these days aren't either. Pip is a likeable character, and the various other characters represent real forces in our society. This is a great novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Each time that I read Great Expectations I'm left wondering whether or not Pip would have been happier if he had never been made the gift of \\"great expectations.\\" More importantly, would he have been a better man if he had remained apprenticed to his blacksmith brother-in-law Joe rather than having been sent to London to be trained in the ways of a gentleman?Great Expectations is a Dickens cautionary tale in which the author warns his readers of what can so easily happen to a person when given the opportunity to \\"better himself\\" by leaving his home, family and friends behind for education and fortune-seeking in the big city. As soon as word reached the local townspeople around whom Pip had spent his early years that a fortune was soon to be his, Pip found himself treated with respect and awe by the very people who had had little time for him in the past other than to chastise his behavior and relationship with the sister who was raising him \\"by hand.\\" Their \\"boy\\" became \\"sir\\" overnight it seemed.But sadly, after arriving in London and seeking to impress his new friends and colleagues, Pip decided that those who loved him most were an embarrassment to his future prospects and he only occasionally felt any guilt about his lack of contact with them. It is only when Pip's future prospects shockingly take a turn for the worse that he seeks the comfort of the family that he left behind.Along the way, Dickens fills Great Expectations with some of the most memorable characters in British literature history. There are Miss Havisham, the spinster who never recovered from being jilted at the altar; Joe, the blacksmith and Pip's brother-in-law who never stopped loving Pip as a son no matter how much Pip neglected him over the years; Estella, the beautiful young woman whom Pip has loved since they were small children but who has been raised by Miss Havisham to give her heart to no man; Herbert, Pip's best London friend, a truly good man who both benefits from Pip's help and who eventually offers Pip a new future of his own; and, of course, Magwitch, the colorful escaped criminal whom Pip meets in the first pages of the book.This is one of those books that I read every few years because re-reading it is like visiting an old friend after too long an absence. As the old memories come back, it's like I've never been away."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"First of all (as I like to say!) I'm no smarter than you and I thought this book was great, that said, this book is not THE easiest to read in that it does take a while for things to get really interesting. I rated it 5 stars because it is excellent but you need to have some patience with this book, in the end it is much worth the effort....and keep me updated!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I don't know what you guys are talking about. If you're a serious reader - and I expect you are if you willingly attempt this book - then there shouldn't be a problem getting into it. Dickens is far easier to read then Dostoevsky or Tolstoy or even Hawthorne or James.You have to understand that you can't skim the classics. If you do, then you miss out on subtle prompts and hints. In fact, any good book should have some buried clues, clues that if you don't pick up, the plot will be confusing or pointless. That's what makes these kinds of books great, the challenge and the reward, plus the wonders they do for your vocabulary.If you want books you can skim over before bedtime and still pick up the plot and characters, that's fine, not everyone needs to be a serious reader. However, don't go around bashing great books that you shouldn't be reading, because you might turn off somebody who will really enjoy it.If you have a real problem with the book, mention the plot, or accurately describe why you don't like the writing style."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great Expectations is truly one of Dickens' best works. It is long but there is so much to offer - rich, memorable characters, universal themes, exciting adventure, unrequited love, murder, mystery, and revenge. The plot touches heavily upon social class distinctions, education, economics and crime and punishment. Issues that still resonate with the modern reader today.Great Expectations, famously, begins in a cemetery where the orphaned Pip is visiting the graves of his parents. There he encounters an escaped convict from a nearby prison ship who is to change his life though Pip will not understand fully how until many years later. As the book continues he meets many surreal characters with perhaps the most memorable being Miss Havisham, the crazed jilted bride, whose manipulations in regard to Pip and her adopted daughter,Estella, break Pip's heart and leave Estella a shallow, empty woman. Another one of Dickens more famous characters appearing in Great Expectations is Pip's guardian, Jaggers, the successful and possibly compulsive obsessive, attorney. Less well known but equally memorable appearances are made by Pip's loyal friend Herbert Pocket whose unusual family provide comic relief and social satire, Pip's brother-in-law the kind but uneducated Joe Gargory, Mrs. Joe, Pip's shrewish sister who is raising Pip \\"by hand\\", Jagger's assistant Wemmick who neatly divides his home life and his work life plus a host of others. Life in 19th century England - both London and it's small towns - are masterfully kept alive by Dickens' sure contemporary descriptions."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"My first complete Dickens book was \\"A Tale of Two Cities.\\" Since that was an idealistic romance novel, this book rather surprised me with its portrayals of the darker side of human nature. Instead of heart-wrending sacrifices, I found painful ingratitude. Instead of perfect heroines, I found scheming, insensitive women. This book was not anything I expected with regards to characterization and theme. However, I would have to say this book exemplifies human nature much, much better. It was not a very entertaining read at all, but the craftsmanship and word employment simply could not be better. This book may not turn one's daydreams on paper, but it is a solid, landmark work of literature."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"My daughter had to read \\"Great Expectations\\" for 9th grade English,she was short of time and a slow reader. This unabridged version really filled the bill. She could listen while being otherwise engaged or read along with the book. The Actor/reader is the same one who read all of the Harry Potter books. Well read and helped keep her interest."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I wanted to revisit this \\"classic\\", having read it in high school and remembering it fondly. I was not disappointed, for I found the story more applicable to my life now, ten years later, than at the time of my first reading. Back then, it seemed a good yarn - lots of fun characters, intriguing plot twists - a grand adventure. Upon rereading, I was able to absorb the story while thinking about my own \\"coming of age\\", and weigh the morality of Pip's universe. At the same time, my original impressions were not misguided - the moral/societal questions Dickens explores are layered into the fun characters and strong plot development.In addition, there are some interesting \\"reading group\\" questions at the back, as well as some interesting commentary by various authors since the time of the original publication. For that reason, I would recommend this edition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Above all what I loved about this book was how all the characters came together and were somehow related in some surprising way. The book was very well written. I had to read this book for school and I'm glad that I was forced to or I might never have chosen to read this book. The language was very understandable unlike some other books I've read from that time period. I really recommend it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"One of the great novels in the English language. It would be presumptuous of me to add more.

Great novels should be spaced out in one's life and reread at specific junctures."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I got bogged-down fairly early in this book and almost decided to stop reading it. Fortunately for me, it soon re-kindled my interest (no pun intended), and only got better as it progressed. This was my first foray into Dickens, and if his other works are as entertaining as this one is, I anticipate a world of wonderful reading ahead. Be forewarned that some of this book's reviews give away too much of its plot (I made the mistake of reading them first). Do yourself a favor: Just trust that Dickens deserves his legend and dive-in. I can't imagine that this famous classic will disappoint you."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"The setting is good.

Of all the novels I've ever taught my students these 12 years I've been in Education, this novel, Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens, is by far the best! It is easy to read and understand, and it holds students' attention until the very end. The plot is like a roller coaster and all the characters seem to be connected in some way. The end of each chapter leaves the reader in suspense and anxious to continue reading. Although the setting of the novel takes place in 19th century England, the novel's themes and the characters' experiences seem to relate to all social classes, races, and both genders. Even my students at an inner-city high school in Atlanta rush home to read ahead to find out what will happen to Pip next!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Yet another success by Charles Dickens, this book is sure to warm hearts of both children and adults everywhere. This book is another classic, telling the great story of a once simple orphan boy named Pip.

If you want a cozy, enticing book to read by the fire on a snow day, go ahead, and read the powerful story: \\"Great Expectations.\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"\\"Great Expectations\\" by Charles Dickens is a very haunting novel. While the book portrays England as dreary, in a strange way it makes England seem like a nice place to live in. 1800s England as depicted in the novel has a lot of poor people. But the people seem nicer and more innocent minded then people are these days. Even the bad guys in the story seem more innocent minded then people these days.The book begins with a young child called Pip visiting his parents grave only to be stopped by an escaped convict who asks him for food and a file. Pip goes and gets these things secretly to avoid getting in trouble with his sister. Later on the convict is captured and before he is led away, he lies that he stole food from Pip's aunt's cupboard to Pip's uncle Joe and this saves Pip from getting in trouble for taking the food. After that, Pip gets a strange opportunity at a house called Satis House owned by a Miss Havisham. She pays his aunt to have Pip play with a beautiful girl called Estella. Later on, Pip is told by an aquaintance called Mr. Jagger that he has great expectations. He tells him that a secret benefactor has provided for Pip to be educated. Pip, jumps at this opportunity. He goes to live in a rented room and is educated all the time not knowing who is providing him with the sums to be educated. He continues to think about the beautiful girl Estella who shuns his advances.\\"Great Expectations is a very haunting novel. With the book, I got a full view of what life was like in England in the 1800s. The character Miss Havisham is really scary. Her house with its room where there is a decaying wedding cake is almost like a haunted house. The book contains no supernatural elements though and that's what is so amazing, that Charles Dickens manages to make it scary without putting ghosts or monsters in it. Miss Havisham was clearly a woman with a lot of potential who ruined her life because she couldn't get over a romance that went sour. I felt bad for her and hope people learn from her example.The character that really caught my attention was Estella. I have had experiences in my own life where I had a crush on a girl who didn't have a crush on me and so I knew what Pip was going through and related to his character in this respect. Its when they're young that men are haunted most by those feelings for a girl or a woman, it is clear though that Pip needs to move on and find another girl to get in a relationship with.All in all, Great Expectations is a good fast read even though it is not an adventure novel, which makes the novel even more amazing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Just a wonderful enthralling read!

It doesn't say anything about Pip suffering from depression, but I think he does, which contributes to his low self-esteem.Then at the back of the book, there is a section of notes, including the original ending.

It also would have helped if the author would have only given some of the characters one name instead of giving some people two names making it look like they were a completely different person, that was very confusing.It was good at the end when things finally started coming together and making a little more sense. One of my favorite parts was when Pip finally realizes that he is not meant to be a gentleman, and that he was meant to be a blacksmith. The major themes were the only thing that really helped me understand the book. I really didn&#65533;t like this book very much because I couldn&#65533;t really relate to it, therefore, I couldn&#65533;t understand it.

If you want to get the interesting part of the book, read the cliff's notes. I've also heard it's a little less mind-numbing on tape.

I really enjoyed the story, but I would raher just remember the story than refresh my memory by rereading it because, face it, the story is just too long!P.S.Since I feel this is such a great story, instead of reading the book, might I recommend watching the movie?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"In the first twenty or thirty pages, I was pleasantly surprised by Dickens's humor and had great expectations for his storytelling and prose-writing talent.I mean he is hailed as one of the greatest literary giants of English literature, as well as one of the most popular novelists of his time.But alas, my great expectations were dashed mercilessly, and I found myself - not unlike how Pip finds himself in the last portion of the novel - banging my head against the hard, boundless boredom that permeated the first 300 pages of non-drama, non-action, and non-story whose only saving grace was that it was not endless.In the beginning, Dickens sustains the story with action, and there's nothing wrong with that as it makes the story more engaging. But aside from that in the first interminable and insufferable two stages of \\"Pip's Great Expectations\\" that span exactly 300 pages, I was thoroughly disappointed in Dickens. Other than Pip getting rich all of a sudden, NOTHING happens: no desire, no real conflict, no gaps, no turning points.As far as the story is concerned, the 300 pages is crap.I said it. Don't gasp.The story finally, finally, finally picks up when Pip finds out the identity of his benefactor, goes through rather inexplicable mental ordeals about accepting the truth along with free money and sentimental outbursts with his \\"dear friend\\" Herbert about pretty much everything, followed by an incredibly maudlin confrontation with the guilt-stricken Ms. Havisham and a final showdown with the villainous Orlick into whose clutches Pip idiotically falls with a stupid letter that gives him little reason to risk the whole grand escape plan he and Herbert hatch for the next day.My conclusion: this book is overrated.Why is it that academics pick these boring books that can't tell stories as part of the western canon? I love reading classics, thanks, but THIS?The book displays a glaring lack of storytelling talent, psychological insight, and restraint. His prose is dense, sprawling, and unseemly as sentences are connected by ugly semicolons and don't flow beautifully at all. The scenes are more told than shown to the detriment of the flow of the story, and characters burst out into mawkish sentiments left and right.Yuck.People are irresistibly drawn to anything related to themselves. I have a sneaking suspicion that the academics who bill this book as \\"most fascinating\\" and \\"greatest and most sophisticated work\\" see THEIR prominent characteristic in it.Cloying, verbose, mediocre at best in the story composition, and irresistibly boring for the first 300 pages, it's \\"most fascinating\\" in the perplexing literary status it garnered over the years, \\"greatest\\" in its unnecessary length,and \\"most sophisticated\\" in the exquisite boredom it creates at that threshold pitch that is above sleep-inducing but below engaging.I won't be reading another Dickens in a long time.Read something else and save your time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I'm a senior in high school and was asked to read this book for my AP English 12 class.

That is not entirely true. I am in seventh grade. I not only loved the book, I understood it too. I have done character analyses (for instance: Bentley Drummle had a troubled childhood) and critisized Pip's character. My mom insists that he's a &quot;loser&quot; - but, then again, she never did have that much insight into character. The poor guy is in love so he can hardly see straight! Anyway, I don't pretend that I'm average, because I'm not. But I enjoyed it and understood it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"It's just too, too bad that no one reads this anymore. It is a timeless story of a young man (love-stricken from young childhood) growing to adulthood by means of a mysterious benefactor. Mr. Jaggers, John Wemmick, Biddy, Matthew and Belinda Pocket, Bentley Drummle, the Aged Parent, and Miss Skiffins are just a few of the absolutely marvelous characters that Dickens created for his story. And how could I forget Estella Havisham, the object of Pip's (christened Phillip) affection? Mr. and Mrs. Joe get a fair part of the story, and they are both delightful - one, because she is so horrible, and the other, because he is so good. A few of the more minor characters (the aformentioned Miss Skiffins is one) such as Trabbe's boy and The Avenger are superb even though they may only speak a few words. If I could give it ten stars, I would!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This is Dickens' 3rd last novel, and nothing indicates that he was running out of steam. While this lacks (in my opinion) the energy of &quot;Dombey and Son&quot; (1848), &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1850), &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1853), or &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1854), it is still a phenomenal piece of literature. Pip is an interesting creation. First we see him as a small child who is victimized by his sister. His brother in law Jo (while not too bright) never approves of Pip's abuse. It is interesting that Dickens wrote this troubled marriage scene soon after his own divorce! It is also painfully tragic when Pip starts to make his way into the world and he has to realize that the kind hearted but simple Jo has to take a back seat to his success. Jaggers offers some welcome comical touches. It is interesting that Pip becomes victimized by a legitimate colleague Orlick and as it turns out, the old thief was his benefactor. (In my opinion the old thief was a literary reincarnation of Fagin.) To this day, I have never forgotten the chills when I discovered that the old thief in the early part of the novel was his benefactor. So we have domestic quarrles, true to life tragic events, strong images, comical touches, and surprise events!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I reallly liked this book, though it made me tired to read it and I could not have any distractions while I read, I am really glad I did. This book was a good challenge if you stick to it. The book all comes together at the end if you keep reading. The characters are really deep. My teacher says the best thing about Great Expectations is it has a twisted plot line and the worst thing about Great Expectations is that it has a twisted plot line. Overall, I enjoyed the book, except the last two chapters. I believe Dickens got tired of writing the book and desided to end the book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This book is superb. Everything about it is very real to life (unlike much of Dickens' other novels). Though it may be hard to comprehend, it doesn't take a genius to understand the themes of this book.

I also recommend Catcher in the Rye if you're into the types of books that make you stop and ponder."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I had to read Great Expectetions for school, at first it seemed like the worst book ever written, it was boring, confusing, and seemingly pointless. But, of course that was before I finished it and fully understood what Dickens was tying to convey. the whole book is a mystery, only in the very end do you finally find everything out. Note: if you are going to read the Cliffs Note version of the book (which i highly recommend you do) do not read the character summaries, because that will kill the whole book for you. Believe it or not, this is probabaly the only classial book with enough suspense to compete with the modern thrillers.

However, it is far too good to heap words like &quot;boring&quot; upon simply because it is long and involved. The autobiographical narration lends it a personal quality far more appealing than that of A Tale of Two Cities, and above all Dicken's empathy for his characters is apparent. The branching subplots weave together seamlessly as the novel progresses (Unlike some people I'm not going to spoil the ending for everyone). Even if you've been turned off by Dicken's before, give it a chance."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Another reviewer claims that you have to be at least 21 years old to read this book. Although I don't think it should be \\"forced\\" on schoolchildren (they will only hate it) I read this novel when I was a child and I loved it. I have just re-read it now and I enjoy it all the more. This is my favorite novel by Dickens. It is from his later period and is criticized for being too dark - which, however, makes it more perfect for today's sensibilities. Stephen King cites this work as one of his favorites: he believes that it is this book that brought the gothic novel mainstream.Was there ever a novelist who created more memorable characters than Dickens? Here, we meet perhaps his most intriguing - Miss Havisham. For anyone unfamiliar with the story, I will not spoil it by describing her. The story is similar to parable about the prodigal son - good Pip inexplicably comes into some money and goes off to the corrupting city.AN IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE: Dickens wrote two ending for this book. His friends thought that the original ending was too downbeat and they asked him to come up with a different one. It is the upbeat ending that is the official ending of the novel. However, most critics agree that the original unpublished ending is better. Most modern editions feature the unpublished ending in an appendix. MAKE SURE YOU BUY A COPY THAT CONTAINS THE ORIGINAL ENDING!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great Expectations is one of Dickens's later novels, a work of his artistic maturity. The narrative is symbolic rather than realistic. Although, as in most of Dickens and in Victorian literature in general, the plot relies heavily on coincidence, it is acceptable here because the events are true to the internal, psychological, logic of the story.After writing A Tale of Two Cities, which was unique among his novels in that it had none of his trademark humor, Dickens set out to make Great Expectations rich in comic elements. This despite, or perhaps because of, being in a depressed state of mind himself at the time. The conventional critical view is that he largely failed in this attempt, but I strongly disagree. The book is hilariously funny in parts and the main character, Pip, exhibits a characteristically British humour-in-adversity throughout his adventures. There is also the host of minor comic characters that we expect from Dickens. And he for once manages pathos without spilling over into bathos, so there are tears as well as laughter here, sometimes both at once.If you have not yet read any Dickens, this is not a bad book with which to start, although for younger readers (teens) I would recommend Hard Times or A Tale of Two Cities as their first. Great Expectations demands a mature sensibility to appreciate its symbolism and psychological depth. Perhaps because it chiefly concerns the childhood and youth of the protagonist, it is often given to young people to read and is a set text in some High School classes. This is a pity because, in its dark complexity, it is more likely to turn youngsters off, rather than onto, Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I've never read any Dickens of my own free will. I was forced to read &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; in high school and I thought that was enough for me. However, one day, on a whim, I bought a copy of Great Expectations. I'm not sure what I expected, but I certainly didn't expect to love it as much as I did.Dickens is not a writer to read at a swift pace. Indeed, this novel was written in weekly episodes from December 1860 to August 1861 and, as it was created to be a serial, each installment is full of varied characters, great descriptions and a lot of action which moves the plot along and leaves the reader yearning for more. Therefore, unlike some books which are easily forgotten if I put them down for a few days, Great Expectations seemed to stick around, absorbing my thoughts in a way that I looked forward to picking it up again. It took me more than a month to read and I savored every morsel.Basically the story is of the self-development of Pip, an orphan boy being raised by his sister and her blacksmith husband in the marshlands of England in 1820.Every one of the characters were so deeply developed that I felt I was personally acquainted with each one of them. There was Pip's roommate, Herbert Pocket, the lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, and his clerk, Mr. Wemmick. And then there was the wicked Orlick. The dialogues were wonderful. The characters often didn't actually say what they meant but spoke in a way that even though the words might be obtuse, there was no mistaking their meaning. I found myself smiling at all these verbal contortions.Dickens' work is richly detailed and he explores the nuances of human behavior. I enjoyed wallowing in the long sentences and letting myself travel backwards in time to a different world. However, even with the footnotes, I found myself sometimes confused by the British slang of 150 years ago, and there were several passages I had to read over several times in order to get the true meaning. Of course I was not in a particular rush. I didn't have to make a report to a class or take a exam about the book. This is certainly a pleasure.I heartily recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good read.ting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems his debts and brings him home. Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together, that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love. But at the urging of others, he changed the ending and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her experiences and her wretched marriages.This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers. It has everything you could ask for in a novel: central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's in here. I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This review refers to the audio(CD - Brilliance Audio) edition of \\"Great Expectations\\" by Charles Dickens, read by Michael PageThis unabridged audio edition of Dickens' classic superb chronology of \\"Pip's' journey through life going from a poor boy to becoming a man with \\"expectations\\" is simply marvelous. As Pip comes into a small fortune, and becomes a \\"gentleman\\" he learns the value and true meaning of friendships and life. But the journey is a long one, with many lessons to be learned along the way before he can find his true self. Dickens has given us a wonderful story, with rich details of the setting and characters that grow and are among the most interesting and magnetic to be found in literature.I don't need to go on and on about the book itself(although I could easily go over my allotted word count here), if you haven't read it yet ,just know you are in for one heck of a literary treat. It is a story that will transport you to another time and place, and you may not want to come back. I will however, talk about this marvelous audio edition. Michael Page is the reader, and what a reading he gives. Just curl up and listen to this master storyteller. Every voice, every nuance is captured. There is no doubt who is speaking as he gives each character the personality and cultural characteristics as Dickens intended. He even does the women wonderfully, without going over the top. In my mind Miss Havisham has always sounded just the way Page portrayed her, Estella as uppity as ever,the humble Joe, along with all the rest.The book is an unabridged reading on 16 discs. each discs has 90 very short tracks(about 45 seconds each), I had no trouble starting up where I left off(when I absolutely had to leave off). I just made a mental note(or you could even write it down) of the track number and disc where I stopped it. The sound quality is excellent, and total running time is about 20 hours. Each disc is in it's own paper CD holder with a clear front so you can see the disc number you are looking for.If you are a fan of this book, this audio edition will give you a fresh read and new appreciation of this fascinating book. If you are experiencing it for the first time, you can't help but to become enthralled. Great to take on long drives or for younger readers to be introduced to classic literature in a most entertaining way.Enjoy the read...for the 1st Time or the 50th time!....Lauriemore great audio reads:A Christmas Carolread by Geoffrey Palmer-Carrie(read by Sissy Spacek)Back When We Were Grownups(read by Blair Brown)The Shipping News(read by Paul Hecht)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I love this book! This is one of my all-time favorite books ever. I had to read it eons ago when I was in ninth grade, and now (14 years later) I am still enjoying it. Every few years I take this one down from my bookshelf to revisit. This is the story of Pip, a small orphaned boy living in poverty in the English countryside with his much older sister and her husband. Pip meets a convict in a graveyard one damp morning and helps him out in the form of some vittles and an iron file. Later in the story, Pip moves from poverty to being a &quot;gentleman&quot; due to the influence of a mysterious, anonymous benefactor. This book tells of his adventures and how Pip's expectations guide him through life. Towards the end of the story, Pip finds out that reality is sometimes very different from what we expect it to be. The characters are what really make this book stand out. Charles Dickens is a master of character development, and his descriptions of Miss Havisham, Wemmick, Joe, and the others is brilliant! The dialogue is great, with the words written the way a commoner would have spoken in England in the 1800's. Another thing I really liked was how all of the characters are inter-related to each other in ways that you may not discover until you get to the end of the novel.This novel will make you laugh and it might make you sad, but it is always entertaining. If you are in high school and reading this book for the first time for English class, keep at it! It may seem difficult at first if you are not used to Dickens, but this book is well worth it! It is truly a gem."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This book is not the full version, despite the length. There's no indication of this until you get inside the book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Charles Dickens's acknowledged masterpiece, Great Expectations, is rightly considered one of the greatest novels of all-time. It depth and breadth are staggering, as it follows its protagonist, Pip, from his early childhood through his later life. During the course of his life, we encounter a vast catalog of raw human emotions: love, hate, jealousy, hope, sadness, despair, anger, pity, empathy, sympathy -- and on and on. The story is treasured and revered for many reasons. One of its main strengths is its plot: after a somewhat slow introductory section, Dickens puts his story in fifth gear and delivers a fast-paced and exciting story that gallops along without ever losing interest or clarity. The incredibly complex plotline, full of separate stories and incidents that seem totally unrelated to each other, but are then all harnessed together as the book heads straight toward its denouement, is also full of constant plot twists, which continue up until, literally, the last paragraph. But, of course, as with all of Dickens's major works, it is the characters that make the book. Like Shakespeare, Dickens preferred to have the story develop through the characters, rather than having the characters be mere set pieces inside of an overriding story. And what great characters they are: the perennially paradoxical but essentially human Pip; the bitter and mysterious Miss Havisham; the beautiful and haughty Estella; the simple and saint-like Joe; the kind and benevolent Herbert; the very human convict, Magwitch -- and all of the other wonderful characters. Dickens excelled in creating well-rounded, very human characters who harbored very real and very complex emotions -- that is, human emotions. We identify with Pip as he winds through his life, because we have been there, too -- the disappointments, the surprises, the loves, the anger, the sadness. In whatever way his story may differ from our own, it is still essentially human, as is ours. For all of his complex and paradoxical emotions and sentiments, Pip is a recognizably human character -- and that is why we love him and this book. A masterpiece for the ages, which will endure for years yet to come, Great Expectations is a great book that can be loved by one and all, for, at its heart, is that grain of simple truth that says so much about what is human in all of us -- whether we have great expectations or not."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"The description of Miss Havisham & her home alone is worth two to three stars. This is unlike any other book in the English language, with the possible exception of Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights?\\" Dickens tells us many things in the begining of the novel that appear out of place or irrelevant, but later those pieces fall into place so that the big picture is revealed.This story runs the gamut of emotions for the reader. Shock, empathy, joy, disappointment, & disdain are all there for the various characters at different times. Multiple plots, detailed descriptions, & ever mutable characters made this a long & entertaining read. This is the story of Phillip Pirrup or Pip. He is a true hardluck case that you root for. His family except for a brother & sister have all passed away. He lives with his sister{a husband beater} & brother in law Joe Gargery in a tiny English village. Oddly for this era, this is one of the few books where fear from a man's perspective is explored. That in itself was refreshing. Along the roller coaster life that Pip finds himself on he meets enigmatic people & gets an anonymous benefactor who helps him reach London to start a better life? Once there life & the nature of Pip himself is radically altered. This is when the title of my review becomes clear.

Then I began to read that first chapter about a boy named Pip who meets the convict looking for vittles.I won't give anything away about the plot. I only want to say that this was the first book that I ever read that I had me truly absorbed. I remember a kid in my class who read ahead a few chapters and had us all in wonder as to what twists transpired. He just smiled and said, &quot;you won't believe how this thing turns out.&quot;After reading other Dickens books I realized that his greatest strengths was populating his books with amazing, odd, likeable, and despicable characters who found there way in and out of his stories.If you haven't read this book, do so."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I got the &quot;cover-to-cover&quot; book on tape for a long road trip, never having heard the story before.

Most of the bad reviews this book gets are from young people who were forced to read it for a class. When taken at one's own leisure, and in one's own time, it is quite entertaining. I'm not sure that the teachers who assign the book are pointing out all the things that make the book great, such as Dickens's flair with the language, the point he's making about a society that places birth above worth, and his ability to make abstract arguments that enhance the story.

Even with Dickens' extremely long r&eacute;sum&eacute; of books Great Expectations maybe the only one read by younger readers because the other are usually mature plots or have extreme length. But, Great Expectations is a \\"great\\" exception.Charles Dickens used a very eloquent vocabulary. His absolute mastery of English makes his book interesting yet difficult to read. Terminology has changed since he wrote the novel, and, in addition to the evolution the language, Dickens was British. This fact changed his wording from typical American English and helped the book be more in character. Dickens also exercises his talent for manipulating words and creating vivid word pictures like these sentences, \\"Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite art of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt itself,\\" and \\"It was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind blows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade.\\" These brilliant word pictures make the book a bear to read when quickly read but also makes it brilliantly fascinating when soaked in and read slowly. In short Dickens has the entire language in his hands and works it masterfully into a brilliant weaving of plot.Dickens also knew how to capture his audience. He used a fantastic plot that wove in and out. Even though his plot was almost cheesy, he managed to pull it off without to much \\"cheese\\" suspected. Though I thought this book had too many climaxes, if you think about its original form - serial - then you understand that he had to keep his readers interested. Dickens keeps the plot \\"writhing\\" until the very end where he had a most expected and cheesy ending. The ending seemed rushed and scrambled together. Out of the whole book spanning thirty some years the last eleven are on the last five pages. The plot as a whole was very good. The plot moved the characters along and changed them to be what they are at the end. The characters grew as you read it not only in age but in emotion and focus.Dickens characters are amazing. He captures a lot of emotions and kinds of people in one book. He grasps a boy's changing thoughts until he grows to be a man. The innocent, childish fears of Pip are so easily grasped, and Pip's relations with Miss Havisham completely change him into a self-centered man trying to woo and unlovable woman. He also shows the starkness of humanity when exploited by its own race. Even some of the lesser characters still show the variety of human expression like Joe's nobleness and Wemmick's eccentricism. In all the characters were amazing.As a whole the book is a masterpiece and classic for all generations. Great Expectations will always be close to my heart."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"First of all, in reference to the reviewer who seemed to think the title was inapropos, all I can say is that I hope that they didn't read the book, for such a lack of understanding would be pathetic. I digress. I am here to dispel some myths. Since this book is often assigned in school, and perceived as \\"important,\\" as another reviewer noted, I think a lot of people shy away from it and assume it will be boring or difficult to understand. Dickens' novels, however, work on multiple level. There certainly is important social criticism and a web of subtly laced motifs within this novel, but on the surface, it's just a good read. I read it on a whim and ended up staying up all night to finish it. So, don't dispel this novel and turn to the many vapid works available to you. One piece of advice, read the real ending before the changed ending (though the changed one will appear first). I felt that the original one was far better, more relevant, and sadly invalidated by the changed ending thrust upon me first. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great expectation was a wonderful classic written by the author Charles dickens. The main character, Pip, grow up in the home of a blacksmith. With both of his parents dead, He lives with his older sister and her husband named Joe. Pip soon meets Miss Havisham and the beautiful Estella that live wish her Pip hoped that Miss Havisham intentions were to make his fortune, make him a gentleman and have Estella to wed. He was wrong, because the social class division leaves Pip a worker, and Estella was a lady. After disappointment, Pip hears news that a secrete benefactor want to make Pip a gentleman and give him a fortune and informs him that he is a man of great expectation. Pip has no idea of who is benefactor is, but heads to London to start his eventful life as a gentleman. Even if Pip work hard for his life but he is getting on well finally.It is a very powerful book that connects with people s live all over. Great expectation is an amazing book in many ways such as the themes, the Character and the writing Themes in this book are very important. They can easily relate to us today. The main point of the book is affection, loyalty and gratitude and friendship are more important than social class, wealth. The Character of Pip made me feel quit e sad. He had a very difficult life but he can improve him self and become a gentleman finally. There are many character of this book. That also made this book very interesting follow"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Probably one of the most memorable Dickens characters, Philip Pirrup is known to most readers as Pip, the 7-year-old boy whom his short-tempered sister raised by hand. Little Pip infers that he has sustained, from as early as his babyhood, a perpetual conflict with injustice. He has known, from the time when he can speak and discern his surrounding that his sister, in her fits of caprice and violent coercion, is unjust to him. It seems to poor Pip that all the endearments in life brushes by him or bypasses him altogether. Fate has ineluctably deprived him of the lightsome hours that make our childhood a time to be remembered like a happy dream through all our after life. The bright side of growing up with his sister's fits of spleen is Pip's friendship with his brother-in-law Joe, who not only has taken him into apprenticeship but sanctified the house Pip calls home that is otherwise sullied by his sister's temper.A chance but terrifying encounter with an escaped convict for whom he brings provisions pilfered from the kitchen cupboard changes the entire course Pip's life. But it is not until he meets the beautiful, cold-hearted and haughty Estella during a summon to a decaying Miss Havisham that he sets his mind to whittle away his coarseness and to become a gentleman, one on Estella's account. The sudden but timely generosity of a mysterious benefactor comes to assist his making of a gentleman and promises a handsome property. The prospect of great expectations not only immediately relieves him from his ordinary sphere of life and frees him from apprenticeship with Joe, but also concurs with his eagerness to abandon his humble origins.GREAT EXPECTATIONS thus follows Pip's new life under his fortune and depicts his education, new relationships, and development through adversity as he slowly dawns on the true nature of his great expectations. The new life does not come without a catch as he finds himself living in a state of chronic uneasiness respecting his perfidious behavior to Joe, whose interference in his life he now regards as disturbance. The more Pip basks in the favor, privilege, and conviviality that is concomitant of his fortune, the more his is convinced of a happier life derived from simplicity and fidelity that only Joe can offer. As he sidles closer to the truth about his benefactor's identity, a revelation for which he is not prepared struck him.GREAT EXPECTATIONS is a story of moral redemption with a prodigal son-like protagonist in the orphaned Pip. The tale is extremely straightforward but is woven with substantial issues he has to deal with. Eager to shred his humble roots, he promptly disavows family and friends at the prospect of a fortune. As the fortune loses its luster and eventually dissipates altogether, he confronts his own ingratitude and learns to love the man who both creates and destroys him, figuratively speaking. Dickens deftly validates Pip's redemption by showing that it produces good deeds as well as good works. This is especially worthy of merit because the novel is told in Pip's first person narrative. Mishandling of the narrative might render the whole tale unconvincing.The proof of Pip's redemption comes laden with good deeds rather than airy words: his clandestine acts of kindness in securing Herbert a partnership in business, and in securing Miss Havisham's respectable opinion of the long-suffering Matthew Pocket, and in his refusing to accept money from Miss Havisham, and most significantly in his love for the man whom has bequeathed him with the fortune."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This book was reccomended to me by my mom for me to expand my reading tastes. I was maybe a little hesitant, but I began reading it, and was immediately pulled in by the compelling, quirky characters and the mind boggling plot. Each new character is equally amusing, and their names seem to depict their nature. When I first saw Uncle Pumblechook's name, I was immediately able to guess what sort of a person he was, same with Mr. Wopsle, Mr. Wemmick, Mrs. Joe Gargery, and more. The humor is subtle, but once you get the joke you'll be howling.However, Dickens is certainly not an author who says little when there is an opportunity to say more; in a nutshell, his writing is quite flourid. Ten pages can be a whole lot to get through, not because it is boring, but because it is full of complex words, sentences, and paragraphs, that you'll need a little bit of rest. I felt sometimes like reading it was like an excercise seminar for my mind. But don't let these few words discourage you, it's a great read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"...endless is the error of intimacy.Such is the story of &quot;Great Expectations.&quot; I have to say that Dickens totally floored me with this magical tale of love and pedestals. I don't even know what made me read it. I think I just found it in my mother's house amid throwaways in the attic. Oh no...this is NOT to be thrown away, this treasure of English literature. This is the reason why we read.Pip is an orphan with no prospects in sight. But one day, under the strangest of circumstances, he becomes the veritable ward of an unknown benefactor and hurtles toward the gentlemanly future of high living and culture. Along the way, he is placed in the almost daily charge of the bitter and rich shut-in Miss Havisham, guardian of the irresistable, yet bitchy Estella. Poor Pip spends a great deal of his days partaking in the education of a gentleman, doing the bidding of the witchy Havisham woman and pining after the girl who uses and abuses him. It sometimes seems like this high society training is a big freakin' mistake.Things heat up when he comes across the criminal Magwitch and doesn't turn him in to the authorities. From there on in the piece continues to fill the mind with limitless imagery. The writing style is a beaut and the characters continue to intrigue with every passing page, from the disgustingly prunish Miss Havisham to Pip's dim-witted, but thoroughly likeable father - a man he sadly comes to see as shameful as his education and training strengthens.This is a story of yearning and loss, guilt and foolish pride as one person after another gets a wish granted and regrets it or waits for a train that never comes in. Yet somehow the ending leaves behind a great feeling. This is among my favorite books ever."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I may be only a 6th grader, but you wouldn't believe how much I enjoyed this book. Charles Dickens having a poor childhood because of the little money his family earned, has written a miraculous book having to do with money. Charles Dickens makes his case for there being a potential for good and evil in everyone. I really enjoyed reading this book and if you are looking for a fabulous book to enjoy, I strongly reccomend you read this."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I love the cover of this edition. The painting seems almost perfect for Dickens novel.But on to the novel itself. \\"Great Expectations\\" was the first of Dickens' novels that I read and I had to read several more before I found another I liked anywhere near as much. It is a small work compared to \\"David Copperfield\\" and his other massive English comic novels. It is a much darker work, too with less of the comedic touch.Dickens published and/or edited several magazines and some of his novels were first written as serials to bolster flagging circulation, \\"Great Expectations\\" is one and it shows. The novel grabs you fast and has a story with many surprises and twists along the way. The one drawback to the earlier serializaztion is that the book probably has too many small climaxes and cliffhangersLike many of the other great novels of the 18th and 19th century a modern reader may well find it a little too full of long descriptive passages. I personally feel that it travels along fast enough that you won't notice.I feel a word or two may be necessary about coincidence in the novel, certainly some other reviewers here at Amazon have felt there was too much. The first thing that should be said is that Dickens readers would not have criticised the coincidence, at the time they had a much firmer belief in \\"fate\\" and would have felt that the coincidence showed how much of Pip's tale was fated to be. The other thing worth mentioning is that the coincidence is no less than one can find in quite a lot of modern television if you just explain the plot. We need to ask if the number of coincidences seems unnatural within the book and if the book works. My answer would be that this tale runs along at a fine pace, well written and well worth the read. The coincidence does not detract from the novel.I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants a good, classic read. As one of Dickens shorter works it is also a fine place to start."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"As a student, I had to read this book as a requirement for my junior year summer reading. Being the largest book of them all, I reluctantly started on this one. However, after giving it the twenty-five page test, I found the book terribly addictive. Had I had a more generous time budget, I would have finished the book in two to three days. As it was, it took me over a month. The storyline, with Pip intertwined in a weird emotional triangle with one Miss Havisham and Estella, has the reader wondering &quot;Who is on Pip's side?&quot; and &quot;What the heck is going on with this Estella babe?&quot; The emotions Pip felt, the things he went through, and just the thought of actually having to go through what he did brings tears to the eyes (even mine, which had been dry for years). By reading this book, I even became more in-tune to my emotions. This novel is an excellent piece of literature for any language buff (Dickens is a sheer master of the English language), and for anyone who loves a good tearjerker. Happy reading!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great Expectations is one of the most absorbing novels I have ever read. It is also the best. The plot is complex and exciting, sometimes very funny and sometimes almost unbearably sad, with so many plot twists it is impossible to lose interest. The writing and descriptions are...well they're Dickens': always brilliant and powerful. And the characters in Great Expecations, Pip, Uncle Pumblechook, Miss Havisham, Mr. Jaggers, etc., are colorful and original, and complex and lively. Great Expectations has the suspense of any of today's thrillers (during the last fifty pages I could not put it down) and a wonderful message: that your social standing does not determine what kind of a person you are; aristocracy isn't all it's cracked up to be; what you really need in life are good friends and people that care about you. Great Expectations is a masterpiece of the first order. I cannot stress enough how much I enjoyed it. It is most assuredly a book I will keep reading again and again throughout my life."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"When reading this book in high school, I considered myself very fortunate that the copies we had contained the original ending. It was placed at the end, after the ending that was originally published. I much preferred the original ending from the momentI read it, and have since checked every copy I have come across to see if it is in them. Sadly, often it is not.The kindle edition does not contain the original ending. I did not see any reviews of this edition that mentioned it, so I thought I would post one for anyone else who finds that important, as I do."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"GREAT EXPECTATIONS is often the novel used in high schools to introduce students to Dickens. Due to it's length and fairly long and uneventful middle phase, I'm not sure it's the best text to introduce people to Dickens. Still, it is a pretty good story and contains some of the most memorable characters in Dickens' fiction.GREAT EXPECTATIONS is the story of Phillip Pirrip, otherwise known as Pip. Pip's parents die not long after he is born and he is raised &quot;by hand&quot; by his sister. His brother-in-law, Joe Gargery, is the town blacksmith and loves Pip. The two are best-of-friends. One night while looking at his parents' graves, Pip meets a convict and his life is forever changed by that meeting. As the novel progresses, Pip meets Miss Havisham (the wealthiest woman in town) and her beautiful ward, Estella. Pip immediately falls in love with Estella and is haunted by her all the days of his life. Eventually Pip is bond to Joe as his apprentice and sets to work in the blacksmith forge. Several years later, Pip's luck changes when he is informed by a lawyer from London, Mr. Jaggers, that he has become the recipient of &quot;great expectations&quot;. The book then follows Pip's life as he enters this new stage in life and as he develops and becomes a &quot;gentleman&quot;. Everything is brought full circle and just about everyone gets what they deserve by the time the novel ends.GREAT EXPECTATIONS isn't the easiest of books to read. What many writers can do in a sentence often takes Dickens two pages to tell. Also, the book is divided into three phases and the second phase is rather boring (except at the end) and really does nothing more than to fill in a few plot gaps and illustrate to us how much of a prig Pip becomes. Nevertheless, GREAT EXPECTATIONS is still a good story containing some very vivid characters: Pip, Estella, Joe, Miss Havisham, Magwitch, Jaggers, and Wemmick. The characters in GREAT EXPECTATIONS are as memorable as anyone in DAVID COPPERFIELD, OLIVER TWIST, or A CHRISTMAS CAROL. The first phase of the book is quite interesting and sets up everything that later occurs in the novel. The third part of the novel is full of excitement and contains Pip's repentance and reformation. Overall, it's a great book and even though it was written over a hundred years ago, it has a lot to say about the society in which we live today."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I first read this book when I was in eighth grade. Ever since then, I have been going back to it because even though I know how the events will eventually turn out, this book always retains the magic touch to entertain and keep one hoping that the main character Pip will live a happy life.Upon reading the first page, the reader is drawn into a world of mystery and suspense. The reader is whisked into an English cemetry from olden times and what draws the reader further is the presence of a little boy crying, afraid of the eerie atmosphere. To make matters worse, a very strange looking man appears to frighten the little boy even further. The suspense just begins.As if this wasn't enough for the little boy crying in the cemetry, Pip goes on to face even more difficulties in life. Pip meets with the strange Miss Havisham who forever wears her white wedding gownn. Pip feels forever alienated by the proud Estella, whom he has fallen in love with. The problem is --- Estella doesn't seem to care at all. To her, Pip is a poor, common boy.Excitement builds up as Pip is granted the chance to become a gentleman with prosperity. Will Estella care about him now? Will Pip remain the same kind-hearted young man he was when he was poor or will he change?Even though I have long found the &quot;answers&quot; (there are two different endings in the orginal) I am still amazed at how Dickens creates fascinating characters and fills his novels with mystery, suspense and romance."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"As an English teacher, I purchased the collection to use in my classroom.

This is a story about growing up and learning what is important in life. It is full of Dickens' excellent descriptions and characters and their relationships.If you like any Dickens story you will like this one as well. If you have never read Dickens, you should.For Kindle owners. I only saw two errors. Both words probably had accents on characters as missing characters appeared as question marks (?), so I am not positive what the words actually were (one was French) and to be honest, I never bothered to look them up.

I only wish I could find the crappy, soulless joke of a book report I regurgitated from Cliff's Notes to please my teacher and get that all-important \\"A.\\" Suffice to say that if I found it I would not post it here.Having re-read the book, I now can say with certainty that Dickens is a brilliant writer and storyteller. His use of language is phenomenal, and his characters tell a deep emotional tale. I suspect it is the tale of Dickens' own childhood dilemma: an emotionally abandoned boy seeking greatness and knowing at some level that he was born for it---and that fate somehow picked him out for it.Pip is a multidimensional character, with hopes and charm and honesty and flaws. He is utterly sympathetic, as I'm sure little Charles Dickens once was himself.Pip, an abused and undefended boy, is picked out rather randomly by a near stranger (seemingly the idealized parent for whom every child secretly hopes) to become a gentleman---to rise above the meagre expectations for which his limited birth has chosen him. Even his closest childhood ally, Joe the blacksmith, does nothing (read that: nothing) to defend him against Joe's abusive wife, Pip's older sister. To Dickens' discredit, I felt that he over-defended Joe's weakness as a non-defender. But, by the same token, Dickens' rendering of Joe's all-too-realistic weakness is quite honest and common: after all, so few adults really do stick their necks out to defend the child. I am only left to suspect that in Dickens' own childhood none did either. I would guess that like Pip, Dickens was surrounded entirely by adults who were weak, sadistic, self-centered, or manipulative. My guess is that only his talent, hard word, and patience allowed him to rise above.My only real criticism of the book (and it's not a big one) comes near the end, when Pip tries to help Magwitch escape England and thus find safety. Granted, Dickens' treatment of this situation does assist the flow of the novel, and does allow him to show just how much Pip has grown to care for his benefactor, but it still left me shaking my head. (And I'm not spoiling the plot, because in the version I read the editor's footnotes spoil the plot anyway early on in the reading, as clearly the editor assumes that the reader knows the story beforehand. Then again, maybe the editor is spoiling the plot to give himself some power. I felt some of his footnotes, which are otherwise quite helpful for background, suggest that he was in an annoying sort of competition with Dickens to show his own greatness.)So although the plot device works for Dickens' purpose, it just didn't strike me as sufficiently realistic to keep my disbelief suspended. My reason: Magwitch is a hardy, intelligent, cunning world traveler, who suddenly, for no good enough reason, puts all his trust for escape from England (and thus his life) into the hands of a complete novice, Pip, who creates a foolhardy plan for escape that ends up getting Magwitch captured and sentenced to death.In reality, given what Dickens' shows us about Magwitch's character, here's what I think would have really happened had Magwitch heard Pip's plan:Magwitch: \\"Pip, thank you for creating a plan to rescue me, but I think I'll pass. I'll go off into the night on my own, and leave England the same way I came to it: on my own.\\"Magwitch would have traveled onward with less hurrah, more stealth, and far more privacy. And as the result he would have likely left England safe and sound, and continued to keep up his benefactor relationship with Pip.But that wouldn't have suited Dickens' purposes for the plot, so the more realistic ending was avoided.That said, the book was still great. I couldn't put it down. Kudos to Dickens! And to hell with my high school teacher for nearly ruining my regard for this great writer."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"From start to finish, awesome.

The story is narrated by Pip, brought up by hand by his sister, Mrs Joe Gargery, commanded to attend Miss Havisham, jilted bride now in decay, where he falls in love with the beautiful Estella and decides he wants to be a gentleman. Eventually, apprenticed to Joe Gargery, blacksmith, he comes into a fortune, and is convinced his benefactor is Miss Havisham, intending him to become a gentleman so he can marry Estella. Miss Havisham's intentions for Estella, of course, differ markedly from this. Dickens includes a rich cast of characters: the guilty and regretful Pip; the cold and cruel Estella; the warm Herbert and Clara; the kind-hearted and faithful Joe and Biddy; the capable Jaggers; the split-personality Wemmick; the nasty Orlick; the single-minded Magwitch. Great Expectations is a much easier and funnier read than the only other Dickens book I can remember reading, and this books immediate predecessor, A Tale of Two Cities, and I noted the echo of the knitting women at the gallows in Estella's actions.

In my opinion, GE is a glorious (not glorified) soap opera chronicling the wildly fluctuating vicissitudes of Philip Pirrip's (Pip's) eventful life, from an orphaned, tormented child apprenticed to genial blacksmith Joe to, by a turn of ironic fate, a wealthy \\"gentleman\\" of leisure. As been often noted, Dickens created worlds, if not universes, in his novels, and GE is certainly no exception. In this review, I will try to avoid detailing the plot, which is already well-known. Instead, I will comment upon Dickens's use of backstory and flashback to flesh out most of the major characters in the novel.Even the most colorful, flamboyant characters in GE are not one-dimensional or stereotypically good or evil. We learn how Miss Havisham's marital jilting by Arthur compelled her to become a spectral recluse in her gloomy estate. We learn how Miss Havisham's misanthropic upbringing caused her frosty ward Estella (whose name suggests a blazing but distant star) to become an inaccessible man-hater. We learn how Magwitch, Pip's surprising benefactor, became a convict through cynical ad hominem prosecution in the barbaric English court system, was transported to the penal colony that was Australia, and how he acquired the money through hardship just to help the orphan Pip, who showed him mercy at the graveyard, and why he risked arrest in London to see his gentleman. We learn that Estella's mother, servant to Mr. Jaggers the lawyer, was convicted of murder but saved, after a fashion, by the lawyer and how she had to sacrifice her daughter so that she could become a lady. We even learn about the somewhat schizophrenic Wemmick, Jagger's clerk, who is sullen and joyless at work but positively animated and exuberant when he is at home (The Castle) with his elderly invalid father The Aged. Through these backstories, we find out that no Dickensian character is ultimately utterly despicable, or demonic, or flawless, or saintly. They are all achingly human, trying to live life the best they can.Since GE is primarily about the growth and development of Pip, we witness his human complexity most of all. In a paraphrase of a comment made by his friend Herbert, Pip is intelligent and naive, curious and hesitant, loyal and perfidious, snobbish but introspective, a false gentleman (through wealth) and a true gentleman (through re-discovered contrition, feeling, and love). Dickens's revelation of the humanity that still lurks in the most wretched of us is encapsulated nicely by Pip's caretaker and brother-in-law, the brawny but forgiving Joe, who says about his abusive father, \\"Whatsumever the failings on his part, dear reader, remember that he was that good in his heart\\". This noble, some may say Christian, sentiment, elevates GE beyond its busy, coincidental melodramatic soap opera plottings and trains its sharp focus on the multifaceted levels of the human condition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Compared to other Dickens' books I have read, this one is the most bizarre and strange story, and it took a little bit of adjustment to get into it. But it didn't take long to lose myself in the magical, grand drama by this literary wizard. As usual, this book has rich background materials, the marshes, deprivation, violence, mysterious and dark past, turns and twists, surprises and over the top coincidences, vengence and forgiveness...The first person perspective by the protagonist is candid and often humorous as well as insightful about the conflict and frustration of an underprevileged person with aspirations in the society where status of a person is not very mobile. The title is fantastic, Great Expectations! How great, and how ominous! Indeed!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great Expectationsby Charles Dickens; I know that had I been required to read this book for 9th grade English, I'm pretty sure that I would have hated it.

A classic story of poor boy makes good, loses his good fortune, finds it again through sacrifice and character and hard work.

Brought back so many childhood memories and thrills !! Worth reading over and over !"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I enjoyed reading this novel mostly because of the rich text and language Dickens used to display the imagery. Dickens wrote this piece in such detail that allows the audience to fully engage in the text, relate to Pip and his struggles, and bring a deeper thought to the way we treat our individual social statuses. As citizens of the United States, we are obligated to work our way to \\"the top of the food chain\\". The majority of the time, we are not given a high status, by blood or other means, to build a superior reputation for ourselves. Therefore we must have the will and determination to make our personal goals become reality. In Great Expectations, Pip's struggles and adventures are great examples of how the audience can relate to the story line and setting throughout the novel to our own personal lives.I thought that Dickens' creatively demonstrated that an individual's social status is not what determines the rights of respect and standards on a person's character. The ability to prove our greater meaning in this world is not something that the government can label us on. As humans, we have the right to make mistakes and errors in life, but out of the morals and standards in which we uphold allow us to make those mistakes result in a learning experiences. Pip strives to become a better man throughout the novel for various reasons. However, Great Expectations allows us to see the connection between the book and real life. In both situations there are/ will be countless obstacles getting in the way of ambitions we set. When Pip decides to leave Joe behind and pursuit his ambitions of becoming a true gentleman he made a decision, much like Dickens himself, to benefit his own life. With any decision there must be great responciblity and will.Personally, I strongly believe that anyone can improve their well-being within a reasonable manner. Only with dedication and support from relatives or friends can one truly achieve their goal. Sometimes our goals don't have the exact result we wished for, but we should be grateful for what we have and work hard for what we want to improve. What I have learned from this book is that no matter what your status is in school, work, at home, or in society as a whole, we all have the ability to make something greater of ourselves. Each individual has the capability to achieve all of ambitions in life we wish to imagine."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This is one of my favorite books, so when I got my kindle I was delighted to see it for free.

Still highly pertinent in the 21st century."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Contentment in life is a struggle; in \\"Great Expectations,\\" by Charles Dickens, a young boy is faced with disappointed expectations of ambition and desire for social self-improvement. Set in the mid-nineteenth century in Kent and London, England, social class is portrayed as utmost importance. For young orphaned Philip Pirrip-Pipp- life is a struggle of realization of the real world and place in life as well as culture. Through traumatic events, mishaps and altered expectations to the truth, Pipp learns that social improvement is irrelevant to one's real worth.The reoccurring motif in, \\"Great Expectations,\\" is in direct relation to the major them of self-improvement through social class. Through characters, places, and infatuations, this motif is prominent. Miss. Havisham, Estella, the Satis House, and Bently Drummle all introduce different levels and perceptions of social class of the 1800's. Bentley Drummle represents the grotesque side of high class, Miss. Havisham and Estella are the quintessence of the highly educated, lavish and greatly respected side of the upper class, and the Satis House is merely the embodiment of the riches young Pipp adores and idolizes. Each character not only adds to Pipp's life long obsession of social well being, but life lessons learned in his battle for fulfillment."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Charles Dickens was one of the most popular writers of all time, creating some of the best-known characters in English literature. In the book \\"Great Expectations\\", the protagonist and narrator, Pip begins the story as a young orphan boy being grown up by his sister. I like this book, because Charles Dickens takes you right inside the Pip's mind and you live through the events and discoveries of his life with him. Pip is passionate, romantic and somewhat unrealistic at heart. That makes the novel interesting. Of course, you cannot forget the great love story (Pip and Estella). The other characters Magwitch, Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Miss Joe, Estella, Mr Jaggers and Mr Wemmick are all unique and special in their way and they add to the novel's richness. Another thing I really liked was how all of the characters are interrelated to each other in ways that you may not discover until you get to the end of the novel. This novel will make you sometimes laugh and sometimes make you feel sad, but it is always entertaining. Latif Dose simplifies the texts. The language is very clear. There are not old English words and this gives the reader much pleasure while reading the novel. I think most young people would like this novel because it's not as hard to read as an other classic books. I recommend Great Expectations to anyone who wants to read a good, classic book because Great Expectations has a little bit of everything in it, mystery, romance and suspense. You cannot easily find all of these properties in other novels, which makes &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a special and a classic one.. That makes this novel very different. It is probably one of the top ten English novels of the 19th century. Some of the passages are beautiful. I cannot forget Pip's response to Estella when she says \\"You will get me out of thoughts in a week.\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"There is really no need to recount the plot of this classic - I think most people who are thinking about reading it already know it is a story of poor boy done good and has wrong assumptions about how he comes about it. But despite the storyline being well-worn, there is till so much to get from this story. What comes across most clearly is the theme that nothing comes without strings-attached - Pip's great fortune, that at first looked like manna from on high, turns out to cause more trouble than it is worth.Dickens is a joy to read - his description is masterful, and his ability to paint pictures of his eccentric characters is unsurpassed - the contrasts between the charming Mr Wemmick and the slimy Mr Jaggers; the amazing Miss Havisham; the self important Pumblechook (who I could not stand! Is there any character in literature so annoyingly self-deluded?). My absolute favourite is Joe - his convoluted ways of attempting to pass information onto Pip, his attempts to spare Pip from his evil sister and his localised venacular. The only disappointing characters are the two main ones - Pip comes across as insipid, uninspiring, and frankly undeserving of the fortune that he falls into. Estella is so sketchily drawn that you never get any feel for her, and I think that given how much complexity Dickens manages for some of the minor characters, he could have afforded more to Estella.However, this is a great read. Don't read it just because you fell you \`have to read a classic' - read it because it is a well written story with the right balance of humour and pathos."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I don't think I'd be giving away much of the plot if I were to say that the story revolves around Pip, a young, middle class orphan who has dreams to be a wealthy, respected gentleman, but has no hope of this as he is a rural blacksmith apprentice. His prospecs change, however, when a mysterious, anonymous benefactor offers to make Pip's dream a reality. I won't give away the ending, but the novel supports Dickens' belief that the middle class is the class to which people should aspire.The plot of this story wasn't to my liking. Dickens' attempts towards the end to wrap all the subplots into one neat little package annoyed me...similar to plot twists in modern Hollywood movies--things so outrageously convienent that it makes one want to roll his eyes. The manner in which things are written, however is fantastic. While the main characters are rather boring, the minor characters, (especially Biddy, Herbert Pocket, and John Wemmick) were much more interesting. Thankfully, Dickens focused on them enough to flesh them out and make them memorable. I would recommend this book, not because I enjoy the plot, but because the writing style is superior and because I, being lower middle class, enjoyed the positive viewpoint Dickens extended concerning my class."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"What have I missed all these years?

No wonder Dickens' is considered such a great writer....this book will have you laughing out loud, and being inspired by the incredible depth of understanding Dickens has for the human condition at all levels of society.....and he manages to do so while weaving a story about one young boy's transformation and maturation...and the tradeoffs for every choice in life.Once you pick this book up, you won't want to put it down until you finish.

In this semi-autobiographical work (a trademark of Dickens' writings), the life of a poor young boy, Pip, is followed from his humble beginnings to his rise into the middle-class, due to the mysterious aid of an unknown benefactor. His pursuit of Estella, a beautiful young girl raised to break the hearts of men by her jilted caretaker, Ms. Havisham, is a classic of literature that has been repeated countless times since. The tragic, gradual break between Pip and his family (particularly the humble but caring Joe) is heartwrenching. Pip's eventual realization of the insincerity of the middle class, and his love for Joe, brought tears to my eyes.&quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a wonderful, moving book that has been copied and satired again and again, from Mishima's &quot;Forbidden Colors&quot; to South Park. An important and unforgettable novel!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"A great story about a young man who has lost his mother and father and is being raised by only his older sister, Charles Dickens' &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a story of diversity, poverty, and growing up.

As Pip grows up, he must strive to understand what is going on, and why it is going on.The book is very long and almost covers Pip's entire life.

I'm a teenager, 15 years old. And even I have to appreciate this classic. Charles Dickens knew what he was doing, okay? Great Expectations is a classic, and there's a reason it's a classic. For the plain and simple fact it was well written, with an interesting plot and a good twist. Just because something doesn't contain profanity, sex and violence doesn't mean it should be presumed boring. A basic summary - it tells the story of life, obsessions and social status. As far as I'm concerned, it isn't boring. Just wake up to yourselves, teenage world. Virginia Andrews isn't the extent of reading pleasure."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I find myself surprised at the comments provided by earlier reviewers. One critic gave &quot;Great Expectations&quot; one star because he/she failed a test. Why should Dickens be blamed for that? Another said there was no structure (in a Dickens novel???). Another, that there was &quot;little direction and less power.&quot; That there was no theme and no plot. Perhaps I am seeing things that aren't there but, whatever the shortcomings are, it is not in plot, themes, or characterization. It is the story of the orphan Philip Pirrip, known to everyone as Pip, from the age of about seven to the age of twenty-three, with a brief section at the end that takes place about eleven years later. Pip is being brought up \\"by hand\\" by his loud and quarrelsome sister and her kind and quiet husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery. Young Pip is soon asked to serve in the home of Miss Havisham, who appears to be half mad since the day, years earlier, when she had been left at the alter by her old lover. Miss Havisham is raising a young girl named Estella to be heartless in her treatment of men when she grows up as a form of revenge against all men. And, Pip naturally falls in love with her. After a few years, Pip finds himself wealthy due to some unknown benefactor (who he mistakenly thinks is Miss Havisham and who he also believes has planned to have Estella marry him when they are older) and he now has \\"great expectations\\" made of him. He plans to become a gentleman and he leaves the kind and devoted Joe to live in London, Pip hoping to leave behind his humble past of which he now feels ashamed. After a few more years, he discovers that his unknown benefactor was Abel Magwitch whom he had helped when he was seven. Magwitch had been convicted and deported to Australia where he became a wealthy sheepman. Even though Magwitch was forbidden to return to England, he does so just to see the young man he had been helping to become a gentleman. Through problems with the law trying to arrest Magwitch, problems with Magwitch's past, the loss of the fortune and of Pip's great expectations, and through illness, Pip discovers the basic goodness in Joe, the devotion of Magwitch and of Pip's close friend Herbert Pocket, and what really is important. He discovers the value of family and of close friends and confidants. Estelle, who had married a cruel oaf, also learns her lessons and finds that she may have a heart as well (in the more common of the two endings of the novel). This is a great novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"If you're like me, you were forced to read some Dickens in High School and found him to be pedantic and to sound archaic.

I am just so enamored with Dickens's story-telling and character development that I have a fear that when I am done reading his canon I'll have to declare a 13-way tie for first place. We'll see.Between Bleak House and Great Expectations I *almost have a two-way tie for first place, in no small part because they are such different types of books...Bleak House was a universe of characters and subplots; Great Expectations fewer characters and not as much intrigue, although the last 1/4 to 1/3 of the book is riveting. And some good comedy also.But I am going to put GE at #1 and BH at #2...while I loved Bleak House as I read it, and have a few favorite characters, \\"Great Expectations\\" will *stay with me* much much longer I think...Bleak House is brilliant (really brilliant) for its commentary on the period and for its settings and for its intricacies; Great Expectations is brilliant because it is simple and timeless.I'm not nearly vain or clever enough to think I'm the first to recognize this, but three neat things about Great Expectations are: 1) it's a novel which illustrates the old warning \\"Be Careful What You Wish For...\\", 2) it is the complete opposite of \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" - an earnest, non-cynical first-person narrator who meets so much kindness along the way, and fewer \\"phonies\\" (although there are a few), and 3) it's such a personal novel that anyone who dares wonder what they could possibly learn about human nature by reading such an \\"old\\" book NEEDS to read it for that very reason.The characters are just so memorable...if I had to pick a favorite, I think it would be Wemmick...you probably work with him and don't even know it: he's the man (or woman) who is competent at work, works for an insufferable boss, and has a completely different home life than work life. His care of \\"The Aged\\" is a remarkable example for any of us in caring for our parents.The love stories are also very touching - especially the ones that turn out for the best...but no spoilers in this review.And the story of Pip's unrequited love is so true to life...and although I think it would have been worse for Pip to lose Estella had she been more than just beautiful outside but also beautiful inside, Dickens wrote beautifully and agonizingly of the highs and lows associated with unrequited love as only one who has experienced it can truly identify. One of the worst and most painful aspects is not the fact that you aren;t chosen but that they chose *that* person. And all you can think is: anybody...anybody but *them*.A memorable book and must reading.Now on to another Dickens novel! :-)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"It is one of the magnificent books in history that everyone should have.

Wish Amzaon provide frequently this kind of excellent novels by free."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This novel was my first taste of Dickens and I have to say I was fairly surprised, and that in a very positive sense. Not only I didn't find it overly \\"wordy\\" or else, but extremely well written. But that's details. This novel is very intense and has unforgettable characters in it, honestly. It's very emotional and it's a trip. A trip that lasted two weeks for me, and that I will not soon forget, if ever. I wholeheartedly recommend this book for those of you who love literature, and even for those of you who are not literature-buffs, because the novel is very readable so don't be afraid of its length if you're not used to reading classics and such.Dickens, I realised, can be surprisingly funny at times, and this without ever losing his capacity to create strongly emotional moments and images. As there seems to be tons of reviews for this book already I'll stop mine here and just tell you that if you're interested in this book, go for it!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I never wanted to read this book, but a friend convinced me when he learned that I loved Pip on South Park (I found the little nerd funny). This was the best advice I'd ever taken. Reading this not only made me love Charles Dickens, but gave me a late start on loving reading in general.Granted, it's a difficult book to read. Dickens packs his book with descriptions and long sentences (yet every word is important and helps with understanding) and he's not easy to get through. Yet Dickens still, with all his flaws, remains a masterful storyteller. His characters aren't deep, but they're relatable and memorable. I love Pip, Estella, Miss Havisham, Joe, Herbert Pocket, Magwitch, and Aged P, and even though I've read this book a long time ago, I love them just as much now as I did then.It's a shame that people have to read this for school (I did so for my second time). It's a wonderful story that should be enjoyed by itself. If you haven't been made to read it, do so now. Push yourself through it and take your time (it took me a month to finish the book myself). You'll be glad you did. Assignments make you rush and over-analyze stories, and Dickens should never be read that way."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great Expectations was a remarkable book. I really enjoyed it. I didn't really have great expectations before I read it. It was about a little English boy named Pip. Pip is a poor kid who suddenly inherits a bunch of money and becomes rich. When he was poor he hated the way rich people treated poor people, but he finds himself doing treating poor people horribly when rich. He finally learns that everyone deserves to be treated with the same respect, even those less fortunate. This was an interesting book, but a tough book to understand, I would probably recommend it only for adults."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"When I was assigned to present a novel for my English class at Mercy High School, I thought of Great Expectations because I had read it five years ago and remembered that I had liked it. I thought that it was rather straight forward and didn't remember having difficulty reading it. When I read it for a second time, however, I realized that it was alot more complex. The reading was simple and getting through the book was easy, but Dickens made his story one worth contemplating by expressing the many sides life with his characters. What made the people he wrote about so wonderful was his ability to make them unique and entertaining, yet so believable as human beings coping with ordinary problems that the reader had no problem sympathizing with them."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Charles Dickens develops the characters, the plot, and the conflicts in Great Expectations spectacularly. The characters Dickens develops throughout the story are human and easy to connect with. Pip is the most real to life character, because he exhibits the most human-like qualities. Pip is a very personable character that makes the reader feel sorrow and happiness along with him. As Pip looks to better himself and become a gentleman, he comes to realize a very important life lesson; money cannot buy happiness. As Pip goes through the story, he allows the reader to see and feel exactly what he feels and sees.Estella is described as a beautiful young woman that captures Pip's heart. Estella has a very insensitive personality, and enjoys making Pip cry; something everyone has encountered in a person some time in his/her life.Herbert is a young man with many dreams and aspirations. Herbert becomes Pip's best friend, and Pip realizes that this young man works very hard for what he believes in. This is the kind of friend that will push a person where they would not normally go by themselves.Abel Magwitch is the convict that Pip encounters at the beginning of the story. Magwitch gives Pip a large amount of money to start his life as a gentleman. Magwitch is the kind of person that would give the clothes off of his back to anyone in need. Magwitch is also a very personable character because he is not all good or all evil. He exhibits both of these; he is a convict and he devotes his life's earnings to Pip.Charles Dickens develops an outstanding plot as the novel unfolds. There are many life lessons throughout the novel. Pip realizes that all of the money in the world cannot buy happiness. Pip also finds out that true love is not just the woman he cannot obtain, because love has to be much more. The plot has many twists and turns throughout. There is always something new happening to Pip. It is almost like a soap opera, because there are so many people and events interacting with each other during the novel. When the plot becomes a little thin, Dickens begins to create suspense for the next big event about to occur. Dickens chooses to develop the plot through the character's actions. Not once did Dickens explain what was happening in the story, he let the characters take over, and within a few pages all questions were answered.The novel has many conflicts that develop throughout the plot. Pip and Estella have a love-hate relationship going on. Pip loves Estella, but she could care less about him. Pip and Joe have a conflict, too. Pip wants to see much less of Joe now that he is a gentleman, but Joe just wants to see Pip, period. Pip thinks he is too good for Joe, even though he is still just the same human as he was before. Money changes people's outlook on life. Pip was once a benevolent, caring, young man, but once he fell into money, he changed dramatically in the way he acted towards others. These conflicts provide for some pretty interesting facets in the story. Charles Dickens develops the characters, the plot, and the conflicts excellently throughout the novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Truly one of the best books I've read.

I am now a junior and reading the book yet again for a history assignment and even though I know what is happening I still can't put it down.To all the freshman out there that have to read this book: Give it a chance. If you really hat eit and want to watch the movie go to the local library and get Disneys version of it. They did it exactly to the book and it is awesome.

True, the book is extremely wordy, and there are many words you'll be getting out a dictionary for reference, and yes it's very slow moving, but it's wonderful.The book focuses on a young boy, who becomes a young man, named Pip, raised by his over dominating sister, and a kind blacksmith, Joe Gargory. For awhile Pip has gratitude for living in the town, but, when he is spurned by the rich Estella and Miss Havisham, he wants to be something greater, someone richer. Being rich falls into his lap, but not without consequences. The book is about the follies of false vanities, of turning ones back on those who loved you, on trying to chase an uncatchable dream from those who don't reciprocate feelings, (in this case Pip's devotion to the haughty Estella) and for neglecting the good values of life for the ostentatious ones. Too often in todays society people (I'm guilty of this too) forget about what's truly important, family and good friends, and associate with only the proud and the, what they deem to be, the important. In the process they get too wrapped up by material wealth rather than the simple beauties around them.Aside from the basic story, the characterization in this novel is wonderful. Dicken's has really created some memorable characters, full of depth and complexity. The dull headed, but kind, Joe Gargory, and the haughty, but lonely, Estella, along with the mournful and bitter Miss Havisham will stay with the reader long after he/she finishes the book.Reading this book is a treat. Peruse it's pages and enjoy."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This novel by Charles Dickens is very well written, although very verbose.

These plots make understanding this book, along with the rich dialect, quite difficult (where it lost the star) but amazing. ADVICE: read the Coles Notes (or other notes) chapter summaries.As I said, it's an extrodinary coming of age (rite of passage) which will not be as distant and farfetched as you might think. Comparable to your own rite of passage if you care to draw parallels with not only Pip, but all other characters too.I found that when you are forced to read this book and too much emphasis it placed on it, it loses it's 'interest', 'luster', and 'magic', (*wink* *wink* high school teachers!).Overall, I liked this book, but the language overwhelmed at times."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Dickens has a very vivid imagination.

First, in my opinion he shouldn't have changed certain characters names around, which can be confusing for some people. There is also illegal activities on the part of some of the characters. Also, even the abridged version of the book is a bit long. Perhaps Dickens could have wound things up in a tighter package for the reader. Dickens plot can be a bit confusing at times, and the reader sometimes is left to piece together the novel for himself.However, this is not a necessesarily a totally boring read. There are several good things about it. Lying is at least partially looked at in a negative light, and steadfast faithfulness among friends is evident among some of the book's main characters. Justice is done to an man for his wrongdoing.Overall, the book is readable but too long. Also, when considering this book, keep in mind that author's back then, are different from authors today. If you like Dicken's works, you might like this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I was disappointed from the fact that I did not finish the whole book when I was in high school.

Let me also say this book is extremely boring in the beginning, because you are learning the peices of the puzzle, but the second half is excellent, and all the peices of the puzzle came together, which is why this is an excellent book. My favorite character was definetely Miss Havisham. Don't give up on this book!!! This is the kind of book I think needs a small sequel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I think that the character development alone makes this novel stand out as one of the best novels of Charles Dickens. The plot summary is also well-crafted, with so many characters intertwining in the books final chapters. We see a personality change in not only Pip, but other major characters such as Estella and Miss Havisham, as we find out that they are all connected in some way.This book might be seen as a rather long and detailed book. Some of the details are probably overdone and unnecessary. This is definitely a book that takes some getting used to. However, I think that one of the morals of the book-- understanding your roots and accepting them-- make this a great book to read.The many characters contrast each other in so many ways, and there are so many good and bad characters, that it becomes a fun book to read. However, you must have patience to read a book this long and detailed.I think this book is well-written (some of the language is a little tough), and Dickens exposes his great writing ability and his abilty to deal with a complex plot and make it all come together in Great Expectations."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Charles Dickens was one of the most popular writers of all time, creating some of the best-known characters in English literature. In the book \\"Great Expectations\\", the protagonist and narrator, Pip begins the story as a young orphan boy being grown up by his sister. I like this book, because Charles Dickens takes you right inside the Pip's mind and you live through the events and discoveries of his life with him. Pip is passionate, romantic and somewhat unrealistic at heart. That makes the novel interesting. Of course, you cannot forget the great love story (Pip and Estella). The other characters Magwitch, Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Miss Joe, Estella, Mr Jaggers and Mr Wemmick are all unique and special in their way and they add to the novel's richness. Another thing I really liked was how all of the characters are interrelated to each other in ways that you may not discover until you get to the end of the novel. This novel will make you sometimes laugh and sometimes make you feel sad, but it is always entertaining. Latif Dose simplifies the texts. The language is very clear. There are not old English words and this gives the reader much pleasure while reading the novel. I think most young people would like this novel because it's not as hard to read as an other classic books. I recommend Great Expectations to anyone who wants to read a good, classic book because Great Expectations has a little bit of everything in it, mystery, romance and suspense. You cannot easily find all of these properties in other novels, which makes &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a special and a classic one.. That makes this novel very different. It is probably one of the top ten English novels of the 19th century. Some of the passages are beautiful. I cannot forget Pip's response to Estella when she says \\"You will get me out of thoughts in a week.\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"The book was a gift and really excited my 10 year old godchild.

There are questions at the end of the text. Wanted about 20 copies but did not want to pay the top price! Like usual Amazon came to the rescue. Can't wait to introduce the children to a classic but closer to their level. It is authentic to so many of the important quotes.

The only problem is I don't want to get out of my car.The reader does a fabulous job of bringing Dickens many wonderful characters to life. I heartily recommend."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"\\"Great Expectations\\" was Charles Dickens' third attempt at writing semi-autobiography, and his most successful. Poor Oliver Twist barely registers in his own book, while David Copperfield becomes a pasteboard figure after reaching adulthood. Pip only grows richer and more complex, and it's no wonder critics thus see \\"Great Expectations\\" as the best of the lot.We open with the finest sequence in the novel, along a swampy coastline in southern England where a small boy at his parent's grave is threatened by a desperate convict. The convict wants food and a file to help cut him free. The boy, Pip, must wrestle with some serious guilt, not to mention the threat of his sister and guardian's overzealous discipline. Social expectations cut one way, but a rogue feeling of sympathy for the convict guides him another. Which will win out?Pip's a bit of a prat, but he's meant to be. After coming into some mysterious money, the former blacksmith's apprentice abandons those who love him in a doomed attempt to win over Estella, the high-class, heart-challenged ward of balmy Miss Havisham. Estella bothers some people. How could Pip love her? Man, I've been there, and I reckon a lot of others have been, too. Estella is one of the great fictional representations of unrequited love, and in Dickens' hands, becomes something even more potent, a symbol of class division and status-scrambling folly.Dickens' handling of Pip is subtle and worth careful re-reading. By using the device of an older, unseen Pip as narrator, we sense where he fell astray without it being pointed out overmuch. Clashing with a snooty rival for Estella's affections, he sweats the possibility of being discovered as the friend of a guileless village blacksmith, Joe: \\"So throughout life our worst weaknesses and meannesses are usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise.\\"Whenever the focus is on Pip, particularly when dealing with Estella, Miss Havisham, or the mysterious, vaguely creepy lawyer Mr. Jaggers, \\"Great Expectations\\" is both high art and a great read. Dickens' descriptive powers remained in high beam in this, his penultimate novel (completed in 1861). The storyline takes its time, but in such a way that it often feels like a prototype for the stream-of-consciousness narrative authors would employ a century later.If only \\"Great Expectations\\" didn't suffer from one of Dickens' chief bte noires, compounding coincidences. Whether it's the identity of Estella's long-lost father or Miss Havisham's unworthy suitor, too many of the plot strands wind up twisted together to unwholesome effect.Other plot strings, like the tale of a blackguard named Orlick or the romances of Pip's pals Herbert Pocket and Wemmick, do little to merit the lengthy attention they receive. Most annoying is the story of Compeyson, built up as Pip's main adversary. Yet we hardly meet the guy before he vanishes in the black waters of Dickens' top-heavy plot machinations.Except for Jaggers, Estella, and Miss Havisham, \\"Great Expectations\\" suffers from an uninteresting cast of supporting characters. But when you have three such meaty characters, not to mention the noble yet shifting Pip at the center, you have one eminently worthy novel. Add to that Dickens' descriptive abilities, and that harrowing opening, and \\"Great Expectations\\" delivers most of the way on its title's promise."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"i enjoy these barnes and noble editions. pocket books make a nice addition to the library."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I do pretty much all my \\"reading\\" on audio books these days and Michael Page is probably my favorite narrator so far. He changes his voice for each character in a way that sounds so natural and undistracting, and his female voices are not annoying (I think the mark of a really great narrator is how undistracting their \\"opposite gender\\" voices are.)The story of Great Expectations deserves to be told by someone of Page's talent. I first read it by accident when I was a kid, not realizing it was a classic (always avoided books I was supposed to read.) I liked it well enough then, but I love it now. The characters are interesting, the morality of the book is not preachy and it's such a substantial book that you can listen to it several times and still pick up some new insight or pleasure. If you're an impatient reader, the book is probably not for you. If you need action on every page, you might get bored. But if you are a people person and you like getting to know the characters of a book, if you like to look for truth in fiction, it's a great story, very well told."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Well, I was looking through some of the reviews posted here on amazon just to get an idea of what to write because this is my first review, and saw that a few people said that you need to be an adult to read this book. I kind of understand what they mean because this is a pretty dense novel, as most of Dicken's writing is. However, I don't feel that an individual's determines his maturity as a reader, and so, I dont feel that people should be discouraging teenagers from reading this classic book.Having said that, let me discuss a few key points that are important to keep in mind when considering whether or not to buy the book. Firstly, this is a very difficult read, so unless you are accustomed to reading classical fiction, be prepared to devote more time to reading the book than you generally would to a novel of similar length (450ish pages). Furthermore, the book is a drag at times, especially in during the first part. Often times, I would get lost while reading the book because I couldn't focus on the descriptions which seemed to get in the way of the plot. However, I have to give Dickens credit on doing a remarkable job of writing the dialogue between characters which allows the reader to immerse into the story. Whenever I wasn't lost, I would often feel as if I was right in the center of the scene and could vividly visualize what was going on around the protagonist.As for the theme of the book, I felt that it tried to impart a good, however slightly shallow, message on the reader. By the end of the book, it is very clear what the message is as all of the characters get what they deserve. However, having read a lot of philosophical literature, I feel compelled on extracting deeper meaning from everything around me, which is kind of hard to do from this book.My recommendation of this book would depend on the reader, I feel that if you have read another book of a similar genre or time period, then you would really enjoy this book otherwise it might be very boring. If this is your first time reading a book by a classical writer, might I recommend visiting sparknotes after every couple of chapters to get a clearer understanding of the plot. Also, I would recommend to every single person to only buy this book if they can dedicate significant time to reading it. Don't think this is one of those books that you can just read anytime you have a few minutes here or there because you will be lost and won't understand it at all. I feel it would be best to sit down and just read for an hour or two (depending on your attention span) and delve deep into the world of the characters. Not only does this process make identifying character development easier, it also makes the book more enjoyable.Also, for anyone who finds Dicken's writing style interesting, I recommend looking at David Copperfeild (just read the first paragraph, and you will be hooked)."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"It was hard to get into for the first 200 pages. The end was nice though. It was not as good as I expected it to be. Not one of Dickens's best. David Copperfield was much better."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"HAHAHHAH696"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I too have been out of school for some time. I decided explore the classics. Mr. Dickens has such a command of the English language so much so that I could not put it down. He expatiated very well throughout the entire pages of the book. I did not read it without my dictionary; which is the reason I read it to expand my vocabulary. After reading this book television became very boring to me. My favorite is Joe Gargery and John Wemmick. Joe because of his stick-to-itiveness. He is the same no matter what. The latter because of his ability to separate work with Jaggers from home. He enjoys life to the max and loves his father so. Pip is also to be appreciated for he does see what is most important in life and the value of love is what is important. After reading this book I have embarked on two others: Much Ado About Nothing (which I have thorougly enjoy) and Silas Marner which is great also. I hope everyone can find the enjoyment of reading for pleasure and learning as I have. Happy reading"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"A great book in concept. However, Dickens was apparently paid by the word. Especially the silly ones, like &quot;prithee&quot; and &quot;vittles&quot;. It is time that we stopped attacking freshmen honors students with this pretentious book, which serves only to drive them away from English forever. Nowhere near the best of Dicken's work, the book reads like a 19th century soap opera, without bathroom breaks and Snuggle-bear commercials. By the time the first interesting character returns to the novel, the reader is lucky if he or she hasn't choked to death on tears of frustration. Why is Estelle such a b****? Why is Ms. Havisham such an old hag? Why is Pip so utterly slackjawed that he permits 20 years of idiocy to be perpetrated upon his stale English carcass? Why, after all, doesn't his benefactor take care of business, murder the lot, and turn this into something vaguely enjoyable? Never mind the fact that Dickens couldn't choose an end, he apparently couldn't even choose a plot, wavering wildly between romance and mystery and the sort of English politics that Michael Palin would love to throw his pasty-white Anglo-Saxon hands about and throttle. Especially the politics. Do we really care about how an English attorney carries himself when we're 15 years old? Not bleeding likely. Powdered wigs and leg stockings sum up the bizarre nature of the staying power of this novel. It's about time that High School English teachers stopped telling one another how *good* this book is, and read it themselves, without the Norton Critical Teacher's Edition beside them. Especially when they have the advantage of alcoholic beverages."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I'm an eighth grade student forced to read this book for English class. Most people would probably assume that the book sucks. Guess what? It does. I'm sorry, but Charles Dickens does not happen to be my cup of tea. He may be a master, but it's impossible to deny that his writing is dry and the story drags in many places. I counted numerous parts of the novel that could have easily been eliminated without affecting the rest of the book. And what the h*** is Pip thinking at the end when he decides to marry (person who I will not name)? Seems to me his only reason for doing this is that he's completely desperate and tired of chasing after Estella all that time. It totally came out of nowhere and wasn't very realistic. The book's really not that bad, but apart from the interesting episodes with Miss Havisham, it's pretty boring."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Some may call me a classic book snob, but here it goes.Great expectations may be at times tedious and I won't deny that, but it is worth it.Charles Dickens goes into great depth of detail and at times a bit overly detailed and I'm sure that is where many people get lost. But if you get the main plot, then you can get the jiff of it.The characters in this book transcend time.Pip, the poor boy who finds himself wondering if he can love old Joe know that he is rich.Estella who cannot love truly but yet brought up to love and destroy.Miss Havisham, the old rich woman who had her heartbroken and know is trying her best to seek revenge.Joe, Biddy and others also play a pivotal role.The story itself plays on the role of moral and also mercy. It shows a colorful and at times exaggerated array of feelings. From grief to greed, to deceit and happiness.Pip, a lonely orphan and living with his sister, finds and help a criminal. Although it was not completely of his own will.Then Pip is introduced to the sad and luxurious world of Miss Havisham where he met Estella, the girl he loved from then on.From then on he resents his meager living until one day he finds out that he had just inherited a large fortune.Then on Pip goes on a quest to truly become a gentleman and win Estella's heart.But how can he win Estella's heart when she doesn't have one?Can he really forsake his family for money?Who gave him that money?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"The kindle text is fine, but please be alerted that the link provided to get the free audiobook takes you to some japanese website that has nothing to do with Great Expectations that I could find."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This is a really good new book.

However, I find that while its messages are eternal, Dickens's style is very off-putting. Don't get me wrong, his prose is very, very beautiful, and his characters are layered in a way that many modern novelists seem to forget. Yet his descriptions are extraordinarily, unnecessarily lengthy. It's a novel, not a travel magazine. Considering that Dickens wrote this novel as chapters to be published weekly in a newspaper, it's unsurprising how drawn-out the descriptions are (higher word count = higher profit). Also, by compiling all of his entries into one novel, you find repetition creeping in as you realize he redoes all of the unpleasantly elaborate descriptions from the previous few chapters over again. It's disappointing to read a book that takes you for either a dunce, or someone with short-term memory loss."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Ordered Great Expectations because it has been many years since I originally read it as a requirement for a literature class.

That convict has escaped with another, his enemy convict. They are captured in the end but the convict whom Pip aided gives Pip 2pounds and a shilling by his fellow convict later on.Then, Pip is taken to a rich lady, Miss Havisham&iexcl;s and meets proud and heartless Estella whom he falls in love with. Born in a quite a poor family in the country, he tries to be clever so that Estella does not call him common, and quite succeeds. And plus, fortune lays itself in his way by an unknown rich person. A lawyer, Mr. Jaggers knows the provider of the fortune but does not tell Pip who it is because the provider&iexcl;s wish is to let him/herself known when he/she is ready for it. And Pip goes off to London.In London, Pip is introduced to Mr. Matthew Pocket, a relation of Miss Havisham for Mr. Pocket is to be Pip&iexcl;s tutor. Pip lives with Mr. Pocket&iexcl;s son Mr. Herbert Pocket whom he had met before at Miss Havisham&iexcl;s when a child, and becomes very acquainted with him. His other acquaintance is Mr. Wemmick, who works for Mr. Jaggers. He has a different life at work and at home, that makes him peculiar. All this time Pip thinks that the &iexcl;unknown provider&iexcl; of his fortune is doubtlessly Miss Havisham and thinks that she wants Estella and him to be married. However, he finds out that in fact it is not Miss Havisham who gave him his fortune but the old convict he had helped! That convict had escaped again and fled to Australia where he had worked for Pip and had become an owner of quite some money which was given to Pip. And now he comes to Pip and tells him. So that convict is known to Herbert as well and they live together.Now, when Pip was young, his parents had died so he lived with his sister&iexcl;s family. Joe, his brother-in-law is a good friend of his, a blacksmith, but his own sister is not very nice to him. A man called Orlick, who was Joe&iexcl;s helper, thinks very ill of Pip&iexcl;s sister and one day, hits her on the head and makes her a simpleton and she dies after some years. That man Orlick, tries to murder Pip for false reasons but fails for Pip&iexcl;s friends save him.The convict, if captured, would be hanged, therefore, Pip decides that the convict should be out of England as soon as possible and that Pip should accompany him. They plan it, and it proceeds. Meanwhile, Estella is married to a quite rich man and Miss Havisham is dead. The other convict who had escaped with Pip&iexcl;s that long time ago, Pip&iexcl;s convict&iexcl;s foe, follows Pip and the convict on their way out of England and tries to capture them. There is a fight underwater, Pip&iexcl;s convict is alive but is soon captured by the police and his foe is dead underwater. Pip&iexcl;s convict, named Magwitch or Provis is deeply wounded, and dies in prison. Before he dies, Pip finds out that Estella was adopted by Miss Havisham and that her father is Provis, so tells Provis that and that Pip loves his daughter. After that, Provis dies.Pip has an old acquaintance in the country, his hometown, a lady named Biddy. He decides to propose to her, now that Estella is gone, and leaves to the country only to find that Biddy is already married to Joe! He congratulates them and thinks about another little Pip to be in that house, just like he was when he was young. He then departs abroad to where Herbert works, for when Pip was a possessor of a fortune, he had secretly found Herbert that job, and Herbert, not knowing the provider of such a job had invited Pip to be a clerk. Pip lives abroad for eleven years, meanwhile Herbert marries and Pip becomes their &iexcl;partner in the House&iexcl;.After those 11years, he returns to Joe and Biddy&iexcl;s abode where he finds himself there! Named Pip after Pip was a little boy! Pip is warmly greeted, and after dinner, Biddy, who knows all about Estella for Pip had told her when he was young, asks if he surely does not fret for her? Pip replies that he thinks not, but anyway, revisits Miss Havisham&iexcl;s old house. The buildings are taken down, but among the ruins, stands Estella! Her husband had died most unfortunately because of a horse but even before his death, her marriage was not led to be a happy one. For all Pip knew, she was married again, but she was not. Pip and Estella converse about their interests, and Pip says, &iexcl;We are friends.&iexcl; To which Estella continues, &iexcl;And will continue friends apart.&iexcl; Then there is a nice little paragraph, which, if I am not quite mistaken proves that they are married.When I was reading this fantastic novel, I saw a lot of things. On my reading of pre-20th century novels, I only encountered those which were in third person, or first person, but &iexcl;I&iexcl; as a girl, not a boy. Great Expectations was something new, for I had thought that a boy liking a girl is to be quite different from a girl liking a boy and a boy&iexcl;s thoughts about poverty and being ignorant is to be quite different from a girl but I found out that it&iexcl;s quite the same. I mean, it depends on one&iexcl;s character and personality of course, but I found out that some boys do not like telling lies or stealing as much as girls and adults do not. It is a fantastic novel, an excellent read, and although the ending is not originally Charles Dicken&iexcl;s idea, I think Dickens made a great decision to follow what his friend suggested. For the original ending was a sad one, which would have made the reader very unhappy for Pip, whereas the new ending gives some hope and happiness to the reader. I read from a book on Great Expectations that the title, Great Expectations, meant not only Pip&iexcl;s expectations but the reader&iexcl;s of Dickens&iexcl; novels&iexcl; expectations. I surely think that those expectations were rewarded to perfection."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I was forced to read Great Expectations in the ninth grade, and i am still in the ninth grade, so yeah.

Of course, the moral of the story is, even when you have everything you want, money still cannot buy you love nor necessarily happiness.Other than that, this is yet another one of Charles Dickens' reads, that is classical, and will help expand on your vocabulary, and build on reading comprehension.

The book starts out when he is 8 years old and he is in a grave yard when an escaped convict comes up to him and demands that he get him some food and a file, so he can get out of his ankle cuffs. Pip does as he is asked and doesn't tell a sole like he had sworn too. The story then continues to follow Pips life as he gets older.This book is an English novel written by Charles Dickens. Charles Dickens wrote many books, of which a couple are required reading by English classes. Great Expectations is a well written book in which the surroundings, characters and noises are well described. Although Great Expectations is well written I feel that the story is a little slow to pick up and, it is hard to become engrossed into the book because it seems a little monotone. In later chapters you can also guess at what might be coming next.Great Expectations though slow to pick up, does have a good, solid story line and can be entertaining to read once you pass the first chapter. This would not be a good book for people who like action books or books with a lot of twists and turns that keep you reading to see what comes next. But if you like a slower paced book with maybe a hint of love in it with a less gripping more predictable out come then Great Expectations would be a good pick."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Well, unlike the multitudes in America, I was NOT forced to read \\"Great Expectations\\" in high school or at any other time. However, lately it seemed like it was time to pick up this old classic and to dig into its treasures.The story starts out with an unlikely scene in a graveyard in a small English village. There we meet a little boy named Pip, who is visiting the gravesites of both of his parents. There we also meet a desperate convict who is cowardly enough to scare the little boy half to death in order to get some food and other items. Pip - an earnest, battered little orphan being raised by his sister and brother-in-law - anxiously sets out to please this convict. And so starts the tale of Pip's life.After the convict scene, Dickens takes his time in setting up exactly what Pip's life was like as he was groomed to take his brother-in-laws place as the blacksmith in the town. Dickens' genius for wit, along with some very likeable characters, help pull the reader through the endless pages of details and slow action.Soon, however, Pip's fortunes change...and then they change again...and then yet again. Yet, while the storyline somewhat resembles a roller coaster, the pacing is so slow that one is never overwhelmed by the action. In fact, I was rather underwhelmed by the amount of action there was for the number of words I was reading.Even so, I would say that this book is worth the effort. Dickens explores human nature of an average man when beset by a number of unusual situations, each one building on the last. Pip is likeable in these scenarios because he is never obnoxiously perfect or unaffected by his changing fortunes. In some ways, he \\"learns his lesson\\" by the end. In others, he does not.While Dickens tackles some rather weighty issues in this book, he does so in his distinctive, chipper, witty manner. Thus, one never really understands the emotional depths that the characters experience due to either their oppressive or their opulent fortunes. But, of course, one does not go to Dickens for emotional depth. One reads Dickens for explorations of tough circumstances with happy endings. If that is what the reader wants, Dickens is probably as able to handle the issues as anyone."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"* * * * * * * * *&quot;Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of ourtears, for they are rain upon the blinding dustof earth, overlying our hard hearts.

While not as emotionally satisfying as the earlier &quot;David Coppefield,&quot; it is nevertheless tighter, more compact, and displays a greater maturity and discipline of writing style on Dickens' part.

The intertwining of these lives, the playing out of these destinies, combined with its memorably Gothic beginning and unsettling ambiguous ending make &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a pleasure to read for both its narrative power and literary craftsmanship. Considered by many to be Dickens' &quot;best rounded&quot; story, I concur by offering this example. Having finished the novel, I craved a viewing of David Lean's brilliant 1947 film. I ended up by mistake with the Ethan Hawke Gwyneth Paltrow 1998 remake. I decided to give it a try, and was so enraptured by the look of the film and its grasp of the material I stayed with it.

These seemingly necessary emotions and acts of something near betrayal are finally exposed as cheap and worthless when the hero's true benefactor is known in the end.

I had gained a sort of superiority to the man and his works. I would dismiss it as all sentimental unbelievabilities. But I decided to not be so proud and read one of his books. On a recommendation from one of my professors, I started with Great Expecations. What I found was a deeply engrossing, funny and humane book that captivated me for the week and a half that it took to read it. Much of it was very realistic (barring, of course, the unrealistic coincidences, that are actually, in their own way, quite comforting) and believable. Dickens went a long way to get into the mind of his narrator, and it works beautifully, as we struggle with Pip in every decision and look back with him at the bad decisions that he made. The themes of the novel (pride, isolation, friendship, hopeless love, etc.) can easily be translated into our own society, putting ourselves in the shoes of the characters as we deal with our mistakes and try to do the right thing. A very amazing book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"There is no doubt that Charles Dickens' \\"Great Expectations\\" is a masterpiece. The intricacy of its plot has rarely been matched. Its characters are unforgettable. It speaks powerfully to what it means to be human.Pip is the perfect picture of flawed humanity. He is essentially well meaning, but his vision always seems to get cloudy at just the wrong time. Throughout the book, Pip falls prey to his dreams and infatuations. In the process he ignores those who truly love him. Only in the end does he learn, in catastrophic terms, the importance of love. Only then is able to accept it.\\"Great Expectations\\" is the story of Pip's learning process. Along the way we encounter some of Dickens greatest secondary characters: the fierce Mr. Jaggers, the self-centered and mentally unstable Mrs. Havisham and her heartless prodigy Estella, and Pip's great friend Joe.I give a special recommendation to this Bantam Classic edition of the work. Its introduction by John Irving is one of the greatest pieces of criticism ever written.Though not my favorite Dickens novel, I give \\"Great Expectations\\" a heartfelt recommendation."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great Expectations succeeds beyond almost all novels of its time in exploring the roots of character and moral behavior. Charles Dickens makes the case for there being the potential for good in everyone. Evil and sin follow from a combination of being self-absorbed and selfish. What is remarkable about the way these themes are handled is that they are clearly based on an assessment of human psychology, long before that field was established.The book is also remarkable for its many indelibly memorable and complex characters. Miss Havisham, Pip, Magwitch, Mr. Jaggers, and Estella are characters you will think about again and again in years to come.The book also surrounds you with a powerful sense of place. Although the England described here is long gone, it becomes as immediate as a nightmare or a dream that you have just awakened from.For a book about moral questions, Great Expectations also abounds in action. The scenes involving Pip and Magwitch are especially notable for way action expresses character and thought.Great Expectations also reeks of irony, something that is seldom noticed in more modern novels. Overstatements are created to draw the irony out into the open, where it is unmistakable. Yet the overstatements attract, rather than repel. The overstatements are like the theatrical make up which makes actors and actresses look strange in the dressing room, but more real on the stage when seen from the audience.At the same time, the plot is deliciously complex in establishing and solving mysteries before that genre had been born. As you read Great Expectations, raise your expectations to assume that you will receive answers to any dangling details. By reading the book this way, you will appreciate the craft that Mr. Dickens employed much more.This is the third time that I have read Great Expectations over the last 40 years. I found the third reading to be by far the most rewarding. If you like the book, I encourage you to read it again in the future as well. You will find that the passage of time will change your perspective so that more nooks and crannies of the story will reveal themselves to you.If this is to be your first reading of the book, do be patient with the book's middle third. It may seem to you that the book is drifting off into a sleep-inducing torpor. Yet, important foundations are being lain for your eventual delight.Mr. Dickens wrote two endings for Great Expectations. Be sure to read both of them. Which one do you prefer? I find myself changing my mind.Give love with an open heart, without expectations!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"All right. I admit it. The book starts out slow. Dickens, though I love the man, writes in such flowery and long winded language at times. What takes many authors a line or two, Dickens will devote whole pages.And I almost put the book down for that exact reason. I'm very happy I did not.With so many detailed threads in the story, the depth to the characters--when they all start to blend together a few chapters in, the result is page-turning.The story centers around a young boy--well, almost young man-- named Pip, and revolves around his growing into age. You cannot help but love the boy. Much of Pip's worry and concern I could relate to--falling in love with a girl who refuses to return your sentiments and only plays with your heart, growing up and leaving home for the first time, and discovering your true relationships with others and yourself, as shocking as they may turn out to be.I felt as if I was side by side with Pip through it all, and that made the novel a wonderful experience for me. I recommend the novel for the young because so much relates to them, and also for the older readers--because you can experience it all again.A wonderful and heart warming tale. Just get through those first chapters.The book is timeless, with the basic story line being one that has affected almost everyone sometime in their life; falling in love with somebody who does not return the feelings. Pip, the main character, falls in love with an exotic and beautiful girl, Estella, but of course she does not have any feelings for him. So Pip does everything he can to win her approval, and most importantly her heart. It is hard to skip around in the book. While some passages might seem as if they have nothing to do with the story, they do. Everything in the story is tied together somehow. Skimming the book is not going to help. Certain events and people the reader thinks are insignificant or forgot completley, will appear over and over throughout the book. I am glad that i decided to read Great Expectations, despite the negative remarks from peers. I found out that most of them never made it past the first few chapters, so they missed out on the good parts. The only reason I did not give the book a higher score is that parts of it are slow and dry, but stick with it, you will not be upset. --This text refers to the Mass Market Paperback edition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Dickens, for whatever reason, never crossed my path in high school, and in the years since I have found myself intimidated to pick up one of his books. This year I resolved to get over that and selected 'Great Expectations' to be my first venture into Dickens' famous fictional worlds. And what joy! As it turns out I had no reason to be intimidated because Dickens is imminently readable and highly enjoyable.This novel is told from the point of view of Philip Pirrip, nicknamed Pip, who begins his tale as a young boy visiting the graves of his parents when an escaped convict happens upon him and threatens him into helping him get food. This experience will have a huge impact on Pip's life, although just how huge is left to be discovered until much later in the novel. Pip soon finds himself in the service of an eccentrically, manically wounded old woman and her beautiful but cold-hearted charge Estella, whom Pip is doomed to fall for and spend the rest of his days pining for. He begins to feel oppressed by his poor life, anguished that his miserable situation will never be good enough to win Estella's heart. And so it seems to be a blessing when a mysterious benefactor takes Pip away from his home to make a gentleman of him in London. Certainly Pip is pleased to have been \\"rescued\\", but over the course of his teaching a curious thing happens to him: he begins to lose the humanity that had made him such an upstanding young man in the first place. He forsakes relations with his loving family, judges his best friend as a great guy doomed to failure, and slowly allows his finances to spin out of control as he begins to spend more and more of his unnamed benefactor's money.'Great Expectations' is, ultimately, a journey of self discovery. Pip rises in society and leaves his life behind him without realizing just how much it had been worth to him. When he reflects on all that has happened to him and wonders if the inaptitude he had sensed in his friend \\"had never been in him at all, but had been in me,\\" it is a thoughtful discovery that really makes you think about what is truly important in your own life. What makes someone a success? Is it the amount of money in their bank account? Or is it the friendships they forge? Does someone need to be educated to be happy, or can they just be satisfied with what they have? Dickens pulls you along through Pip's story with a great deal of wit and a dash of cynicism that, refreshingly, serves to enlighten the reader rather than depress them. It is an intelligent and heartfelt novel that has become a classic for all of the right reasons, and is one that remains relevant to modern readers -- the true test of a classic, in my opinion. As for myself, I have been thoroughly enchanted by my first experience with Dickens, and look forward to reading many more of his books in the coming year."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great Expectations was my first book by Charles Dickens, and I still believe it to be my favorite. It is a very powerful book that connects with people's lives all over. The main character,Pip, grows up in the home of a blacksmith. With both of his parents dead, he lives with his overreactive sister and her husband, Joe Gargery. Pip soon meets Miss Havisham and the beautiful Estella that lives with her. He longs to be a gentleman, but the social class division leaves Pip a blacksmith apprentice, and Estella a lady. However, one night, Mr. Jaggers (a lawyer)comes to Pip and informs him that he is a man of great expectations. Pip has no idea of who his benefactor is, but heads to London to start his eventful life as a gentleman.Great Expectations is a amazing book in many ways. Three of these ways are: the themes, the characters, and the writing. Themes in this book are very important. They can easily relate to us today, and these main ideas are crucial lessons through literature. Next, the characters. Dickens creates such perfect characters that they will stay in your mind and you will begin to link people you know to people in the book. Such characters include Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Mr. Jaggers, Magwitch, Herbert Pocket, and many others. These people in Great Expectations make the book enjoyable to read. Lastly, the writing is awesome. Sentences are easily read, and the suspense keeps you reading from cover to cover.Great Expectations will always be one of my favorite books, and I strongly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a challenge, and a excellent read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"An outstanding book that I read this year was Great Expectations. This was a wonderful classic written by the magnificent author Charles Dickens. Charles Dickens wrote a book that truly captivated the power of human love. He showed us that life can be very difficult, and you have to work very hard in order for you to succeed.In the beginning of the book, a character named Pip lived on a forge near some marshes in England. His family was generally poor. He lived with his older sister and her husband named Joe. Joe was a fairly poor blacksmith. One day, Pip was walking on the marshes. Suddenly, a strange man came up to Pip and threatened him. The strange man was a convict who was put to die on the marshes. He was handcuffed and chained. He told Pip that he would kill him if he didn't bring him a steel file and something to eat. Pip then ran back to the forge and brought the convict a steel file and some food. This vivid occurrence haunted Pip for the rest of his life.After the incident on the marshes, Pip met a lady named Miss Havesham. Miss Havesham was a very weird lady. She always wore her wedding dress in her house. She never left her house. Miss Havesham had a very beautiful adopted daughter named Estella. She was an arrogant woman. While looking at her, Pip fell in love with Estella.One day, a mysterious man came to Joe's forge. This man was sent by a secret benefactor who was residing in London. The man didn't give his name. He told Pip and Joe that someone in London was requesting him. The secret benefactor wanted Pip to come to London so that he could become a gentleman. Pip was very excited when he heard that he could work in London. Pip and Joe agreed upon the proposal. Later in that same week, Pip left Joe's forge to travel to London. There he could be a gentleman with a bright and bold future.While in London, Pip encountered many strange mysteries. Pip finally met his secret benefactor. Read the book to find out who the secret benefactor was...Overall, Great Expectations was an outstanding book. It really captivated the vast stretches of life. Great Expectations really made me feel quite sad. I felt very sorry for Pip. He had a very difficult life. He had change his personality forever once he became a gentleman. I would recommend this book to anybody who enjoys reading classics. I have read other excellent books by the wonderful author Charles Dickens. I have read Oliver Twist and The Christmas Carol. They were also excellent books."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I am 15 and reading is my least favorite thing to do. If I ever read, it's only for a few minutes. Not with this book, I read it all day, and so far have read it several times. I don't know about this edition however, b/c it is for younger readers. I am also sure that whatever edition you get will be great. This book shows tons of emotions, and is guided by the narrator, Pip. It is a superb book, that once you pick up you will never put down.Pip is raised by his sister and brother-in-law, both named Joe, b/c of his parents being dead. Pip has many scary and shocking experiences throughout this novel. It really shows how much Pip changes throughout the novel, from being poor to being a gentlemen, and at last realizing what really matters.Pip is an interesting and exciting character, who really makes the best of this book!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"It left me wanting more.

I read every page searching for why people loved this book! After reading the last page, I put the book down and felt disappointment that I still hadn't alighted on it. I realized Pip's selfishness once the wealth settled on him, and realized his turn-a-bout after losing everything to his name. But the book didn't fully finish in my thoughts, it just hung there without a sole purpose.

A wonderful novel of Pip who comes into his \\"great expectations\\" via an unknown benefactor -- who he believes to be Miss Havisham. We see how the influence of money and position affect Pip's relations with his family and former neighbors, and not necessarily for the better. There are lots of surprise twists and turns in the plot, especially about Miss Havisham and her adopted \\"daughter\\" Estella and her true parentage.As always, a Dickens novel is peopled with wonderful and unusual characters that eventually all play a part in telling the story. I noticed another reviewer said there were two endings. The version I read had only one ending and I don't know which one it was. I will have to search out another version to see which I liked best."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"First of all (as I like to say!)

Popular modern fiction is so often shallow, and as such seems a waste of time. Which is why I read Great Expectations, it has stood the test of time. I never read it in the past because I assumed that the prose would be somewhat archaic and difficult, but I was wrong, I found it very readable and surprisingly funny, which I also didn't expect.

And you absolutely forget that it is all one person reading. The wonderful descriptors Dickens so artfully paints in complete portraits and scenery with words, flow effortlessly, almost musically so that the it unfolds in the listeners mind as sure as one were reading Dickens' words.

Now if we could just get Page to record any of Wilkie Collins' work..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"\\"Great Expectations\\" is a thoroughly engaging novel. We find a set of interweaving story lines that rival today's best movies ('Crash' comes to mind. Sorry! I digress, already.) Anyway, as usual, the protagonist and narrator, Pip, bears all the innocense of Dickens' best characters. He is able to observe all the qualities and idiosyncracies of the good, the bad, and the ugly in Victorian England. As another orphan character, he is \\"brought up by hand\\" by his strict and nasty sister with the help of his brother-in-law, Joe Gargery, a benevolent blacksmith. The plot moves quickly as he comes upon an escaped convict who coerces him to get him food and a file. He finds the experience all too much, for he is in a no-win situation. He manages to escape this escapade with grace, but not the situation his sister places him into. She forces him upon the company of Miss Havisham, an old, bitter woman who has never recovered from being jilted early in life. Through her he meets a young woman, named Estella, and falls hopelessly in love. Through Havisham's patronage, he becomes an apprenticed gentleman as well as Joe's apprenticed blacksmith; then he obtains wealth from a mysterious benefactor. From these experiences, he acquires a gentleman's demeanor as well as a gentleman's appetite for money.\\"Great Expectations\\" is a worthy classic book experience. The characters are drawn well, especially Miss Havisham. (The images Dickens uses for her and her surroundings are among the most memorable of the novel.) It defines what true wealth is, and juxtaposes well the pompous and the hypocritical characters with the genuine and good. 'Great Expectations' demonstrates, more than it preaches, about the virtues presented. Also, the plot lines run together in a way that is so skillful, it hardly seems contrived. There is also some good irony and suspense thrown in for good measure. \\"Great Expectations\\" is a decent and enjoyable reading voyage."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens is a timeless 19th century novel that addresses issues in life that remain relevant today. In particular, it explores the modern individual's personal development through experiences that span from youth to adulthood.In Great Expectations, Dickens employs several techniques to effectively portray the personal development of the main character Pip. The title, Great Expectations, is significant because it reveals that the plot focuses on Pip's aspirations in life. The novel is a first person narrative, with an older Pip retelling and commenting on past events that had an influence on his social development. This element allows the reader to observe how a young Pip reacted to events in his life and how an older and more mature Pip interprets these events years later. A recurring theme throughout Great Expectations is the class system of Victorian England and the significance of social status. Pip struggles with the issue of social status throughout the novel and must come to the realization that social status is not connected to one's real character.In his novel Great Expectations, Charles Dickens combined aspects of his own life, with his knowledge of human behavior, to create a realistic portrayal of an individual's personal development. The novel's portrayal is so clear and its content so relevant that it continues to be read and analyzed over a century after it was first written."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"As young men and women, at some we must make the choice to stay in the community and be a humble fish in a little pond or strike out on our own in the big city.There are many ways to do this and Pip, the main character, does it scornfully although he does not know it at the time. Like so many people, he is lured by the bright lights, \\"sophisticated\\" culture and big money of the big city. He has no problem leaving behind a simple world where he is cared for via an unknown benefactor for an unknown reason. He guesses at whom the benefactor might be and what their intent is, but he gets it all wrong. He falls from the path of moral righteousness and has no idea what his life really means. Dickens masterfully crafts together this story. I think that Joe represented good Pip and Orlick was the alter ego. Additionally, I was kicking myself for not seeing a couple of plot twists, but I was so engrossed that I didn't see them coming. I hope the same thing happens to you.I wonder if F.S. Fitzgerald was influenced by Dickens because there is a fantasy like worship of the rich, followed by a downward spiraling degradation. Although F.S.F writes about the rich with outright contempt, Dickens neutrally accepts them more as a vehicle for the story.Anyway, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Charles Dickens' novel Great Expectations explores the side of human nature that many do not like to read in novels. In the United States, in the 21st Century, people would rather read about romantic-style plots where all turns out well for the protagonists. Dickens, however, chooses to illuminate what man can really be capable of: betrayal, duplicity, unfaithfulness, and a handful of other negative characteristics.Definitely an interesting novel, Great Expectations will undoubtedly have its audience intrigued and constantly pondering.I would highly recommend this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Unlike many of the reviewers who wrote so passionately about this work it is not a book that has played a significant part in my reading life. The great narrative drive, the tremendous skill in creating vital characters, the richly descriptive and often ironic language are aspects of Dickens genius.But somehow the world of Dickens dark and gloomy and Victorian and so British reality never really appealed to me. This says nothing however about the quality of the work and its great gifts to the reader. The book is the portrayal of a society, and of a moral education. This is a book about the formation of a character through experience, about learning from life's difficulties and disappointments to become a better person. It is about ' recognition' not only of one's own true and better self, but about what is important in life. This book as Dickens himself has had enormous influence on Western literature. I think of two very different writers, Kafka and Salinger both of whom clearly had Dickens in mind in certain points of their writing. Pip, Magwitch , Joe Gargary,Miss Havisham, Estella are living characters in the heart of Western literature. The book then I believe is far greater, far more than my own reading has given me of it. Not always apparently does the reader do justice to the work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"i was a assigned this book to read over the summer between 8th and 9th grade for my honors english (it seems as though many students are assigned this book going into 9th grade honors english. is it some sort of nation-wide standard?)... at parts the language can be thick and a little harder to decipher than most the language of most authors people my age are used to reading... this is only a slight hindrance, though, because about half way trhough the book (assuming this is your first dickens book, as it was for me) you get used to it and you seem to be talking like pip in real life!!!!!!!

The Martian Major Leagues starts today, so I grilled a warthog.One of the reasons that I found this book (in terms of literature, not food) so disturbing is because the Martian term for a hemmohroid is a pip.

If instead of being named &quot;Magwitch&quot; the convict had been called Bozo the Clown, and gave Pip balloon animals instead of money, I would have enjoyed the book much more.But, the thing that ticked me off the most (and Auntie, too!) was the way that Dickens never ended his sentences: instead, he just ran them on and on and on and on and punctuated them only with commas and semicolons, as if to say, &quot;this is my book, feel free to fall asleep; or, you could eat it&quot;: that reminds me of a very funny story about a man named &quot;Kitty&quot;...WHACK!(Auntie just hit me over my other head with a frying pan).

The Martian Major Leagues starts today, so I grilled a warthog.One of the reasons that I found this book (in terms of literature, not food) so disturbing is because the Martian term for a hemmohroid is a pip. In terms of food, it could have used a bit more seasoning, like a trip to Denmark. Of course, they didn't actually go to Denmark. If instead of being named &quot;Magwitch&quot; the convict had been called Bozo the Clown, and gave Pip balloon animals instead of money, I would have enjoyed the book much more.But, the thing that ticked me off the most (and Auntie, too!) was the way that Dickens never ended his sentences: instead, he just ran them on and on and on and on and punctuated them only with commas and semicolons, as if to say, &quot;this is my book, feel free to fall asleep; or, you could eat it&quot;: that reminds me of a very funny story about a man named &quot;Kitty&quot;...WHACK!(Auntie just hit me over my other head with a frying pan). The truth is... the only good part about this book is when Miss Havisham (the Martian) gets married to Pip. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH! HA.Ha."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I was required to read this book for english class and I must say it is by far the worst book I have ever read.

I would not recommend it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This book was a very big disappontmet. I thought this book could have had a couple minor plot changes. I also thought the way the main charictor, Pip, transfored through his expectations was shallow and padanthic.

I can't get into it at all! It's like a really boring nightmare! I mean, the parts that take place at Satis House are mildly interesting, but no part of it seems to be building up to anything. The story moves so slowly that at times you'd swear it wasn't moving at all, and, to be sure, at times, it isn't! It's just sitting there in its stupid rocking chair knitting and petting its cat by the fire, which isn't even burning! OMG!You want to read something fast paced and interesting?Try Daniel White's Hellstone, available right here at amazon.com (plug). Now that's a good book. White's influences span the ages, and don't skip Victorian, if that's what you're into, which you obviously are, or why would you be here?Don't get me wrong. I like Victorian literature. A Christmas Carol is a very good story, as is Dracula, and Frankenstein, and most of Poe's works. It's just this particular book that I don't like...and anything by Jane Austen.In conclusion, buy Hellstone. You'll be happy you did."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I have been a great reader my entire life, having read and enjoyed many classics as well as the modern books of today, but never in my life have I had such a difficult time getting through a book. I usually fly through novels within a few days, but getting through this one is likened to going through a maze in the dark. I give it two stars because I do think the plot was interesting, but the execution was abominably horrible. I actually had to have a dictionary next to me in order to understand all the weird words Dickens used, words such as 'peppercorny' and 'farinaceous.' Now, I usually pride myself on having quite an excellent English vocabulary, but I felt utterly lost when trying to read this book. Some of the dialogue was completely unfathomable and pointless, and about a quarter of the time I did not have a clue as to what he were talking about. Many of the characters were annoying, Mr. Pumblechook for example. I cringed during the chapter when he saw Pip, after Pip had become a gentleman, and the stupid man kept saying \\"May I? May I?\\" Ugh. There was so much this book could have done with out; the endless pointless descriptions, the useless minor characters, and the stupidity of some of them was unbearable. What I mean by that is Miss Havisham's voluntary reclusive existence; I mean, how can somebody live like that without going completely insane, just sitting in the dark day after day, wearing the same clothes, and throwing her life away for a man who was only after her money? Stupid and lame that was, if mildly noble (her behavior). I cannot understand why Dickens is so praised as a writer. His plot may be good in this book, but it is terribly written. I have made two attempts in my life to read this book. The first time, I got about halfway through and had to stop because it was about as enjoyable as plucking my eyebrows. A few years later, the second attempt got me to about the 42nd chapter, but again, my interest fizzled out. I do not think I will ever finish this book, and would only advise reading it if you have trouble sleeping, because it will knock you out fast. As a final note, I could not get through Oliver Twist either. Again, a great plot, but poorly written."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Reading GREAT EXPECTATIONS as a 14 year old high school student in 1967 helped me acquire a clearer understanding of the concept of infinity.

Fall in love with and his often misguided heart."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"It's ridiculous to review Dickens, who is as secure in the Western canon as Shakespeare. Nonetheless, I'll make two points about \\"Great Expectations\\", which is the first Dickens novel I've read since my adolescence. (Kennedy was President, alas.)First, I'll say that the characters in this book are affecting exaggerations and not quite real. For example, Joe Gargery, the blacksmith, is touching in his decency and saintly in his generosity. But Dickens gives him no rough emotional edges, and so he never rises beyond rustic sentimentality. Likewise, Hebert Pocket, Pip's friend, is a lovely young man but exists in friendship with out making any demands. And, there is the resolute and controlling Mrs. Havisham and her pathetic martyrdom. Yes, she was hurt by a man. But, it's hard to imagine a person living in the filth and disorder of her mansion, unless she is crazed, like a modern street person. To sum this up, I'd say that his characters are not really persuasive, even though they resonate emotionally.Second, I was surprised by the near total lack of visual effects in the writing. Early on, there's a moment of visual writing when young Pip is in the cemetery. But thereafter, this element is all but lacking in the book. Even after several re-readings, for example, I could never quite see Magwitch tumble into the river.Regardless, I enjoyed the read and did not find it discursive or too long. Go for it!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I liked this book even though sometimes I couldn't understand it. Charles Dickens used a lot of words he didn't need to, and he used a lot of big words that needed to be looked up. There was a lot of parts that I did not understand. Otherwise it was a pretty good story when I knew what was going on. I would recommend this book to other people because you learn about the lifestyles back then."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This novel was pretty good. I liked how everyone's lives in it were somehow connected. I also liked how Pip matures and learns the big lessons of life.One thing I didn't really like about it was that it was hard to understand. The English dialect was hard to follow, all the different names were hard to sort out, and there were manyold-time-ish and confusing words. But other than the confusion, the story line was great and Dickens wrote it really well and brought everything and everyone in the book together nicely. All of the characters were fun to read about and Dickens made them seem interesting and some very weird. I would recommend this book to anyone because it seems like anyone could connect with the characters in this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This book seems interesting as you would expect from Dickens, but I must admit that i found it boring. I only got past the first chapter, and found my self asleep. I think that the plot is a good structure that could be updated very well. If you can get past the boring language you will definitely enjoy it. If you went in with 'great expectations',then i doubt that you will come out with great pleasure. if you are put off by this review, hten check out the 1930's version starring the late Alec Guiness- it's absolutely brilliant!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I was assigned to read this book for my English class and I have never read a more stupendously boring book.It's almost 500 pages long and has a story that could be told in half that.A poor, young orphan has aspirations to one day be a respectable gentleman.Big deal. GE is a revered book but it lacks everything that makes a book truly great.There is very little theme or characterisation and the plot is virtually non existant.THe chapters are so long and meandering you have to force yourself to read them.You keep reading waiting for something,anything to happen.

This is the worst, yet! I don't understand why students have to read classics that people rarely understand! I thought the book was pointless with nothing to look forward to while you're reading. Many books have a strong structure and basis where you want to know what will happen next, which keeps you reading on. This story has no meaning and Charles Dickens is going no where with this. Not to mention the characters are just plaing weird. Where in the world did Dickens get a bizarre lady like Miss Havisham, who is practically ill in the head? I would never recommend this book because it was boring, time consuming, and I can rarely consentrate on what I was reading. I'm glad I got over reading this. I'm sure the only people who read this book is the ones who are forced to, like myself. If I can give this book's rating as a no star, I would.

This ranks with Catch-22 and Huckleberry Fin as one of the worst novels yet published in the English language. Was there a plot? No. Don't kid yourself.

I'd like to see all copies burned. Okay, not really. That's a little extreme. But, at least take this garbage out of school curriculums. Its' making us stupid, making us believe Pip's world is what the world really is. Pip if a fool that got dumped too many times and where's the sex. Was Dickens scared of it. I believe that all great novels should have sex in them. It brings some humanity to them . Great Expectations is a fantasy on level with the Bible but worse, tragicly worse."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great Expectations was a mediocre book. I was not impressed. I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class. It was too long and boring. I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real. It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill. Every chapter was boring. I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book. Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays? This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story. In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK! If you want to read a good Dickens story, read \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I didn't enjoy this book in high school back in 2000. I am re-reading this book again after 12 years.What an amazing gift we have inherited from Charles Dickens. I am enjoying revisiting the Victorian society again."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I was compelled to read Dickens (\\"A Tale of Two Cities,\\" in my case) in eighth grade and decided that I didn't like his writing. I managed to avoid Dickens and the Victorian novelists for several years, even as an English major. It wasn't until I was in my mid-20s that I read \\"Great Expectations,\\" and I'm glad that was so, because I was finally ready to appreciate Dickens. If you've ever picked up a Dickens novel and put it back down with relief, you might try again in a few years. If you do, \\"Great Expectations\\" is an excellent choice for meeting, or for encountering again, this amazing author.Like \\"David Copperfield,\\" this novel is written throughout in the first person, and follows the title character from childhood to adulthood. The first-person point of view gives the story vividness and impact, as we see everything that unfolds through Pip's eyes. The difference between the perspective of Pip the boy and Pip the adult, looking back and writing, colors the plot and creates suspense.There are many possible reasons to read this book (other than having it assigned to you, of course).You could read it for its astonishing characters -- Miss Havisham, defiantly moldering away and shut up in her never-used wedding finery; Magwitch, the escaped convict with a backstory you'd never expect; Joe Gargery, the blacksmith whose external roughness is matched only by his inner tenderness; Estella, as self-divided and self-destructive as she is beautiful. You could read it for its settings -- the spooky marshes, the busy streets of London, the gothic horrors of Satis House. You could read it for the plot -- the hidden connections, unexpected reversals, and ambiguous endings. You could read it for its social criticism -- the comprehensive view of working-class, middle-class, and upwardly-aspriring characters; the insight into what people will do to themselves and others for money; the unsparing look at ideas of gentility versus actual nobility of character. You could read it for its language -- the idiosyncratic dialects, the indelible scenes, the variety of prose rhythms Dickens employs.In the end, there are two main reasons to read this novel: pleasure and wisdom. \\"Great Expectations\\" is of its time without being dated, and can be enjoyed as a satisfying story. The themes Dickens addresses are timeless, and speak to the 21st century as forcefully as they spoke to the 19th.This isn't my all time favorite Dickens novel -- that would be \\"Bleak House,\\" followed by \\"David Copperfield\\" -- but it's one of his best. If you've never tried it, or if it's been a while since you did, give it a try. You may well become a Dickens addict."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"The DK series of classics are great!

Charles Dickens is one of my favorite authors of all time next to Sparks, Crichton, Irving, Brewer, and Bradbury. The story follows the inheritance into wealth of a fourteen year-old in 18th century England. Told with detail, finesse and a mystery that will keep you hooked, don't miss out on this first rate literary experience.The young orphaned Pip, the sensual Estella: the boy's love interest, the enigmatic and vengeful Miss Havisham in her bridal wear. These are images you will never forget. Pick up a copy (unabridged if you can) and loose yourself in this carefully and masterfully wroght world.I also recommend John Irving's works, mainstream fiction, and Dandilion Wine by Ray Bradbury.

I've had my copy of the book on the shelf for years, but never got around to reading it. Unfortunately, I spend more time driving than reading. Michael Page did a fine job reading all the roles with distinctive voices for each character, male and female. The total listening time was about 20 hours. There were many tracks on each CD. So if your CD player only remembers which track was playing when you stopped it, then probably the most you will have to repeat when you re-start the disk would be about 40 seconds. The recording quality was good, but the duplication process less than perfect. There was 1 disk out of the 16 that had some \\"popping\\" sounds. I do not know if every copy of the audio book will have 1 disk with some static, but my copy did. It was a little annoying, but was not too bad.

He did sound British!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"\`Great Expectations' is one of my favourite Charles Dickens', second only to A Tale of Two Cities. Those who are not habituated to his style of writing may find it a bit difficult, but eventually that hurdle too would be overcome and the reader can enjoy the work of one of the finest authors of all time to its fullest.Phillip Pirrip was an orphan living with his dominating elder sister with no great ambition for the future, other than to become a blacksmith like his brother-in-law, Joe Gargery. But that was before he inherited a large amount of money from a mysterious benefactor. Now, leaving behind his shallow ambitions and old acquaintances, Pip follows his dream of becoming a \`gentleman'. Then maybe the beautiful but cold-hearted, Estella, the ward of the eccentric Miss Havisham, would accept his love for her. But will the unsolved mysteries of his past hinder him from fulfilling his \`Great Expectations'?Though Great Expectations first appeared in Dickens' weekly magazine, All the Year Round, more than a century back the story and the characters of the book still live on. Like all other books by Charles Dickens \`Great Expectations' too, does not just tell a story but also gives a message to its readers. Pip after coming into his inheritance starts ignoring his old friends because he feels that they are inferior to him, little realizing that they were the ones who loved and cared for him when he had no money. This situation is not something unique or something that can be related to only by the people of that time. This happens with almost every one of us. Once we achieve our goals we conveniently forget about those who helped us reach that goal. The way Dickens' has woven this message in his unforgettable story makes the book all the more beautiful. One thing I liked about this book is how all the seemingly unconnected characters seemed to fit together like the missing piece of a jigsaw puzzle by the end. What makes this book truly unforgettable is its characters. Every character of the book has an eccentric side to them. The only character that I think is \\"normal\\" is Pip and I did not find him interesting at all (I like eccentric characters. Am I weird?). Maybe that's how the author wanted it to be. Though the book has only a few female leads, they are the ones who steal the limelight. The eccentric Miss Havisham who sits in a room with a rotting wedding cake, wearing her wedding dress seemed more alluring to me than any of the other characters. It was her eccentricity that truly attracted me to her. If she had been some old, moody spinster, I would not have liked her half as much.Though I have repeated the point more than once, but \`Great Expectations' is truly an unforgettable book. Combined with prolific writing and memorable characters, this book is something which should be read at least once by all.Favourite Quotes:\\"Suffering has been stronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be.

Having completed two of his greatest novels, Great Expectations and David Copperfield, I am a Dicken's fan for life! As an author, I realize how much I have missed. I love the old-english style of writing, the great history of Britain, and the downhome stories of boys, which seems to be Mr. Dicken's love. I am sadly impressed of the mistreatment of children of that era and am surprised that any were able to rise to achievement. What was true then, is true now - if we are to achieve anything in life - no matter our past, we must pull ourselves up by the boostraps and become... Excellent read.

Not me. Granted, part of the reason I enjoyed this book so much was because I had expected it not to be (A Tale of Two Cities is still collecting dust on my bookshelf). The writing is flawless; characters, wonderfully varied; and plot, save an occasional feeling of contrivance at the almost uncanny character interconnections, spectacular.Pip, an orphan, lives with his 20 plus years older sister Georgiana \\"Mrs. Joe\\" Gargery, an unhappy woman who \\"rampages\\" on him and her blacksmith husband Joe, a simple, kind man. During an unexpected encounter with a shackled escaped convict, he is coerced into helping the man to prevent bodily injury to himself. It's not the last the boy will see of him. Pip is later asked to visit an eccentric woman (having been left at the altar by a scheming fianc&eacute;), where he encounters the beautiful but cold Estella, a future love interest, and several other central characters. Eventually an anonymous donor provides monetary help to Pip hoping that it will facilitate his becoming a gentleman and a scholar. But as his financial situation changes from meager but adequate to one of relative wealth, his personality transforms from kindhearted and unpretentious to inconsiderate and snobbish. Only through the adversity that follows his attempt to fulfill the expectations of his benefactor does Pip learn some important life lessons.Also good, Mr. Pip by Lloyd Jones (wish I hadn't read it before GE), An American Tragedy by Theodore Dreiser, and The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"When I was a teenager, I loved Dickens. In later years, however, I abandoned Dickens for more overtly \\"intellectual\\" authors. The wonderful thing about great books is that they do not suffer from multiple readings. Returning to Great Expectations after maybe 20 years was a delight. It is simple, accessible, gently humorous and heartbreaking. Dickens' love of language is simply a joy to experience. The novel is beautiful, effusive and yet tinged with Pip's own discomfort of class and self. Dickens holds his own as the Master Storyteller of the 19th Century."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"All the standard Dickensian motifs are present in this book: deus ex machinae, factitious coincidences, longueurs, inventive names, an empathy towards children in a world of pompous adults, and sheer expository brilliance.Dickens paints a picture in your mind...you see the country, smell the air, and hear the voices of the characters as if they are actually speaking. This being Dickens, you must allow for some patness in the plot...grant that, and then you can enjoy the genius of his phrases, metaphors, characterizations, and recounting of the absurd.(Wopsle's go at Hamlet in London should have you laughing out loud.)This is an excellent book...a classic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"A dark night. A pair of escaped convicts; a young boy named Pip who is seven years old. Pip helps the convict Magwitch with food and drink. Magwitch is sent in chains to banishment in distant Australia. Pip living at the forge of Joe Gargery and Pip's sister (Joe's wife) becomes an apprentice blacksmith. Pip also meets the enigmatic Miss Havisham who dresses in a yellow wedding dress lamenting her lost love. At Satis her estate he encounter Estella (star) who becomes the love of his life. Estella is as cold as an Eskimo and her heart as icy as Mt. Everest. He also meets Herbert Pocket who becomes his best friend.In part two we see Pip moving to London as he and Herbert become dissolute, fall into debt and live shallow lives.In part three secrets are revealed which make Pip a good man. We learn that it was the convict Magwitch who provided the funds needed to allow Pip to go to London and work for Mr. Jaggers the lawyer. We discover who is the father and who the mother of Estella. We learn what happened to Magwitch and all other mysteries are revealed. To give these secrets away in this review would ruin the pleasure of reading this classic novel.Great Expectations is a bildungsroman which is darker and more inttrospective that Dickens earlier David Copperfield of 1850. In it we see Pip grow from a selfish callow boy to a man who has suffered, helped others and been reunited with his lost love.Along the way we meet such immortal characters as Joe Gargery and his loving wife Biddy; the tragic Miss Haversham; the evil Orlick and Compeyson and the complex convict Magwith.The novel is cinematic in its ending as Magwitch returns to England to see how Pip is doing as a young man who has lived on the convicts benevolent financial bequest.Some critics believe that Estella is a representative of Dickens mistress Ellen Ternan. The novel is well plotted and moves quicker than many Dickens novels. This 1861 novel is narrated in the first person by Pip and was the last completed novel in the prolific Boz's illustrious career.Great Expectations should be read by everyone who loves English literature and Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This is a wonderful story that Everyman's Library has place in great binding."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"If you have a student who either hates to read or struggles to read I would highly recommend this audio book.

Were I able to, I would give the book four and a half stars, rather than the four I've assigned it. As other reviewers have already amply commented on the book's numerous merits, I should like only to point out , what I thought to be, its foremost shortcoming. Although intentional by Dickens, I found my extreme dislike of Pip for much of the book to be a nuisance, chiefly because, as narrator, Pip set the tone of the narrative. It can be difficult not to equate the loathing of the narrator with the book itself. Luckily enough this was not a particularly prominent failing, and did not heavily tax me. Besides this, I found the book to be splendid, particularly during the bits concerning Joe and Mr. Wemmick, who were, at times, heartwarming and emotionally evocative to an extreme degree. In short, Great Expectations is one of Dickens's greats, with only minor, easily overlooked flaws."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"It is impossible to exaggerate the satisfaction this book gives to its reader and the power of its deep human sympathy. If you were to read only ten books in your lifetime, Charles Dickens' GREAT EXPECTATIONS should be one of them.If you were to listen to just one audiobook in your life, Frank Muller's narration of Great Expectations should be it. One of the most complimentary things that can be said of such a performance is that it leaves you feeling that the work can be read only in that way. Muller accomplishes this, with the curious and endearing twist that Pip's own narration comes with an American accent, while all others speak in the unforgettable idiom of their place among the English classes and subclasses. Muller on Dickens is a triumph that even Dickens would have applauded.Now, for the book. The personae will stay with you forever. Pip himself. The deeply generous Joe Gargery. The immortally beautiful Estella, her heart in the end made soft through suffering. Miss Havisham, too terrible to believed but in the end redeemed from her lake of bitterness, if her cry, 'What have I done?!' is to be taken innocently. Wemmick and the Aged P, then - belatedly, Miss Skiffens the gloved. Herbert, then Herbert and Clara.Jaggers, about whom one is left to ponder, 'Who *is* this man?'Dickens and Muller are at their best with scoundrels. Expectations provides them no shortage of villains upon whom to practice. Pumblechook. Bentley Drummle. Old Orlick. Compeyson, about whom the best thing said is that he has drowned.Dickens' keen eye for the glory and the pathetic depths of humanity is almost unparalleled in English literature, with apologies to his critics. He knows that there are Gargeries and Biddies and Herberts. He understands this without for a moment denying the hell in human hearts that is comprised by the likes of Pumblechook with his false respectability and Orlick with his violent, drooling hatreds.He has comprehended that heaven - if he believed there is such a place - is likely populated by people surnamed Havisham, Jaggers, and Magwitch, who perhaps dance the more vigorously for having been much forgiven.Yet writing *about* Dickens and his worlds takes time that could be spend on reading Dickens and of his worlds.For that you'll need to pick up Great Expectations."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Michael Page gives a wonderful performance that brings \\"Great Expectations\\" to life.

He's a master of all the things that make for great writing and storytelling. Dickens has an ear for dialogue most authors would kill their own mothers to possess. He also is a master of creating vivid scenery, another sign of excellence essential to great writing and one which many authors lack. Finally, but not least in importance, Dickens knows character development. He REALLY knows how to develop intriguing characters, to the point where many of his books spawned figures that have become literary archetypes. Not bad for a guy who grew up in extremely adverse circumstances. He even spent some time in a factory sticking labels on bottles after his father's imprisonment for debt. Most people wouldn't recover from such poverty, but Dickens did. He went on to a successful career in journalism before settling down as an author of serial novels. This format, which allowed Dickens to write and release his stories piecemeal, made him a great success with the public. The anticipation for the latest chapter or two of his stories often led to near riots. Not many writers can elicit such a response today.Many consider \\"Great Expectations\\" a seminal work by a master. Millions have read it, most unwillingly, but most consider it one of Dickens's most accessible stories. It's a tale about a youngster named Phillip Pirrip, known throughout the story as Pip, and his rise from relative obscurity to the heights of wealth and privilege. As the story opens, we see Pip lamenting the passing of his parents in the local cemetery. Their deaths resulted in Pip living with an older sister and her blacksmith husband Joe. Life is tough in Pip's village. His sister wields a heavy hand against her younger brother, relatives like Uncle Pumblechook berate him, and they live in a place where convicts often escape from barges floating on the river nearby. In fact, Pip has a frightening encounter with one of these prisoners at the beginning of the book. His actions, undertaken at the command of this felon, result in a series of incidents that lead Pip to the home of the local recluse, a dour old woman by the name of Havisham. This woman, as rich as a lord but as unhappy as one could ever be, takes a liking to Pip and keeps him around for entertainment.It is during his tenure as Havisham's court jester that Pip comes into contact with several important figures that feature prominently in the story's later episodes. He meets the cold yet beautiful Estella, Havisham's adopted daughter, and falls in love with her. He also makes an initial contact with the old lady's lawyer, the highly successful Mr. Jaggers, and an odd young man named Herbert. All play an integral part in what is to follow, namely the announcement (through Jaggers) that Pip has suddenly come into fortune, or great expectations, that require him to move to London in order to train as a gentlemen. In London Pip spends time with Jaggers, his assistant Wemmick, Herbert, and even Estella. He spends his money, helps his best friend in covert ways, and wonders who in the world set him up with this money and property. Jaggers makes it clear that he isn't supposed to dig too deep concerning the origins of the fortune. Instead, he is to wait until the day when the individual responsible steps forward. When that happens Pip's world as he knows it nearly collapses. He must move heaven and earth to avert disaster while at the same time coming to terms with who he is and what his future holds.\\"Great Expectations\\" is, in a word, great. It contains all of the hallmarks one associates with Dickens. The characters, everyone from Wemmick to Jaggers to Havisham to Joe, sparkle brightly as fully formed individuals living and laboring under very real problems. Atmosphere is divine: Pip's village and London come to life under the writer's pen. Even the author's penchant for examining social ills moves to the fore in a chapter that looks at the horrific conditions in London's main prison. Another real plus is the humor. If you haven't read Dickens, you don't know what your missing in the humor department. This author has an amazing sense of what is funny, and it is nowhere more apparent than in the scene in which Pip and Herbert take in a play starring one of our hero's relatives. This short chapter along with the ones describing Wemmick's abode are absolute masterpieces of hilarity, and they're actually bright spots in what is otherwise an occasionally dark piece of writing. And last, but not least, there is the downbeat conclusion. There are actually two conclusions to \\"Great Expectations\\". Make sure you pick up a copy that has both of them.About the only thing \\"Great Expectations\\" lacks is length; it's one of Dickens's shortest novels, which is probably the reason millions of teachers assign this book to their students. That's unfortunate because most kids want nothing to do with this book once it's forced upon them when in fact they could actually benefit from reading it. Why? Because \\"Great Expectations\\" teaches us a lot about love and identity, two things that matter quite a bit (or should matter) to young people. The teachers ought to assign something like \\"Hard Times\\" and let those who want more seek out \\"Great Expectations\\". The prevailing opinion on this book is that it is semi-autobiographical. It doesn't really matter whether the story is about the author's life or not. What is important, I think, is that this story attains a perfection that few books ever reach. That's why it's a classic, I guess. If you haven't read Dickens before, you should start right here."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great Expectations, 1860-'61, Dickens's second to last completed novel is the first tome I have ever read and is one of the best books I've ever read.The story centers upon Pip who is orphaned and lives with his mean sister and her kind husband Joe. The book's classic opening is when Pip meets an escaped convict and he forces Pip to give him food and then later is caught. Little did Pip know that this occasion will live on and he will be reminded of it in a very unexpected fashion later in the bookYoung Pip is then sent to Satis House to meet the very mysterious and eccentric Miss Havisham who, jilted at the altar spends the rest of her cursed recluse life in her rotting, yellow wedding dress in Satis House. Pip also meets Estella, a beautiful, yet very cold and proud girl brought up by Miss Havisham to hate men as revenge for her fiance's betrayal.Great Expectations is the story of Pip's life and of all the surprises (there's a lot of 'em folks) hopes: some lived some smashed, and of course, Dickensesque eccentrics who populate the book.Great Expectations is the first tome I have ever finished and I must say that it was worth it. Since I didn't have the book for a while, it took me about three months to read it but have no fear, for this is a pretty quick read with many twists and turns along the way.This book is often considered Dickens's masterpiece. Well, I don't really know about that but it has to be close to that. It certainly was a great read and I think you will agree."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I've taught this book in 9th grade for years because it is a curriculum requirement. During that time, I have raved about the incredible abilities of Dickens to create memorable characters, plot fascinating fiction, make the lives of ordinary people in England memorable, write incredibly descriptive passages . . . .The time has come to tell the truth. While it may be a great *work of literature*, Great Expectations is a tough book to like.There is much to appreciate - in the intellectual sense of the word - about GE, from carefully drawn characters to an infinitely detailed plot. Without exception, students love to play *connect the characters* as the novel progresses. They discuss the unrequited love between Pip and Estella, Biddy and Pip - they love the relationship between Joe and Pip. They are fascinated and repulsed by Miss Havisham and her house. They are shocked by Magwitch, and enthralled by his sacrifice. Truly, this has all the makings of a 9th grade *hit*! So what's the problem? Language,length, and format.The language is off-putting. So much is colloquial to the time and difficult to bring current. Joe's dialect (along with the convict's) is VERY difficult for my deep south students to imitate when reading aloud, and sometimes even difficult for them to decipher at all. Sentences can go on (and on and on and on and on) so that the end hardly seems connected to the beginning. While common when Dickens was writing, these patterns are a bit difficult for a modern audience.Length and format are a problem that go together. Originally published as a serial, this novel was presented a chapter or two at a time, with a wait between installments. That allowed a reader to digest the events in a chapter, contemplate the relationships, discuss them with friends and build up anticipation for the next installment. By virtue of that style, many side-stories are included that have little bearing on the overall plot. Likewise, there is much detail included that seems almost irrelevant when one is reading the novel in full. Those are the very things that fostered interest in the serial, and yet in a novel, they seem extraneous and confusing. At the end, the novel seems (just a bit) overwritten (and perhaps that is because it wasn't originally a novel).In summary, my feelings about this novel are mixed. The story itself is fascinating, but I find myself eternally dreading that time of year when I will yet again introduce it to another crop of unsuspecting students . . ."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"In this delightful edited version of Dickens immortal tale, Hugh Laurie reads.

I must have read it many times since, and everytime I read it, I am filled with array of emotions, and a deep respect for the author. Pip, the hero, is a character that embodies hopes, disappointments and dreams of every boy. As he narrates his life, we grow with him, see many people come in and go out of his life, and we feel with him his emotions and predicaments. Life is full of surprises, unexpected twists and turns, and this novel is a great chronicle of the possibilities of fate. But most importantly, this is a story of pining... and a novel worth pining for.Miss Havisham, the old lady, epitomizes eccentricity, while Estella in her cold abandon represents every heartbreaker. This story is about pining, about love, about friendship (especially Pip and Joe, and later Pip and Herbert), about relationships, and most importantly about what one feels and lives by. Like all Dickens novels, this is a very well written story, and is much more engrossing than any of its on screen versions. This is a story that must be read at leisure and it must be failing of the reader to try and compare it with some cheap paperback that one can scram through while watching a movie and munching chips and cola. Classics deserve respect, attention and concentration: dedicate yourself to one, and trust me you will discover a lot more.

Hardly things the average teenager of the 2000s can relate to.But if you're in your twenties, thirties, or forties, this book is as compelling a novel as you'll ever read. It's an opportunity to look back at Pip and ourselves, the great expectations we all have, and the major surprises, disappointments, and regrets of life.The adult reader can understand the vindictiveness of Miss Havisham, the pride of Magwitch, the true and rare friendship of Herbert Pocket, and, of course, Estella. Each man has in his life an Estella.Beyond the true-to-life tale of hope and defeat, is the wry humor throughout the book that a more mature reader can appreciate.Surprise yourself.

I also had to read this book when I was in ninth grade and I had no clue what was going on. Those kids might not want to admit it, but it was above thier understanding, I am proof of that. I decided to read this again and even though I was indifferant to it the first time I read, and realized it to be the literary genuis that it truely is. It has an amusing story line of the events that surround a young boy's life and how he copes with his coming into fortunes and life in general. But Dicken's masterful writing makes more than just a story line, it is also a social critique of Industeralized Society. For existance, Joe represents how life was before the Industerial Revolution. He was kind, hard working, morally upstanding, and happy, amoung other desirable qualities. Whereas Estella, for example, represented how it was during the Industerial Revolution. She was greedy, self-centered, controlling, and unhappy. This is also evident in Pip. At first he had the traits of the former, but once he got his &quot;Expecations&quot;, he exhibited the traits of the latter. Another part of his critique was the differance between the rich and the poor. There are other important ways in which he portrays them, but for lack of time the poor people were happy, whereas the rich were unhappy. Dickens is also great at describing setting and characters, so as some might see that as boreing, I see that as giving more depth to the story. He makes it seem like the reader is actually in 19th century London and meeting such interresting characters as Jaggers, Mr. Pocket, and of course honorable Joe. Anyone concidering buying this that is in high school, I reccomend not buying this because you will not undersand it, hence dislike it. But anyone who is already out of high school, or someone who read it in high school I would reccomend this book.

Understanding Dickens, one must remember that he wrote his book in chapters which were printed as excerpts in popular magazines of the time. Compiling these excerpts together results in a lenghtier novel.

It took me about 3 days to read, and it was kind of a fluctuating thing. Some parts of it I couldn't put down, while other parts I dragged myself through. On the whole, I thought it was a good book, but not one I would read over again for a while. Dickens' use of figurative language is exquisite, but sometimes I found it hard to understand at first. The way almost every character described is tied some way into the tale is fantastic. You always have to pay attention, for you never know when that character might turn up again. This is such a tragic story already that I wish it would have ended a little better. I know it broke my heart. All in all, I would only recommend this book to someone who is in the mood for a complex tragedy."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Even though I'm only in High School, this book had a deep impact. This book was extrmely well written, Dickens use of figurative language and his descriptive language was fantastic!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This is a great book, and if it's too 'complex' for you, you haven't read many good books, because it pioneered the layout of a novel. It is full of forgiveness, obsession, pride, disillusionment... rich and involving. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"My previous experience with Dickens is that I picked up A Tale of Two Cities, got about five pages, and then returned it to the library, yawning.Well, I finally decided that I would will myself through a Dickens novel. And I enjoyed it immensely. I can't say that the plot was especially thrilling -- nor the ending particularly satisfying. And yes, it is long, and if you just want to find out what happens, you won't find it to be of much interest. But what I like about the books is the attention to characters and details -- even ones that are almost irrelevant to the story -- but which kept kept me smiling and reading. In particular, his friend who is a clerk who has made his house TRULY to be his castle, complete with moat and drawbridge -- and who has an Aged Parent that had me laughing like crazy. The unexpected irony -- when Pip describes things to be such and so, but when it is clear to the reader to be much different -- I found to be wonderful. I felt that Dicken's had painted very strong visual elements -- by the end of the novel, I had very strong visual images of most of the characters and settings. I'm pleased to say that I have read a Dicken's novel and I truly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"i had to read this book for school and ill admit i wasn't exactly enthusiastic about it. But as soon as i started reading it i fell head over heals into Pips world. Great expectations is about a boy named Pip who lives with his sister and his brother in law Joe. He begins to visit the rich lady of the town who has a beautiful but crual adopted daughter named Estella whom Pip falls desperatly in love with. Pip finds out that he has a bennifactor so he moves to london to become a gentleman. He meets many people like the stiff lawer Mr. jaggers,the happy go lucky Herbert and Mr. whemmik who is a stiff as Mr. jaggers in the office but once at home in his casatle he laughs and has a great love life. this is one of those books that you can't stop reading. And the twisting plot and all the sub plots are just like todays soap operas. Happy reading"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"With a top notch cast and a wonderful, well planned adaption, this easily ranks as one of BBC's best radio drama presentations. The horror, romance, and tongue-in-cheek silliness of youth are all thoroughly portrayed here. Pip is as he should be... a sympathetic but misguided character whose life is spent in the pursuit of hollow happiness.The BBC drama does well on many levels...

Don't get me wrong I love my computer and I love modern technology but I will never, ever give up having books. I love the smell and feel of paper.

Do not touch it if you like literature!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"In honor of Charles Dickens' 200th birthday, I re-read one of the first of his novels that I experienced originally over 30 years ago. After having read some eight or nine other Dickens novels, revisiting Great Expectations was a somewhat different experience this time around.Like David Copperfield, this is a first person narrative. Being inside the mind of the central intelligence and narrator, the reader can only know what he knows. Therefore, there are fewer narrative threads and multitudes of characters to weave into a complex tapestry than there are in other great multi-layered novels such as Bleak House and Little Dorrit. The jovial wit and exuberance of Pickwick becomes saturated with a world weariness and verges on cynicism in most of the novels of the second half of Dickens' career. As one of his last completed novels, Great Expectations fits within this pattern.Pip is not quite the bland, colorless character that Oliver Twist or David Copperfield are. True, the structure of the plot almost demands that he be a passive recipient of much of the action. His fate is mapped out for him by the anonymous benefactor from his youth and it is not until well into the second half of the novel that he actively seeks to steer the course of his life with each subsequent piece of knowledge he acquires. Pip is not quite an innocent. From an early age, he is consumed by guilt over unknown sins he feels he has committed. He does fall prey to vanity and he descends easily into spendthrift habits and enjoys his unearned prosperity with shameless hedonism. His greatest sins seem to be pride and vanity, leading to the snobbery that fuels the snubbing of his faithful and saintly brother-in-law Joe. To his credit, he is self-analytical and examines these shortcomings as soon as he realizes he possesses them.The sentimentality that often mars even the greatest of Dickens' novels is muted in this one. Pip is fully aware that he is no angel and there are few \`catch phrases' as often appear in his other novels to signal the reader to be moved. On the other hand, the coincidences are piled a little too high for my taste and the evil Orlick subplot seems to be one adversity too many for this plot which can sustain its own weight on the saga of Pip, Estella, Miss Havisham and Magwich.As much as any novel, in Great Expectations Dickens captures the torture of a male's infatuation with an \`unattainable' female beauty, especially one so willing to inflict heartache. This novel still reaches across the centuries with an emotional power that is timeless and universal. Regarding the so called happy ending that Dickens revised as a concession to public sentiment, the ending for this novel is not quite so clear cut as one might expect in a Dickens novel. The last sentence, in particular, includes a double negative that in no obvious way equals an unequivocal positive. By doing this, Dickens is able to sustain the tone of the novel leading up to it and not betray the thematic thread he has followed for almost 500 pages. Despite its shortcomings, Great Expectations possesses a power never surpassed in his novels."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Anyone who loves the english langauge language will enjoy this book. Dickens is a master of description bringing to life the colorful characters. So, if you haven't read Dickens for years, pay him a visit ."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I had great expectations, because I had listened to a very good Charles Dickens recording by Martin Jarvis earlier (Hard Times), and Great Expectations was also good, even if it did not make me laugh quite as much as the Hard Times audiobook."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Read this when I was about 10yrs old, then saw the movie at an old theatre.

Used a dictionary and encyclopedia to figure certain things out.I purchased the BN classic and it provides a bit more history that one would have known, unless you've done a research paper on it. Other helpful insight & information one may not know during that time period or era. BN does a pretty good job."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens is one of the greatest novels I have read. First, I admit, I have difficult transitioning to Dicken's novels. They are written in English, but not in the version of the langauge I speak. However, after reading for a while, I am able to adjust to his style.This novel is great for many reasons. First, it helps me to understand the poverty and hardships faced by the poor in England during his time. Whenever I read one of Dicken's novels, I am always left with an attitude of gratitude. Additionally, in this novel, nothing works out the way I expect or want it to. I wish that Pip would not have acted as he did once he came into his great expectations. I wish that things could have worked out differently with Miss Havisham and Estella. But, the ending is well done. The twists are what I enjoy most from Dicken's novels. I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"As background information, I am in the process of reading most of Dickens 22 novels. I bought the Penguin Popular Classics version of the novel. It is very basic and comes in a simple green cover. It contains no introduction or analysis, just the text plus a very brief historical sketch of Dickens. It seems to be an excellent value for the money and I bought three Dickens novels in the series. I was a bit disappointed in that one book seemed to fall apart as I read it: the binding seemed very weak and cheaply made. It was marginally okay for the present book which is just 400 pages, and the book did not fall apart, but did seem damaged after one read. Another Dickens novel, which was 700 pages long, fell apart with at least 50 pages coming loose. After this bad experience, I bought other versions of Dickens's works - Wordsworth Classic versions and the regular Penguin Classic versions, the ones with the photo on the covers.Charles Dickens, who lived from 1812 to 1870, is the best know male English writer of the 19th century. He authored 22 novels plus numerous short pieces. Most of his writing was first written in serialized form, later published as single novels.A young Dickens at the age of 12 had the unenviable job of attaching labels 10 hours a day at the Warren's boot blacking factory. That experience shaped much of his writing career. Still in his teens he became a law clerk, then later in his twenties a journalist. The last job as a reporter led to the serialized writing of his novels. His works were social commentaries with larger than life characters, or colorful caricatures, living in the slums of London. He was a critic of poverty, social injustice, and the slow moving court system. Those themes permeate most of his novels and it is present her in Great Expectations. This is a novel set in London and the countryside close to London. It is a story of a young boy who wants to grow up and become wealthy and to be a gentleman. Those are his \\"great expectations.\\"Without giving away critical plot elements, it is the story of a young boy called Pip, whose parents are dead, and who lives with his sister and her husband Jo who is a blacksmith. They want Pip to learn the trade and be a blacksmith as well. They live in a small town near marshlands near London. His ambitions are grander and he wants to escape to London and become a gentleman. Will Pip find happiness? Will he succeed? Action shifts back and forth between the small town where Pip first lived and the city of London. It involves Pip, lawyers, accountants, Pip's new friends, his love interest, etc.The novel is not used by Dickens for any pressing social issues, although one might argue that it shows how Pip's ambition blinds him to his true friends. But mostly it is pure entertainment. The book is a classic but has a choppy feel that one can attribute to the way it was written. It was written as a series of dramatic stories for popular serialization which were then combined to make a single novel. I enjoyed the read and would highly recommend the book.Having read 10 of Dickens's novels I still rate David Copperfield as best, and ahead of the present book, both as a work of literature and for entertainment value. In many ways the two novels are similar, but the plot is far more interesting and realistic in David Copperfield, and Dickens has many more interesting characters in that book, and as a bonus it is almost twice as long."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Of all the negative reviews I read, the common theme is &quot;I didn't understand it.&quot; Or, &quot;I was forced to read...&quot; Truth is, it is a very solid novel; not the greatest, but very good and insightful. For those of you who claim not to understand this work, may I suggest a return to Winnie the Pooh? Give the book a chance, think a little about it, and you may be surprised."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I remember having to read this book when I was a sophomore in high school. At the time I hated the book with a blue passion. Basically becuz I didn't understand it. Just recently, I decided to give it another chance (fifteen or so years later) and could not put it down. Although Pip is the main character, I found my sympathies lying with Estella. So young, so beautiful... so hardened. Ms. Havisham, in her greedy bitterness, deprives Estella the chance of real emotion, real love. Although I believe Ms. Havisham realizes what she has done near the end of the story, it is much too late for Estella. The re-written ending, although it pulled at my heart-strings, didn't work for me. The original ending is the only logical, perhaps realistic, ending in light of the events that occur within the story. For you kids who are forced to read it, try it again in a few years. I know your perception will have changed."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I had to read Great Expectations for a class project. I looked at how many pages it was and froze; &quot;How am I ever going to finish this book?&quot; I thought. After about 30 pages I was hooked and read it in a week.

Dickens did a great job of tieing everything together at the end, and you know he must of had some master plan on what was going to happen!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great expectations is not only a great story filled with mystery, drama and action.

This is a treasurable addition to any collection."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"A book that captivates the ideals of entertainment, Great Expectations is a novel that cannot be put down. Having previously read &quot; A Tale Of Two Cities &quot; for an English topic, I was dissatified with the quality of work that Dickens produced and did not understand the hype surrounding his works and the popularity of sales. Great Expectations has changed my view entirely, as Pip, the protagonist will always be a person that can be related to and felt for. The life of the protagonist experiences many facets of human education, and the outcome is satisfing to himself and to the reader. Dickens has created a true exploration of people and how and who we are. Each chapter ends on a twist and torments the reader into further readings. The life of Pip and the events and characters that involve him work fluently and emphasis this theme. Dickens commonly gives subtle hints of information for the reader to use in working out the complexities of the novel, sometimes leading in the right direction, and other times, in a misleading direction. This keeps the reader informed and eager to process all the facts to conclude their own opinions. The ending is truely &quot; warm-hearted &quot; and acts ideally to conclude the novel. A splendid book not to be neglected from any book collection."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This may be Dickens' finest novel, for while it may lack some of the comic character that animates his other masterworks, it has a focus and coherence unseen elsewhere in his serial novels. Filled with memorable images and the pain of unrequited love and self-reproach, Dickens has invented a superb comment on wealth, on youth, and on life in general. (Youths forced to read it in high school may not understand the pain of looking back until later in life.)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I, too, languished through this in High School. I, too, vowed never to pick up Dickens again. Then something happened. This is not bragging: it just happened. I grew up. Any intelligence I had mellowed into understanding, a very different faculty. Saddened, changed, I picked up Dickens again. And at last, I understood. Great Expectations isn't a classic for its language, plotting, style or wit. Like all Dickens' work, it is faulted in these areas. It's a classic because of Dicken's passion, which along with Bleak House pours onto the page and if you are at the right time of life, into your heart. So to all the reviewers here who find him problematic, wait a bit. Read a little about the nightmare world he lived in, the choked waterways slimey and poisonous with oil, feces and dye...the dangerous, airless shacks stacked up on each other, the rotten food...when it could be had at all. If you can, too, research a little into the social mores of the day, because what Dickens says about Victorian manners is quite true: virtue was often toggled to wealth in an absurd attempt to justify those unworthies clawing their way to the top of the &quot;Beehive&quot;. Try Dickens again later, when you have grown old. He's a ripping good yarn, but you must forgive him...he sees people as tiny valiant miracles amidst a roiling world of injustice, farcical posturing, physical danger, ignorance and want, and he needs to tell you about it. He often jokes about it, because the society he was writing for was very touchy and required its medicine to be sugar coated. It is only after you've put a Dickens book down that the images--minus the wit--pour over you and like the smoke curling through a Dickens novel it occurs to you you cannot breathe..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Charles Dicken's novel, Great Expectations, teaches a lot to the reader. The best thing about the story is Dicken's development of plotting and characters. It is about a person who experiences grown and shattered expectations from childhood to teenagehood to adulthood. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; basically means what is &quot;expected&quot; in life: a job, a career, money, marriage, etc. Pip helps a convict, Magwitch, in the beginning, to escape by bringing him a file to file the convict's leg iron. In the second stage of Pip's expectations, Pip has always been thinking that his secret benefactor is a certain Miss Havisham (whom he met in childhood), because he thought that her daughter, Estella, was destined for him. At the end of this stage, the benefactor appears, and Pip finds that it is the convict whom he had helped so long ago!! He is filled with repugnance. And Estella also gets married to his most despised enemy. And he is deeply in debt. Pip's great expectations are shattered to pieces by all of this. Later, Pip has to deal with it in the third stage of his expectations, and the story ends with all the people around Pip married, but with Pip still single. But Estella's husband had done so much evil gambling, and he also died in a horse accident, leaving room for relief from Pip. So, the story isn't exactly a happy ending, but it's better than nothing.

I just wish I could ask the dead author some questions like Why didn't you let Pip grow the Hell up? That poor me, I'm a country peasant with no friends act got real tired real quick. Second question Where in his warped imagination did he get Ms. Havishom? News flash!

Miss Havisham, Pip, Magwitch, Mr. Jaggers, and Estella are the characters that you should think more about them understand them.If this is to be your first reading of the book, be patient with the book's middle third,because the real and important events starts very late;The story centers around a young boy--well, almost young man-- named Pip, and revolves around his growing into age. Much of Pip's worry and concern I could relate to--falling in love with a girl who only plays with your heart, growing up and leaving home for the first time, and discovering your true relationships with others and yourself.It is a darker work, but it has some exciting and entertaining parts to it, too. If a ex-convict came up to me, I would be so scared that I would run away.

The major themes of the story were kind of hard to understand because some of them are hidden in the story and Dickens doesn't come right out and say what's happening and sometimes he drags out the seen and makes it really easy to lose interest or just get confused.Dickens didn't really bring the story alive for me because I didn't really understand some of the parts in the book, but I did like the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"HOW I JUDGE A CLASSIC: I don't give extra brownie points to classic books.

It is considered to be his greatest work to many critics. I read the book and found that it was probably the most boring book I had ever read in my life. Overall the book had a pretty well thought out plot. To me though the book was a classic and masterpiece only when it was first became published. People now in the present are not very easily satisfied with a book with a good plot and are well written. People now are just more interested in books that have a lot of twists and turns in the story. They want be able not know what is going to happen next in the story. The book Great Expectations even though it was such a boring book it did have some very interesting parts. Also the book was overall well written by the author. One strength that the book had was the fact it had such interesting characters. The author had well character development throughout the book. All the characters in the book were described that you tell each character apart because of their personality or physical appearance. The main character Philip Pirrip also nicknamed Pip was very well described as a character. The author told everything possible about Pip so throughout the book you saw the main character grow into man and also grow as person in general. When Pip when through something you almost felt like it was you in the book. Also another strength in the book was the great setting descriptions. It was so good because when you were reading the book you could actually picture the setting in your head. The book had very little strengths because I was forcing myself to actually read it. If it had actually been actually interesting I would have finish the book in one day instead of a three weeks. The only reason that I actually read was the fact I knew had to do a report on it. The book had many faults for a classic book. The main weakness of the book was the chapters that were pointless and just there to take up space. The book seemed was written to just tell a story of boy without any really interesting parts. I was somewhat disappointed in the fact that the book was considered a classic book because a classic book to me is book that can interest anyone and any age. The book had great plot and well-written characters but I thought that the book could have been shorter. It could have been shorter and would still have the same impact on a reader. The reader will eventually find out that the book Great Expectations is just a book to read when you have nothing else to read. Think this book just wasted my time. I hated every minute that I spent reading this book. In scale of one through to ten I would give it a four. The book is fairly good but the book is simply too long to tell a simple and boring story of a boy named Pip. I wouldn't recommend this book because I think that the reader will be truly bored. Probably the main target audience of this book was of young adult. The book is good for that age range because of the somewhat difficult and confusing vocabulary. The book Great Expectations is just a book to be read when there are no more books to read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"this book basically bored me to tears, it's one of those books that you really have to be into from the beginning to get the story at all, like harry potter or lord of the rings. main point = if you're not a charles dickens fan, the amazon description doesn't amaze you, and even you've read it before and reallllyyyyy disliked, then this book is not for you."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"In my opinions, the book is alright, but not the greatest book ever as other people like to say.

The clothing would be torn apart and you would smell horribly. The cake would've been gone, too. And the aged one in Mr. Wemmicks apartment who gets happier the more violently you nod at him?

I'm sorry -- I know that by critical accord he's one of the finest and most influential of all English writers.

Dickens' tedious descriptions and constant indecision on how the plot should turn makes the novel lose it's potential merit.Thousands of scholars and other readers have lauded Great Expectations as the finest Dickens' work of all time. The fact remains that it appears Dickens could not decide whether to make this a tragedy or an &quot;all's well that ends well&quot; happy-go-lucky type of story. This is proven by his change of the original ending. However, any reader could give testimony of feeling &quot;yanked, strung along, or thrown about&quot; from page one as they wonder just what Dickens wants them to think about Pip and his less-than remarkable life. Should we sympathize, feel disgust, be concerned? Does he deserve Estella's scorn or is he a victim of circumstance?The more you read of this cryptic novel the more you grow to understand that Dickens doesn't know what his novel is about, either. The entire book seems to vary by the chapter. And the fact that the plot has a potentially good story behind it that Dickens doesn't care to elaborate on makes the entire thing a bit more tedious for the take.The fact remains that Dickens is a fabulous story-teller. He has accurate, unjaded descriptions, refreshing, occassionally bitter, sometimes triumphant plots, and enough suspense to keep you reading throughout the night. It's just that none of that takes place in Great Expectations.Holly Burke, PhD.Clinical Psychologist, Abnormal Psych.

But there are other great stories that Dickens has done such as \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" and I am unsure why this one is always required reading.The story itself is mildly interesting and the characters and dialogue are unrealistic. There were many times that I felt like I was visiting an insane asylum.Dickens is labeled as a classic author, and often that gives reader's pre-conceived notions that his novels must be good.

I was forced to read this novel in 11th grade and I couldn't finish it. Must be because I play too many video games, right?I'm a freshman in college now, and I still hate Dickens. Don't write me off as a slack-jawed Gen-Xer though, because I've read some pretty heavy stuff (Faulkner, Montaigne, Steinbeck, Salinger, Dumas, Hemingway, Vonnegut, Tolkien) and loved it. I eat up Mark Twain; &quot;A Connecticut Yankee&quot; was a page-turner for me, and &quot;Huck Finn&quot; is my all-time favorite book. I just don't like Dickens' writing style, which he shares with most other Victorian novelists: unnecessary verbosity, obvious pomposity about the self as a masterful writer. I agree that Dickens is one of the great storytellers of all time, and he may have had the greatest imagination for character development since Shakespeare. But his writing style turns me off."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I am currently being forced to read this book for my Honors English class in high school. I've already read it once before for a different class, so I know what I am talking about when I say this book is the ultimate cure for insomnia.I honestly try to appreciate what is *supposed* to be fine literature, but &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is about as entertaining as watching kale grow. First off, the fact that this book has two endings inspires a bit of skepticism in me. I've never heard of an author so indecisive that he would put two endings in a novel. It creates a generally unsatisfying conclusion, as you're at a loss for which ending to &quot;accept&quot;.Aside from which, this book has enough useless passages to fill a hundred pages or so. It seems that, basically, Dickens didn't quite know exactly what to write about, but felt the urge to *write* *something*. So he wrote &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, following the traditional poor-boy formula of his previous 15 or so books.I find it especially hilarious that none of my teachers have ever even read the bloody novel, but it's &quot;good&quot; according to the curriculum. In the words of someone from a certain other Charles Dickens book, &quot;Bah! Humbug!&quot;.Don't judge Dickens by this book, however. &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, for example, even though it follows the same &quot;poor-boy&quot; formula, is worlds better than this.As much as I'd love to say, &quot;Oh, it's a classic, everyone should read it!&quot;, I personally don't think so."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great works of English literature from the 1700s and 1800s shared one thing in common; twists and turns in the plot lines that are never fully exposed until the last lines of the book. Chief among these twists are reversals of fortune both good and bad. So goes this work of literature. Though read by many as children, I would consider it more worthy of young adults, as the text can be quite boring for anyone below their teens. Basically, the plot revolves around Pip, a boy who grows up poor in the care of his sister and apprenticed to a blacksmith; a blue collar job by any standard. But he comes into an inheritance which he gladly accepts, leaving behind his previous life. A second theme of this story is his awe and obsession over Estella, a pretty girl who he meets first when young and poor when she does not even see him, and later one when he is rich when she cannot look past him. This is the probably the part of the book best remembered; a boy infatuated with what he cannot get, only to re-encounter it on later on in life as something he might not want anymore.As a book, it is shorter than most of Dickens' work, and much easier to read. But it has less historical meaning, and to me, less exploration of social ills than his other works such as Oliver Twist and Great Expectations. The book focuses more on personal travails, and how relationships between individuals all depend on the where the individuals came from. The book is interesting enough, but not that exciting, and I would not consider it as a mandatory work for all students to read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I liked this book, I really did, I promise. But in my opinion, Dickens's other novel &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; is much, much better.So before you buy this book, check out &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; as well.

That doesn't mean that it will be better in all people's opinions."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens, was a very strong novel. I enjoyed it, but found parts of it confusing and difficult to read. It is a very &quot;deep&quot; novel which has twists and turns throughout. In the begining, Pip was an orphan who went to live with his sister (who was mean) and her husband (who was an OK guy.) Later, he goes to the home of Miss Hauisham. She is a lady who is kind of crazy because of a past situation. Her lover left her years ago. Here is where Pip meets her daughter, Estella, who is very beautiful ( and who was always moody and was spoiled.) Pip falls for Estella (I guess he can put her personality aside.) Later on, Pip becomes wealthy but he can't figure out who left him the money (He thinks it was Miss Hauisham.) It ends up that a man named Able left him the money. When Pip was young, Able asked him for food. Pip got it for him and Able was convicted and he was forced to move away. After he moved he became wealthy and because of Pips heart and help, Able left him a fortune. As for the end... you can read it for your self and find out the suprises. My only complaint is that there are some confusing parts (as I said above.) Overall, I really enjoyed this book and reccommend it for people who like Dicken's work. To be honest, when I first got this book I did not want to read it. I figured I would just rent the movie with Gweneth Paltrow, and base my report on that. It is SO DIFFERENT. The book and the movie are not alike. I decided to read it and so I did. I reccommend this book for people who like Dicken's work. He really did a great job with this one."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great Expectations must have been what the readers of Dickens' serial publication must have had when they first read it, and I have to wonder if they were as disappointed as I was after slogging all the way through to the skewed, disjointed, and extremely contrived ending. This was written as a serial, not a novel, and I think Dickens (and his readers) would have benefited from a rewrite before publication in novel form.If ever there was a novel that set out to have no meaning, no core, no arc, and most of all, no satisfaction, it must be Great Expectations. The novel's title clearly states Dickens' perspective and intention; that great expectations in life will be met by great (and bitter) disappointment, and the greater the expectation, the greater your disappointment in life will be. The idea that a woman jilted at the altar will spend her life grooming a young girl to make other young men's lives miserable, is a contrived, almost paranoid idea from a male's perspective. Mrs. Havershim's great expectations for life were dashed, because instead of moving on to meet a better man, she chooses to become a shut-in and ruin a young man's expectations for life. However, if it seems that Dickens is building towards some kind of message about not having overblown expectations and then being bitter if they don't work out, the reader is to be disappointed. Dickens goes out of his way not to make this point or any point, but to make a grimly sad tale bereft of any kind of compass or solace for either the characters or the reader.Pip, the protagonist, survives his encounter with the damaged Estella, who had been deliberately damaged by Havershim to be \\"unable to love\\". The ending, in which he encounters her again briefly and is glad she is able to have the heart to \\"understand his heart as it was\\", is unbelievable, pompous and drowning in its own self-pity, all at the same time. It also feels as if Dickens took a perfunctory way to get out of a story that had meandered its way away from him.Great Expectations must be the most disappointing, overblown \\"classic\\" novel I have ever read, not because it doesn't have a happy ending, but because of the way that Dickens has created his characters and shapeless mess of a story, and presented it in the most abrasive fashion possible. I was relieved at the end to have finished it, not satisfied, not sad, and certainly not edified. There is nothing to learn or grow from in this novel; it has made me less of a Dickens fan. And that is the most disappointing result of reading it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I'm surprised that this book is a requirement in highschool. I had to read it in my upper division English Lit class in college and I just couldn't get into it. There are way too many retarded characters on which Dickens spends too much time, Pip gets more annoying with every page, especially his love for Estella who is one of the most disgusting characters in the book.

I'll give it that. Magwitch and Miss Havisham are definitely original and entertaining. But everyone else is pretty bland.Pip's love for Estella is rather pathetic. Why he would love such a despicable person is beyond me. This fact alone makes Pip difficult to relate to, and thus not a very good choice for the point-of-view character.But the one thing that absolutely ruins this book is the clutter of coincidences. One of the first rules of fiction writing is NO COINCIDENCES. And Dickens goes out of his way to break this rule. Over. And Over. And Over.Really, it is not a very good book. Please do not wasted your money on it (although there are a LOT of pages, so it could last you months as toilet paper"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Of all the Dickens novels I've read, this one is certainly the most atmospheric and perhaps the most true to life. In terms of art, this is probably his supreme achievement. The plot isn't as convoluted as it is in Bleak House. The action is more dramatic. The female characters, particularly Estella, are more believable and (in the case of Miss Havisham, for instance) more intriguing. The sentimentality and the overall length are under tighter control. The humor still abounds. The language is easier to read but no less descriptive. No, it's not a perfect work -- there are still cloying and annoying characters and incidents, and far too many ridiculous coincidences -- but to me, at least, Great Expectations is Dickens' greatest achievement."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"The book \\"The Great Expectations\\" was probably originally intended for middle-class adults in London. Today however the book is read and understood by both children and adults. Some things about the book that made it worth reading was first and most obvious the story line. Also the book seemed to go really fast. The story started with action wich made the book more enjoyable to read. Also it didn't get bogged down very much throughout the entire story. Another good quality of the book is that it didn't contain much romance, which can also slow a good book down. The main point of the book that affection, loyalty, and consience are more important than social advancement, wealth, and class, could have a strong affect on certain communities. Since this sort of theme has been around for a while and will continue to be around for a while gives the book credit for being a classic. Also the fact that this book is fairly old and is still being read to this day makes it a classic. The book was written in great detail. All the characters were fully described and all served a purpose. That also made this book very interesting. I would recommend this book to middle school students, and to adults as well as anyone in between. This book and the main idea was not difficult to understand. Also it is enough of an action and \\"turn around\\" book that it keeps the readers attention even to the end."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens was a very good novel in my eyes. The main character Pip believed, as a true Victorian, that a gentlemen is made solely of financial aspects and physicall possessions, and he is oblivious to moral aspects of the positions. Upon recieving his great expectations, he moves to London for a further education, and to become what he thinks is a gentlemen. Through Pips life he learns that his life as a gentlemen is not what he thought it would be, and his views of a true gentlemen start to change. With thanks to Dickens and Great Expectations, we realize that sometimes even a convict may be more genteel than a traditional gentlemen. He may start as a poor orphan boy, like Pip, or labour as a blacksmith, like Joe. truly, what matters is the heart and inner worth that make a genuine gentlemen, and social prestige has not a bit to do with it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Although one of the first Dickens books that I've read, it is still one of my favourites. The scenes with Miss Haveisham's ghost wedding banquet are haunting and have stuck with me for years. We see how Pip saw this abandoned wedding banquet, and then we follow Pip and his subsequent relationship with Miss Havisham as he grows up. Miss Havisham, for some reason has resolved to take out her considerable vindictiveness on little Pip, and we see how this moulds little Pip's character. We also see the positive effect that a prisoner (Joe Gargery) has on Pip. The tone of this novel is quite gloomy throughout, but it does end on a positive note. Although gloomy, it does have Dickens' usual warmth and humour displayed throughout, and of course his wonderful characters.

In his journey, he meets several different people, like Ms. Havisham and Estella, for example.

We meet Pip as he describes his sister who &quot;raised him by hand.&quot; However, despite his misgivings about his sister he still feels very fondly towards his brother-in-law Joe Gargery. He meets many extraordinary characters along the way one of them being the classic literary figure Miss Havsiham. Miss Havisham had a broken heart and she raised her daughter Estealla to view men the same way she did. As Pip grows up and moves out on his own he becomes the only person to know the true identity of Estella. The other important character in &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a criminal. He had threatened Pip in the marshes when he was a young boy and came back from New Zealand many years later to see Pip again. All though the criminal meets his untimely demise we still grow close to the character and miss him when he goes. This book gives an excellent view of not only a young boy's thoughts and emotions but outlook as well. It takes you on a journey that provides you with many lessons that can be carried throughout your life. Despote the magnificence and brilliance of the author's writing it is still a very difficult book.

As he strives to become a gentleman, aided by an anonymous benefactor's money, he succeeds only in alienating those who love him best and most honestly. Appearances, as in most Dickens novels, are deceiving, and those who are wealthy in a material sense are not those who are wealthy in the emotional sense and vice versa.The language and sentence structure are both complex; if you have any difficulty in understanding this sort of English you'd do well to wait awhile before reading GREAT EXPECTATIONS, because Dickens' brilliance is in the wording. This is less humorous than many of his other stories; however the humor is there if you look for it and listen for it in the phrasing.Dickens provided two endings for this book, and, frankly, I don't care much for either...but read the book, read both endings, and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This is a story that only Dickens could tell, and no Hollywood screenwriter can capture the same.

He helps Magwitch out and then Magwitch takes the blame and gets sent to Australia to pay for Pip's crime. Pip is then invited to play at Miss Havisham's manor with her ward Estella. And Miss Havisham uses Estella to despise any man. Since Miss Havisham was betrayed by her husband to at the altar by not showing up, she feels it's her life's duty to make all men suffer. So Estella makes Pip feel horrible for his hands and only allows him to get close enough to toil with him. You feel so sorry for Pip and how he is tormented by Estella.

I have also become a great admirer of the work of Frank Muller, who has recorded countless works, both popular novels and classics (including Moby Dick, the brave soul!)When Mr. Muller sank his teeth into Great Expectations, he created a performance with the perfect combination of innocence, humor, irony and adventure. He had me laughing out loud despite being stuck in terrible rush hour traffic.The actor manages to become the characters to the point where you forget only one man is reading all of the parts. He has created convicts you could easily picture, and almost smell. His portrayal of Joe Gargery makes you love the character for his heart of gold. His portrayal of Wemmick's \\"castle\\" and the \\"ancient\\" was so hilarious I was almost in tears.Of course, Dickens had quite a bit to do with it too.I realize there are countless recordings of this great work, and I'm sure this won't be the last I will ever hear.

It follows the interesting story of a boy named Pip throughout his many life experiences and different phases of his expectations. The plot is connected in a unique way throughout the book, and mysteries are solved and connected with it. Through his beautiful writing and interesting plot, this novel is arguably Dickens's greatest work. The language does require your full attention to understand it, and it is a very long book, but the writing is so great that you don't really notice to much.The tone of the novel is pretty dark and gloomy, but there is a constant sense of hope throughout. With themes of social class, guilt and innocence, and ambition we see Pip grow as a person and learn about the struggles and trials in life. There is also a bit of a love story that occurs that puts some fey real emotion into the story.I would reccomend this book to younng adults and adults who have the ability to understand the writing. I would reccomend that a person read it when they are looking for a good book, but have plenty of time to read and really take the story in.

Lo and behold, I came to find that the sentence, as published in this edition, is NOT what was supposed to have been written. Doubtless it is a (large) typographical error, but it changed the entire ending of the novel. Shameful to have happened, particularly for a book that markets itself towards classrooms and reading groups.The only good thing that developed from this experience is that through my research I discovered an alternate ending that Dickens had originally intended to use. Reading about the controversy between the two endings was interesting. Aladdin's nonsensical third ending was not.

Dickens has given us a wonderful story, with rich details of the setting and characters that grow and are among the most interesting and magnetic to be found in literature.I don't need to go on and on about the book itself(although I could easily go over my allotted word count here), if you haven't read it yet ,just know you are in for one heck of a literary treat. It is a story that will transport you to another time and place, and you may not want to come back. I will however, talk about this marvelous audio book. Michael Page is the reader, and what a reading he gives. Just curl up and listen to this master storyteller. Every voice, every nuance is captured. There is no doubt who is speaking as he gives each character the personality and cultural characteristics as Dickens intended. He even does the women wonderfully, without going over the top. In my mind Miss Havisham has always sounded just the way Page portrayed her, Estella as uppity as ever,the humble Joe, along with all the rest.If you are a fan of this book, this audio edition will give you a fresh read and new appreciation of this fascinating book. If you are experiencing it for the first time, you can't help but to become enthralled. Great to take on long drives or for younger readers to be introduced to classic literature in a most entertaining way.Enjoy the read...for the 1st Time or the 50th time!....Laurie"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Read this book in high school many years ago and probably did not understand the story fully. Just reread it and I absolutely loved the story. The depth of the characters is amazing. You feel like you have know them all of your life. Much more enjoyable now than at the high school level."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Pip, the main character in Charles Dickens's Great Expectations, writes the story in first person as a middle aged man looking back on his life. Pip's parents die when he is young making him an orphan. Pip is \\"brought up by hand\\" by his sister, who treats him with scorn. His sister's lack of love, however, is tempered by her husband Joe, a blacksmith. Joe is a simple, uneducated man and Pip's only \\"friend\\" during childhood. Pip commiserates with Joe about his sister's verbal thrashings, trying to make the best of his unhappy upbringing.Early in the story, Pip has an encounter with a convict in the cemetery among the marshes near his home. Unbeknownst to him, this man would be the source for his \\"Great Expectations\\" later in life.One day Pip is invited to the home of Ms. Havisham. Ms. Havisham is a single, eccentric, old woman who stopped living in the real world many years earlier when she was spurned by her lover on her wedding day.Ms. Havisham has adopted the beautiful Estella, and from the moment Pip meets her, he is infatuated with her beauty. Estella represents wealth, education, success, and opportunity--things Pip values but thinks he will never have.Dissatisfaction within himself grows as he wants to be more in life than a partner with Joe in the forge. Pip becomes unhappy not only with himself, but also with Joe, who represents what he does not want to be--uneducated and simple. Failing to appreciate Joe's moral character, Pip's world view begins to change as he sees education as something to be attained--the sure way out of his wretched life and the means by which he could woo the object of his unmerited affections, Estella.Pip's life changes dramatically when he is visited by a well respected and fiercely admired lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, who brings him an unusual message. Mr. Jaggers tells Pip he is to receive \\"Great Expectations,\\" but the benefactor is to remain anonymous until and only if they choose to reveal their identity. Pip mistakenly assumes the benefactor is Ms. Havisham, and the manipulating, self serving woman does nothing to dissuade him from his incorrect assumptions.The story takes Pip to London where he lives a life of excess and discards many virtues from his childhood. He no longer wants anything to do with Joe and believes his future course has been immutably set--that he is to marry the beautiful Estella. He shares his indulgences with his new friend, Herbert, whose acquaintance he had made years earlier at Ms. Havisham's place. The two of them rack up excessive debt as Pip sees himself as \\"a man in waiting\\" for all his fortunes to come to pass.Things are not what they seem, however. It is eventually revealed that the benefactor is not Ms. Havisham but the convict, Mr. Magwitch, whom Pip had met in the cemetery many years earlier when he was a young, impressionable boy.Pip is confronted face to face with the despised convict, hounded by the remembrances of him torturing him in the cemetery, dreams that lingered, causing him much consternation. But now he has to accept the undeniable truth that his turn of fortune is not because of Ms. Havisham's provision, but the despicable convict's desire to make him a gentleman. The convict wants his life to be redeemed for something good and chooses Pip to be that vehicle.Through a series of events, Pip acknowledges the inexcusable way he has treated Joe and wants to make amends. Before he can accomplish this, however, other happenings complicate his life. The convict, now in England, needs Pip's protection. Pip must make a way for Magwitch to leave England without being discovered.While Pip hides him with a trusted friend, Pip comes to realize that the convict he had earlier despised has more redemptive qualities than Pip has within himself. As he makes provision for the convict's escape, Pip sees Magwitch change for the better, and in so doing, Pip also changes. Instead of hating the convict, Pip grows to love him. The self centeredness of Pip's indulgences is replaced with care, not only for the convict, but in growing degrees, for others.In the process of trying to escape, the convict is attacked by his long-time archrival and enemy. As a result, Magwitch is severely injured, discovered by the authorities, put on trial and convicted, but dies from his injuries before his death sentence can be carried out. Magwitch's estate is turned over to the authorities to make restitution for past wrongs. Pip is left penniless and obligingly accepts that his Great Expectations and source of income have dissipated into nothing. Meanwhile, Estella marries someone else--a man whom Pip despises.A few years earlier, Pip had secretly made arrangements for his friend Herbert to have a small expectation out of his \\"Great Expectations,\\" amounting to a sizable sum of money. When it becomes known to Pip that he will lose his \\"Great Expectations\\" to the authorities, his only thought is for his friend. Pip returns to visit Ms. Havisham and requests, in a show of repentance for the wrongs she had done to him, a sum of money that Pip could again secretly provide to Herbert.Herbert wisely uses this money to successfully buy into a business venture. He later marries and moves overseas in his business pursuits--none of which would have been possible without Pip's anonymous provision to Herbert.Pip credits this as the only redeeming thing he has accomplished, reflecting on all the other things he did or didn't do that could have been used for good.Pip falls ill following the death of his convict friend, Magwitch, and Joe comes to England to care for him until he is well. Joe surreptitiously leaves early one morning when Pip is sufficiently recovered, and when Pip wakes up, he discovers Joe has paid off all his creditors. Pip immediately returns home in penitence to confess to Joe all his past wrongs, realizing that Joe is a better man than he. He recognizes in his now humble state that his \\"Great Expectations\\" deceived him into using it as a source of pride against Joe.Upon arriving home, Pip's expectations are not what he envisioned. His sister who raised him by hand has long since died as a result of an attack on her by the evil Orlick. His childhood friend and confidant, Biddy, has just married Joe. In the end, redemption works its way for good. Joe and Biddy are happily married and the sore memories of Pip's sister are forgotten.Pip returns to London and within a month, leaves England and joins Herbert's firm, Clarriker and Company, overseas. Pip lives abroad with Herbert and his wife, and after successfully making partner, eleven years later, returns to his boyhood home in England. He discovers Joe and Biddy now have a son who reminds him of himself.Before bidding Joe and Biddy a final farewell, Pip makes one last trip to the Havisham place, the old woman having died many years earlier. Pip discovers Estella in the garden, a chance meeting since she no longer lives there. The old house and brewery have been torn down and sold off except for the garden enclosed by the ivy covered wall.Years of a stormy, failed marriage have softened Estella's vindictive, prideful nature, and she confesses that \\"suffering has been stronger than all other teaching and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be.\\"The reader is left to ponder whether Pip and Estella ever marry because Pip says, \\"I saw no parting from her.\\"In the end, Pip learns much about what matters--wisdom he would not have possessed if he had stayed working at Joe's forge. As a middle aged narrator looking back, there is sadness but sweetness about what he has lost because of what he has gained. Perhaps the reader is the real winner, having seen redemption on so many levels within each character. In the end, if we are honest, we can identify these shortcomings in ourselves. If Pip can work out his \\"Great Expectations\\" to bring redemption, perhaps we can, also--that is, again, if we are honest. Our sinful nature will always be there, but if we look for good, God will not disappoint us. Maybe \\"Great Expectations\\" will not only find us, but redemption will be there, too, just as it was in Pip."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This was my first time to read a Dickens book i thought i wouldn't like it but once i got to know all the people and there ways which were very funny ways at times, i really enjoyed the book and couldn't but it down i love the sweet friendship Pip and Herbert have in the story but the best thing was Joe how could you not love Joe in this story!!!! he wasn't the smartest person but he was the best person..!!!,Im not sure which ending i like most but i thought they were both good in there own way.. ;)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This particular book is just the right physical size, as are the type and font, to make it easy to read, unlike any paperback version you are likely to find.To enjoy Dickens is to enjoy his preposterous characterizations, clever and cutting wit, wonderfully complex story lines, and of course his trademark maudlin interludes or devices.The latter make a pretty rich broth making one of his books go a long way. His use of language too causes one to undertake his novels fully prepared to spend time parsing his sentences and consulting a dictionary in order to satisfactorily comprehend his writing.In other words, Dickens can never be read lightly even though, strictly speaking, his work might be considered light reading.'Great Expectations' is particularly worthy of close reading for, whether intentionally or not, it harkens back to 'The Odyssey' by Homer. Yes, that's right, apart from being a truly ripping yarn, the gist of which you can doubtless cull from other amazon reviews, this is a book in which Dickens examines or, more accurately, lays bare the inner workings of the (male?) human psyche.Humans are raised upon a diet of myths of human perfection, a list of which is endless; superhuman athlete, heroic military personnel, idealistic politician, anointed prophet, perfect mother, exalted leader, etc. What Dickens does in this great book is discuss the contradictions that lie within us all that make us heroes one moment and cowards the next; paragons of virtue on the one hand, and unprincipled thieves on the other; selfless benefactors today and greedy self-servers tomorrow.Most of us believe ourselves to be endowed with above average amounts of courage, generosity, and charity, etc. In addition to pointing out such conceits, Dickens proceeds to demonstrate how we maintain these notions while acting in radically contradictory ways to them.This brings me back to Homer's 'Odyssey,' and also to the works of Wm. Shakespeare which are the West's most revered examinations of man's psyche. It strikes one that this book is Dickens' effort, successful and brilliant effort, to do as they have. Granted, the latter's work is sentimental and written to be broadly popular; however, this accessibility in no way can hide the fact that Mr. Dickens addresses fundamental human truths/traits in this book.Based on amazon reviews, this book is evidently assigned to many 9th grade English classes. What a shame, as it is doubtful that such a young person has yet had a broad enough experience of the personal contradictions that allow us to tick. Perhaps Freshman classes would be better served by 'The Great Gatsby,' 'Catcher in the Rye' and similarly glib works, leaving sublime works such as this for later years. (It could be argued that early exposure might arm one against future bad behavior...the point Dickens makes though is that we can't avoid ourselves.)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great Expectations follows Pip's life goes from childhood to adulthood with many twists and turns.

It was rewarding and fun to see in my mind's eye, and take pleasure in, the huge banquet of tasty and very often humorous nuggets offered.

AS an adult though one can appreciate it more because we choose to read the book instead of it being an assignment that needs to be completed for school."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Dickens was part of a great humanistic effort, of the 1800s, that more than ever evoked and espoused the Christian principles of human respect for one another. Great Expectations is about the unexplicable evil youth encounters and how one should rise above the hate and vindictiveness of stupid, petty people. It is a book that explains that there is great suffering in the world and there are those that will hate you for no other reason than that you look the way you do, or simply for the fact you exist in the form you are, or have the ancestors you have. And this hate may never be fully exposed, but be there none-the-less, lingering in mysterious shadow and never seen. An honest read of this book by my ninth graders allowed some, who felt anger and self-pity in the form of vengful hate, to rise a little out of their cycle of dispare. The greatest revenge, some say, against your oppressor is to live happily. The book shows how a vengeful heart is so self mutilating and unfulfilling. Great Expectations runs the coarse of someone who managed to forgive. It is a moving book and one that gives inner strength and respectful grace and recognition to the divine in all of us. It is better to not get bogged down in a discussion of Dicken's personal life, which is a mixed bag, but just read the book. Why would ultra feminists hate this book? Because they hate. Hateful people will hate a book that so poignantly exposes these wreched people for what they are. The book also shows, most significantly, and contrary to much of the belief of the time, that bad people can reform and become good. The significance of this, and its effect that Dicken's made upon this notion, is as haunting and deep a goodness as the evil Mrs. Havisham placed in Stela's soul."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great expectations is a very good book. It has action and a meaning. The book starts off by pip, which is a young orphan boy, going to a graveyard to look at his parent's tombstone. Then a escape convict grabs pip and tells him to bring him food and a file for his chains. The next day pip brings the man what he wants and then police capture the man but he protects pip and says he stole the food because he is touched by pips kindness. Then one-day pip is taken to the satis house, the home of miss Havisham, pip meets a beautiful young girl named Estella and falls in love with her. One-day Jaggers who is a lawyer tells pip that he has received a great fortune from a secret benefactor. The man tells pip he must go to London immediately to start his education as a gentleman. Pip thinks miss Havisham has given him the fortune. When pip is in London he finds new friends and begins to treat his old friends coldly, especially Joe. Several years later a familiar face comes in to pips room it is the convict, Magwitch. He then tells pip that he is pips benefactor. Pip then agrees to help him escape London. Compeyson is pursuing Magwitch and pip later finds out that Compeyson is the one who left miss Havisham on the alter and that Estella is Magwitch's daughter. Pip begins to care for the convict but later Pip hears that Estella has married another man. When Pip goes to visit miss Havisham she catches on fire and is burned badly. During the escape attempt Pip and Magwitch are capture by police. Magwitch is sentenced to death and Pip loses his fortune. He gets back together with Joe and later ends up marrying Estella and living happily ever after. I think that the author of this book could have made this book in 3rd person instead of 1st and it could have made it better. I think that this book was well writen had had a good message of dont let money go to your head and know who your true friends are. I recommed this book to anybody."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"It may be difficult to rehabilitate Dickens from the reputation assigned to him by his critics, such as his being labelled as a spinner of popular yarns; a prime representative of Victorian strait-laced morality; a notoriously verbose prosaist whose writing teems with rhetorical redundancies and digressions; a careless plotter and over-plotter with a propensity for hyperbolic and grotesque comedy, depicting grim and depressing situations peopled by caricatures and abnormally exaggerated personages. The criticism that he commits a number of unforgivable Freudian flaws cannot so easily be obviated as well. Unlike the more firmly established exponents of the realist novel, such as Stendhal, Balzac and Dostoevsky, with their searching psychological assessments of character and motive, Dickens seems concerned mainly with evoking the idea of a certain character and not the character itself in its concrete, three-dimensional actuality. This explains his penchant for caricature. Nevertheless, his ability to present concrete characters is illustrated in &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, one of his later and finer works, particularly the characters of Pip and the convict Magwitch, who are psychologically profound and sympathetic portrayals in comparison to the host of other characters. His ability as a profound satirist and social critic is conclusively demonstrated by his interweaving his analysis of class, injustice and crime with the narrative. Pip, who finds himself elevated from his humble origins to one of the highest strata of society, by being made into a gentleman by a mysterious benefactor, is shocked to discover that this same benefactor, the agent of his social progress, is a despicable criminal who offends him by his sight. The message is obvious: society is a complex network of interrelations that interpenetrate class divisions; Miss Havisham is jilted by Compeyson, who is Magwitch's accomplice; Magwitch is the benefactor of Pip, who is in love with Estella, Magwitch's daughter. All, Dickens seems to say, are equal, regardless of their class or origin, before the judgement of God, which transcends human judgement. This is memorably brought out in the courtroom scene, during Magwitch's trial, in the description of the shaft of light that illuminated the room, \\"between the two-and-thirty [prisoners] and the Judge, linking them both together and perhaps reminding some among the audience, how both were passing on with absolute equality, to the greater Judgement that knoweth all things and cannot err.\\" Dickens's moral is the necessity of human fellowship, which we see lacking in the dehumanised Jaggers and Wemmick and in Estella and Miss Havisham, who both come to tragic or regrettable ends, through their coldheartedness and pitilessness. This quality, Dickens's use of plot coincidences to deliver profound human statements, partially redeems him from the charges of being a mere popular storyteller or a romanticist. In this respect, and also with regard to his verisimilitude in rendering authentic detail, he invites comparison with the great realists, such as Flaubert and Joyce, the masters of radical and even amoral realism, though Dickens, with his undisguised moralising, his chaste heroes and puritanical heroines, does not sit comfortably amongst these two; both of whom had works banned, one for his apparent frankness, the other for his obscenity and scatology. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; remains, however, as one of the great representatives of the realist, or social, novel, the product of an age that abolished serfdom and slavery, that witnessed the Industrial Revolution, the growth of large towns and the expansion of business enterprise. as such, it is an invaluable document of its time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"A classic British novel written by Charles Dickens, Great Expectations, is a great novel with a very good moral at the end.

Also, the cover does not press an image of the characters or setting onto you, and allows you to picture your own Pip or Estella. Other editions of this book might not give you so many resources and be so reader-friendly. I am glad that I was forced to read this book, because I would have never read it on my own, or I would have quit after the first book---- which is a little boring, but reveals some very important facts to develop the intricate and complex plot.

As a kid, we had this book on our Literature List and every time we had to write down the answers of Literature tales, it was rather strenuous and boring as this meant to be a part of education. However, when it came to conduct a teaching class in literature, Great Expectation turned out to be an adventure. Unlike Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, Pip is not really a hero and also it does not end a Happy ending but Pip is being stripped of his wealth and his position in society. Pip is sent to London to be educated as a gentleman, he is impressed by the wrong people for the wrong reasons. He neglects and abandons the honest, hardworking folk who care for him and his pride is hurt when he learns who his mysterious benefactor is. Pip express guilt for his behavior who have a violent nature and crude ways but altogether he is courageous too. Pip, his father surname being Pirrip and his Christian name Philip, that's how he is called \`Pip' , has a fascination for Estella but is brought up by Miss Havisham to wreck revenge on all male sex and break hearts. Herbert Pocket is a character who has frankness was amiable and cheerful who became a friend of Pip. Dicken's novels have a central theme \`rags-to-riches' tale of a poor, underprivileged boy who is finally accepted into society. Strangely, this one has a different end. A nice read and great pick for Classroom Literature workshop."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"When i first red the book in the highschool i've looked through like Pip. But after some years, when i'm reading it again, now i can see it like Dickens do... It's a novel that anybody can selfexplain on any time of his life. If not, he's very lucky..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"It's a shame that most people resign this book to their \\"having already been read\\" list as a result of this novel being assigned coursework in junior high or high school. Dickens was a master of depicting subtleties of human relationships and personalities. Great Expectations illustrates this gloriously. Whatever can be said of Pip, is that he is abashedly a hopelessly human character. I sincerely can't imagine a young reader to identify with the maturity of these character's substantive familiarities with one another. Please don't write this book off, because you feel as if you already know the plot line and story because you read it young, I guarantee, read as an adult, this celebrated novel will take on a whole new light when you have been out in the world and experienced the complexities of the human condition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I respect the point of view of the reader who said that he/she can't add much to the opinion of countless generations who read this classic for the past 150 years. Classics last this long because they're masterpieces, and hence this work deserves five stars.The only thing to add in my point of view, is that I won't be surprised to learn that Dickens wrote this story especially for school boys who are really struggling to identify themselves and determine what is really important in life. No wonder this is one of the most required readings in middle school. In other words, adults won't find in it a mature story like the one in Steinbeck's East of Eden, or the taboo-sex theme of Nabokov's Lolita. This is about a young boy who goes on a long journey and ends up finding himself and realizing what really gives him happiness in life.As for the ending, there are two endings; published and unpublished, and I like the published more. Don't read further for I will give the ending away, unless you've read it already, but in the last paragraph Pip says that the mist of the evening when he held hands with Estella reminds him with the morning mist when he left the forge. The way I see it is that Estella will go through the same journey that Pip went through when he left the forge and went to London, the journey that was initiated by Estella's father and that helped Pip to be a better man. Now Estella will go through a journey initiated and guided by Pip in order to make Estella a better woman. Magwitch hurt Pip in the beginning but Pip helped him so Magwitch gave him all his money. The money was gone but was left was more important than money: The journey and experience that made Pip a better man. Estella was mean to Pip, but Pip loved her, and destiny put them both on a crossroads at the end of the novel, but because Pip loves Estella and because she is Magwitch's daughter, Pip decided to walk with her in a journey that will make her a better woman.Magwitch and Estella, father and daughter, never met. But there was a link between them; Pip, who became a better man because of the father, and who will now pay him back by making his daughter a better woman. Great Expectations is about the magical and ironic links between people, and how the person who you think hurt you the most may end up to be the person who helped you the most. The fact that an evil man is not as evil as he seems, and a pure man is not as pure as he seems.And these are just few of the many other themes in this classic. So the bottom line is, this novel may be more meaningful to the middle school son than to the forty something father. Read it early before you get older!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Victorian society got a good spanking when Great Expectations was published, at the time Dickens's anger and frustration was at one of its highest points. Pip, the novel's protagonist - I hesitate to call him the hero - is at once likeable and recognizable as a powerful symbolic tool, though the former quality intentionally decreases as the novel progresses.Pip is joined by a cast of the most memorable characters in literature - the cold, ethereal Estella, the crazy, wounded Miss Havisham, loveable dullard Joe, whip-smart lawyer Jaggers - the list could, and possibly might, go on for pages. If there were literary awards for Best Ensemble, the characters in Great Expectations would clinch them all. The characters function as both political/social symbols and, though they exist in a time period far removed from us, identifiable and memorable figureheads that will - and should - be a literary hallmark forever."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I first read this about 12 years ago as a teenager in High School of course at the time I could not possibly comprehend everything that is going on. On a whim I decided to reread this novel and am very happy that I did, Pip, Joe, Estella, Mrs Havisham all these charecters are so colorful and well written it amazes me. This novel covers a diverse collection of human emotions such as love, friendship, loyalty, shame, and forgiveness. If the only time you read this it was mandatory reading for freshman english do yourself a favor and pick it up again and reread it I found it very worthwhile."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Many reviewers have called this Dickens' greatest novel. One reviewer says it was the first time a character's feeling had been explored in such detail. These things I cannot comment on - this is the first Dickens novel I ever read, and I am not familiar with other works of this period. I can say that it was a damn fine read though.I must admit, maybe it was a convention of the time, but there were a great many impossible coincidences in this story. The term &quot;soap opera&quot; even crossed my mind at one point. In the end I forgave these improbable coincidences because the story was so compelling, and the novel so old, and the author of legendary repute.I loved the saint-like character Joe. I think he was my favorite character. And Dickens does a masterful job of showing the friendship between Pip - the protaganist - and Joe and especially Herbert. Miss Havisham is the picture of the bizarre rich recluse. And Estella the epitome of the cold-hearted shrew. All of the characters are rich.And it is true, as many other reviewers have commented, that so many issues are explored in this work. The meaning of true love, genuine friendship, the implications of &quot;moving up&quot; and it's effects on family and friends, good fortune, redemption, etc. It's all there - life is there.The book was slow at certain parts, but most of the time I found myself eagerly turning the pages. Dickens is a master at compelling his reader to turn the pages. What will happen next? At some of the titanic coincidences and plot turns I found myself thinking, &quot;what?! You've got to be kidding me...&quot; and then begging for more. I think you will too.There are some deeply heartfelt moments. Deeply heartfelt, touching, that inspired warm feelings in me. It was a pleasant change of pace from the darker, more cynical literature of today (though there are evil people and violent actions in Great Expectations as well). The final lesson of redemption is truly heartwarming."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This is my favorite book. I've read it at least 6 times, and it is still a wonderful story. Dickens makes you feel what little Pip feels on the unexpectedly interesting journey of his life. From his childhood encounter with an escaped convict to a mysterious rise to riches and fame later in life, I am completely immersed in his story. The tale of his love for a girl named Estella who, not only will never love him, but emotionally tortures him every day of his life is heartbreaking yet somehow familiar. There are subtle lessons to be learned from this book. If you haven't already read it, you should."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"All that can be expected from great English classic is here.

The narrator, who is also the main character, addresses you directly and colours the whole story with his own amiable personality. Indeed, one can imagine that the novel, published in instalments in that long bygone era before radio, television and other non-printed media, was conceived to be read out loud in the family parlour.The characters are straightforward, captivating and likeable. Totally removed from any realistic complexity, they are all the more memorable: nave, honest Pip; distant, cold, condescending Estella; devoted, loyal, simple-minded Joe; mysterious, ethereal Miss Havisham; etc.The plot, convoluted, wholly implausible and a tad predictable, evokes harsher but so much simpler times. Though by no means a cliff-hanger, the work is suspenseful and the reader's interest is expertly sustained throughout.Extremely well written, peppered with tongue in cheek humour, this archetypal novel is strongly recommended to any audience, particularly in audio form."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I needed to purchase 3 books at one time for my daughters high school assignment, I was given a \\"short\\" notice.

As all of Dickens' tales do, this provides a look at life for the ordinary man in that time and place, England in the 19th century. It is also a parable about the worth of people as judged by their wealth, status and power vs. their character and more. It is filled with wonderful character studies that only Dickens could do: Miss Haversham, stunted and destroyed by her bitterness, in turn doing great damage to the beautiful, cold Estella. The star of the novel, the orphaned Pip, raised by his shrewish and abusive sister and her wonderful, loving and simple husband Joe, the friends Pip makes, etc. Mr. Prebble reads this great novel as no one else can. He brings the characters to life so I could feel their emotions. All of the characters had unique voices and suitable accents that matched them perfectly. I was particularly moved by his portrayal of Joe. By the way, Mr. Prebble's beautiful, very masculine voice does the female characters believably. One does not even think about it. Thank you, Mr. Prebble, for narrating this novel and providing me with the best Christmas I've had for a while."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I loved it! In fact I remember reading Great Expectations during a 7th grade English class and getting in trouble for not paying attention to what was being taught. I came to this book on my own, as opposed to being made to read it, and while the lenth and the language was challenging for the first few pages, I remember falling head over heels in love with Dickens' style. This was the first time I felt myself get lost in a book. I've read it several times since in the last 14 years and I get lost in Pip's world every time!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Yes, the prose is overlong. Yes, the English language has evolved since Dickens' day, so you'll be using the dictionary feature on your Kindle often. But Great Expectations transcends time to bring a very relatable story to modern readers. The mystery deepens at every turn, the characters develop more fully and, if you open your mind and relax, the book's a downright page-turner (or page-clicker, for Kindlers).I tried reading this classic when I was younger and less patient, but it took a 40+-year-old me to 'get' it. Perhaps young people need to experience life and the lessons we all learn to really appreciate Great Expectations. Perhaps they relate a little too much with the freshly made gentleman and don't really understand why he castigates himself for his behavior. Or perhaps they're just not patient enough to 'zen out' and enjoy the book for what it is. Whatever the reason, I sincerely hope the young people who hate this book today, will pick it up again when they're more 'seasoned' - then they might just understand why it's a classic.If this review gave you information that was helpful, please feel free to click the YES button below!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great & free down load to PC Kindle product; yes, Kindle has a free software download so that you can read their books on your PC too.

The typing errors throughout the book ie.words that all ran into each other, and even pages of the story missing, made what should have been a pleasant read into a chore to finish it.I had looked forward to re-reading all the old school classics on my new Kindle but if the conversion of the old publications to e-readers are of the same standard, then I will not want to do so.I fear that \\"Oliver will not be asking for more\\" unless the recipe is improved.I have rated it only one star ,not because of Dickens Story but because it was spoiled for me by it's typing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"I am no english literature purist by any stretch of the imagination but I did have high hopes for this book.The characters are realistic to the period but the story is very slow.

She is 14 and it was easy for her to understand and follow."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Like many other reviewers, I read this book because it is a requirement in many English classes. Although the plot becomes interesting at times, the majority of it is filler. The book is filled with pointless characters and chapters devoted to run-ons of Pip's thoughts.Because the book was written so long ago, it is also very difficult to connect with. The character relationships are annoying. The romance between Pip and Estella becomes very hard to believe, because Estella is not a likable person. And the dialect is very unbelievable. It is hard to picture someone using Joe's speech patterns, even in old English times.While there are probably many people who will enjoy this novel, I would not suggest this book to someone looking for a quick read (meaning high school students). It is very difficult to skim and requires alot of time to appreciate. If you have a lot of time on your hands and you enjoy long, character developing novels this book may be for you."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"This was an interesting book. It is the first book by Charles Dickens that I had ever read. The language was weird but that was because it was a British novel written in a different era. I enjoyed it though because it was a escape to a different era and time. I plan on reading several other works by this author. It was slow to start but only because I was not used to the writing style or language. I would recommend."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"The setting of this book is in the Elizabethian era. Class, titles, and wealth is veryimportant around this time period and Dickens shows the importance in this great novel.Another theme of this novel is that not everyhting is as it seems.The story starts with Pip(Philip Pirrip) at the graveyard. He went to visit his dead parentswhen all of a sudden he was snatched by an escaped convict. The convict threatened Pipsaying that he will slit his throat if Pip did not bring food, a drink and a file. Pip did whathe was told and felt guilty for helping the convict out for many years after.He is asked to play at Satis House where he meets Miss Havisham and the beautifulEstella. Pip hoped that Miss Havishams intentions were to make his fortune, make him agentleman and have Estella to wed. He was wrong, instead Miss Havisham's intentionswere for Pip to fall in love with Estella and then have his heart broken.After this dissapointment, Pip hears news that an anonymous benefactor wants to makePip a gentleman and give him a fortune. Pip believed that the anonymous benefactor wasMiss Havisham but instead it was the escaped convict that Pip helped when he was ayoung boy. It gets even more interesting when Pip finds out that Estella is the daughter ofthe escaped convict.This novel comes with interesting twists and great themes that can have a reader thinking,\\" whats going to happen next?\\" I recommend this novel to any reader who likes a greatstory."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"The reason I choose to write this review is quite simple: to tell of a great book that gets better every time you read it. The compelling twists of &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are very involved and makes for a book that not only comes off extremely in depth but also entertaining. I first read this book and high school and have since read it twice more.

Sometimes I didn't get it but othere times I did and did think Charles Dickens made it easy to understand. I don't think he should have written so many characters becasue I lost track of who was who and where they were at. He should have written more to the ending, like what happend to Pip and Estella.I did like when Pip started realizing that just because you have money dosen't mean you can be mean to people like Joe and Biddy and everyone else that do't have as much as he does. I liked how toward the ending everything kind of came togeter; that's whenI really understood who was who.

The theme is worthy enough of study, though, and the reading is enjoyable. Recommended."},{"Title":"Great Expectations (Enriched Classics)","review":"Great Expectations is one of Dickens less &quot;weighty&quot; novels. It is slow-moving and at sometimes tedious to read. While the setting and characters are developed well enough to draw you in to the story, the plot is quite unbelievable and the book sometimes tedious at times.The story is about Pip, a young working class boy who comes into great wealth because of a mysterious benefactor. He abandons his good old friends Joe and Biddy to follow his heart towards Ms. Havisham and her cruel daughter Estella. Also dragging along with him are Hubert, his friend and confidant, Magwitch, a filthy convict, Mr. Wopsle, a bad Shakespearean actor, Mr. Jaggers, a vindictive lawyer, Mr. Wemmick- Jagger's more amiable assistant, Molly, a servant with a mysterious past, and Old Orlick, whom you'll know all about at the end of the book.After my first go through, I gave this book a second chance to grow on me and read it again, but it didn't.

Don't You Want Somebody to Love is a distinctly personal perspective on those times -- part self-deprecating, part self-aggrandizing, it's a priceless account, written in an authentic voice by an actual participant.Much of the text concerns Darby's views on the development of the 1960's scene in San Francisco, and on the rise of the counter-culture in the USA in general, about which he often provides thoughtful commentary. There's also plenty of stuff on the music of the Great Society -- how they rehearsed, how and when songs were written, and who played what, on which song.There's also a great Stanley Mouse cover, a bunch of reproductions of Great Society concert posters, and a decent, if somewhat random, selection of black and white photographs."},{"Title":"Don't You Want Somebody to Love: Reflections on the San Francisco Sound","review":"My brother-in-law kindly loaned me his copy of this book. I was looking forward to reading about the genesis of the San Francisco music scene from a real insider's perspective. In it we learn that Darby Slick authored the first of the &quot;hippie hits&quot;, Somebody to Love, and was in the vanguard of the embryonic San Francisco psychedelic music scene. We get to meet Bill Graham, Janis Joplin, Grace Slick, Jerry Garcia, and others while they were still nobodies just trying to follow their dreams. Unfortunately, the book needs massive editing to make it more than a rambling collection of anecdotes that often follow one another without segue. The author's priceless stories are often less than coherent, and it seems that he rarely finishes a thought before jumping to another in a stream of consciousness style. What we do come away with, though, is a tantalizing picture of some of the key players and events that somehow managed - without a plan - to push American culture from straight to hip (at least for a while!). I'm sure that nostalgia freaks will forgive the typographical errors and loose copy editing, but we all would have appreciated a sharper focus."},{"Title":"Don't You Want Somebody to Love: Reflections on the San Francisco Sound","review":"First off, I know this book has been reviewed already, but it brought back some of the many memories from that whole era, that I felt compelled to write something to hopefully defend it from others who find it lacking. While there's nothing earth-shaking, no life-changing information, it's a pleasant, sometimes enlightening read. And that's what it's supposed to be. What some find as literary faults or shortcomings, I find charmingly innocent. To each his own. Slick doesn't pretend to be Norman Mailer (or whoever you like), he's just putting down on the page things he found (finds) interesting, and hopes maybe you will too.Is this great literature? No. Is it supposed to be? No. It's simply one person's account of the things he saw and experienced at the very beginning of the \\"hippie movement\\", in the early 60's. And how the whole scene changed and morphed into something a bit different. And ultimately, the author's quest for learning and (again ultimately) finding himself after a long journey of discovery. The author, Darby Slick saw it all.Darby Slick was the guitar player in THE GREAT SOCIETY (sometimes referred to as THE GREAT! SOCIETY, or THE GREAT SOCIETY!), and composer of \\"Somebody to Love\\", one of the true \\"60's hippie classics\\" of the era. In this (131 pages) book, he gives a personal account of what things were like from his perspective, from his little corner of it all.The chapters are laid out chronologically, beginning with his childhood in Palo Alto, meeting Grace Wing-then chubby and not married to Slick's brother, Jerry, and his introduction to drugs. From that point Slick writes about his feelings for Wing (Slick), his early travels, THE BEATLES influence, and so on. He then talks about forming a band, the hippie era (which only was real and lasted for a short while in 1966 from my personal experience) when everyone knew virtually everyone else involved, and the band's first gig.Slick also talks about bands/people then just starting to form and find some kind of identity-THE CHARLATANS (a personal favorite-check out their album), THE JEFFERSON AIRPLANE, QUICKSILVER MESSENGER SERVICE, the GRATEFUL DEAD, THE MYSTERY TREND, Janis Joplin and BIG BROTHER AND THE HOLDING COMPANY, SONS OF CHAMPLIN (their first album is great), COUNTRY JOE & THE FISH, and a few other groups and individuals.And Slick also writes about some of the important people behind the scene-Tom Donahue (who basically started underground radio), Chet Helms (who put on dance concerts at The Avalon Ballroom), Bill Graham (who started out doing benefits for The S.F. Mime Troupe), Bill Ham (light shows), and Ralph Gleason (who excitedly wrote about this \\"new\\" music).But after Grace Slick joined The Airplane, Darby Slick felt betrayed , and fulfilled his dream of traveling to India to study music with Ali Akbar Khan. After a few months, Slick returned to the U.S., tried to live a \\"normal\\" life, got married, sunk deeper into drugs and alcohol, became sober, and continued playing (and learning) music.Included in this over-size soft cover book are a number of period photographs, and one of the best (and coolest) things-two b & w and four color full page reproductions of several posters advertising the band from that early period. A nice touch is a b & w photo of the author, taken in 1991, the year of the book's publication. And the cover art (which at one time you could purchase as a poster) is by the inimitable Stanley Mouse, famous for his poster work during that era. Plus (and here I'm bragging a little) my copy has bassist Jack Casady's signature from the same period when this book was published. It doesn't have any connection with the book itself (he signed it at a memorabilia show), I just think it's cool.If you've read this far, chances are you're familiar with the band's albums-\\"Born To Be Burned\\" (Sundazed Records), and \\"Grace Slick & The Great Society\\" (both original vinyl albums on one CD from Sony/Columbia Records).Another reason I decided to write something about this book, is that I feel that anyone with an interest in that whole period and/or the music, should have this in their library. With the many books about this era and the music (some written by people who weren't there-which removes us a step or two from that period), it's nice to sit back and read something (especially a personal account) from someone who was really there, who had close ties to it all. Would an outside editor have helped to tidy things up a bit? Possibly. But then that personal, that human touch might have disappeared from the book. Reading this book is like sitting down with Slick, and having him talk to you about those times. And that's what I like about this book. Check it out-it's a nice, small account of life during that exciting, always changing time."},{"Title":"Don't You Want Somebody to Love: Reflections on the San Francisco Sound","review":"What a great afternoon-and the book &quot;Do You Want Somebody to Love;&quot; the Reflections of the San Francisco Sound-this is what you have to read-to really put yourself into the picture. Both author Darby Slick; &amp; artist, Stanley Mouse... &quot;MADE&quot; the scene here in the City. You'd see a poster by Mouse, (or compatriot) on a ubiquitous telephone pole-and stand there staring, trying your darndest to decipher the message. If you had gone in the early days to one of the shows around town-you probably would have bumped into &quot;THE GREAT SOCIETY&quot; which figured very prominently in our rounds. We just got left class on an afternoon like today-and were being driven by a buddy who just got a gig chauffering-in the Mecerdes, over to Darby's new place in ForestHills, they had just got back from India, the place was clean &amp; airy. Splendid in its decor; a Tiger-Skin Rug hung on the plaster wall, there were Persian Carpets on Hardwood Floors and light colored Silk Curtains everywhere. And this was a nice place to set up the new studio with a magnificent looking Sound-System, the fancy Control Panel took up about half the room.

His writing, though somewhat Victorian, is easy to read."},{"Title":"Yours To Reason Why: Decision In Battle (Da Capo Paperback)","review":"I am glad to see that Da Capo decided to re-print this book in a cheap paperback edition. The author is always interesting and vivid (his review of Battles in Britain, for example). In this case, he takes the reader step by step through the situation as it unfolded before one of commanders, presenting information that he would have had at the time. At several critical points there is a \\"pause\\" to ask the reader to select one of the options. Immediately after in small print, Seymour explains the decision actually made and briefly discusses the wisdom of the choice. Then the narrative continues to a second critical juncture, and so on. Small tactical maps interspersed in the narrative (there are 76 in all) are quite helpful. The 25 plates containing paintings or photos of commanders, some artwork on the battlefield scenes and a few interesting contemporary cartoons aren't remarkable, but nicely complement the text. There are good orders of battle for each campaign selected and a very well chosen bibliography, arranged to match the respective battles. The selections of battles for the most part are the usual (see Creasy's 1851 classic) \\"decisive\\" encounters seen in other battle books: Hastings,Crecy, Agincourt, Cromwell in the Third (English) Civil War, Saratoga, Waterloo, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg. The twentieth century battles might seem to deviate from this pattern a bit. Gaza/Palestine 1917 (instead of Passchendaele, Gallipoli, Verdun, Somme) and Anzio (instead of Britain, Barbarossa, Stalingrad, etc. for WWII). However the WWI and WWII selections are justified by the treatment in the narrative.This is the way, in my humble opinion, military history should be taught, and to a large extent Seymour follows the methodology that has been used by the world's leading military academies.Great reading, and terrific brain food. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Yours To Reason Why: Decision In Battle (Da Capo Paperback)","review":"First read this classic years ago but I find myself returning to it time and again when I read a book on one of the battles Seymour covers. I go back and forth, staying slightly ahead in Seymour so I can feel a little of what the original commander felt trying to determine what's on the other side of the hill with limited information. Some have wondered why he chose the battles he did or, rather, did not choose more famous encounters. The criterion for a work like this is a battle with several decision points on both sides. So not just any battle will do. I especially like the practice of many small maps instead of one overly-detailed map. It enables one to follow the flow of the battle much better. The major fault with this book is probably the \\"traditional\\" viewpoint for at least some of the subject matter. \\"Old school\\" errors and prejudices poke through annoyingly for the American Civil War battles and even Waterloo. Still, worth a read--more than once."},{"Title":"Ellen Gallagher","review":"Book arrive in bad condition and stained.

Yah. By the time an author heads into the third book in a long running series, an exuberant rhythm of confidence has often been achieved and firmly activated. When reading a third book I can almost feel the author's blood pumping with an awareness of \\"This is how I was meant to write; I'm on a roll.\\" This is not to say that the first and second books are anything less than this; each sequential book, according to my over-baked theories, has different, yet equal assets based on its order.I ordered this book from Amazon's marketplace of various venders, wanting to own one of the original versions of the hardback which is no longer in print. An ex-library copy seemed to be my perfect option. When I released the library's protective, clear plastic cover, I was pleasantly surprised that the book jacket felt better than new. It was free of any flaws I could discern, shiny, glossy, and colorfully gorgeous.Having sensed how uncannily the yummy art on the hardcover's jacket would reflect the mood and theme of the story, each time I noticed the fan of sliced Swiss cheese, and skull-trail of milk set off by a brown, orange, and green quilt; each time I picked up the book for a continued read, I felt a jolt of joy, realizing I was holding in my hands a cohesive, coherent, colorful whole of a physical and mental mesh. Ironically, as richly sensual as this pleasure was, I wondered if a dedicated Amish person might be spirited to fondle that photographic-stylized cover face, setting aside for a moment any fears of succumbing to the addictive siren of meaningful artistic luxury.(Sue Grafton deserves this luxury, too! see the conclusion of my review of \\"S.\\")Introducing the murder with an early morning phone call to Magda at her PenDutch Inn gave a perfect contrast to the opening scenes in Myers's first two novels in this PenDutch series, including the fact that the call took Mags away from the Inn, to Farmersburg, Ohio for the duration of the plot. As much as I like being \\"in\\" that Inn, I enjoyed as much or more observing Madgdelana, Susannah, and Freni immersed within a pure Amish community.I was fascinated with the increase of Amish lore here, around the Gordian knots of \\"family ties\\" in this clannish, cozy culture; and I was entertained by the descriptions of repetitions of noses, names, feet, and faces. Equally effective in establishing setting and lore were the bouncing seas of black buggies and shifting seas of black backs at major communal events like funerals. And of course, the periodic tension was telling, around rights and wrongs in dress, thought, speech, and behavior. Daily rituals were eye-openers in exposing the realities of electrical absence, like the heating of supper dish water on the stove prior to clearing the table, the lighting of kerosene lanterns instead of clicking light switches, and sleeping in cold upstairs bedrooms with fires roaring (or banked quietly) only on first floor levels, and sometimes only in the kitchen hearth.The contrast between the English, Mennonite, and Amish was brought out humorously in many venues, one being the use and payment of English or Mennonite drivers when Amish need to travel to far reaching communities to attend funerals, weddings, or the like. The conversations were hilariously enlightening between Magdalena Yoder a well-stretched Mennonite, and Harriet from Goshen Indiana, a snickering Englisher \\"chauffeur\\" who was haughtily disdainful of Amish ways, about which she didn't have a toe hold of comprehension. When Harriet thought Magda was Irish, or maybe Jewish, Mags didn't come forth with her history; she bubbled the fun, playing off the reader's awareness of Harriet's foot swallowing.Speaking of which, the food scenes and recipes were prime-timed-and-luscious, down-home-simple-and-rich, with humor sprinkled into the genuine Amish mix as a bonus of cultural spice.A few sensitive scenes perfectly relieved the hilarity of Myers's style, one between an Amish minister and Magda, which revealed some of the base of Amish beliefs, and another during a supper scene at Annie's home in which Magda endearingly set aside snide remarks to comfort a lonely old woman. Providing a contrasting release to Magda's continual rolls through hilarity, these scenes exposed that Myers could clearly write serious works with as much power and cultural excavation as she does comedy. She has an uncanny ability to interject with a natural ease, emotionally sensitive scenes within a habitual flow of hilarity.In addition to the above literary achievements of no small accord, the mystery in Spilled Milk was perfectly percolated throughout, and boiled over with much needed heat in the winter chill of an abandoned barn.Magdalena's romantic vulnerability to Aaron Miller was endearing when it slipped through her snippets of effervescent sarcasm, and I loved his protectiveness, his devotion to her compelling him across snow covered countrysides (to stand by her side) via a snowmobile spree from Hernia, PA to Farmersburg, OH, sliding with speed across winter treacherous terrain. In fact, all plays on Amish attempts to dim the surge of sexuality were especially entertaining and enlightening in this plot of milk and cheese.Probably what I was most involved in here was the increased (without over expansion, glorification, or discounting) revelations of Amish ways and core beliefs, especially beliefs in the existence of incarnated evil and the cultivation of humility, accompanied by a revulsion (sometimes a fear) of Pride, all of which was creamily blended into production of the best Swiss cheese available under Heaven. The complex, sometimes trip-wired underpinnings of serious religious dogma was exposed with such finesse here, no revered angle was slapped in the face. Yet, the trip-wires were heated to a slight red glow, just enough to see, if a reader chose to focus with respectful, retrospect contemplation.My afterthoughts included an intriguing conflict between the Amish dim view of Pride, and my belief that pride in accomplishment is what cajols the soul to remain embodied within a physical world. Allowing myself to wallow in pride of something I had a hand in creating is what allows me the will to keep going, fueling myself with at least a minimal amount of what I see as one of the purest types of spiritual joy. Yet, for the Amish, high compliments on their work or mine would be viewed as the ultimate evil in crime.I understand the seductive dangers of pride. Possibly it's easier, safer, and wiser to rule all of it's facets as dangerously deadly, to disallow complexities of sunlight and shadow to darken one's path to light after death.For my choice of life, though, I hope to achieve and maintain that balance of relishing the sensuality of a physical world, of an embodied life, without allowing the immensity of satisfaction to posses or compel me, to the point of abandoning integrity. Walking that balance lifts the traveler onto an oh so difficult tightrope; I understand the seduction, the heartening sense of security of living at the more subtly sensual, ground level of life, without wallowing too often or long in the potential quicksands of pleasure, pride, joy, and ease.At least, when I vicariously experience various levels of lifestyles in fiction, I have less fear of losing my ambition into a the hazy lazy days of an eternal, comforting summer, no discontent sought or swallowed. And, without having to shoulder the hernia causing hard work of farm life, I can also enjoy the quiet sensuality of the Amish lifestyle, and their yummy food!Returning to conclude the winter of our current novel ...The collection of ending chapters-and-verses of Spilled Milk (and rich Swiss cheese) had a hearty punch and heightened sparkle. Being the sentimental slob that I am, yet still able to bubble in fun at the best or worst of times, I didn't just read, but reveled in the last couple pages.Do we be wary of the morrow of life?Read, and read, and read ... live, and live, and live ... and see.Linda G.

Ms. Myers started out with a nice idea and produced an acceptable first book. But the rest have been trash. They are badly written, poorly edited and they are just plain silliness (and not in a cute/funny way)! There are far to many inconsequential characters clogging up the storylines, the most extreme overuse of a word that I have ever seen (wailing), and too many references to being one's own relative.

I will never trust the rating scale again."},{"Title":"Fundamentalism Reborn?: Afghanistan Under the Taliban","review":"The book gives a lot of detail concerning the rise of the Taliban and the factors which have contributed to their success. The book also goes into great detail concerning the players involved in Afghanistan and with the Taliban today. For those familiar with the Afghan conflict this is very interesting reading but for the casual reader does little to clear up an already complex and misunderstood post Cold War conflict.The chapter concerning the dilemmas facing the international agencies who are currently engaging with this movement was excellent although could have been expanded further. The loss of UN crediability to intervene in the ongoing civil war is perhaps one of the greatest disappointments to all involved, especially the civilians of the country.The book is a compilation of a number of Afghanistan experts views. Therefore, the reader will find some chapters easy reading and informative while others seem cumbersome and boring.The Western media portrays the excesses, or perceived fundamentalism, of the Taliban to a great extent. The book attempts to show that there are positive aspects to the movement as well. In a country which is traditionally conservative in its view of women and culture norms, the Taliban are not as hated as the media often indicates.Overall the book does well in portraying a forgotten country and the issues it is dealing with in the post Soviet Union era."},{"Title":"Fundamentalism Reborn?: Afghanistan Under the Taliban","review":"Fundamentalism Reborn? is a collection of writings by various authors, with a few words from Maley at the beginning and end of the book. The collection touches upon the rise of the Taliban and the future of the Afghani state. Individual topics vary, providing a wide scope of issues surrounding the Taliban and its role in Afghanistan. Foreign and domestic recognition of the Taliban, the need for financial support, and the Cold war are among these issues. Extremely important is the extreme need of financial aid in the face of a Western cold shoulder and hearty support from Islamic fundamentalists and terrorist organizations. The lack of US/Soviet aid after the Cold war was a central factor in the rise of the Taliban and its terrorist foundations, and is also one that is often overlooked.Another subject brought up in the book is the role of the UN, and the need for it to provide not just mediation in the conflict, but rather reconstruction aid to Afghanistan. While my readings on Afghanistan are by no means extensive, thus far I have not seen much information on the crucial responsibility of the UN both in writing and in the media. As the world becomes more and more globalized, the need for international order and a single regulatory, unbiased body increases. Hence, as the world that is so dependent upon one another becomes more divided along Western-Islamic lines, the UN is the only source of peace and reconciliation between the opposing powers. So, it is a definite quality of attraction that Maley does include writings and touch upon the responsibilities of the UN in this matter.Aside from being a deeply informative and organized account of the Taliban, the best aspect of this book is the variety of viewpoints provided to the reader. Although Maley does indeed offer his own personal opinions in the introduction and in his prophecy for Afghanistan, it does not subjugate the many other perspectives contained in the book. Unlike novels written by a single author, the reader is not plagued by bias, selectivity of information, or a single cultural standpoint. Rather than having a conclusion forced upon the reader, the reader is able to take in a wide array of information and attitudes, and then consolidate the information into his personal stance upon the very controversial subject. Maley did an excellent job in selecting authors from different backgrounds, stations, and outlooks, and moreover the continuous change of writing style allows for sustained interest in the book. To date, this has been my favorite piece of writing on Afghanistan and I would highly recommend it.Shirin Raza"},{"Title":"Fundamentalism Reborn?: Afghanistan Under the Taliban","review":"An excellent series of essays by veteran watchers of Afghanistan with much recent experience on the ground.

This is an important contribution to the literature of atheism. It offers a thorough introduction to the topic, and also a profound, innovative discussion for the experienced reader. It is wise, thorough, and useful. \\"Natural Atheism\\" deserves a place on the shelf among contemporary classics on atheism.\\"Natural Atheism\\" is a compelling argument for rationality. In some respects, the book is a primer in reasoning. Overall, Eller's book is a preparation for the atheist - or for anyone unafraid to genuinely think about these matters. The arc of the book moves cleverly from a 12-Step program to recover your reason, across an impressive discussion of principles of reasoning and the claims of religion, concluding with thoughts about atheist activism.The book is divided into three parts. Part I establishes the groundwork for rationality. Eller reviews classic arguments for God(s), showing logical flaws in each claim. Among the most useful sections of Part I are discussions of \\"burden of proof\\" and \\"cultural relativism,\\" each a concept that is abused and contorted by apologists of religion.In Part II, Eller distinguishes nuances of difference among atheists; characterizes belief, knowledge, agnosticism, and science; and discusses the historic intolerance of religions.Part III is perhaps the most significant section, because it places atheism in a contemporary American context. Eller discusses principal lines of conflict, each of which is fabricated by the religious right. He gives a history of the separation of church and state, including a summary of key decisions by US courts. And - in the most novel contribution to the literature of atheism - Eller discusses positive action by atheists. He asks - and answers - the question, \\"Is there an atheist agenda?\\"\\"Natural Atheism\\" is written in accessible, graceful academic prose. Eller's use of evidence and organization are excellent. His discussion is complex, substantial, and comprehensive. Readers who look for effortless, unthinking answers will not find them here - but such answers would be misleading anyway. Eller's work deserves to be read widely and quoted often.The book is nicely produced by The American Atheist Press. The quality is excellent."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"Natural Atheism is a brilliant book that effectively discusses everything a person needs to know about the conflict between religion and reason. A tribute to rational thinking and a handbook for those who have always been suspicious of fairy tales, superstitions, and all similar malarkey. Eller makes it clear that the burden of proof must always be borne by those making the outrageous claims, as opposed to those intelligent enough to be skeptical. A perfect book, and perhaps the final word on the issue, because once you understand that we're not obligated to prove that there's no such thing as Santa or the Easter Bunny, then there's not really a lot more that needs to be said about either, and the same principle applies to religion."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"The best book ive read in a long time.

It seems some people begin reading about atheism based on some negative interaction they had with religion. Of course the author brings out the usual point/counterpoints and presents them in a smart and reasonable way. But after a reader gets past his/her outrage, and sarcasm, and finger-pointing, and mind-opening... what's next? So you don't believe in X, what DO you believe in then? David Eller takes a step towards that.Are all atheists dry, analyical, snooty, intellectuals who have no humanity or faith in anything? Or are all atheists hippie, human lovers who dance around the maypole and hug strangers on the bus? Neither. Atheists are people like you and I. And the author shows us it is okay to celebrate the great things humans do and decry the awful things humans do. And how there isn't really any need to bypass humanity and nature and attribute good OR bad things to some supernatural force or tradition. Then he wonders aloud about what atheists stand for besides just being anti-religion and pro free-thinking. And where it can all go from there. It is a fairly uplifting presentation that sneaks up on you as you complete the book. One of those \\"hey, that's right!\\" kind of moments you won't forget."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"I have been an atheist for 6 years,and I have collected and read many, many [old and new] books on atheism - And I was still pleasantly impressed with this book by David Eller.I am so impressed that I have donated copies of it to several universities, public libraries and individuals.This is a book useful to new non-believers, long time atheists and particularly for persons who are sincerely asking questions.It has 12 chapters,divided into 3 sections, a total of 352 pages, published in 2004.

I liked the fact that arguments from Biblical authority are dismissed in just about one sentence by recognizing that they are just arguments from authority (a fallacy).My only complaint is that the book was a bit wordy at times. I think that the points could have been made with 1/2 the text. But that is a minor compliant from someone who is just a lazy reader sometimes. Overall, this book is one to keep and then buy as a gift for a freethinker friend. I doubt that a Theist friend would understand the reason and logic.By the way, my minor compliant simply reduces my rating from 6 to 5. It deserves the highest possible rating on Amazon. It's really that good. Read it!Eller: if you read this review, please create an audio book version!!"},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"Natural Atheism is a book that made me constructively analyze the controlling and manipulating poison of the religious freaks that are major problem of almost anything what is wrong in this modern dangerous world.You feel the author is so close to you when reading his work. Especially when he is provoking doubts that are fostered spontaneously and naturally to us, who are most ignorant and uneducated folks when Atheism is mentioned.People's longing a world where factual and false can be plainly distinguished, and that religions, ideologies, methods and practices are established on this longing. These people want to judge before they comprehend. This is one harmful free thought that we all have to erase from our already socially manipulated and screwed up brains.I recognized language of wisdom, intelligent and unforgettable analogies, and many excellent thoughts in this book. Certainly, anyone interested in contemplation, conviction, faith, religion, science or cultural relativism definitely should have this book."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"David Eller has written a fantastic, and very thorough, book about whether any gods exist, and about atheism.Early chapters of the book cover critical thinking, logic, epistemology, and a systematic dissection of the major reasons why people believe in God. Later chapters include wide-ranging topics, including an especially-splendid argument for the separation of church and state. It is a little slow at the start, but certainly worth reading to the end.In the recently-popular \\"God Delusion\\" by Richard Dawkins arguments that came from the author's own field of expertise, biology, were the most novel, and some of the most compelling. Similarly, Eller provides novel and compelling insights from his own area of expertise. Eller is an anthropologist and brings much of his knowledge from this discipline to the analysis of religious practice and belief. Eller provides some fascinating insights when writing about culture and history.My only gripe about the writing style of this book is that the author occasionally refers to himself by the first person plural \\"we\\", rather than the singular \\"I\\". This might simply be my personal preference, or my inexperience with the typical writing style of anthropology. But this is trivial.All in all, I think this is the most comprehensive and scholarly book on atheism since George Smith's \\"Atheism: the Case Against God\\"."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"Eller packaged the whole shebang in one, fast-paced volume covering all aspects of atheism. His clear-cut prose is littered with quotable bits and gives readers those \\"Aha!\\" and \\"Absolutely!\\" moments throughout. From the basics of atheism, through logical proofs, science and evolution, separation of religion from government and the history of our founding, fundamentalism, and finally to the future of atheism, Eller has presented atheism as the logical conclusion of reason. In a time of concern for our religious liberties, \\"Natural Atheism\\" offers us some hope of a future in which reason is valued and superstition denounced. I highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"This book is very, very good. Dr. Eller put in an incredible amount of thought and research into each topic that he covers. This book is full of very helpful information... everything from refuting the arguments for Gods existance to a short lesson in logic to a nice summary on the history of the whole church and state thing.The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars was because I had a really hard time getthing through the second half of this book. The topics, while very informative, didn't really interest me that much. However, i still reccomend this book if you are interested in atheism, and would like to read a very thoughtful analysis of it, without any religion bashing."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"I bought this book based on the review by David Mills, author of Atheist Universe. I bought them both at the same time. Fully expecting Natural Atheism to be better, I read Mills' book first. Though Natural Atheism presents the arguments comprehensibly, I found it less interesting and far more dry than Atheist Universe. I would still recommend it together with Atheist Universe for a rounded expression of the arguments but I think the points could have been made in simpler language."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"Eller's book is a well thought out guide to Atheism and most of the main pillars of its ideas. I really do like how he proposes an idea and then offers a clear and straight-forward example of that idea. I especially enjoyed his commentary on belief vs. knowledge and his \\"four box\\" example; this broke the argument down concisely and is very, very elegant. After having, for so many years struggled with my self-proclaimed \\"I am an Agnostic with Atheistic leanings\\", I have, after much reading, relection and contemplative thought, and discussion with others, reached the conclusion that it is now time to term myself a positive atheist, and I not only feel quite refreshed by the experience but it has allowed me to look at old debates and ideas with a fresh pair of eyes. There is very little that is particularly unique about this book except that it is very easy to follow and is broken down into relatively small doses for one new to this information to digest and think through. Eller quietly guides you through ideas such as reason and logic and how to apply these fundamental processes to new ideas or situations. Even if you have take courses in reason & logic, psychology, philosophy, this is an excellent primer or even a short-form text book for one to brush up on those ideas. Eller provides many, many examples of how to approach situations and ideas, and how to address others who are not quite understanding the philosophies behind atheism. I also appreciate that he quantifies negative and positive atheism and why positive atheism is the proper approach to this philosophy."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"Eller writes not only elegantly, but with a clarity of insight few possess. His work goes far beyond the standards of journeymen atheist authors in that he attempts and succeeds at the herculean task of laying out a vision for a rational humanistic future. Like a skilled brick mason, he runs course after course of subject matter to build an edifice of knowledge. Starting with concise summaries of twelve popular arguments against theistic fraud, he quickly dispenses with the fallacies of faith. In the second and third chapters Dr. Eller provides the reader with a short course in critical thinking and reasoning. This alone is worth the price of the book. Chapter four is an introduction to anthropology. A worthy foundation upon which to build an understanding needed for a humanist future. In part two, Eller demolishes the error of equating faith/belief with knowledge, clarifies the models of positive vs. negative atheism and science vs. religion. In part three, the author presents an uplifting and encouraging case for why and how reason and humanism can make a positive difference. I particularly enjoyed the discussion of the harmful nature of spiritualism and how a simple appreciation of our very humanity can lead to a richer and more satisfying life. All free thinkers should own David Eller's Natural Atheism\\". It is worth having and rereading."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"Although I've pretty much always been a \\"natural atheist,\\" only in recent months have I been open about it. As such, my take on Dr. Eller's book was slightly different than what others might get out of it - as his sound reasoning in the early chapters of the book is somewhat mooted to the freethinker who has already drawn much the same conclusions.For me, the perhaps overlooked strength of Dr. Eller's book comes in the later chapters having to deal with the theist, and the ongoing struggle - traced from past to present - against the constant threat of fundamentalist-based oppression in today's society. As such, the book not only maps out the good reasons one should be an atheist, but also why one's right to reason should not be threatened by those who do not.\\"Natural Atheism\\" is one of the best of the several books I've read on this topic, and is highly endorsed."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"David Eller's book joins the ranks of those excellent well written books which explains atheism as a thought process. If you read this book, you will look around a world of religious violence and science bashing and wonder how anyone can belive in the delusion of deities. I enjoyed Natural Atheism and recommend it."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"Natural Atheism is a compelling book which dispells many myths surrounding atheism, shows how there is no logical case for a divine being, and addresses implications of an atheistic stance. The logic that Eller employs is flawless and he never steps over the bounds of reason into speculation.The book starts off by refuting classical arguments for the belief in a god and presents logical arguments against the existence of god. Next, he provides a brief 'course' on reason which is outstanding because many people use improper reasoning not just in arguments about religion, but in their everyday life. Eller then describes atheism in detail and puts to rest many stereotypes of atheism and atheists. The last part of the book is devoted to the applications of atheism; such as, the separation of church and state and living in a disenchanted world.By the end of the book I had come to the conclusion which echoed a quote on Eller's business card: \\"Atheism is a beautiful thing.\\""},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"\\"Natural Atheism\\" has me thinking about where I acquired and how I nurture my doubt. I acquired it long ago from reading novels where, as Milan Kundera says in \\"The Art of the Novel,\\" no one knows the truth but everyone has the right to be understood. I nurture my doubt on literature, philosophy, psychology, biography and film; I feed it on the first rule of sociology, that things are not always what they seem; and I nourish it on anthropology's contribution to the world, cultural relativity. But I NEVER nurture my doubt on logic; I couldn't tell you five logical fallacies if my life depended on it. To painstakingly judge someone's claims and ideas with logic is about as much fun as balancing a checkbook. I hope I employ clear thinking -- I just don't want to think about it.This makes me quite different from the author of \\"Natural Atheism,\\" whose passion for logic and painstaking clear thought leaps out page after page. At times I feel the author is telling me my doubts don't count because they've not been nurtured properly. At other times he tells me my thoughts are second-rate because, \\"reason is the only type of thought that deserves to be called thought.\\" This is not a claim that sits well with an intuitive doubter like myself, someone who has come to suspect, as Kundera would say, that most people desire a world where true and false can be clearly distinguished, and that religions, ideologies, methods and practices (like a strict application of reason) are founded on this desire because such people want to judge before they understand, and that this is ultimately a denial of freethought.So as you can guess, there were many times I set the book aside \\"for good.\\" But I always came back and read a bit more. And though I found more passion for reason, I also found words of wisdom, clever and memorable analogies, and lots of good ideas. Indeed, anyone interested in thought, belief, faith, religion, science or cultural relativism definitely should have this book on the shelf; the chapter on anthropology and freethought alone is worth the price of admission. If you're trying to decide between this book and \\"The End of Faith,\\" get this one, no contest. If you're going to order a couple books, get this one and \\"The Future of Religion,\\" by Rorty, Vattimo and Zabala, which will opens a whole new avenue for doubt, and one that I prefer. And check out \\"The Art of the Novel,\\" too; Kundera's insights are stunning. And don't overlook, \\"Doubt: A History.\\" Wonderful!If freethought is the goal, just remember that there are many ways to get there; and don't let anyone tell you your \\"method\\" is wrong -- even if you're only a daydream doubter, like me."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"David Eller pens a highly intelligent argument for rejecting god-beliefs through the use of logic, critical thinking skills and facts (as opposed to the arguments for religion that rely upon such abstracts as emotions, feelings, speculation and other opinion-based wishes).This is a critical thinker's guide to accepting that \\"All humans are born Atheists. No baby born into the world arrives with specific religious beliefs or knowledge.\\"David Eller celebrates Atheism, and encourages like minded Skeptics to do the same. Though a bit dry in places (where he attempts to keep his arguments strickly in the logic format), I found his book optimistic, intelligent and reasonable."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"As an atheist virtually all of my adult life, and one who has put considerable study into comparative religion, I actually read very few books on atheism /per se/. There are a variety of reasons for this, the prime being -- to use a religious metaphor -- I am already in the choir and I don't need to be converted. For most of my life I have also been a pretty laid-back atheist. I, as most atheists I know personally, am not an \\"atheist evangelist\\" and have no mission to forcibly convert believers to non-belief as, apparently, some of the vocal \\"new atheists\\" (Dawkins, Hitchens, et al) would do. One gets tired of endlessly re-reading arguments that one has long since internalized, and which are designed to move one to a position which one already holds. In short, most books about atheism bore me to tears.Nonetheless, I carry on frequent dialogs with many believers of different faiths, and one of them, who has written his own rebuttal \\"The Truth Behind the New Atheism: Responding to the Emerging Challenges to God and Christianity\\" to Dawkins' \\"The God Delusion\\" has motivated me to do some reading in less-explored directions. In the process of wading through the work of various esteemed (and/or reviled) theologians and philosophers, I decided that perhaps it was time to look into what some of the atheists were saying, preferably some who didn't have such a big axe to grind as some of the aforementioned \\"new atheists\\".Somewhat to my surprise, David Eller's \\"Natural Atheism\\" actually resonated with me; with my experience in discovering, or rather in acknowledging my atheism. Eller surveys the various common arguments against the existence of God, as seems to be /de rigueur/ in every book on atheism, but his central thesis is that none of us are born believing in God; we have to be indoctrinated with that belief. Thus, we are all \\"natural atheists.\\"On the surface this may seem like simply stating the obvious, yet it seems to be anything but obvious to religious believers who have created a wealth of mystical beliefs (souls; original sin; etc.) to justify their contention that newborn infants can be such things as \\"Christian babies,\\" \\"Muslim babies,\\" \\"Jewish babies,\\" and on and on. In fact, I think the concept of \\"natural atheism\\" may even be foreign to many atheists, some of which go so far as to describe themselves in terms like \\"I'm a recovering Christian.\\"Indeed, if I had read this book ten or fifteen years ago I would have understood it in an abstract, intellectual way -- \\"yes, I can see how some people are atheists from the beginning\\" -- but I would not have connected with it on the same personal level as I do now. Raised by a Roman Catholic father and a Russian Orthodox mother, with all the ritual and religious education that implies, for many years I could point virtually to the moment of my \\"conversion\\" to atheism,following my first full reading of the Bible at age thirteen. However, as I have gotten older and experienced more of the world, locating that 'moment of conversion' became more and more elusive, until I have finally come to realize that I never \\"converted to atheism\\"--the fact is that I /never really believed/ in God to begin with. What for most of my life I had though of as my moment of conversion was really a moment of /admission/ -- of what I really thought, felt, believed, and didn't believe.Reading Eller's book has been extremely useful in helping me to sort out my true early feelings as I was being vigorously inculcated with all of the trappings of Christian belief. I didn't start out with a belief and reject it: I started out without belief, and refused to accept the belief that my particular corner of our culture would have poured into me. Besides being the natural state into which we are all born, atheism, Eller argues, is a natural consequence of the development of a logical rationality and critical thinking. In this sense, atheism represents a normal, positive attitude, and not a 'rejection of,' 'anger at,' or 'hatred of' God, as is frequently charged by many theists.Eller doesn't stop with showing how atheism is a natural state. He also makes a very plausible presentation, from an anthropological perspective, as to how humans have developed so many supernatural mythologies and why so many of us are so reluctant to part with them. He has a whole chapter on critical thinking, explores the difference between belief and knowledge, and how we think about truth. Moreover, Eller makes his presentation without either descending into the obfuscatory depths of symbolic metaphysics, or the shrill theatrics of religion-bashing that seems to be popular just now. His presentation is cogent, witty, and friendly, and strongly urges the reader to maintain an open mind and a healthy skepticism as they continue to pursue the Big Questions with an eye to what religion has to offer as compared to other epistemologies like science.In short, he makes his case without preaching at the reader. This is very important to me, as I never much have liked being preached at, be it by a theist or an atheist.One can find any number of turgid philosophical tomes treating the classic arguments concerning God and religion, and one can find plenty of volumes of angry polemic attacking religion. As in any field, some of these are very good and some of them are garbage. But nearly all of them make presumptions on the background of the reader which may not be justified. Eller speaks not to these extremes so much as to the vast majority in the middle, where most of us find ourselves. If believe you are newly become an atheist, or think you might be an atheist but aren't sure what that really means, or if you are just having some normal doubts about your faith and are looking for some perspective, I highly recommend this book. And, as others have said, if you're only going to read one book on atheism, \\"Natural Atheism\\" is a choice candidate ."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"It is unique among so many atheism books that are popping out into the market nowadays that instead of trying to appeal to the masses, it is based heavily on academic philosophy, nature of logic, and naturalness of atheism without depending too much on natural science or social issues. I almost feel as if I am meditating when I am reading this book.It is definitely deep, slow-reading, and not too much exciting so I encourage readers to take some time read it slowly, think about what the author is trying to convey because some of the topics get rarely covered by so many popular atheists like Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris, and Dennett."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"David Eller has revolutionized, and continues to revolutionize, the concept of atheism, by returning it to its natural state of existence. That is, like any other concept or idea within human reality, atheism serves a specific purpose and function within human evolution and cultural thought. Mr. Eller masterfully extrapolates this process, beyond the superficial arguments between atheists and theists.Indeed he verifies how atheism is as natural (and necessary) for human beings as oxygen is for us to breathe and live. No human being is born believing in, knowing of, of embracing any kind of religion, spiritual system, or higher power. Such ideas, like religion and spiritual beings, are externally inculcated within the mind of the human being, whereas the idea of atheism is there from the very start, by the very absence of these ideas existence.All of the above is what Mr. Eller shows, but perhaps more importantly he shows the necessity of living an atheistic lifestyle, rather than one through faith or belief. Human beings cannot survive through faith and belief, and progress beyond the limitations of their existence. Only an atheistic lifestyle can do that. I recommend this book for anyone who is teetering between agnosticism and atheism, and additionally for anyone who has an interest in the subject matter regardless of their position. For regardless of the position one takes, all who read this book will be transformed and enhanced in a better way, which ultimately leads toward a more prosperous and fulfilling human existence."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"This book offers a comprehensive view about atheism and that is exactly what I found in it. The title is referred to the condition in which every human being is born, this is, as an atheist. The case of David Eller is different because he never was a believer despite the social \\"pressure\\" for being one. \\"I was born an Atheist...,\\" he says, \\"All humans are born Atheists.\\" In this perspective, what Eller does is give us the path we transit from being atheists to be believers and (in some cases) to be Atheists again.This is not the book about the personal experience and how the author lived it but just the opposite. Eller doesn't star his book. The star of the book is reason only. That's why chapter two is dedicated to it. In chapter two, Eller tells us that reason is (equal) to thinking and also that --or as a consequence-- reason is a method. In this vein he writes a fortunate (and a kind of definitive) sentence: \\"Reason is the process of moving form facts to conclusions by means of argument.\\" This definition closes the possibility to the supernatural under the premise of the facts. If you take the facts out from the sentence you doesn't have the whole process of reasoning but just a part of it (which is a completely different thing).You can read it by yourself and being convinced (or not). But like it or not Eller is not only highly cogent but also he is solid as a rock. He doesn't leave loose ends. So as long as you read you discover that the author has meditated any single detail of his work. This is not a testimony --I insist-- but a defense of the atheism as a natural condition without any artificiality. Here --despite the fact that N.A. is not an easy reading-- everything is crystal clear. There is no rhetoric or verbal twisting for making you believe in a position which has nothing to do with believing. \\"Atheism,\\" as Eller puts it, \\"is the conclusion (not the belief) that there are no gods.\\"This book is different from any other one about this topic. I already said that N.A. is not testimonial, neither about science, archaeology or history. So Eller is not Richard Dawkins, not Christopher Hitchens, not Sam Harris. Eller is Eller and you'll be able to realize it as long as you read the book as I did. This book is a plus in the summation of atheism defenders. Is intelligent, well written and last bur not least, with no cheating or traps.My only \\"but\\" is Eller's U.S. centered perspective. But this is a problem with the majority of this works. In Latin America we are like orphans of this discussion and Catholic Church is very strong in terms of publications and opinions. We need an Eller here to enrich our visions about the world.Finally, I highly recommend Natural Atheism. You'll note the difference with recent books and debates in the essence of this original and courageous defense of atheism."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"This is one of the best books on atheism that I have ever read--possibly the best. I won't know that answer until I have read Dr. Eller's next bookAtheism Advanced: Further Thoughts of a Freethinker. This book is so carefully and thoughtfully reasoned out that it was truly a delight to read. It does not drip with vitriol like some other books on the subject and the final chapter doesn't leave one hanging but creates a hopeful atmosphere in which atheists can move on. Move on from what? Read it and find out! I do not think that you will regret it."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"Natural Atheism by David Eller\\"Natural Atheism\\" is a thought-provoking, and inspiring book about atheism. Anthropologist and accomplished author David Eller provides the reader with an intellectual treat about one's natural-born atheism. This insightful 352-page book is broken out into the following twelve chapters: 1. Twelve Steps to Atheism, 2. Thinking About Thinking - A Short Course on Reason, 3. Proofs and Principles -- Unreason, Religion, and Relativism, 4. Anthropology and Freethought -- The Loss of Certainty, 5. Knowing Is Not Believing, 6.

Separation of State and Churches -- The Best Protection of Everyone's Freedoms, 10. spreading the Unfaith -- Atheism As Good News, 11. Fundamentalism and the Fight for the Future, and 12. Living in the Disenchanted World -- Toward an Atheism of the Future.Positives:1. An excellent, well-written, book that was a treat to read.2. Thought-provoking, a lot of intellectual gems.3. Thoughts with convictions, Mr. Eller made his points clear and did so with passion.4. Does a wonderful job of defining terms.5. Twelve Steps to recover one's natural atheism.6. Classical logical arguments for gods debunked: cosmological, ontological, and teleological. Also, a number of other interesting claims debunked too.7. Sound reasoning and logic exemplified throughout book.8. What reason is. A very thorough explanation.9. Principles of logic explained and uses many great religious arguments to help illustrate.10. How to use sound reasoning to argue against theists.11. Cultural relativism, I finally get it!12. Anthropology defined. Good stuff!13. Great wisdom, \\"To advocate that a belief be accepted without reason is to advocate that a belief be accepted without thought and without verification.\\"14. The best explanation for faith.15. Knowledge and certainty. Excellent descriptions. \\"Perhaps knowledge is inherently uncertain while belief is inherently certain...and therein lies all the difference.\\"16. Religious knowledge...I loved Mr. Eller's thoughts on this, very persuasive.17. Uses Michael Shermer's basic models on the matter of science and religion: same worlds, separate worlds, and conflicting worlds.18. Great insight on religion from many classic apologists. Tertullian's views are eye-opening and not in a good way.19. Defining science and why science is indifferent to religion.20. There are fascinating gems in this book, \\"In some Plains Indian societies in the western United States, people recognized not two but three genders --a male, a female, and a 'two-spirit' or third gender commonly referred to as a berdache for men who were inclined to perform some of the roles of women. Berdache were not \\"tolerated\\" but welcomed and valued in society, often holding respected positions in society as teachers or similar roles.\\"21. \\"There is no world-religious source that includes toleration as one of its values\\". Had to share.22. The history of toleration, fantastic!23. A great chapter on Separation of State and Churches...worth the price of the book.24. Thomas Jefferson an American icon.25. Atheism...spread the word. Promoting positive atheism.26. A great explanation of the terms: evangelization and proselytization.27. So what is our good news as atheists? Inspirational.28. The interesting history of fundamentalism.29. Atheist morality.30. Good bibliography.Negatives:1. I would have preferred an electronic version of this book for references purpose. This book has so much value2. Obviously some chapters are better than others. For instance, the sections on different atheisms didn't appeal to me as much as the rest of the book.3. No index...once again, electronic version would be appreciated. Kindle me!4. It's a serious book, perhaps a little humor would have added spice to an otherwise excellent book.In summary, \\"Natural Atheism\\", is an excellent book. It's a thought-provoking and erudite book that will satisfy the atheist community. Mr. Eller covers a lot of topics of interest to atheists and provides valuable information. His sound reasoning and logic of thought is appreciated and I look forward to more books from him. Well done!

Nonetheless, it is still highly recommended."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"This book goes more in-depth on reason itself than most books on atheism that I have read.Richard Dawkins is scientific where Christopher Hitchins demonstrates to us of the ills of religion by how it \\"poisons everything\\". Sam Harris shows us the folly of unexamined beliefs. But no one discusses at such length \\"reason\\" itself like David Eller. So it fills a gap and I found it very educational. I should caveat that Michael Martin is very exhaustive in his works on the philosophy side of it, but I find his books (though good) a bit dryer and harder to work my way through.David's book in some areas requires some deep thinking and pondering, so you can't just zip though it. You need to \\"think\\" about what he says, so it does require some level of commitment. I didn't really agree with his views on Agnosticism which seemed a bit contrived and goes against how most understand it, but found it rather interesting at least. He attempts to bridge the gap between positive and negative atheism which I think he succeeded successfully.I am looking forward to David's other book \\"Atheism Advanced\\" when I get a chance."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"Absolutely wonderful book by a great author.

It's really about rational, logical thinking and the trouble occurs then they don't happen."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"David Eller misses the point entirely as do most atheist, god is not the problem.Of course atheism is a reaction to theism, to the god belief, but god is no worse than Santa Claus or the Great Pumpkin, all of them are figments of human imagination. The problem is the clergy, that self-selected band of god representatives on Earth. They have taken a perfectly innocent fiction and have used it for their own vile purposes. The purposes, of course, are the accumulation of wealth and power as we can see in the Vatican and in other seats of religious power.As David Eller points out, god and religion are part of human culture. If every culture has one or more gods then there must be a good reason for it. I figure that it was some kind of survival mechanism, a way to fill a void of knowledge. Our brainpower developed faster than out initial ability to fill it with facts and instead we filled it with superstition and myth including the god myth. As we developed science and our knowledge grew, we replaced myth with facts and we continue doing so. Atheism is just one more step in this path.Natural Atheism aims to help the reader convert to atheism by first setting out a twelve step program and complementing this program with instruction about logic, reason, the burden of proof, history of religion, the founding fathers and many other topics that will help you argue with theists. But I'm not sure you want to argue with them, to what purpose? I mostly just avoid the subject. First of all, there is absolutely no need to justify ones atheist position to anyone. I'm an atheist because I decided I wanted to be one and no one on this whole Earth can deny me that. Second, most arguments about atheism center on religion. But if god does not exist, why bother arguing about god and religion? Think of it this way, the clergy is selling you a product you don't want or need. Would you get into a prolonged philosophical discussion with a salesperson in a store or would you simply say: \\"Thank you, I'm not interested.\\" The clergy has no right to question you about your morality or about anything else, it's non of their business. But this is precisely the technique they use to intimidate you. Just say \\"No.\\"The only real problem that remains is morality. Morality is part of culture. Morality is not restricted to religion, religion does not have an exclusive or a trademark on morality even if the clergy would like to take that position. This is why I don't have a problem with most of the ten commandments, the ones that don't include god but only your fellow man. I'm happy not to be killed and I would be happy if you didn't seduce my wife if I had one. These are the laws that we have given ourselves over the centuries and they work quite well in my opinion.If you still feel that you have to explain and defend your atheistic position to anyone you don't need to study atheism but assertiveness instead. The book that helped me a great deal in this quest wasWhen I Say No, I Feel Guiltyby Manuel J. Smith"},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"I thought it was great. The only problem for me was that the author holds to a moral relativistic position which I think is untenable and can lead to contradictions. But overall it was good.I also have his DVD which is also very helpful.I also met the author and thought he was quite sharp and interesting."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"This past week, I received a wonderful surprise in the mail. A friend of mine was excited and impressed by a new book he'd read. He overnighted me his copy. When I opened the package, I saw David Eller's \\"Natural Atheism.\\" Looking at the cover, it was the most attractive and beautifully printed book on atheism I'd ever seen. In this case, you CAN judge a book by its cover.I was familiar with David Eller's esteemed reputation in the atheist community, but I had never read a book by Dr. Eller (which is a sad comment on me, rather than Dr. Eller). This is unquestionably one of the finest books on atheism ever published. If you think this is an overstatement, then you have not yet read the book. Thankfully, there is no dishonest attempt in this book to reconcile religion and science, nor to water down the atheist message into agnosticism or secular humanism. The writing is clear, on-the-mark, and no-nonsense. If you are a person whose mind is at all receptive to reason, then you will benefit from -- and enjoy! -- reading this free-thought title. Your ability to combat creationism will be greatly empowered.Dr. Eller succinctly summarizes all the traditional arguments for and against God's existence. But, more importantly, he actually introduces a wealth of original material. Many books on atheism (and religion) merely rehash the same old arguments again and again. \\"Natural Atheism,\\" while discussing all the traditional issues, provides a much needed fresh and updated perspective. My only complaint is that, as the author of a title on atheism myself, Dr. Eller's book will no doubt prove to be tough competition!Nonetheless, I congratulate Dr. Eller for his exceptional volume, which will certainly become a popular seller when word of its publication becomes widely known. Additionally, Dr. Eller's book is published by American Atheists, who, in my opinion, are the leading and most authoritative voice for atheism in the world today. You will be very pleased with \\"Natural Atheism.\\"David MillsAuthor of \\"Atheist Universe\\""},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"In addition to being a contribution to clear and unpretentious explanations on the premises of atheism, this book succeeds in identifying several pitfalls created by faulty argumentation. Eller makes a remarkable distinction between the basis of a \\"belief,\\" which is neither \\"true or false\\" since it is beyond the scope of reason, and a contention presented as fact which requires evidence that can be observed or tested.In one of my favorite examples, Eller responds in this way when asked if he \\"believes\\" in evolution: he states that he doesn't \\"believe\\" in evolution but rather \\"accepts\\" evolution as the best explanation we have so far based on available evidence; if something more convincing comes along, he is ready to part with his previous views. Would theists be as willing to part with their views in light of hostile new evidence? This is one of many instances where Eller demonstrates his care in avoiding any games associated with \\"belief.\\" People can hide behind \\"beliefs\\" and justify them unfairly, either by using feelings and/ or personal experiences or reason itself--until, of course, reason fails to support their claims. That is, when convenient, logic and reason are allies to the believer. When not, it is time to hide behind the myriad of gods, spiritual experiences, etc.Eller maintains an open mind and recommends rigorous questioning and skepticism as a way of avoiding hasty conslusions and assumptions. Much explanation is given, and the reader should come away with a lucid understanding of the importance of the \\"burden of proof.\\" If we are to accept everything at face value without question, we would resort to considering any claim--regardless of how ludicrous--as serious.This book can reinforce a healthy mentality, challenging readers to examine the integrity of their thinking. From the role of philosophy and logic to the often misrepresented views of the \\"founding fathers,\\" Eller covers plenty of ground; to oversimplify his discussion of serveral matters with general comments would be unfair. I can hardly represent the depth of his elaborations. Eller delivers impeccable arguments complete with a combination of honesty, sophistication, experience, and wit rarely seen in a work of this nature."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"&#65279;To David Eller, an atheist is someone who does not believe in any God, as opposed to someone who affirmatively denies the existence of God. People, according to Eller, are not born believing in God; they have to be converted. In Eller's terminology, we are all natural atheists, hence the title of this worthwhile and well reasoned book.Eller's intention is to convert you back to your natural atheism. He even offers a twelve-step program; it won't work, of course, but neither do any other twelve-step programs, as far as we can tell.The book runs the gamut from reasoning and philosophy to science and religion, toleration, separation of church and state, and (although he doesn't call it that) epistemology. Many of the subjects are at least vaguely familiar to me, yet I found Eller's treatments refreshing and worthwhile.The book is a wonderful combination of reasoned argument and cogent one-liners. You'll have to read the reasoned arguments for yourselves, and I recommend you do so, but here, paraphrased, are some of the insightful one-liners. To the charge that atheism is a religion, Eller responds that atheism is no more a religion than not collecting stamps is a hobby. To monotheists, Eller (an anthropologist) observes that countless cultures believed in countless gods, and monotheists disbelieve in all but one. Atheists thus disbelieve in only one god fewer than monotheists. Finally, religion has no methodology and cannot solve problems: physics debunked phlogiston, but the Protestant Reformation could only replace one paradigm with a welter of conflicting paradigms.Two criticisms: Eller's inconsistent use of \\"god(s)\\" for \\"God\\" drove me crazy. More importantly, the book has no index; unlike a fish without a bicycle, a nonfiction book without an index is considerably less useful than the same book with an index.Such carping aside, it is a splendid book, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"I am a \\"natural atheist\\" as Dr. Eller defines the term, as I have never been a theist of any kind. Oh, my parents tried the best they could, but no one could ever give me a satisfactory answer to where the water came from. I really didn't think about it too much though, \`till I moved from the northeast to the south about fourteen years ago. Religion is part of the culture here, and impossible to avoid.\\"Natural Atheism\\" is probably the most complete book on atheism itself I have read, and the most coherent. He managed to hit most of my hot buttons, and clear up several of my conundrums along the way. As other reviewers have mentioned, reading the book is kind of like having a long-time atheist, who is also an old friend, take you through some of the rough spots, and show you where the shoals are.If you think you may be an atheist, I suggest you consider this book. If you are troubled about your belief in a deity of some sort, I suggest you consider this book. If you know you are an atheist, and are looking for a friend to talk to, I suggest you consider this book.The author discusses \\"spirituality,\\" where it comes from, and what it is. For me, this was one of the most meaningful parts of the book, as I have always had a problem with understanding exactly what was going on. His explanation was clear, concise, logical, and understandable. This book will become a part of my permanent library!"},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"Book catalogues are loaded with titles extolling the benefits and virtues of god-belief and religions. However, testimonials about atheism are in short supply.David Eller's \\"Natural Atheism\\" fills that niche beautifully. The author doesn't just explain atheism and make a compelling case for its validity. He also advocates \\"evangelism\\" on behalf of atheism and points out why it is so important to our modern world, especially to the culture of the United States.Dr. Eller writes with candor and clarity. His book is a welcome addition to this atheist's library. It sits alongside Dianna Narciso's \\"Like Rolling Uphill: realizing the honesty of Atheism,\\" David Mills' \\"Atheist Universe,\\" George Smith's \\"Atheism: the case against God,\\" and my own modest effort.As more and more atheists speak out, maybe there will be less and less misunderstanding about what atheism means and who atheists are and greater appreciation for why it matters.\\"Natural Atheism\\" is a valuable contribution toward that effort."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"David Eller writes with wit and passion. \\"Passion\\" is not a word applied by so-called mainstreamers to Atheists, since they are supposed to be feckless and ignorant. David Eller shows how this is not so as he passionately, intelligently and articulately lays out the Atheistic position.Prior to reading this, I read Sam Harris' *End of Faith* and can say there's simply no comparison. Harris' case is sophomoric in comparison. Mr. Eller hits the nails on their heads repeatedly. It would be hard to argue with the position he stakes out, without resorting to intellectual dishonesty, ad hominem abuse, and self-contradiction -- all which Theists are usually willing to do.One of the very strongest aspects of the book comes from Mr. Eller's anthropological background. He makes a point very forcefully and in different contexts that Theists really have no answer to whatsoever: which god(s) do we accept as real? Which body of supposedly divine teaching is right? There are so very many out there to choose from. Since most of the claims of these different traditions are mutually exclusive, which is right? You will find, says Mr. Eller, that Theists insist that their particular version is right and everyone else, by extension, must be wrong. You can't believe in Yahweh, Allah, Buddha and the Hindu pantheon all at once. These religions make mutually exclusive claims. So who has it right?Theists, of course, will defend their particular version of god(s). They are very uncomfortable if you try to extend that defence to other religious traditions. The more blinkered will condemn the other traditions as idolatry etc; the more open may pay lip service to ecumenism or other wishy-washy brands of toleration. But then you only have to point out that they are traducing the demands of the very god they profess, who insists as an absolutely basic point of faith, the he and he alone is god. They may then admit that the other god(s) are not real, that their followers are misguided, and so on. But the crucial point, no matter how it's dressed up, is that the monotheist denies the existence of the Greek, Roman or Hindu gods, African witches, Amazonian forest spirits, dead ancestor spirits, Aztec rain and war gods, or other monotheistic head honchos (like Allah). He has no other choice. If he didn't, he wouldn't be a monotheist.Most monotheists are therefore disbelievers. They disbelieve in many hundreds (if not thousands) of deities worshipped by others. Atheists only disbelieve in one more god than monotheists. So what's the fuss?This simple and beautiful point illustrates the book's elegant argument. A fabulous read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"For those who wonder why others do not believe in gods, the title of this book offers a big clue. The title addresses the fact that all humans are born athiests. It is only through indoctrination that they become theists. But a more important fact made in the book and addressed by the title is that many athiests acquire and develop their views as a natural consequence of how they acquire and process knowledge. They are not necessarily former theists, people who are disgruntled with religion, or rebels. They are critical thinkers, people who analyze situations, people who require evidence and logic. For rational thinkers, people who don't wallow in fiction, ahteism is a natural position. Many athiests are folks who simply don't hold as truth anything which is not reasonable, logical, or proven. It's not just religion which they disbelieve, but anything which must be accepted on faith alone. Based on this concept, it is probably safe to say that most atheists don't believe in anything \\"supernatural,\\" astrology, UFO's, or that the moon is made of cheese. Atheism, naturally, comes as part of the mindset of a reasoned thinker.It is this fact, above all the others made so well by author Eller, which will help readers understand what makes an atheist an atheist. While Eller encourages atheists to be heard by joining organizations, he points out that membership does not make one an athiest. Atheism a natural conclusion of a logical mind."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"When I first received an e mail from the author, Dr. David Eller, and his request that I review this book I had several on the shelf waiting for my attention. As an author of some note myself in this area, and being familiar with Dr. Eller's work in the field of Anthropology (as a Natural Historian, our interests over lap in many areas including anthropology and cultural studies), I was curious to get into this book and moved it to the top of the list. As you are reading this review, you are also curious about what kind of book this is. Let me qualify myself so that you may consider the source of this review, as anyone can say what they will on the internet and many people may not be forthright about their own agendas. To begin with, I am not an atheist myself, but a Pantheist. As such, I see the wonder and amazement of the cosmos itself as the reason it exists. I need not place humanity in any special role, nor do I accept we are the special project of any gods. That being said, I found this book very well structured, logical in its conclusions, and an easy and very captivating read.Dr. Eller begins with qualifying himself as a natural atheist. This is obvious, as we are all atheists at birth. But Dr. Eller goes further to explain why it is so many of us are held emotional captive by mythologies and belief systems. As an Anthropologist with extensive field experience and spent two years living among aboriginal people in Australia's outback where he studied both their culture and religious beliefs. As one with an exceptional degree of professional and field experience with other cultures, and more specifically cultures that have been largely unchanged for thousands of years, Dr. Eller has had opportunity to realize the cultural and political ideologies behind myth and religion; its development and continuance.Natural Atheism might be best summed as a user's manual for the rational person living in an irrational world. It will also be of immeasurable use to that person who is sitting on the fence of belief and reality. Although I found a few items in the chapter on Epistemology that I felt might have been more thoroughly explored, 98% of the book is flawless in its treatment of both theism and atheism and I cannot recommend this book highly enough, but 5 stars must do. Like David Mill's book, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"This book will hopefully persuade parents to provide an environment for their children that encourages the critical thinking skills that they will sorely need to successfully maneuver through life. Dr. Eller contrasts the concepts of knowledge and belief in an enlightening manner. I found logic, reason, insight, and humor on every page. I highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Natural Atheism","review":"I've been a non-theist since 2001 and have read a couple dozen books on the topic. This one is by far the best one I've read. The chapter on critical thinking alone is worth the price of the book. There's also a section on separation of church(es) and state that includes a handy synopsis of important legal decisions.Most books on atheism are structured approximately the same way - a section criticizing arguments for belief in gods and a section offering arguments against belief in gods and little else. Eller's book goes much further than these types of books and is much more useful.As mentioned above, Eller includes an and excellent chapter on critical thinking and logical fallacies. He also deals with issues like the difference between belief and knowledge, how to think about topics such as truth, science, and values.His section explaining the misunderstandings (and proper understanding) of relativism is also quite informative.This book has a lot more to offer and I've only scratched the surface - there are excellent chapters that discuss anthropology and freethought, toleration and truth, the twelve steps to atheism, fundamentalism, atheism as good news, and living in a disenchanted world.The book strikes an appropriate balance between heavy philosophical works like Michael Martin's Atheism: A Philosophical Justification and popular works like George H. Smith's Atheism: The Case Against God. Unlike many books on atheism, Eller accomplishes what he sets out to do without engaging in religion bashing.If you could buy only one book on atheism, I would recommend that it be this one."},{"Title":"This Mess","review":"I think the School Library Journal's reviewer is offended by this book's slightly subversive verse: \\"better\\" in Conrad's universe is equivalent to \\"unconventional.\\"My favorite conceit is the fireplace filled with blue balloons.

The artist duo Kara and writer Lee Yuh-Hee of the glorious must-read Demon Diary series have created this Angel Diary series. However, although both series have similarities in artistry and style, Angel Diary is unconnected to the world and people of Demon Diary.Chun-Yoo-Nim, the cute but not beautiful daughter of the royal family of heaven, is engaged by her father to the young king of hell. In order to escape her wedding she runs away to earth and poses as a normal teenage boy called Dong-Young. In the first volume of the series there are a few issues left unexplained, for example where is she living, if anyone is posing as her parents, and where does she get her money from. Four guardians from heaven who, would chance have it, are also posing as humans in the same school and vanquish evil spirits, are charged with finding her and bringing her back to heaven.While trying to hide from the four guardians, Dong-Young also has to cope with being constantly possessed by ghosts and the strong advances from Bi-Wal another boy in her class. Of course Bi-Wal has a hidden idenitity and secretly knows that Dong Young is in fact a girl. Apart from the unanswered questions, the first volume also suffers from being slightly disjointed in places and not being as laugh-out funny as Demon Diary. The creators admit that they were rushed into finalizing this first volume.However, the plus points far outweigh the minuses. The strory is funny and very very cute; Bi-Wal looks like a young version of the OMG gorgeous Eclipse from DD; there are echoes of the first volume of Eerie Querie with the spirit possession; cross-dressing elements; and a strong romantic theme throughout that was missing from DD. Indeed it is almost worth buying the volume for a copy of gorgeous half-dressed Bi-Wal picture at the beginning of the book.If you are a fan of manhwa (Korean manga), the Demon Diary series, or Eerie Querie, this series is a must-buy. Hopefully the story will become stronger in the next volume and I can give it 4 stars."},{"Title":"Angel Diary: v. 1","review":"Demon Diary was one of the best manga series i've ever read. I just loved it so much, from the story to the characters it was pure gold. And though Angel Diary isn't connected at all to that wonderful manga, I'm seeing the greatness these creators possess shining through once again.All the things treasured in Demon Diary, are back here in Angel Diary. The story thus far is one of pure hillarity. But even so, I can't help but wonder what will happen down the line, it's turing out to be quite an inchanting plot. The characters, of course, are to die for. Their personalities alone are just amazing, they are so easy to instantly fall in love with.Even without Demon Diary, Angel Diary can stand alone as what is sure to be a great new manga. I can't wait to reach the climaxes the story is sure to have. Hopefully we'll get to spend more time with these characters then we did with Demon Diary's short (but amazing!) 7 volumes."},{"Title":"Angel Diary: v. 1","review":"It's fantasy but also some reality and the characters are completely realistic as well. Great buy, have read it several times myself in a few days. I can't wait for the next volume!"},{"Title":"Angel Diary: v. 1","review":"This manhwa has great art and I like the characters so far. The characters have humor as well as tints of depth in them. I don't find anything wrong with the plot. It has it's sparks of \\"Oh, what's going to happen next?!\\" Nevertheless, you get to wondering about the characters that seem at first glance very amusing to be somewhat dark and enigmatic. 'Angel Diary' the first volume, has great artwork nothing less from the team of Kara and the plot line that YunHee Lee puts out, which is the princess of heaven escaping to Earth, to try to get out of the arranged marriage set by her parents.By the way, is to the king of hell. This is all in attempt to try to sort out a truce of peace between heaven and hell. The princess manages to go to the human school disguised as a pretty boy, however, is very prone to being possessed by ghosts or anything that is spiritual, at that, so she gets herself in quite a bit of trouble, heh. Also, she is crippled of her powers on Earth with the spell that is on her, which by the way the Queen of Heaven put on her.A must buy for any Manhwa fan out there that likes the gender switch of girl into boy sort of thing, and is looking for something that is as promising with the characters development as with the plot.A++++ Manhwa!!! :-)"},{"Title":"Angel Diary: v. 1","review":"To avoid marrying the king of hell, an angel princess goes to Earth-- as a schoolboy. She actually gets very into her role, complaining about the difficulty of hiding \\"these useless breasts\\" and fighting off the advances of her (male) friend and schoolmate. So far, the story shows a few of the princess's exploits and the angel kingdom's attempts to track her down. It's very cute, and I'm fond of the art. Also, the gender bending is pulled off so well that it appeals to my yaoi (boys-love) fetish. However, the plot is somewhat confusing, and not exactly deep to begin with. I'm going to be on the lookout for the next volume, though."},{"Title":"Angel Diary: v. 1","review":"I love angel diary, ive already read the series but is so good that I had too buy it. The story is dealt good and I really love the art work and I'm a big fan of genderbenders."},{"Title":"Angel Diary: v. 1","review":"The only princess of Heaven is missing! Running away from her arranged marriage to the King of Hell, the princess Dong-Young is hiding on Earth, living as a normal teen...boy?! All of the angels of Heaven and the agents of Hell--as well as the demon race--are looking for her, but they don't know exactly who they're looking for. The four guardians of Heaven are charged with returning the princess, but not all of them agree with that charge. Meanwhile, on Earth, Dong-Young is trying to blend in, but her annoying classmate Bi-Wal keeps declaring his love for her. But he thinks she's a boy, doesn't he?Kara, the duo behind the series Demon Diary (TokyoPop), team up with writer Lee to create a cute romance that plays with the ideas of gender and family relationships. Dong-Young is not the only character whose gender is confused, called into question, or out and out changed throughout the course of this series. Because of this, Kara and Lee manage to get readers thinking about what gender really means, though they never shove any ideas down anyone's throats. This is still a light romantic fantasy. But there are characters who don't look their assigned gender, there are characters who form deep bonds with characters of the same gender, and there are characters who have to transcend the perceived limits of their gender. What makes all the deep thoughts work is that Kara and Lee do not drop the issues midway through the series in favor of romance or action or vice versa. They keep those ideas fresh and they keep the action and romance moving. It's obvious that they have mapped out the world they created and that they know how things work in that world. So when new ideas are presented, they fit nicely into a slot that readers didn't at first see but makes perfect sense within the story.The romance is never neglected, though at times it isn't developed as fully as it could be. Dong-Young's relationship with Bi-Wal is as \\"awww\\" inducing as romance readers could want. Bi-Wal saves Dong-Young when needed, but Dong-Young is also unafraid to take the initiative. She's a fearless young woman who grabs a hold of what she desires--fitting for a ruler. Another love relationship is built a little too easily, with the complications shoved aside in favor of moving along the story. A third relationship comes close to being a same-sex one, though it appears to be entirely emotional. The two characters need each other and find companionship and completion from one another that they never found from others. It's hard to say how that relationship will turn out by the end of the series, but at the end of volume ten it appeared to have been shattered.Family relationships are another big part of the series. Dong-Young's role as princess is one that fits what her father needs her to do, no matter what she might want. Two of the guardians of Heaven are step-siblings and two are cousins and their relationships with each other are shaped by their family ties (both positive and negative) and by a childhood together. Bi-Wal's role in the story is easy for readers to guess, but how his family shapes Dong-Young's story--and how she in turn shapes that family--makes for compelling reading. Not all of the characters are fully developed, however. It's unfortunate that at least one of the guardians devolves from a major player to a humorous side-character, but that can happen in long series with a lot of characters.Kara's art (one of the duo draws and the other inks) is pretty and cute at the same time, much like the story. There are a lot of very pretty young men in the story, fitting for a romance story aimed at female readers. Luckily Kara is also skilled at the action and fantasy scenes. In a story like this, those scenes could become chaotic, especially when there are a number of characters in play, but Kara manages to balance everything and keep those scenes clear and moving along quickly. Angel Diary is only 13 volumes long, so it is nearing the end of its run. There is nothing that should keep it out of the hands of a middle-school-age audience and the medium-sized length of the series makes it easy to fit into budgets. Libraries looking for light fantasy romances to meet the needs of voracious readers would do well to consider this series.-- Snow Wildsmith"},{"Title":"Angel Diary: v. 1","review":"I absolutly loved this manga.

The coverage is extensive and includes situations like dealing with the overzealous parent at open house, the parent who wants to talk daily just before school, the parent who gossips about the child or about you, the parent who mistakenly believes their child is gifted, the child who is gifted, the child whose performance is declining, habitually truant children, bullies, the student caught cheating or stealing, parental questions on testing and test results, and dozens of other situations. The book is laid out in a workbook style full of notes, reminder lists, examples of various written communications, self-evaluations, sign-in forms, forms for a parent to request a conference, forms for a teacher to request a conference, guidelines sheets, phone logs, behavior observation charts, and just about anything else that you could possible ask for or anticipate needing. By having established policies that are clear and easy to understand the teacher keeps control not only of her students, but also of his or her time.

(School Talk, 1)","review":"Teacher Talk is a helpful way to aide not only the first year teacher but even all seasoned teachers with a month by month checklist of effective communication strategies to utilize throughout the school year and their teaching career. This book is a must have!!"},{"Title":"Teacher Talk! (School Talk, 1)","review":"As a student, I am very interested in pursuing my career in education. Reading Teacher Talk gave me an excellent idea of what to expect and how to deal with many of the issues faced everyday in and out of the classroom. I was beyond pleased with the knowledge and ideas I have taken from this book.Some examples of the topics discussed are--dealing with the parents who want to know what, where, when, and how you teach, the child who performs below grade level, parent conferencing, the child caught cheating, the parents who are too involved, and much much more. This book covers all aspects of teacher responsibilities starting with open house in September to communicating with yourself in June. Teacher Talk made me realize that communicating with my students is only a very small portion of my duty as a teacher. Parents are essential. If I can communicate and gain the parents support, I will reach my goal of becoming a very inspiring teacher.The most beneficial portions of this book, in my opinion, were the suggestions revealing how to deal and communicate with parents effectively. Teacher Talk explicitly addresses many real life scenarios. Following these scenarios are suggestions and guidelines that can be used to overcome many obstacles. Most parents go to the extreme to see their kids succeed and we as teachers must be fully prepared to handle any of their concerns.Another useful aspect of Teacher Talk is the countless amounts of already made worksheets located at the back of the book. These worksheets are helpful on the organizational side of things. Some examples of the worksheets are open house sign in form, transportation form, parent/teacher phone log, day of conference check-list, parent communication survey, and many more. These pre-made worksheets are a great help to anyone who is interested in teaching.I suggest Teacher Talk for anyone who is pursuing a career in education. There is no such thing as a perfect teacher, so why not try to advance your skills with opening yourself up to new ideas?"},{"Title":"Teacher Talk!

Although the 1988 edition is a little dated now, its coverage is very wide and it had really up-to-the minute acronims and words in it then, so it is not very much out-of-date yet.

I think it would be pleasing to anybody who is a fan of the Brontes, Jane Austen, or Daphne du Maurier, but it seems to me to be a little less well-written than the books by those more famous writers. It becomes more readable and engrossing once you get past several baffling opening scenes which only come into focus after you get deeper into the tale and learn more about the characters and the locale.The story is about two unlikely lovers, which isn't an unusual feature in romances; but the fact that the psychological conflict in the tale deals IN DEPTH with an obstacle of RELIGIOUS CONFLICT turns out to be pretty astonishing. Helbeck, the character for whom the book is titled, is a very devout Catholic bachelor satisfied with living an unusually pious, abstemious, and charitable life on the deteriorating estate of his centuries-old family. Laura, an impetuous and rude young woman taught to be a free-thinker by her intellectual father, arrives with her stepmother for a visit at the Bannisdale mansion. The relationship that develops between the two main protagonists and some of the supporting characters serves as a vehicle for a sub-theme--which is nonetheless also a major and oddly important theme--about the specific religious conflict between traditional, very pious Catholicism and modern concepts of freedom and personhood. Catholicism in the person of Helbeck, who emerges as both an admirable and compelling character, is intermittently assailed by Laura, whose emotional resistance to him bespeaks an admixture that would include what might perhaps rightly be termed poorly-defined scientific atheism, paganism, anti-\\"Papist\\" Protestantism, and just modern \\"free-thought\\" in general. The personality clash at the heart of the story is rather as if ideas that are new and raw, not well enough thought out, and emotionally undisciplined are trying to come to terms with an adamantine formal religion that is highly ordered, mystical, and resolutely firm. The author writes knowledgeably and sympathetically about Catholicism, which I would never have expected to find handled in a romantic novel. So that's why I say that this is an astonishing \\"romance.\\" However, the story can be read just basically as a good \\"love story.\\" It isn't a highly intellectual book, and the reader could appreciate the religious conflict in the tale from just the usual viewpoint of ANYbody who likes to read novels and romances. The story soon cast over me the spell of a good work of fiction and it was hard to put down.Laura Fountain's surname probably was deliberately chosen by the author to suggest the natural vivacity and volatile elements that are part of Laura's nature. Notice, too, how Laura feels deep connections with some of the watery manifestations of nature on the Bannisdale estate, especially the wild River Gleet. Early in the story, her character is so proud, critically outspoken, and willful that any reader is bound to dislike her, but over the course of about 500 pages she changes a good deal. She even experiences a very basic Christian conversion at one point, I think, but this is unclear (at least, to me) and perhaps not permanent. There is anxiety created throughout the story by the back-and-forth changes of mind and heart that take place in Laura. The action takes place within over-all circumstances that are torn-apart and at odds. There are ominous tensions between qualities of refinement and rudeness, sensitivity and obtuse carelessness (sometimes admixed in the same character), the crumbling estate and the earthy farm, the old rural way of life and the new industrialized town life, and the ideals and tendencies of Catholicism and Protestantism.Perhaps there are implications to draw from Alan Helbeck's surname. The \\"Hel-\\" syllable could suggest the abode of the damned, a place of suffering and punishment. The root meaning of the \\"-beck\\" syllable can refer either to a mountain stream or to a \\"call\\" or summons. The combination of these meanings might possibly apply in an ironic way to Alan Helbeck's destiny with regard to Laura.Other characters' surnames which obviously seem meaningful are Mason and Friedland. (And there may be other meaning-filled names that I've failed to notice.)I think that the book is provocative from the point of view of its dealing so deliberately with Catholicism versus inchoate ideas of personal freedom. Going by what I read in a brief on-line biography of the author, she observed this same kind of conflict in her parents during her early family life. Despite the length of the book, I feel that the author didn't deal adequately--especially from an emotional standpoint--with the situation she created and the plot that she ultimately unraveled for the reader. In its odd way, it's a terrific book and I think it's \\"unforgettable.\\" I highly recommend it. But, after the author has managed to provide the opening up and expectation of a believable love union in the midst of the very great unlikelihood of one, she hits the reader with an unexpected ending. Anyway, I wasn't prepared for what happened. I'd be interested to see what other readers might say about it. The only comment I'd heard about the book before I read it was from a reader who had responded to it by saying, \\"Poor Laura!\\" I'd add to that, \\"Poor Alan!\\"I won't say anything more about the story so that the reader can come to the book without many expectations and can go through a purely intense experiencing of the story as I did. I recommend that the reader NOT read anything about the author and not even read any of the author's prefaces to other editions of the book until AFTER reading the story of Helbeck and Laura. Just plunge in with a pure, unprejudiced mind and imagination. The story will have greater impact that way. Then, after you think your own thoughts in response to the story, it may or may not be interesting (for you) to find out more about Mrs. Humphrey Ward if you don't already know about her.[I took the trouble to seek out and order the original 1898 Vol I and II editions of the book, which were not more expensive than the modern versions. Enjoyed reading the antique copies. Had never heard of the author or the book until they turned up in connection with family research where I read about the book in an old letter.] (The complete novel is a 2-volume set.

There are plenty of color photographs of artifacts, as well as substantial information that seems to be well-researched.

Anyone who has delved into this area knows how confusing it is to keep the Sumerians, Assyrians, and Babylonians all distinguished from one another. There is a tendency to lump all \\"Mesopotamians\\" together in a way that makes it easier to talk about but harder to understand. In fact, at one point in studying this, I figured out that my seven year old thought \\"Mesopotamians\\" were different from Sumerians and Babylonians... a fourth culture!This book does a great job tackling this problem. There are great maps in it, great insets, and distinguishing paragraphs where there needs to be. It is slightly above a 2nd and 3rd grade level, where my boys are, but still helpful if a parent helps them work through it slowly.

But this is not an easy book to read. What does it mean to \\"know\\"? what do we know? how far can we be sure that we do in fact know? These are fundamental questions about human thought, and this book is an essential item in the library of anyone who is concerned with such questions."},{"Title":"Human knowledge: Its scope and limits","review":"Russell's \\"Human Knowledge: Its Scope and Limits\\" has had more influence on my own thinking than any other work of technical philosophy I have read. Russell is always a spectacularly readable and clear writer, full of vivid, well chosen examples, and with very little abstract argument or technical jargon. He is also, at least in this work, particularly sensible, realistic, and grounded in reality. I don't always find the answers he proposes adequate; but I do always feel that his questions and concerns are the right ones."},{"Title":"The Bermuda Triangle","review":"Although most of the sensational \\"mysteries\\" and disappearances of ships and airplanes in the \\"Bermuda Triangle\\" have since been proven to be the result of either human error or ordinary bad weather, this is still an entertaining read. For a while. After running to the computer every few pages to check on recent developments in the searches for these crafts and finding out that either wreckage has been found, or that recordings of distress signals have been digitally enhanced and turned out to be far less ominous than reported, I got more and more disenchanted. That this book is frequently listed as non-fiction is unfortunate. Nevertheless, Berlitz is a compelling writer, and it's not difficult to read. I'm sure if you like this genre and aren't terribly distracted by \\"facts\\" you may enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Bermuda Triangle","review":"This is the first book I've read about the Bermuda Triangle, and it was quite fascinating! Mr. Berlitz first describes the disappearances that have occurred in the region, and then discusses the possible causes for them. Some great photographs are also included.The only reason I've given this book a \\"4\\" instead of a \\"5\\" is that the author tends to go off on tangents - all of which I found quite interesting - however, I think it may have been better had he left some of this info. to another book.I would definately recommend purchasing this book (although you'll have to find a used copy) for anyone interested in the Bermuda Triangle, or ancient mysteries in general."},{"Title":"The Bermuda Triangle","review":"If you believe in ghosts and fairies, this is the book for you. For me, it is immensely fascinating how seemingly rational persons go for this pseudo-scientific nonsense. I give it 2 stars, not zero, because it's entertaining in its own absurdity."},{"Title":"The Bermuda Triangle","review":"If you are totally uncritical thinker, someone who still finds the Easter Bunny stories fascinating, then you'll love this book. There are so many things wrong with it that it's difficult to know where to start. He certainly plays fast and loose with the facts and doesn't let a little lie every now and then get in the way of a good story. For instance, there is the USAF Globemaster disappearance in 1950. It did disappear, but it was on a flight from Newfoundland to Ireland at the time. How in the world does this count as a Triangle disappearance since the route passes nowhere near the Triangle? And the weather always seems to be \\"calm,\\" but a check with U.S. weather service records shows that this is not the case most of the time. In fact, in one instance (the cargo ship Sandra) weather records show that at the time of the disappearance winds were topping out at 73 mph, only 2 mph below hurricane force! And his co-writer (J. Manson Valentine) tried to capitalize on the financial success of this book by inventing a Great Lakes Triangle, but that book did not sell. Go read Lawrence Kusche's Bermuda Triangle Mystery - Solved if you would have the truth. If on the other hand you prefer to remain ignorant, well I'm sure that you can find a copy of that Great Lakes Triangle book somewhere."},{"Title":"The Bermuda Triangle","review":"Speaking as a graduate of the USCG/USAF National Search and Rescue School, the whole concept of a \\"Bermuda Triangle\\" is a bunch of hokum and this is the terribly researched book that started the nonsense. Any area that has as much novice ship and aircraft trafic is going to have lost vessels. There's actually more of a case for a Cape Sable Triangle, but everyone realizes the North Atlantic has storms!This whole book was debunked by a research librarian in Arizona who simply did real footnoted research (something Berlitz never thought of) in the following book:\\"The Bermuda Triangle Mystery - Solved\\" by Larry KuscheThe mystery of the Bermuda Triangle had been told in books, magazine articles, and on television and radio talk shows for several years when, in 1972, Larry Kusche, then a reference librarian, decided to collect all the information he could find on each incident. He made contact with the Coast Guard, the Air Force, Lloyd's of London, and many other agencies. He obtained microfilm copies of newspapers from cities where various incidents had been reported.This exhaustive research had an unexpected result - it solved the mystery. It also resulted in the publication of The Bermuda Triangle Mystery - Solved which is now back in print. Larry Kusche's book is more than an investigation of a mystery: it is a fascinating case history of a \\"manufactured mystery\\" in the making. It shows how over the years the raw materials of official accident reports, newspaper accounts articles in the mainstream press, and word of mouth have been assimilated into a \\"false mystery\\".The Bermuda Triangle Mystery - Solved is the only book written on the Triangle that approaches the topic rationally, rather than as another great unsolved mystery of our time. Approximately 60 of the best-known cases are examined, in an unusual, but very clear and logical style. Kusche relates each incident as it has been told over the years. He then includes snippets from articles and reports that show what was written at that time. Kusche then discusses the incident, pointing out flaws in the story.The Bermuda Triangle Mystery - Solved is the only book that critically examines the \\"mystery\\" and provides the reader with an alternative rational explanation to the sensationalist stories in the media.Larry Kusche is a technical writer, commercial pilot, and a flight instructor.

After reading his book \\"Atlantis The Eighth Continent\\", I was stunned at how good his book was compared to the other 5 I had just read. I had read a few of what I thought great interesting material on ancient history and was quite pleased with them, and some of the interesting factual tidbits they gave...then I read Berlitz' work Atlantis... and immediately grabbed another Berlitz book (this one) to read, wondering if it was a fluke. It was no fluke! Since then I have bought every other work of his I could find. This mans work is well above the other material and it made me hope that I might find other competent researchers works out there.He brings a vast array of interesting material to support his subject. The fact that this book sold millions of copies is no fluke, and I was truly surprised to find I'm only the second one to review this work (on Amazon.ca) and the first one to recommend it!( and I'm surprised to find only 8 reviews are here on Amazon.com. How soon we forget the masters!!!)It was his work that slowly made me realize that the ancient history is related to so many current subjects and it was his work that gave me some clues to suggest that there just might be something to all the UFO's out there as well.This guy approaches his subject rationally and methodically and furthermore he writes very well and his stuff is very readable, and indeed considering his subjects he makes even the potentially dry material exciting! After reading this book I was sold and I have bought every work by this man I could lay my hands on ever since.(except his language books...but you know I may buy one of his language book now!)Even though this book is now 34 years old it reads FAR better then some of the new ones out there.

Charles Berlitz delves into the secrets and mysteries of &quot;The Bermuda Triangle.&quot; His mastery of the subject allows him to intertwine this subject with several other theories and mysteries that give validity and truth to his premises of the origin of the Bermuda Triangle. I am an avid reader of science fiction, biographies, science and many other subjects. I really have a tremendous interest in researching more on the topics that Berlitz brought up. Some of those interesting subjects are The Philadelphia Experiment, Project Rainbow, Mayan Culture and UFO's. Books are written to educate and to encourage learning. Charles Berlitz has mastered both"},{"Title":"The Bermuda Triangle","review":"The very popularity of this book shows Berlitz captured the imagination of a lot of people. For this, the book deserves five stars. It shows he has a knack for imaginative writing.However, the book is quite inaccurate as to facts. Recent scientific experiments have established that methane gas eruptions on the sea floor give rise to two phenomena. The gas bubbles cause boats to sink and plane engines to cut out. The experiments resulted in sinking boats. Nature, of course, gives rise to far more spectacular occasions of such methane gas bubble eruptions. It is known that these gas bubbles rise to the surface of the ocean and rise up into clouds. It has been demonstrated that one percent methane is sufficient to cause an airplane engine to cut out, especially of the Avenger type model aircraft. The clouds in the Bermuda triangle contain up to 20 percent methane. Flying through them would aggravate the problem for any pilot. Furthermore, methane gas, just ten percent of it, will cause the flight indicators to read that the plane is climbing, when in fact it is falling. In a cloud, where you cannot see anything below you, you could easily crash.However, Flight 19 mentioned in this book of the five navey avengers was likely the result of psychological problems of the lead pilot. Recent understanding of flight psychology has shown that pilots can get spacially disoriented. The stress level increases and the pilot will get tunnel vision. Nothing will shake him from his belief because nothing can shake him from his fear. As a result, he won't trust his flight instruments. We know that this lead pilot thought he was in the Florida Keys when in fact he wasn't. In combination with the above scenario of methane gas, he may have been stressed because he couldn't see where he was going and because his instrument panel went off the charts.The Big Foot legend mentioned by Berlitz is likely the result of University of Washington professors who wanted tenure. Furthermore, it kept the evolution myth alive since no missing link otherwise exists.Berlitz mentioned the lochness monster or \\"plesiasaur.\\" Recently, on the national geographic channel, a sperm whale was cut open and inside was found a completely intact plesiasaur.

They remind one of Edgar Rice Burroughs and read just as smoothly -- one adventure after another -- always with a strong, young protagonist a boy can wish to emulate. These are real gems if you can find them. I included a list of titles with my scans. Good hunting and good reading!"},{"Title":"A slave of Catiline (Roman life and times series)","review":"\\"Slave of Catiline,\\" written by Paul Lewis Anderson (1880-1956), was published in 1930.This story follows the adventures of a slave named Tiberius Rufus who lost his parents in a shipwreck and was raised by fishermen in Sicily. When pirates raided his village, he was captured, sold into slavery, and purchased by a lanista, a trainer of Roman gladiators.Tiberius distinguishes himself in the arena as a red-haired left-handed net fighter. When this book starts, he is purchased to serve as a bodyguard to a scheming politician named Lucius Sergius Catilina, aka Catiline, who history remembers as the architect of a vast conspiracy to overthrow the Roman Republic in the 1st Century B.C.. These are the tumultuous times bracketed by Sulla, Cicero, and Caesar and, as such, make for a very interesting backdrop for a good, well-crafted story.Tiberius' master, Catiline, is on the wrong side of history. He is rich, clever and persuasive, but ultimately outwitted by Marcus Tullius Cicero, Rome's greatest orater. Much has been written about Cicero, the self made man who was not born into fortune and status. In \\"Catiline,\\" we get glimpses of his private and public life as he wrestles with the threat of a rebellion that has strong appeal to many in the upper class.\\"Slave of Catiline\\" focuses on Tiberius Rufus as he struggles with the Roman ideals of honor, civic virtue, dignity, and duty. Tiberius, whose history and destiny make him a wonderful protagonist, must chose between duty to his master and a debt of gratitude he owes Cicero for having spared the life of his best friend.This is a story about friendship and honor in the face of duty to an increasingly questionable cause. Given that the protaganist is a former gladiator, there is plenty of adventure and many well-written fight scenes though the violence is never graphic.Anderson's formal, yet accesible prose is a real pleasure and it serves to anchor the story in an earlier time. I'm sure that real gladiators and scheming politicians were far more foul-mouthed than Anderson portrays, but it's a testiment to the author that he conveys the gritty times in language that was acceptable to his own times.The pace is enjoyable but not relentless like so many modern adventure novels.\\"Slave of Catiline\\" reads like a sequel to Anderson's \\"Pugnax the Gladiator (Roman Life and Times Series)\\" which was published nine years later. I recommend reading \\"Pugnax\\" first if you can, but the stories stand independent of each other.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"A slave of Catiline (Roman life and times series)","review":"People say this book is bad and pointless- they're wrong.

The characters are different, but there are enough similarities to link the two without a problem. This time around, Circle Dawn, sort of the frontiersmen of the colonization movement, are called to a planet where, it seems, humans may have inadvertently broken the nonaggression treaty with the native race, the Karg; Kargan hatchlings are dying on their way through the change to adulthood. The book jacket goes much farther into the plot than this, but explaining the how and why of things would be, to me, a spoiler; you'll just have to read the thing.I originally thought Dreams of Dawn was just getting off to a slow start, but what seemed to be a lack of ability to pace a novel is more Steussy's writing style. This is not necessarily surprising, considering her nonfiction publications (anyone seeing a title like Gardens in Babylon: Narrative Faith in the Greek Legends of Daniel, who has ever been exposed to literary criticism, will likely pull out the dictionary before even cracking the cover). And it can be a stumbling block for some readers, no doubt. But Steussy's strengths belie the weaknesses of pacing and somewhat leaden explication; her characters are very well-developed, the plot does move along (albeit slowly), and her ability to build tension under these conditions is somewhat, well, remarkable. By the time you're a quarter of the way through the novel, you're still in character development mode, and while the main problem has been advanced, Circle Dawn haven't really started the quest to figure out what the problem is yet... and you don't care. You're too busy getting to know these people. And liking them, for the most part. They help mask the relatively recycled plot and its underlying very recycled theme (to Steussy's credit, she never crosses the line between recycled and clich&eacute;, and never gets preachy on us; no one in the novel ever actually hugs a tree).\\"Compelling\\" is not the right word to use for this novel, thanks to its leisureliness, but it kept me reading well enough. Worth a look for sci-fi fans. ***"},{"Title":"DREAMS OF DAWN","review":"In 'Dreams of Dawn', Marti Steussy gives us a look at another piece of the universe she created in 'Forest of the Night'. There are no cross-over characters; everyone in this novel is new to the reader. However, the overall structures and ideas are still the same: this a future in which humanity has gone forward into the universe in a tentative way, exploring planets and beginning colonisation for human beings in cooperation, for the most part, with other intelligent species encountered along the way. Protocols have been set up, worked out over long and painful experience, that certain trained teams, called the First-Inners, would be the first to explore new potential planets, to determine if the colonists pose a threat to the indigenous population, particularly those that might possess intelligence. This is reminiscent of the Star Trek Prime Directive, save that there is no non-interference policy here, but rather a search for means of cooperation.Like the first story, there is a colony already in place, the planet having been cleared by the First-Inner team for a colony that is well-established and thriving. There are several species here, who consider not only the newcomers alien, but are also alien and mysterious to each other (think of the relationship, or lack thereof, of whales to humans, for a broad comparison). The Kargans had a life-cycle that changed them from one form to another in three stages, the third stage of which was alien to the others.Steussy creates a colony world not too much different than a rural town perhaps in the old West of North America - far from production centres and population, relying on their own product for the most part, but also active in trade. This is very different from the more 'traditional', sanitised and plastic colony-bubbles of most science fiction.When trouble begins to arise on the planet, First-Inners return to investigate, but find difficulties on both sides of the issue. The main characters here are the First-Inner team, some special Kargans and colonists, but the real point of the story becomes the mystery to be solved - that mystery is not what is happening to the Kargans (the human food supply, alien to young Kargans, is to blame) but what should happen to them in the normal course of their lives. Even to the Kargans, it is a mystery.The key question here is similar to that in the first novel: Can they learn to communicate before a disastrous confrontation takes place?It is quite fitting that Marti Steussy, biochemist, Hebrew scriptures scholar and minister, would put so many rich elements into this story, too. The science makes sense, though I confess to have gotten lost on first reading at some of the biochemistry (I am an astronomer at heart). The change of the Kargans can be likened to life-stages of human beings, but especially those who are in search of special callings - the biblical phrase 'many are called, but few are chosen' is particularly apt for the final Kargan metamorphosis. Steussy is an adventurous person, and for part of her research for this book, she drew on personal experiences in caves in Tennessee.It is a pity that Steussy isn't writing science fiction any longer. However, her two novels (this, and Forest of the Night) provide a good field for the imagination, and her novels are definite assets to any science fiction collection."},{"Title":"Brush up Your Bible","review":"The Bible is one of the most influential books in the world, in more ways than one might think at first glance. The Bible, and in particular the King James Version, has had a profound impact on the English language, especially in word and turn-of-phrase choice. Perhaps this was due to the fact that the King James Version of the Bible was produced during the flowering of the English language, historically speaking about the same time as Shakespeare, and when English was beginning to be carried across the seas in commerce and colonisation.Many of the phrases we take for granted today are of Biblical origin. Phrases such as 'salt of the earth', 'labor of love', 'fight the good fight', and 'to cast the first stone' come from the Bible. However, other 'biblical' statements and phrases, such as 'original sin', actually do not exist in the biblical text. Many things are attributed to the Bible, but are not in fact there.'Brush Up Your Bible' is a fun little book designed to highlight the parts of the Bible that have made it into common speech, the stories, legends, and linguistic elements. It also highlights the common mistakes made in assessing these stories. For instance, how many animals of each sort did Noah take into the ark? Think it was two of each kind? Guess again.Interspersed with the stories are historical notes--an essay entitled 'Why four gospels?' for instance, discusses the development the gospels as texts:'It is now clear that the four canonical Gospels were not the only four to be written, and that others--now lost or excluded from the Bible--circulated among the Christian communities of the Roman world. But by the early second century, church leaders had begun to regard Matthew, Mark, Luke and John as the best and most authoritative records of Jesus' works and teaching. The New Testament canon as we know it took shape as a whole in the fourth century.'The section on non-biblical (but seemingly biblical) phrases includes an historical record of where these phrases actually originate. The phrase, 'don't know him from Adam' actually originates from the serial 'London Sessions' in 1784; 'raising Cain' might have been done, but was not referenced in the Bible; 'God forbid!' never occurs in the Bible, but rather in the thirteenth century poem 'Cursor Mundi'. The 'Golden Rule' is never actually called the Golden Rule, but is referred to as the 'Golden Law' by Robert Godfrey in 1674. And, while there are many Jehoshaphats in the Hebrew Bible, none of them was specifically known to be a jumper. These and other fascinating facts show the breadth of the influence of the Bible, as well as the breadth of Macrone's work in drawing it all together.Macrone has a neat little section on famous 'typos' in Bibles of the past, and recounts such examples as the 'Ears to Ear Bible', which misprinted the famous line 'who hath ears to hear, let him hear' as 'who hath ears to ear, let him hear'. There was a 'Wicked Bible', printed in 1631, which misprinted the seventh commandment to read 'Thou shalt commit adultery'. There is the 'Placemaker's Bible' from 1562 in which Jesus in the beatitudes proclaims, 'Blessed are the placemakers'. Perhaps one printer, fearing persecution, was responsible for the 'Printer's Bible' in 1702, whose psalmist decries the 'printers' (rather than 'princes') who have 'persecuted me without a cause'.Explore the Bible in a new way. If you are interested in the spiritual message, this will be a welcome side treat. If you don't care for the Bible much, this book will show you just how much of a debt of language and literature is owed to it nonetheless. In any case, this is an excellent book to learn fascinating facts often overlooked both by scholarly and inspirational studies.The author, Michael Macrone, also produced a volume entitled 'Brush Up Your Shakespeare', whose language is contemporary with the King James Version of the Bible. This makes a good gift, a good refresher, and a good book for discover of a common but no longer commonly known subject, approached from a gentle, humourous, non-dogmatic way."},{"Title":"Mainly in Moonlight: Ten Stories of Sorcery and the Supernatural","review":"I met Mainly in Moonlight by accident, it seemed, at a library book sale. At $1 per each grocery bag full of books, I stocked up for the winter reading season. However, when it came right down to it, I didn't have the time to concentrate on longer works, and this book, having 10 short stories, was more convenient to read in snatches.I was drawn in immediately by Gray's realistic portrayal of the characters (albeit magical), and the not-quite-fairy-tale flavor of the stories. Gray's magical world is true in the sense that, like *real* life, things are unpredictable, and fate seems capricious at times. His remaking of fairy-tale stereotypes is delightfully humorous, and some stories can move me to tears of laughter and joy, as well as instill a sense of overwhelming awe, no matter how many times I re-read them.If you like fantasy and understand that magic lives in all of us, this is a must-read!

However,judging from the title of the book, one would normally expect to see a similar amount of pages are dedicated to the medicinal applications of the medicines.

This biography provides a good overview of the various phases of his life, although it tends a little much (for me) toward psychological analysis. The first few chapters, which describe what probably was for St. Ex the best period in his life, are particularly well done.I had two minor problems with the book, which does not reduce its value as a good general biography. One was the tendency to treat St. Ex's work in terms of how close or far it strays from &quot;true&quot; fiction, as if fiction is the ultimate form, rather than assessing the work on its own terms. I also found the ending quite abrupt -- I would have expected a little more discussion about his legacy as an author and how his reputation has fared since his death. Otherwise, a beautifully written book and a good read.

There have been hundreds of commentaries written on Romans over the past few centuries, but Murray's has joined the small cluster at the top of the 'classics' list (with Charles Hodge and Martin Luther, and the less orthodox Barth). All future commentaries will continue to reference Murray, as the standout work of its kind for the mid-20th century.In addition to its usefulness for preachers and seminary students, it is also a nice window into the kind of teaching that was coming out of Westminster Seminary in a golden period of productivity when that school was THE leading Reformed school of the English speaking world."},{"Title":"The Epistle to the Romans;: The English text with introduction, exposition, and notes (The New international commentary on the New Testament)","review":"John Murray is an important figure in the Presbyterian and Reformed faith in the 20th century. His commentary on Romans is thorough and insightful, building on the heritage which he inherited from the great Reformed thinkers from Luther and Calvin to B. B. Warfield and Geerhardus Vos, the latter under whom he studied at Princeton. Murray shows particular sensitivity to the Old Testament background of Paul's epistle to the Romans and Paul's consciousness of his place in the history of salvation, a history which to Paul culminated in the person and death/resurrection of Jesus the Christ. Dr. Murray's admirable treatment of Paul's doctrine of the Spirit may only be surpassed by his successor at Westminster Theological Seminary, Dr. Richard B. Gaffin (and by his professor at Princeton, Dr. Geerhardus Vos). Murray's work is scholarly but not so that it would be inaccessible to the intermediate student. Murray does interact with his contemporaries; but could have taken it a litter further. The only criticism against Murray's Romans is his treatment of chps. 9-11 where he fails to break out of the dogmatic mould, and thus fails to capture the movement of the epistle from the anteclimax at the end of chp. 8 to the climax at the end of chp. 11. Overall, however, Murray's is a helpful and insightful commentary, a must for students and pastors."},{"Title":"The Epistle to the Romans;: The English text with introduction, exposition, and notes (The New international commentary on the New Testament)","review":"'God's righteousness revealed in the gospel is the provision of His grace to meet the exigency of His wrath. And nothing discloses its glory and efficacy more than this.' p xxivNo one is more able or probably likely to succeed John Murray in explaining God's own glory as the sole cause of redemption. The cross as symbol of God's power to reconcile fallen man to Him, is misunderstood to be a sign in that for Jews it constitutes an offense, and for Greeks, folly. And yet, given all the hostility that came by the fall, and with the subsequent glorification of man's wisdom and power as supreme, God simply calls. And calls effectively. The covenant of grace was divinely promoted as such revelation moved onto the world scene. It was as such most successful strategically that the apostle should write the Epistle to the believers in Rome - seeking to teach the nature of the grace of God and thereby fulfill his commission as apostle to the gentiles.'There is no discrimination arising from race or culture and there is no obstacle arising from the degradations of sin. Wherever there is faith, there the omnipotence of God is operative unto salvation. This is a law with no exception.' 1:28Romans 3:24 is the ground of our confidence: 'Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus'. God settles the relationship issue once and for all through justification and adoption, and in this way He places the new life on a sure foundation. Murray's syntactical construction connected v 24 to 22a: 'a righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ, unto all who believe', as clauses that are parenthetical in the pericope. He then stated the importance of the doctrine of justification in unequivocal terms: 'It is perhaps not irrelevant to observe that this is the first time in this epistle that Paul uses this verb directly and positively in reference to what is the leading theme of this epistle.' Again in support of free grace, Murray calculated its staggering implication: 'As we have found already, the fact of universal sinfulness bears directly upon the other fact that there is no discrimination among believers - they all are beneficiaries of the righteousness of God.' 1:115 The indiscriminate preaching of the gospel to all, regardless of creed, color or condition, strengthens our need to understand the free offer of grace by, firstly, putting forth the sufficiency of Christ to save us from our sins, and, secondly, by teaching that God is willing to save all those He efficaciously calls.As Murray explained elsewhere:'God's call, since it is effectual, carries with it the operative grace whereby the person called is enabled to answer the call and to embrace Jesus Christ as He is freely offered in the gospel.'Redemption: Accomplished & Appliedp 96To add weight to his already convincing exegetical argument, Murray honed in on the two catalytic terms Paul used: 'freely' [Gk: dorean] and 'by His grace' [Gk: autos charis]: 'Merit of any kind on the part of man, when brought into relation to justification, contradicts the first article of the Pauline doctrine and therefore his gospel.' The sovereign will of God's good pleasure invites us only to try harder to come to grips with Paul's true meaning: Paul said that it is God's goodness [Gk: chrestotes] that leads us to repentance (2:4). Because we are powerless to effect salvation's actualization in and of ourselves, we have no choice but to accept that God, having promised eternal life, is able to make good on His promise: 'No element in Paul's doctrine of justification is more central than this - God's justifying act is not constrained to any extent or degree by anything that we are or do which could be esteemed as predisposing God to this act.' 1:116"},{"Title":"The Epistle to the Romans;: The English text with introduction, exposition, and notes (The New international commentary on the New Testament)","review":"Murray provides a superb reformed understanding of the book of Romans.

This book is a must read and must have for any citizen concerned with freedom, liberty, and a truly just society."},{"Title":"Cliches of Politics","review":"This is a reprint of a similar book previously entitled \\"Clich&eacute;s of Socialism.\\" It is an irreverent collection of 83 right-wing shibboleths, against \\"socialist tinkering,\\" repackaged as contemporary nuggets of patriotic wisdom. Were it not so obviously politically skewed, this book could be a potentially valuable collectible. However since it is both dated and gores only one side of the \\"sacred cow,\\" it is much less valuable. Instead of just changing the title, the author should also have changed the content.Arguably, in today's reactionary American culture, which is slowly drifting in the direction of Fascism, and given that Communism is on its last legs, we sorely need a book that explores the clich&eacute;s from the other side of the sacred cow much more than from the side presented here.Still, if one can overlook this built-in bias, there is a great deal of knowledge and truth exposed in analyzing these clich&eacute;s.Three stars"},{"Title":"Cruising the Mexican Riviera & Baja: A Guide to the Ships & the Ports of Call (Cruising the Mexican Riviera & Baja)","review":"This is a very quick book to read about the ports you will be visiting. I read it on the airplane on the way to my cruise. It made my trip to the Mexican Riviera a pleasant experience with many helpful hints and colorful pictures included."},{"Title":"Cruising the Mexican Riviera & Baja: A Guide to the Ships & the Ports of Call (Cruising the Mexican Riviera & Baja)","review":"I read the appropriate chapter before each port of call. The author gives you hints on problems you may face as well as encouraging you to see the important sights. I felt that with his guidance we didn't miss anything, and enjoyed the vacation spots much more."},{"Title":"Cruising the Mexican Riviera & Baja: A Guide to the Ships & the Ports of Call (Cruising the Mexican Riviera & Baja)","review":"This book is a fine guide to cruising the Mexican Riviera and Baja California. It describes the main cruise ships, especially those on the Carnival, Celebrity, Holland-American, Norwegian, Princess, and Royal Caribbean lines. There's advice on climate, what to wear, both in port and on the ship, and the costs involved. And there are good descriptions of the ports. Anyway, I was on a one-week cruise and found the book very useful. The cruise prices were very reasonable (it was the off-season, but the weather was fine). Do not expect to get seasick: I rarely noticed that the ship was moving. Yes, I liked the food. And the Lido deck. And even the art auctions with the free champagne.As the book explains, cruises are often one week long, with stops in Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlan, and Cabo San Lucas. These leave from the Los Angeles area: mine started from Long Beach. It's fun being pampered and having all sorts of things to do on board.Puerto Vallarta, about 250 miles south of the tropic of Cancer, is not a very rich city. But there are some things to do there. One can swim with the dolphins! Or, if one is really adventurous, soar over the jungle on a guide rope! One can shop for tanzanite, silver, leather, pottery, and ceramics. Or visit a tequila factory. There is a very unimpressive church, completed in 1987, with a fiberglass crown on top. And there is Mismaloya, where one can see plenty of iguanas.In Puerto Vallarta, I liked the sculptures along the Malecon best. These include the \\"homeless whale,\\" the \\"dancing dolphin trio,\\" \\"Caballeo del Mar\\" (by Rafel Zamarripa), \\"Neptune and Nereida\\" (by C. Espino), \\"The Milleniums\\" (by Mathis Lidice), \\"Nostalgia\\" (by Ramiz Barquet), \\"Nature as Mother\\" (by Adrian Reynosa), the fantastic \\"Rotunda of the Sea\\" (by Alejandro Colunga), and my favorite, \\"In Search of Reason\\" (with the pillow-headed mother, two children, and ladder, by Sergio Bustamente).In Mazatlan (about 15 miles south of the topic of Cancer), one can see cliff divers, the flying pole dancers (an interesting display of acrobatics), bullfights (not my cup of tea at all), more sculptures, and a tall natural lighthouse (a great landmark for the city). There is also a rather nice church, the Basilica of the Immaculate Conception.Cabo San Lucas is about 50 miles south of the tropic of Cancer. This is a true beach resort. It has some great scenery, and most folks take a boat trip to El Arco. There are a couple of nice little beaches there. These include \\"Lovers beach,\\" which is a good swimming beach and \\"Divorce beach,\\" which is right next to it but is very dangerous to swim at. One can also visit the glass-blowing factory. And across the peninsula, in San Jose del Cabo, one can visit Cacti Mondo, a big cactus garden. In Cabo itself, I also recommend an Italian restaurant with a terrific view, the Mona Lisa.Do not miss the opportunity to see the Los Angeles area if you have time. Just to give you a tiny idea of what is there, let me mention two of the things that interest me: art museums and large pipe organs. Seven of the best art museums are the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA), the County Museum of Art, the J. Paul Getty Museum, the Norton Simon museum, the Huntington Library, the Pacific Asia Museum, and the Armand Hammer museum.What about pipe organs with over 100 ranks? There are at least seven of them: First Congregational Church, Los Angeles (5 manuals, 346 ranks), Crystal Cathedral, Garden Grove (the sanctuary is not of crystal and it has no cathedra, but the organ is 5 manuals and 270 ranks), Westwood United Methodist Church (4 manuals, 153 ranks), Lake Avenue Congregational Church, Pasadena (4 manuals, 126 ranks), Disney Center, Los Angeles (4 manuals, 109 ranks), Cathedral of Our Lady of Angels, Los Angeles (4 manuals, 105 ranks), and Royce Hall, UCLA (5 manuals, 104 ranks).If you are thinking of taking such a cruise, get this book!"},{"Title":"Cruising the Mexican Riviera & Baja: A Guide to the Ships & the Ports of Call (Cruising the Mexican Riviera & Baja)","review":"I just returned from a Mexican Riviera cruise. We followed the walking and taxi tours recommended by the author(actually tore out the pages for each port and took them with us) and had a wonderful time. We saw so many sights that our fellow cruisers missed. The author provides detailed information, along the lines of, \\"Exit the ship, turn left, walk two blocks... skip Museum A in favor of Museum B\\" etc. including advice regarding when to take a cab vs. walking to certain attractions. I found the directions to be very accurate for Mazatlan, Puerto Vallarta, Cabo, and Zihuatanejo, although the map for Acapulco was not sufficiently detailed, so I suggest you pick up a city map if you're planning on walking there. Unfortunately this book does not have any restaurant recommendations, but we ate at several of the \\"authentic\\" local restaurants mentioned in the book \\"Mexico's Beach Resorts for Dummies\\" and were very happy with our choices. Finally, the author provides some useful information about cruising in general, including a checklist of items to take, and since this was my first cruise, I found this to be very helpful."},{"Title":"Cruising the Mexican Riviera & Baja: A Guide to the Ships & the Ports of Call (Cruising the Mexican Riviera & Baja)","review":"This book was helpful to us in planning and taking our cruise to the Mexican Riviera along the Pacific Coast.

We are cruising the Mexican Riveria in February.Mr. Ludmer's comments about cruising, in general and preparing for a cruise are right on the mark.The reason we bought the book is for the information on the ports. It is all right there, in an easy to read, easy to find format.Of course we haven't been on the cruise yet. We always take a travel writer's opinions with a grain of salt, but we'd never criticise their observations. Everyone's likes are too subjective. Nonetheless, having the input of someone who's been there is very valuable. That's the way I feel about this book, a fun read, with information that, I'm sure, is well worth the price."},{"Title":"The Latin language (Great languages)","review":"The best part about this scholarly book is Palmer's development of the somewhat constricted literary language of Classical Latin out of the wider context of the dialects and varying usages of Latium and its environs. Readers should be aware that this is a historical survey of Latin, not a reference grammar or a book to learn the language from. Prior knowledge of the basics of Latin grammar is assumed.In tracing the history of the language, the book necessarily gives a history of Roman literary styles, from the age of Cato and Ennius to the Christian period. While this is not a comprehensive treatment of Latin literature, it is informative.The extensive etymological and comparative information in this book, on the other hand, is somewhat dated, since it was written in a period before the laryngeal theory had thoroughly penetrated Indo-European studies. Its treatment of Latin among the Italic dialects fares somewhat better."},{"Title":"The Latin language (Great languages)","review":"First of all let me declare my satisfaction with the book itself. It is a valuable addition to my Latin shelf, and I particularly appreciate the appendix of archaic Latin material. The detail throughout the book is scholarly and thorough. But two complaints sour my experience of this purchase:1. Amazon does not reveal that this is simply a reprint of the 1954 Faber & Faber publication. This is shown ONLY on the verso of the title page, which is not visible in the preview! Amazon gives only this for a publication date: \\"University of Oklahoma Press (April 1988)\\". Reprehensible.2. Throughout the book there are abbreviations for key sources. The epigraphs included in the appendix, for example, are all referenced as coming from CIL, but nowhere are we told what CIL, or any other abbreviation, refers to. Well, a search of the web shows that CIL is Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum:\\"The CIL (Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum) is the most important collection of Latin inscriptions, and is a very important tool for every student of Roman history. It was conceived by Theodor Mommsen (Nobel Prize for literature in 1902) in mid-19th century after dozens years of planning work and attempts. It was published thank the undertaking of the Berlin Academy (Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum consilio et auctoritate Academiae litterarum regiae Borussicae editum, Berolini 1863).\\"Well, we needed to be told that in this book! Why are we not? It MAY be the fault of the original author and publisher; but my best hypothesis so far is that the republishers simply omitted the usual list of abbreviations provided at the end of the front matter in the original Faber series (see for example the French and Russian volumes). If this is so, that is a serious disservice to readers, and represents an inexcusable decline in publishing standards since the 1950s.

This is the best book I have read. It has everything! It's like having eight different pregnancy books in one. It has a ton of practical details you won't find anywhere else and is very readable. The section on nutrition is incredible. There's a section with great diagrams for labor positions. The best drawings I've ever seen to explain effacement and the muscles of the perineum. You'll even get a couple pages of useful visualizations so you'll have some idea what hypnobirthing is about. Anything you're curious about, you'll get just the right amount of practical information in easily digestible format. If you get this book, you won't need any other books. However I do recommend \\"Pushed,\\" to understand risks of modern maternity care. Pregnancy Day by Day is pretty and fun, but the information isn't quite as useful. The (modern) Lamaze Guide, ande The Doula Book were good too, but this book contains a lot more diverse information. Ina May Gaskin's new book was OK, but I didn't learn anything new from it. Ina May's book is 1/2 birth stories (tons of mothers telling you how great midwives are at the Farm, which I already know and don't care to read), and the other half is full of stuff about modern maternity care which I already knew."},{"Title":"Pea in a Pod: Your Complete Guide to Pregnancy, Childbirth & Beyond","review":"I am a physician by training but felt like I needed a refresher course before having my first baby.

Readers should be aware, however, that Goldberg has definite opinions which may slightly color the way she presents material. For healthy women, she advocates the use of midwives and birthing centers over hospitals, natural birth over elective medical interventions, and she does not view circumcision very highly.

[no. 135])","review":"Kenilworth is set in 1575 during the reign of Elizabeth I. It is the story of Amy Robsart who has secretly married Robert Dudley Earl of Leicester. But Leicester is the Queen's favourite and fearful that he would lose his status if his marriage became public he keeps Amy secluded in Cumnor Hall. However, such secrets are hard to keep in an Elizabethan England full of plots and intrigues between factions vying for Elizabeth's favour and as Leicester entertains the Queen at Kenilworth castle the truth will out.As usual Scott tells a good story in Kenilworth. He takes as his point of departure the known incidents of history and weaves his plot around them. He is not always faithful to the historical record, but he captures the mood of the time. His characterisation of Elizabeth is particularly fine, showing her fair and just but swift to take offence and with a devastating temper. Scott builds great tension into his plot, because it is a story rooted in a period where one false step can bring instant downfall, where the highest can be brought to the block in an instant, if Elizabeth's capricious mood turns angry.Kenilworth is quite a difficult read. Scott's scholarship was such that he often uses the language of Elizabethan times and continually refers to historical events and literary texts which are now obscure. It is for this reason that it is important to read an edition of Scott which uses the best modern experts to clarify and explain the text. The Edinburgh Edition of the Waverley Novels, published by Edinburgh and Columbia University Press, is the definitive edition of Scott and is a stunning example of modern scholarship. The glossary is full and the notes are detailed and useful. The editor, J.H. Alexander, has gone back to Scott's original manuscript and first edition to provide a text of Kenilworth which is in a number of crucial respects different from that which has been commonly read since 1831. In the end the most important thing is that this edition makes Scott easier to read and easier to enjoy. Scott ought to be enjoyed. He was one of the most popular novelists of his day and with a little practice, reading him becomes a great pleasure. Kenilworth is quite a good place to begin an acquaintance with Scott's writing. Being set in England, it has no dialogue in the old Scots dialect, which can be difficult nowadays even for Scottish people to understand. Moreover it has a fine story with many interesting characters both virtuous and villainous. It may not be one of Scott's very greatest novels, but it is a good one and well worth reading even if at times it may be something of a struggle."},{"Title":"Kenilworth, (Everyman's library. Fiction. [no. 135])","review":"Don't read any of the following reviews unless you've already read Kenilworth. Scott deliberately withholds from the reader key facts (facts which all of the following reviews reveal) until well after the plot has started. Anyway, I've been on a Sir Walter Scott binge recently and, of the three Scott novels I've read -- Ivanhoe, Quentin Durward and this -- I'd place this book well above Ivanhoe but equal to Quentin Durward. It takes place in Elizabethan England; it has some sword fights; it's fairly funny in parts; the plot creaks only occasionally. Still, well worth reading."},{"Title":"Kenilworth, (Everyman's library. Fiction. [no. 135])","review":"As a ardent reader of medieval England stories, this is one book which I found as entertaining and romantic as any other book I have read. It has everything from castles and Knights in horses to damsels in distress. Scott is magnificent in the portrayal of Amy as well as Sir Walter Raleigh and Elizabeth is the crown of his characterisation. A book worth reading.."},{"Title":"Kenilworth, (Everyman's library. Fiction. [no. 135])","review":"Readers of Scott know not to read for plot, for even his most highly regarded novels meander and stray wilfully from the strict path of story-telling. Kenilworth, in addition to being a typically marvelous example of Scott's allusive narrative power, also happens to be the tightest and best contrived of his plots, one of the very few of his novels where all the ends are tied together convincingly. The novel has a gloriously conveyed Elizabethan atmosphere, which it is not timid about evoking at all levels and types: there is peasant comedy, taproom humor, stately politics, an aritocratic love story, villainous alchemists, and a sort of self-taught, lesser artisan hero whom its easy to root for (Wayland Smith).If you're familiar with the movie Elizabeth, you'll recognize some of the situations in this novel. But Scott isn't particularly historically accurate here, nor is he trying to be. His source is an Elizabethan ballad, and he tries to convey that world in all its Shakespearian complexity.Overall, one of the best, one of my favorite, of the Waverley novels, finally available in a dependable, well-edited edition. Bravo Scott, bravo Penguin Classics! More please!"},{"Title":"Kenilworth, (Everyman's library. Fiction. [no. 135])","review":"In Sir Walter Scott's 1821 novel KENILWORTH, very young Amy Robsart of the English country gentry had once been engaged to marry a serious young scholar of Cornwall, Edmund Tressilian. But the handsome, rich, powerful Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, comes between them. Tressilian and Amy's father, Sir Hugh, know that Amy has either eloped or been carried off by someone. But they suspect ungainly Richard Varney, not the handsome, vastly wealthy Earl of Leicester. Richard Varney, as it happens, is the hugely influential right hand man of Dudley. And one of Varney's jobs is to scout out pretty women for his Puritan master to seduce.To this end Varney systematically ingratiates himself with Sir Hugh Robsart and brings his master and Miss Robsart together in clandestine meetings. Amy loves Dudley as woman has never loved man before but will not, like his other conquests, willingly go to bed with him unless and until they are married. The Earl, for his part, is smitten by Amy and impulsively weds her, over Varney's objections that he is ruining his political career. But the great Earl remains ambitious and prudent enough to keep the wedding secret until he can find a time and a way to make it known without doing harm to his rising status with his old childhood friend and onetime fellow prisoner of the Tower of London, Elizabeth Tudor.Dudley has Varney fit up splendidly as Amy's closely guarded residence a ruined abbey which Varney has been given as spoils from Henry VIII's dissolution of the monasteries. It pertains to the village of Cumnor near Oxford. The Earl hides his new wife in Cumnor Hall, where, after a search at novel's beginning, Tressilian finds her but cannot persuade her to return to her father.From that point on, the plot becomes more and more complex and the secret marriage harder to keep secret or, once discovered, to explain. Varney assures the inquisitive Queen that Amy is his wife, not Leicester's and Leicester takes his good time telling the truth. Meanwhile Varney convinces the already great Earl to do his best to win Elizabeth's hand and become King of England. The pious Earl trusts the villainous Varney to find a way to make this happen that is both effective and compatible with the Earl's Puritan conscience.Without revealing precisely what happens to love-smitten Amy Robarts, who remains devoted to Leicester through betrayal upon betrayal, let me quote her keeper's comment to Varney in the final pages of KENILWORTH on how Amy's love of her unworthy husband has scalded her: \\"It is a seething of the kid in the mother's milk\\" (Ch. 41).There are twenty or more other rounded, energetic characters whom readers will enjoy seeing pass across the stage of KENILWORTH. They include Sir Walter Raleigh and his legendary muddied cloak. There is Will Shakespeare, whose rhymes the Queen can't get out of her mind. There are other memorable real and fictional minor characters of both sexes.Walter Scott is famous for his descriptions of costumes, armor, jewelry and clothing. When the Queen visits Dudley's castle at KENILWORTH, her ladies must moderate their dresses lest they eclipse the vain monarch. But Elizabeth likes her men young and well turned out and the Earl of Leicester outdoes them all in dazzling white: \\"his shoes being of white velvet ... his stockings of knit silk, lined with cloth of silver ... the scabbard of his sword of white velvet with golden buckles\\" and on and on (Ch. 31).This is a rich fable of a Lord who did his devious best to have his cake and eat it too. Its dramatic possibilities led into almost as many Walter Scott operas as did IVANHOE. KENILWORTH inspired Auber, Klein, de Lara, Donizetti, among others, to set the story to music.Finally: a friend of mine grew up in affluent Kenilworth Village, north of Chicago. She says that street names there are daily reminders of characters from Sir Walter Scot's novel of the same name. My friend cites Amy Robsart as the prime example. An American town created as a monument to Sir Walter Scott! And why not? Sir Walter Scott's great historical, almost gothic, novel of 1821, KENILWORTH, deserves celebrating and is more exciting and heart-stopping fiction than plodding, minutely accurate history. Thank you, Illinois!-OOO-"},{"Title":"Kenilworth, (Everyman's library. Fiction. [no. 135])","review":"As the book opens, Amy Robsart has left her family home and has secretly married Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. Amy's father, Sir Hugh and the man her father intended her to marry, Edmund Tressilian, have no knowledge of Amy's whereabouts and suspect foul play at the hands of Dudley's sneaky master of the horse, Richard Varney, and Tressilian goes in search of Amy at an old manor house, Cumnor Place. As Elizabeth I's attraction to Dudley grows, so does Dudley's ambitions to reach for the stars and a greater place at court than he ever dared for, and Amy becomes a bit of a liability -- especially to Varney who hopes to rise in power alongside his master--and thus the game is on.This is the first Walter Scott that I have read, with the exception of Ivanhoe and that was many years ago when I was a young child. I admit to almost giving up a couple of times, as the vernacular used by the characters was hard to follow at times, but it's worth slugging through the first 50 or so pages until the story starts cooking along as Scott takes the reader on a grand ride through the court of Elizabeth Tudor. Even Walter Raleigh makes a wonderful secondary character, his characterization of Elizabeth I was spot on, and I loved the way Scott worked Dudley's famous fete of Elizabeth at his castle at Kenilworth into Amy's story.Although Scott based this tale on an old English Ballad (which is printed in the back of the book) and not known history, it's still a jolly good yarn peopled with interesting characters, poison, astrology, treachery and all the well known intrigues of the Court of Elizabeth I. Those of you who are well versed in Tudor history already know the fate of Amy Robsart and I will have to warn those potential readers who are picky about historical accuracy that Scott definitely diddles with history in this tale. But for those readers who are willing to forget what's in the history books and ready to enjoy a jolly good yarn by a master storyteller about Elizabethan England, this is one book worth checking out, and I intend to read other books by this author. Five stars."},{"Title":"Kenilworth, (Everyman's library. Fiction. [no. 135])","review":"Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832) is Scotland's greatest novelist. The poet and lawyer turned to fiction after Lord Byron's poetic star ascended while his declined. Scott is the father of the historical novel. In his Waverly novels he revolutionized the novel and won glowing immortality in English literature.Kenilworth (1821) shows Scott moving south of the border to Great Britain. Tne book is set in 1575 during the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Historical figures such as Sir Walter Scott and Shakespeare (fleetingly) appear in the excitingly melodramatic tale of intrigue, murder and court politics at Elizabeth's court.The plot: Amy Robsart is secretly married to Dudley Lord Leicester. Leicester wishes the marriage to remain secret as he is courting Queen Elizabeth. Dudley dreams of becoming King of England. Amy is also loved by the Cornishman Tresillian who seeks to help her escape from Cumnor Place where she has been forced into seclusion by her husband. Scott is good at imprisonment images: Amy is often described as a bird in a cage.Leicester and his chief henchamn Richard Varney want it believed that Amy is wed to Varney. Elizabeth learns the truth. Amy is murdered by Varney and the thughs who are in his employ (this is a fictional account; historians are divided as to what led to Amy's early death). Richard Varney is the most interesting figure in the novel. He is an amoral overachiever whose Machiavellian plotting leads him to disaster. He is one of the most dastardly villains in all of English literature.The novel is divided into three parts:Part One-Set in Cumnor Place and a local inn. Part II-The Elizabethean court in London. Part III-The estate of Kenilworth, owned by Leicester, where he is holding a magnificent reception in honor of his guest Queen Elizabeth.Scott adds humor in his minor characters such as innkeeper Giles Gosling and Flbbertigibbet. Kenilworth is free of the Scotch dialect of most of his novels but is still a formidable read for 21st century eyes. The book is filled with excerpts of poetry and quotes from literary works. Scott is an acquired taste since his style is convoluted, formal and difficult to decipher.As a fan of Scott I love the new Penguin Revised edition of his works based on the Edinburgh Edition. The Penguin edition includes a glossary of words used by Scott and over 50 pages of footnotes explaining the many arcane references.Scott committed many literary crimes! Among them:a. Difficult sentence structure hard to understand on a first reading.b. Implausible plots based on coincidencec. Wooden characters who are one dimensional. They are puppets.4. Intrusive authorial comments on the plot development and characters.5. Creaking plot manipulation.6. Unrealistic dialogue. The characters talk as if they are on stage declaiming and revealing themselves to the audience. At times I thought I was watching a Shakespearean drama.7. Too many words! The books needed better editing.With all these failing Scott excells in the primary fictional requirement of an author. The author of Waverly knew how to tell a story! His tales will long be remembered by readers who soldier through the prose to reach their final page. Great Scott! What a genius was this father of the historical romance novel!"},{"Title":"Kenilworth, (Everyman's library. Fiction. [no. 135])","review":"Sir Walter Scott (1771 - 1832): Kenilworth. A Romance. Edited and with an Introduction by J. H. Alexander. London and New York: Penguin Books, 1999. xlvi and 467 pages.Scott started his literary life as a poet and only later turned to novel-writing. Perhaps that is why his plots are not always as brilliantly conceived as his descriptions of the life and times about which he writes. \\"Kenilworth\\" was his second novel, after \\"Ivanhoe\\", in which England and not Scotland stood in the centre of attention. Unlike \\"Ivanhoe\\", however, \\"Kenilworth\\" is set in the Renaissance, during the long reign of Elizabeth I (the year 1575 is mentioned at one point). And I suspect that it is Scott's description of Elizabeth and her court which remains in most Englishmen's common memory of this period until today. The story Scott tells is based, as is usual with him, on historical reality, which he has, using his incredibly full antiquarian knowledge of the period, described and expanded to cover a large canvas with some of the most colourful scenes and characters to be found in any historical novel. Next to the wonderfully evocative descriptions of Elizabethan pageantry I would name the profoundly skilful dialogues between the Earl of Leicester and Elizabeth or between the Earl and Varney, his master of horse, as the high points of the novel. These are reported in such detail that, inevitably, the story-line or plot only develops comparatively slowly, although this, of course, builds up enormous tension towards the end of the book until the whole is tragically resolved. The detailed descriptions and reports of conversations also create character, and Scott has here very ably created some of literature's most fascinating characters. Other reviewers have pointed to Elizabeth herself, here most wittily characterized, but personally I found equal pleasure in the power-hungry, wavering Earl of Leicester, in the cringing, miserly Forster, in the hypocritical astrologer Alasco, in his former assistant Wayland and in the grimassing, inquisitive boy known generally as \\"Flibbertigibbet\\". The villain Varney is painted in very black colours, almost too black to be true; the tragic heroine, Amy Robsart, has, interestingly enough, been compared with Lucy in \\"The Bride of Lammermoor\\", but for my taste Amy seems a little too passive and submissive. If there is a \\"hero\\" to the story, I suppose it is Tressilian, who is, however, lost sight of during considerable chunks of the story.Reading Scott is always something of a daunting task because of his immense vocabulary and his constant use of antique or antiquarian terms. The Penguin Edition of \\"Kenilworth\\" makes this task somewhat easier by providing copious notes and an extended glossary, although these practically entail one in reading with two fingers in different places at the back of the book and constantly turning the pages back and forth. Scott's unbounded delight in quotes from the Bible, from Chaucer, from Shakespeare, from Webster and from Ben Johnson as well as from more obscure literary and historical works is perfectly documented in the notes. The \\"introduction\\" should only be read after studying the novel, not before, and should really have been printed at the end, not before the text. There are various other aids to understanding here, too, including a comparison of the novel with the known historical facts, and some 16th century maps and charts of Kenilworth Castle where the majority of the \\"action\\" in the second half of the book takes place.\\"Kenilworth\\" is definitely one of Scott's major novels, although I would recommend that novices start with his more popular tales of Scotland: \\"Guy Mannering\\"Guy Mannering (Penguin Classics), \\"Old Mortality\\"Old Mortality (Oxford World's Classics), \\"The Heart of Midlothian\\"The Heart of Midlothian (Oxford World's Classics), \\"Rob Roy\\"Rob Roy (Oxford World's Classics)or \\"The Bride of Lammermoor\\"The Bride of Lammermoor (Oxford World's Classics), all of which were published some years prior to \\"Kenilworth\\"."},{"Title":"Kenilworth, (Everyman's library.

Although the actual writing of the book is excellent, conveying wonderfully the flavor and character of the times as well as the vanity of the monarchs and suitors, the plot ends abruptly with a tragic ending. Aside from altogether disliking tragedies, I found this ending a surprising disappointment because the book gave very little indication of the horrific climax which was to come.

Although Grace and her older sister are allowed to stay together at several homes, they are too young and vulnerable to shield each other from the horrors that are to come.As disturbing as some of the incidents of sexual abuse are, these incidents need to be written about. It will help you understand the horrors of childhood abuses and the emotional scars that last a lifetime when children are not cherished, protected or allowed a voice in society.Although this book is recommended for a mature reader only, the abuse is relevant to understand the strength Grace's character shows to survive. Yet, through therapy when older, she finally finds the path towards forgiving herself while she develops an understanding that she did not cause the abuse, nor were her resulting life choices unreasonable. Actually, she learns they were adaptive and necessary at times for her own survival.Garland Roper beautifully creates depth and passion for Grace's character, as you are continually pulled back to the book to be inspired by her ability to adapt and survive. Any survivor of abuse can relate to the story and to Grace.From Hidden Grace, the reader will benefit from learning self-forgiveness, strategies to survive and thrive, as well as to be truly inspired for your own life. If this character Grace (a believable true-to-life character, made complete with flaws and rough edges) can find peace, happiness and forgiveness, then anyone can!Armchair Interviews says: Hidden Grace is a fascinating, inspirational and uplifting page-whipping story that is genuinely a must read for any survivor of abuse or anyone wishing to understand and relate to survivors...and doesn't that just about cover us all!"},{"Title":"Hidden Grace","review":"Twenty years of Dr. Garland Roper's experience as a psychotherapist have consummated in the from of a deeply disturbing, insightful, and healing book \`Hidden Grace' (Cliffside Press at OMNI, Maine, 2005). A literary novel, a psychological study of psychosexual torture and depression, a case against inhuman foster neglect, and a life-giving look at one woman's courage in the face of brutal abuse, the merit of \`Hidden Grace' is hard to encapsulate in a single instance.We meet old Grace Albright who revisits her middle-aged therapist Dr. Carl Wilder, a struggling modern-day Sisyphus wrestling with his \`rock' of confidence as a therapist, to help her write a book about their therapy. Dr. Wilder narrates memories of Grace's writings telling, in her words, the story of her early life in foster houses. As Grace opens the chapters of extreme sadistic torture at the hands of her foster families, Dr. Wilder's depressive view of his own life transforms positively. Together the therapist and the patient rise from their tombs and become living persons in their own flesh, no more given into the torture of slavery.\`Hidden Grace' may well be seen as a detective story in literary style. Grace's unwillingness to speak of her torture kindles the curiosity from the prologue and keeps the flame aglow till the very end of the book. The development of her character, her self-concept as a sinner against herself, challenges notions of established moral concepts. The distinction between sinner and victim of sin is diffused until Grace makes Dr. Wilder (and the reader) see the light.The language of Gar Roper's narrative is anything but professional. More important is the narrative device, a combination of first person in Grace and Dr. Wilder's voices, and Grace's writings. Events are seen at once through the eyes of both the doctor and her patient. This chimes in with the theme of the novel, a story of participant roles integral to the therapy in question. The discovery and revival of the innocent and loving Grace is accomplished through the written word. That of Dr. Wilder follows and, who knows, of how many eyes and minds.The impact of Grace's indelible character is reinforced by the title page. The young girl on the left has face and eyes looking through you. Her beauty is indescribable and her terrors poignant, her sufferings violent enough to tear one apart. And yet Dr. Roper makes such a loving picture of her ripe age that Grace Albright becomes a symbol of convalescence.The epilogue and author's note reveal a few facts about the book, concluding with some inspiring words, which might sound rather tame in the face of the novel's powerful hang over.Hidden Grace is for us, lovers of beauty, courage, and truth."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"This was a interesting book written by Thomas French. Karen Gregory was finally moving in with her boyfriend. Although, he was out of town she still chose to move in alone. This proved to be a fatal mistake. Her killer for reasons unexplained (but how well can murder be explained anyway?) watched her as she moved in. He knew she was alone, and made his move. Her blood curtling scream filled the air, yet no one called police. In a neighborhood that boasted community watch, Karen was ignored. A sad tale, that challenged my very sense of safety. I also was left asking myself how well do I really know my circle of friends? French did a good job with this book. I found his descriptions and depictions to be startlingly detailed, and not emotionally driven or one sided. Not like some true crime books that take a side, and present it only. Need a good book to curl up with in the dark, alone? This is it."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"Kinda makes you wonder if you know your friends as well as you'd like to think.

It is the story of Karen Gregory, a young Gulfport, FL woman murdered in her home in 1984. UC is most noteworthy because author French maintains suspense well into the text, much further than most murder tales. When the purp is finally collared, many readers will be surprised. Furthermore, the trial portion of UC is definitely more topsy- turvy than is normal. An aggressive, bullying defense team, at least one callow judge, and a seemingly plodding prosecution extend the mystery. Even the initial trial verdict fails to close the case right away. Throw into the mix questions of admissibility, endless trial motions and \\"jury quirks\\". We certainly can see the imperfections of the justice system. The OJs of the world can walk away. The result is some very satisfying reading for the true crime aficionado. A complete review must cite the fact that Karen did indeed scream at least once for help that fateful night, but her neighbors failed to respond. What happens? A good review doesn't divulge resolutions. Amazoners will just have to read for themselves but are certain to enjoy themselves doing so. There is also interesting local color provided, not all of it complimentary to the Gulfport/St Petersburg region. As my friend, Tundra has mentioned, UC provides no photo of the victim, a unique omission for the true crime field. The \\"Ann Rule rule\\" is waived for AC. Those pesky centerfold pictures don't reveal the ending but the back cover includes a huge clue as to the perp. Forewarned is forearmed. The nicest a reviewer can state about UC is to cite the printing history: 12 paperback printings since 1992.

I found the courtroom drama to be riveting reading especially the roles of the jurists. For those who haven't served on a jury, I haven't, I found it to be very educational. The problem of staying awake during numbing questions by both the prosecution and the defense and what goes on behind the doors as jurists wrestle with coming to a unanimous verdict. Once the verdict is achieved there is the tendency to second guess yourself and wonder if you made the correct choice.A unique twist to this story is the fact that one of the officers trying to solve the problem is a friend of the one who is the murderer.

Most of them did nothing. One of them had already done too much.I just read the &#8220;St. Martin&#8217;s True Crime Classics&#8221; (2001) version of this book. It *is* a classic and the designation of &#8220;Classic&#8221; and the reprint is well justified. The writing style is quite good, it flows along within the conventions of the genre without getting in the way of the tale. Here&#8217;s a sample, which preceeds Part One in the &#8220;Classic&#8221; edition (Maybe not in the previous ed., as it is not included in the sample pages here on Amazon&#8217;s Item Page at the time I write this review):&#8220;She lay alone in the hall for a night and a day and another night. Finally someone saw her, and the police arrived and raised a circle of official yellow around the yard, and the neighbors stepped forward with their excuses, then retreated behind the walls of their front doors. The forensic experts came, and the forensic experts left, and at last the case was left in the hands of one who would not let go. During the day he would sit at his desk, examining and reexamining the photos of her on the floor, and ask her to help him see whatever he had missed. At night he would return to the house, wandering inside, hoping the empty rooms might reveal whatever they remembered. The weeks stretched into months. He eliminated one suspect after the other and ran down one blind alley after the other, and still he was no closer to understanding, until that day he stumbled across a single moment of stupid good luck. Then came the lie detector tests at the station, and the reenactments in the dark, and the anonymous phone calls that could not be traced, and the rounds of weary accusations and denials.After all of that, he arrested a man and put him on trial for this life.An investigator asked on of the neighbors:&#8220;Does he look like a murdered to you?&#8221;The neighbor said:&#8220;What does a murdered look like?&#8221;The book includes photographs to answer that question.

The story itself is intriguing, particularly the way the main suspect was finally narrowed down. Waiting to find out the verdict was equally as intruiging, as was the trial itself. I read it in over about two nights.Everyone is of course entitled to their own opinion, but I have to say that one of the 1 star reviewers made a claim that is very misleading - and almost resulted in me not buying the book. The reviewer states that the trial and sentencing takes up 50% of the book and \\"there was simply nothing unique or outstanding about the trial that made it worthy of taking up a full 50% of the book. Everything relevant to the crime and victim is known by the time the arrest is made and the trial starts. The rest is filler\\". That isn't entirely true. It is true that 'legal matters' take up about 50% of the book, but that wasn't just the trial itself (which takes closer to about 30% of the book), but pre-trial motions, legal manoeuvrings etc. And there are many other things going on during the time those initial legal matters were covered, including additional investigations by police, interactions between various people relevant to the case, some discussion of their lives and how the case affected them etc. - it's certainly not as though 50% of the book is set in the courtroom.Additionally, to my mind the trial was, if not unique, certainly outstanding in some respects. I don't want to give much away but some things that occur during the trial are quite shocking and evoke some quite powerful emotions: compassion, outrage, disbelief.. I have read many true crime books (mostly American) and yet I learned things about the US justice system that I didn't know, thanks to the coverage of the trial/sentencing in this book. The author also includes some information about the jurors, how they voted and their views on the case which were very interesting. I think the author was trying to extend beyond this case to make a comment, or at least raise awareness, about the ways lawyers can manipulate the system. All interesting, relevant, and certainly not filler!I would encourage anyone interested in true crime and the legal system to give this book a chance."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"This book was very well written and so very captivating.

Good read if you like true crime"},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"Typically, I find the true crime books to be poorly written and don't always finish them. Mr. French is particularly good at including details and weaving the story together in a way that keeps the reader interested. Much like the victim's (Karen Gregory) family and the jurors, I found the story gave me nightmares due to the hideous brutality. Instead of tossing the book aside, I soldiered on, because this is real life. Sometimes horrible things happen to good people. I felt for Karen's family enough to keep reading about their torturous struggle for justice. French allows the reader to view this crime from many different angles and shows great compassion for the murderer's family as well."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"A great book that kept me interested....I could not put it down! The Kindle edition has a lot of grammatical errors but I could look past those. I recommend this book if you like true-crime."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"It's not the typical true crime read. i believe this represents a more realistic view. &#8220;there were definitely a lot of ups/downs the victim&#8216;s family had to deal with... and it won&#8216;t end"},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"Very engaging, well written and researched book. There are quite a few editorial errors, i.e. word ommissions but one knows what they are."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"The young man, his manner so well described by French, asked me if his girlfriend, Karen Gregory, who he introduced to me, could sit in on my class so that she would know more about him and his major, criminal justice. I still have a vivid visual memory of them and where they sat-- &quot;in the back&quot; so they would not be intrusive, he said. Much later, her brutal rape and murder shocked me when I read about it in the first series in the St. Petersburg Times. It took place near where I had lived, too. And then, later, French did a 7 part series, which this book is based on, that captured not only the crime, but the slow and improbable way the case wound through the criminal justice system, so filled with human error and with human caring. Her artist friend's portrait of her in the first installment of that series was extraordinary. There are pictures in the book, but not of her. Since its publication, whenever I have taught the introductory criminal justice course at the University of South Florida and elsewhere, I have required my students to read the book and to write a critique of the system based on it. What do they think should have been done differently? What was done right? The students get caught up in the book, much as have the other reviewers on this page. And I recommend this book, as I know they would. But it is special to me, it haunts me as does my memory of Karen and her boyfriend, a decent guy who now has a Ph.D. in social work. French has now won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of another St. Petersburg murder tragedy; and his latest book might help you understand something of how the school boy murders at Colombine happened, though it is not about them. But read Unanswered Cries, it is real and it is revealing."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"I found this book doing a search for Kitty Genovese, a young woman murdered over several hours as many heard and watched--and did nothing. (...) He lived across the street with his girlfriend. The murderer,(...) used his \\"kindness\\" and \\"helpfulness\\" to ingratiate himself with the neighbors, and to explain why, at times, he appeared in places he had no business to be. His best friends were the local law enforcement. \\"Georgie couldn't do a thing like that,\\" his family and friends insisted, though it appeared, after all, that none of them knew him very well.I refer college students to this book as a resource for discussions about ethics, crime, and sexual assault. The book provides an excellent description of the criminal justice system. The defense used the flashy attack-the-victim and diminish-the-victim techniques we came to know so well in the OJ Simpson case. Ms. Gregory's sister, Kim, was barred by the defense from entering the courtroom because she might emotionally sway the jury if she wept--under the pretext, of course, that she \\"might\\" be called as a witness. Yet the murderer was let out on bail and allowed to parade his toddler daughter and by-then wife in front of the jurors. During sentencing, dozens were allowed to talk about what a great guy the murderer was. No one was allowed to talk about the murdered woman (I believe this is not the case in Washington State, where I live; family members are allowed to state the effects of the crime on their lives).Unlike many crime books, this is extremely well-written. The language is straight-forward and simple, and therefore manages to convey a pathos that penetrates deeply. This title should be listed under \\"ethics\\" and \\"US courtroom practices\\" rather than simply \\"true crime.\\" If you had heard Karen Gregory scream, would you have called the police?"},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"One of the nicest things about this book is its understatement: it's very level-headed &amp; unexcitable ... one of those books that grows on you after you're done with it. French chose a crime that, on the face of it, might not leap out as fodder for a newspaper series, let alone the book it later became. It was grisly &amp; no doubt devastating for everyone whose lives it directly touched (what murder isn't?) but it hardly seems sensational ... &amp; that's French's achievement in &quot;Unanswered Cries.&quot; He makes you care about the victim, the crime, the do-nothing neighbors &amp;--yes--even about the murderer. French does a particularly good job of illuminating the victim &amp; her friends &amp; family without overdoing it. Murderers' actions have consequences far beyond the death of their victim ... &amp; French documents that very well."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"Mr. French tells the story of Karen Gregory's murder by using a writing style that is able to pace a true story similar to a work of fiction. He is able to keep the reader interested while providing the necessary details demanded of a true story without losing the attention of the reader.This is very difficult to do with true stories, which is the reason that readers complain about the writing abilities of less talented writers than Mr. French.I would highly recommend this book to anyone because it is an intriguing story with little &quot;smoking gun&quot; evidence and no eye witnesses. The story also has the unusual twist of the killer being a friend of the main investigator of the crime.I can offer an update on the convicted killer of Karen Gregory. Three year ago, he was instrumental in developing a mobile crime lab vehicle that could perform various tests at the crime scene. He was applauded by the police officials that worked on the project for his tireless devotion to perfecting the crime lab and it seemed that he was somewhat content with his station in life."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"I was pleasantly surprised to see Mr. Harper's review of this book - I took Criminal Justice at Troy State under Mr. Harper and the reading of this book was probably the highlight of his class. I picked up another copy about a year ago at a bookstore and it brought back some fond memories of school. Excellent book to read and it makes you think about the horrific crimes that could be committed just right next door without your knowledge or someone just ignoring that cry for help. I think a picture of the victim in this book would have cheapened the effect - the picture in your mind is set from the very beginning of the scene, the people in the story, and it would not be as a great read if everyone was pictured in the book."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"I have read many true crime books to even mention. This book by far has left me in complete shock and silence.This poor victim was left to suffer a horrifying death at the hands of a vicious monster. All while her many neighbors turned a deaf ear to her agonizing screams for help!This story has shown me just how cowardly and apathetic people have become!!Given the fact that they had a \\"neighbor watch program\\" in this area , it shows how words can mean so little to so many people. I rate this book highly and recommend it to all women who live alone not to incite fear ,but so that they may learn how to be aware of wolves in sheep\\"s clothing and better prepared to defend themselves. Our neighbors who we may think we know are not always what they appear to be!! A truly sad and disturbing book."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"I read this book because a neighbor recommended it to me and Karen Gregory was murdered two blocks from my house. Although I did not move to Gulfport until 2005, this quaint little town will forever be in my heart.While reading this book, I was saddened, sickened, surprised, and ultimately relieved in the end. As the title suggests Karen Gregory's cries were unanswered on the horrible night of her murder. Many neighbors heard the scream but no one called for help. Living in this caring little neighborhood, I was shocked.Thank you Mr. French for your dedication to this book, I hope that it has knocked a little sense into this little community.I recommend this book to anyone that wants a real, but certainly frightening, account of \\"A True Story of Friends, Neighbors, and Murder in a Small Town.\\""},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"This is the kind of book that will stay with you for a long time. The chilling account of neighbors blocks away, who heard her screams will send chills up and down your spine. It will also teach you to be wary of everyone! You will look at people (even your neighbors) with a different eye. I am not saying you will become a paranoid zombie but you will look at things differently. A well written book that will scare and enlighten you at the same time."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"Based on a true story about the 1984 rape and murder of Karen Gregory. The warm Florida evening, when she is murdered, people around the neighborhood hear a scream that came from Karen. Detectives are sifting throught the evidence that is surrounded by questions: What did the strangely worded note from a friend mean? Why was the house so orderly, when it had been the scene of a frenzied struggle? Why were the bloody footprints on the carpet barefoot? Det. Larry Tosi soon searches for Karen's killer, but the maniac he was hunting for was....someone he called a friend."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"This book grabs you from the beginning and won't let go! The story is one of horrific nature and of the great sorrow that Karen Gregory's family and friends suffered. George Lewis proves that he is a deceitful liar. He changed his story each and every time he learns that the police have evidence to prove him wrong. This proves to be his biggest downfall."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"I read way more True Crime books than I care to admit. This is one of the best I have read, not due so much to the topic, but rather the writer who kept me interested from page one. I figured out who the murdered was very early in the book, but that did not keep me from being captivated all the way through. This story is full of actual facts, and told in such a way that I could not put it down. Very interesting read and I would surely buy any other true crime books by this writer. You will not be dissapointed."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"This was an excellent book, I couldn't put down. I felt every painful feeling and injustice the victims family felt.

I felt part of the investigation, the family, the scene and the killer. Rivetting reading. Cannot waity to pick up another of his true crime books."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"This is an interesting read of a true story. It is a study in human behavior, not only the killer's but, all those who were touched by the murder of a young woman in her own home. The book itself is a little &#34;wordy&#34;. Author could have achieved the same result in a few thousand fewer words."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"This book was so good on so many levels--the story of the crime itself, the inaction of the victim's neighbors and what that says about us all (can I honestly say I would have acted differently????), the investigation and the reluctance of the investigators to go where the evidence was leading them, the lack of support by the court system for the victim's family. This is all packaged in a very well written book. I enjoyed this so much I immediately started looking for other true crime books by the same author. Alas, there were none."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"This is one of the most well written true crime stories I have ever read!

Not sure if I can but it is on my to do list."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"I was a little disappointed in this story. Does not really seem the punishment fit the crime.The victim suffered a good deal more than the neighbor who did it."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"I loved this book, I couldn't wite to find out who the killer was. When I did find out I was shocked! Not only was he the neighbor, but he was a fire fighter, someone you'de would think to be a trust worthy person. Wrong again! Even with all the mistakes made, like George getting out on bail, he was dumb enough not to run and they still got their man. I hope he will always be in jail, because I think he will do it again. It must have been really had for detective Tosi to descover that the murder who he has been surching for so long was always right there under his nose, a friend of his."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"I read this book several years ago. Although it was well written, I would only recommend this book if there aren't any other true crime books to read. By the time I finished the book I knew more about the murderer than I did the victim."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"The story was good, and a good job was done making me relate to the characters, but some of the sentence structure was off. By that, I'm referring to the authors tendency to flip words around to sound &#34;off&#34; to me, like &#34;she already was...&#34; rather than &#34;she was already&#34; & &#34;they already were&#34; rather than &#34;they were already.&#34; Not breaking any rules, but sounding almost if I were listening to an unpolished person of low intelligence.Also, lots of missing words like &#34;when became a firefighter;&#34; and double words like &#34;the the.&#34;Not a favorite for me, but the story makes you wonder if you REALLY know someone."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"I tried reading this book a few years ago because I grew up in the town where it took place (mere blocks away.) I had always heard of the famous Gulfport Murder, but didn't really know a whole lot about it. I now live in Orlando. I got about a half an hour into the book--cringing of the poor writing all the way--and finally couldn't take it any more. The prose is extremely over-wrought and flowry; a true example of a journalist turning to fiction at its worse (no Dickens, Hiassen, or Wolfe here). The man aparently has no knowledge of the craft of writing whatsoever. Yes, I know what you are thinking--&quot;But this is not fiction&quot;--but it still resides under the same rules because it is presented in a chronological and fictionalized account even if the events are true.Anyway, if you have a much stronger stomach than I do for terrible writing, you might find the story worth reading; though I must admit, even what I was able to pick up from the story was pretty typical in its type.I would NOT advise this book."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"Very sad story impacting many friends and family members. Youg women cut down too early in her life.Story is well told, couldn't put the book down"},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"So many neighbors heard her last scream. No one could save her. Good Author; background given for all main characters. Just enough detail without bogging down. Good read, but sad."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"Thomas French writes a riveting and comprehensive account of the true murder case of Karen Gregory. The reader gets an accurate feel for the personality and life history of the victim and the killer. One also sees the far reaching effect on families, friends and neighbors who are affected by the murder. The trial rendering gave just enough information to maintain interest without becoming tedious. George Lewis comes across as a pathological liar. The disquieting elements for me were the waffling of the final judge after the verdict was reached, and the lawyer antics of the defense team."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"I could not put this book down. It was so well written, revealing new evidence & plot twists at each chapter. The subject was very tragic and the author treated the victim and her family with great sensitivity and compassion. The search for justice was very compelling. Usually the courtroom drama can become tedious but this was the opposite."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"Thomas French in his book UNANSWERED CRIES tells the story of Karen Gregory, a young woman who had just moved into her boyfriend's home when she brutually murdered by her neighor George Lewis: an all American boy next door with good looks and a career as a firefighter.The main viewpoint stressed in UNANSWERED CRIES, and hence the title, is that many of Gregory's neighbors reported hearing a blood-curdling scream but did nothing that may have assisted Gregory. Most of her neighbors would live with the regret of having minded their own business as a young woman lay dying at the hands someone they all knew and trusted.The one disappointing aspect of this book is that, despite the many references to victims' rights, there was no photograph included of Gregory; leaving readers to have to conjure their own image from the detailed writing.This is an excellent piece of true crime writing. UNANSWERED CRIES is attention catching and thought provoking. As I finished, I found myself asking: \\"The next time I hear a scream resound through my neighborhood, what will I do?\\""},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"This is the rare true crime book that actually improves with a second reading; things that seem innocuous or commonplace the first time through will reveal their true nature and secrets on a reread. Thankfully, this book avoids the \\"victim beatification\\" too often found in other true crime books; here, the deceased is shown as she was, with both virtues and flaws. My only real complaints are that the end of the book feels a bit rushed, and that the author starts treating the suspect as guilty before the sentence is passed; it's well-established tradition in these books for the author to at least feign neutrality until the jury returns a verdict, at which time he or she is then free to let loose."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"I found this book repeated a lot of its material. Somehow I felt it could have gotton to the point faster."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"A tragic and heart-wrenching story. The fact that the police work was amateur and shoddy makes it all the worse. Fans of true crime will not be disappointed. That said, i found it to be was poorly edited and boringly written."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"Until now, I had never read a true crime that gave so much story about the jurors and the courst proceedings. It was interesting, but did drag a little in some parts."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"I have always been fascinated by the capacity in humans for evil and indifference, both of which are demonstrated in abundance in this story. While I thought this was a well-written story with a nice depth of detail, I couldn't give it five stars for a couple of reasons. One reason was the inexplicable threads left hanging. The Hawaiian shirt--we hear about it, and then it just drops away from the story. The suspect, arrested and charged--but nothing about searching his garage or his home. It just seemed like there were a number of gaping holes.Secondly, an odd proclivity for dropped words, and a couple of times what felt like entire paragraphs missing. I don't know if those issues were a result of sloppy editing, or possibly an anomaly of e-pubbing on Amazon. I see that sort of thing so often in e-books that I have to wonder if it is a download issue. I tend to blame poor writing and editing when I see egregious grammatical errors and tortured sentences, but the writing style in this book is clean, with the exception of those many missing words, so I am going to give the author the benefit of the doubt, and blame it on some sort of odd technical snafus."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"I read this in 24 hours. Couldn't put it down. The author's story was well-written, comprehensive, and well-organized. He also demonstrated how the criminal justice system seems designed to protect the rights of the criminal to the exclusion of all others, something I can't understand. My heart goes out to Karen Gregory's family and friends and to all the loved ones of countless other victims. I'm looking forward to reading other books by this author."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"Gripping, well written, keeps your attention.

The writer pulls you in from the first chapter and doesn't let you go. I'm and avid reader and have just recently started reading true crime novels. This is one of the best written ones I've encountered. It is quite difficult to put down and walk away - you just have to know what happens next.Surprisingly, after reading it, I had difficulty sleeping! I've never encountered such a problem before and it is for that reason that I entitled this review \\"Oddly disturbing.\\" But, don't get me wrong, the book is not a \\"Helter Skelter\\" type story. It is a tragic story, but not overly descriptive in any way. I think what made it disturbing was the people in the neighborhood, the police, and the killer. They all seemed like such ordinary people. Another disturbing fact is that the killer \\"seemed\\" to have no prior history. It all seemed so random.You will enjoy it - the writer did an excellent job, and you will feel deep sympathy for the victim's family."},{"Title":"Unanswered Cries","review":"Another well written book.

Ellis Hanson's well edited collection has found its way onto numerous college reading lists and will doubtless stay on them for years to come as this is indeed a seminal volume in the history (brief as it is) of queer theory and film. Academic yet readable and engaging, these essays leave behind discussion of queer films in terms of whether or not they contain \\"good\\" or \\"positive\\" representations of gay men and lesbians, and rather celebrate what is illusive, problematic, complex, and interesting about the queer themes and characters that have appeared in film since its earliest days.Hanson's own essay tackles lesbian vampire films, a genre which most critics and film theorists have seldom taken seriously. By the time he's done with it, however, you can't imagine how lesbian vampires could have been igorned for so long. The book, like Hanson's essay, invites us into new and unfamiliar territory and rewards us with fascinating perspectives and analytic energy that can only come when scholars are turned loose on fresh subject matter.Although talking about anything \\"queer\\" is apt to offend certain constituencies, these essays cannot be lightly dismissed. The book is challenging, provocative, and absolutely essential reading for anyone who is interested in queer theory, film, or both."},{"Title":"In His steps; \\"What would Jesus do?\\" (The pocket classic)","review":"This book really convicts you to think &#34;What would Jesus do?&#34; in every situation in your everyday life.

Each question can be used as a springboard to discussion and education. Some answers are sure to bring surprises to the adult asking the question. Others are just good questions to help children expand their thinking.For example, one question is \\"What do you need to make pizza?\\". This leaves you with the option of including pizza dough or flour, water, and other ingredients of the dough. On the other hand when it comes to toppings what could be added? You could get really creative with this in determining what is appropriate or not. What about ice cream for a topping? Not appropriate? Maybe it would be if the \\"pizza dough\\" were phyllo, the \\"tomato sauce\\" were ice cream and the toppings were strawberries with chocolate drizzled across it. Open a child's mind to the possibilities of the world is one of the best gifts you can give them, this book helps you get started with many, many questions that can be used to help them think creatively.If you would like a collection of questions to ask your young child that will help them learn manners (\\"What do you do if someone has bad breath?\\"), basic science (\\"Do fish have feathers?\\"), or expand their creativity (\\"What do you like to pretend to be?\\") this is a great collection to get you started.

Forget the book reviews -- they can wait until lunchtime. I *have* to read Will Manley first. He's the Dave Barry of librarianship, the Andy Rooney of bibliophiles, the Jerry Seinfeld of bookworms. His comments are always on the mark and usually make me smile and nod my head in agreement. Here, his observations about goofy patrons with bizarre questions and typical reference desk scenarios are accompanied by Richard Lee's funky illustrations. The result is the kind of honest silliness that should first be thoroughly enjoyed by oneself and then immediately shared with colleagues. Though this book is clearly one of specialized humor, anyone who works in a public service occupation will recognize some of the customer categories -- \\"Dorkus Completis,\\" \\"Studentus Moronis,\\" \\"Parentus Irresponsibilis,\\" and the rest. If a layperson stumbles across these pages, let the outcome be that he/she learned that (a) librarians are people too and (b) that they have a good sense of humor. It might be a strange and twisted kind, but it is humor nevertheless. Thank you, Will, for encouraging us to laugh at ourselves."},{"Title":"Truth about Reference Librarians","review":"Just read this one, checked out from my local library. I'm not a librarian but my mom is, and I'm about to start working on my MLS. We both had a good laugh w/ this book.The section on &quot;stupid reference questions&quot; made me howl. I pray I will be able to keep a straight face if I ever end up working in Reference. May end up choosing cataloging from the get-go! The 10 stages were funny, if a little depressing.Think of Matt Groening's &quot;Life is Hell&quot;, focused on Librarianship. That's pretty much the kind of book you have here."},{"Title":"Truth about Reference Librarians","review":"Will Manley's &quot;The Truth About Reference Librarians&quot; is a must for stressed-out library students. Feeling pressured about your Information Sources exam? Pondering the absolute ridiculousness of LC Subject Headings? Wondering if an MLIS is really worth all this idiocy? Here's the book for you. Manley provides a selection of valuable resources: the signs of reference burnout (personal favorite: &quot;You might be suffering from reference burnout if a patron asks for a good mystery and you offer her AACR2&quot;), suggested epitaphs for librarians, and a list of technological innovations reference librarians *really* need (such as the odor-activated antiperspirant gun). Richard Lee's illustrations are a good complement to Manley's lively text"},{"Title":"Truth about Reference Librarians","review":"After reading this book I am both happy and relieved to say that I am finally on the road to figuring out our two reference librarians.

The language is engaging and the description is clear. It take a standing on Leadership types and dare to fight the conventional wisdom of leader-vs-manager.This is a book on the thinking about the Leadership type, which describes its stregth, needs and weakeness within corporations.The Artist, Craftmans and Technocrats. Most readers would like to think that he/she is the crossing between Artist n Craftmans and the book do warn us on this. please double check yourself and think again honestly.This is not a very deep book (like Mitszberg: The Rise and Fall of Strategic Thinking), but also not a shallow book (like FISH or W-M-M-CHEESE, ONE MINUTE SERIES), but just right in between. Enjoyable to read.And if not for anything else. the above explanation of the 3 types alone would shred new lights in your view of the leaders. And worth your time invested in reading it. The other important thing to point is that Leadership Type is not teachable or even changeble, so much for the leadership seminars. ( I believe this to some extend, that entrepreneurs are similarly -mostly- BORN and not made!)The book did not give u a HOW TO do something, but let you think about leadership adn how people differ from each others.A mandatory reading for management leader. and Psychology student focusing on management."},{"Title":"The Drama of Leadership","review":"Wether you like or don't like the book may depend very much on wether you are a technocrat, an artist or a craftsman. But I like the book mainly because it almost perfectly describes and interprets the developments within some organizations which I had and have to deal with.Are Pitcher's theories good enough to be used for predictions, i.e. about the development of carreers? The book passed that test too.In Germany the well known weekly magazine DIE ZEIT (1997/09/12, page 26) recommended the German edition of Pitcher's book (&quot;Das F&uuml;hrungsdrama&quot;) to their readers."},{"Title":"The Drama of Leadership","review":"At least my experience fits exactly to what the author reflects on her 6 year study!! In an easy to read style and an exciting manner the author develops a theory that is flexible enough to allow for individual differences and structured enough to help analyzing your organization. I like the qualitative view on organization as this aspect is usually neglected. The last organization I worked for developped the exact same way as the example given in the book!"},{"Title":"The Drama of Leadership","review":"One star for this book can be only explained if it touches you. We must remember that so strong negative answer is usually employed when we don't want to see some part of the reality. In fact, the book can help us to understand some of the maladies of the mainstream theories of leadership. Very smart book for intelligent readers.The main shortcoming of the book is inherent to any taxonomy. Why three? Why not four?... However, classification is useful and we do not decline to use it."},{"Title":"The Drama of Leadership","review":"Why are some companies initially great, just to fail shortly afterwards ?

Even the rise and fall of companies can be predicted in this way, just by looking at their population type. Recruiting could improve completely using the knowledge of this work, so could innovation and creation.If you are in any way a long term focused person, people oriented, open minded, intuitive, visionary, humane, dedicated, or wise and never fully understood certain destructive behaviour or political games going on at work DO read this book. If you are an artist or a \\"craftsman\\" you will love this book, especially when \\"artist\\". \\"Technocrats\\" (the short term focused power hungry type of person) on the other hand will hate it.A perfect book for every HR professional-recruiter-headhunter and all managers and professionals out there - if interested in hiring those true creators.

My husband and I shared this book with our 2 and 1/2 year old, and it is one of her all time favorites.Mr. Inkpen's soft, charming illustrations along with his witty and sweet style of story telling make this book so appealing, that you will be happy to read it \\"over and over\\" again to your child. Pick it up and fall in love.Here's the outline: Kipper's friend Pig sends out a wish list for his birthday party, so Kipper visits a pet store to buy him the perfect gift. After carefully considering the many creatures in the shop, (\\"The stick insect... too much like a stick.\\") he finds a hamster and brings it home to give to Pig the next day. He names the hamster Roly, after dicovering the \\"tricks\\" he can do. Kipper adores Roly and wishes he didn't have to give him up the next day as a present to Pig.

Definitely a fun book."},{"Title":"Kipper and Roly","review":"The pictures are cute (but not overly so), the prose is well-written, and the story is great w/ the lesson of friendship & giving.

For some reason, I find myself thinking of the great Welsh poet, RS Thomas, whenever I pause and read Wright. That's probably unfair, but their sense that God is in the silences between noise, in the fissure between what our mind can verify and the demands that are made on our soul -- these things bring them together, at least in my mind. This is a fine collection of poems."},{"Title":"CHICKAMAUGA","review":"Charles Wright\`s book of poems is the most moving bookof poetry I have read in a long time.He speaks to the soulas well as the heart.My only problem with Charles Wright ishe doesn't have any other books out that I can find.Thanks foran enjoyable night of reading your book.I would of givena ten but the book was to short."},{"Title":"CHICKAMAUGA","review":"Charles Wright's Chickamauga is an outstanding collection of poetry. It is both very modern and deeply traditional in its feelings with parallels to Chinese poetry and to the work of Wallace Stevens. The poems use landscape and memory of his Italian years to link us to the basic human experiences of life: ageing, loss etc. They seem a great step forward from his previous books, like the Zone Jounals and China Traces, and at least equal to his most recent book Black Zodiac. I found it both beautiful and deeply moving."},{"Title":"Lee Smith, Annie Dillard, and the Hollins Group: A Genesis of Writers (Southern Literary Studies)","review":"The author provides an historical overview of the development of private Southern women's schools from finishing schools to respected institutions of higher learning. Primary in this change at Hollins is the influence of Louis Rubin on both the writing program and the writers that program produced, with many quotes from the students about their mentor. Parrish also gives many humorous and interesting anecdotes about Lee Smith, Annie Dillard and the other subjects of the book during their formative years at Hollins. She shows how their college experiences carried over to their writing both then and through the years since graduation. For Lee Smith and Annie Dillard fans, this book is a must-read."},{"Title":"Lee Smith, Annie Dillard, and the Hollins Group: A Genesis of Writers (Southern Literary Studies)","review":"Parrish impresses her reader with not only the grasp and knowledge of her material, but with also a certain spice that is often missing in non-fiction. Through her vivid descriptions, the reader is immersed in the Hollins culture. This is most definitely a must for the Dillard and Smith fan, but even more so a must for the reader who enjoys exquisite writing."},{"Title":"Lee Smith, Annie Dillard, and the Hollins Group: A Genesis of Writers (Southern Literary Studies)","review":"This book by Nancy Parrish offers valuable information about four southern fiction writers-- Lee Smith, Annie Dillard, Lucinda MacKethan, and Anne G. Jones. Members of the class of '67, at Hollins College (VA), the four were involved in the writing program that was shaped and nurtured by Dr. Louis Rubin. By means of interviews and research, Parrish examines how and why the four students developed as writers and later became recognized as accomplished influential voices in contemporary American literature.Although Parrish's book focuses on the writing program at Hollins College, she gives an excellent historical account about how private southern women's finishing schools transitioned into nationally respected academic institutions.Parrish writing style is straightforward and direct. Her research is convincing, and the many quotations, anecdotes, and stories she includes make the book entertaining.Several years ago when this book was first published, I read it and found it interesting, but recently, having to prepare a lecture about southern fiction, I found Parrish's book to be a valuable resource. I also found her book insightful, enjoyable, and a fine consideration about southern life and culture."},{"Title":"TOO MUCH FLESH AND JABEZ.","review":"good book. read it after i read gilbert sorrentino's piece on it from \\"Something Said\\"."},{"Title":"Books for Burning: Between Civil War and Democracy in 1970s Italy","review":"Antonio Negri is probably best known for Empire, the book he wrote a couple of years ago with Michael Hardt. That brilliant survery of globalization and late capitalism remains essential reading for anyone interested in the subject. Negri's new book is a reprint of some pamphlets he published in 1970's, but it is still an incisive and pertinant work. Reacting to the tremendous disparities between the social classes in Italy, Negri grapples with the central moral questions involved in revolutionary change and violence. I found it an initially difficult but rewarding work, and it would be interesting if many people, not only on the left, but on the right as well, took the time to check it out. This is one of those books that has alot to teach to people on both sides of the political fence, and Negri, as someone who has really paid his dues (he was imprisoned in Italy, and the pamphlets in Books for Burning helped to put him behind bars) is an important figure in Marxist thought."},{"Title":"Cosette Or the Time of Illusions","review":"M. Thenadier moved to America to become a slave trader at the end of Les Miserables. Inspector Javert not only died, his body was found dead in an ending that Victor Hugo declared to be one of his best and should not be changed or he would never write another word. Well, since he's not writing any more, it has been changed. Marius didn't have a penchant for getting involved with dubious people - indeed, his participation in the student uprising was motivated by idealism.If this book had characters with different names, and did not say \\"Sequel to Les Miserables\\", perhaps it would be better.Really, this is a sequel to the musical, not the book."},{"Title":"Cosette Or the Time of Illusions","review":"Ok, so it starts a little slow but by the end of the first chapter you're hooked. It's well written with an intricate plot that has you hooked... until page 300 or so when you realise that there are not enough pages left to satisfy the story. I was gripped and then it was all over. Where was the end?The three main characters are left stranded somewhere in the ether and you're left just as forgotten as they are. Maybe I am missing a sequel or something, if so, when I find it, I won't be as severely disappointed as I am.This author had me eating out of the palm of his hand. Perhaps this was the cunning intention all along- only now I am fuming at the lack of conclusion to an otherwise wonderful, almost perfect book."},{"Title":"Cosette Or the Time of Illusions","review":"OK, just a few things: Les Miserables (the original novel) is commonly regarded as one of the greatest pieces of literary work ever written, and therefore should not be changed. However, in this version, Javert is still alive, and Marius is a carefree, fun-loving, and immmature character. Marius is not carefree. Javert is dead. I would call that changing the original novel. A reader who is not familiar with the original work might enjoy this, but anyone who loves Victor Hugo's classic novel would not enjoy this book. My advice to those who want something to read? The original novel."},{"Title":"Cosette Or the Time of Illusions","review":"Increadible how someone can completely spit on the great work that is Les Miserables with a sequel that hardly knicks the surface of Hugo's sublimity and romantic writing. This is total crap. Ceresa's sequel is nothing but intellectual looting with one simple goal: to make a buck by feeding on a potential market of Les Miserables (the musical) fans with little or no literary interest.I'd like to make one important point: in the original JAVERT KILLED HIMSELF! THATS IT! HE DID NOT SURVIVE AT THE LAST SECOND. NONONO! I will NEVER in my life believe that anything told in the original can be skewed and reorganized to fit the poor authorship of an unauthorized sequel. I will not read Marius or the Fugitive even under the threat of chopping off my right arm. I refuse to help fund the bastardizing of the story that changed my life and made me a better man. I don't care how this cliff hanger ends.This is all just a bad dream I woke up from the second I threw this book in the trash. Burning books is for Nazis and fundamentalist christians who can't handle HARRY POTTER, but for this book my views on book burning take a nice 180 spin.Illusions\\" and \\"Fugitive\\" never really happened, historically or otherwise... not even close... to me, this story is fiction's fiction.Shame on you Francois Ceresa."},{"Title":"Cosette Or the Time of Illusions","review":"As a die hard fan of Les Miserable I purchased this book in a sale bin. I found the first few chapters a little dry and a little hard to get into,but kept reading and found the book to be actually quite good. The plot was complicated, and I thought very similar to the story of the Count of Monte Cristo. As Javert (Verjat) begins to unravel Marius misfortune, I wondered too how they would wrap everything up in a few pages. Well, they didn't. Did Ceresa forget that a story needs an ending. Is there a sequel that is coming, or is Marius the Fugitive the sequel? Is there an English version? What a dissapointment to come to the end of the book with the fate of the main characters still in the air. While I enjoyed the book in itself, it was rather strange to get to the end, and find there was none."},{"Title":"Presidential Redwork: A Stitch in Time","review":"This book would be a compliment to any public or school library.

The book features all 42 U.S. presidents in easy to embroider redwork patterns, updating a form of redwork quilting popular at the turn of the century. Also included are bonus patriotic patterns such as various American eagles and U.S. landmarks. While the book isn't being used for quilting, the family can read the interesting biographies on each president, many revealing little known facts about our nation's leaders.

It was great. I haven't been able to get into other zombie novels because they seem pretty much the same--just gore without much substance. It never occurred to me that Ezekiel's vision of the dry bones rising and taking shape could be what we call zombies. In my mother's Bible, there was a fascinating full plate artist's rendition of Ezekiel's valley of the dry bones. It was full of skeletons, some in the process of standing up.

The zombies in this book aren't your standard zombies. They think, speak, work together, etc...

Very stereotypical characters, a lot of religious discussion, and a predictable outcome, but all in all it was worth the read."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"This book has great deal to say. The back cover realy sums it up best murderous theological fantasy, indead an epic vision of damnation and redemption, supercharged with mayhem, terror and old-time religion.

I love zombies (in abundance) and the apocalypse (one apocalypse check). I couldn't stop turning the pages, I knew what was going to happen but I had to read it all over again. I could scarcely contain myself at several points waiting for certain events to happen. The characters where as real to me this time around as the first, they aren't just characters in a story they are people I know.The theological discussions are interesting and keep your attention while moving the plot along. While the action scenes are packed fill up Roger's usual descriptive bloodshed, both disgusting and amusing at the same time.I have made every friend of mine read this and even loaned it to my mother, she was most upset that while reading it she missed her train stop. Buy this book, read it, make your friends read it, make them buy it."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"I picked up The Dead because I enjoyed Rogers's fantasy books (Blood + Pearls, etc) so much, and because the premise intrigued me. A zombie story set to the backdrop of the Christian apocalypse... ok, sounds like a fun ride. And oh man, it was.The book ended up being much more than I expected. Instead of a simple scary story I found a long theological discussion with periodic episodes of completely hair-raising horror. I'm not a spiritual person but I never felt put off by the deep religious basis of the book, nor did I ever feel like I was being preached at. On the contrary, I found myself very intrigued by the philosophical implications of the story. Rogers's take on the ultimate evil is especially interesting. He tackles ideas about free will, the nature of God, what it means to have faith, and more. What other &quot;zombie story&quot; can say so much?I've been lending The Dead to all of my friends and all of them have loved it so far.

A must buy! 5 stars no prob! I can't put into words how good this was!"},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"This book is a must read for any zombie lover. The undead in this book are vicious. The action is fast and furious and the reasoning for the dead walking again is very compelling. These are zombie from the classic Romero mold &quot;When there is no more room in the hell the dead shall walk the earth.&quot; This book would make an excellent movie. You will find yourself not able to put this book down and wanting to read it again once you are done."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"The Dead was a good, quick read for me. It was so quick because I couldn't stop reading it once I got started. Things start out nice and fast with a corpse bashing his way out of a coffin and move right along as a zombie crisis snowballs towards some really freaky scenes later on.You get to know many of the characters pretty well before they get eaten alive or mutilated in various unpleasant ways. Disturbingly, their tormentors are often people who were close to them in life before rising as murderous zombies. The living characters have to fight back to survive, and thus are forced to face the horror of hacking loved ones to pieces or blowing huge holes in them. Considering the tortured existence of the undead and the desperate struggles of the living it is tough at times to know who to feel sorriest for here. You'll know by the end of the book though.I hate to give away too many details, but there's a creature a little later in the book that you really have to see, and I don't mean a zombie. This thing is pretty weird, and it just might change how you think about supernatural beings. There's also some really twisted stuff in here, so if you'd be squeamish about things like somebody getting the skin ripped off of their face like a mask you might want to read something else. I like that kind of stuff though...at least in books..."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"This book is killer! It is the Last Days and it ain't like that hack who writes those \\"Left Behind\\" books describes it. Legion himself walks the earth and he is making the dead and dying into an army that wants to eradicate all of humanity.By the way, the survivors and fighters in this book do one of the most common sense things when firing at a horde of rampaging ghouls."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"A great take on the apocalypse, from the point of view of one town USA. This is judjement day, religious type stuff, not your typical zombie story. Lots of descriptive gore and action, it really had a creepy holocaust feel to it."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"Wow. How to start. Well, this book gained notoriety in my circle of friends, getting passed around from one to another. Then, it was my turn. I was hooked from the first, being a fan of zombie movies and such. A strange thing happened as I read The Dead. The book starts to get into a lot of Catholic theology, but never gets preachy, more of an explanatory tone; hey, here's what I beleive, etc., through one of the characters, to explain what is happening. Instead of this bogging down the book, it drew me in even more, having had a Catholic upbringing. A real tension is developed among the characters; who will make it through this, and why. The main bad guy/king zombie/demon is genuinely terrifying, not because he's some kind of typical bad mofo, but because he knows your sins, he knows your worst secrets, and is ready to hand out retribution for them. All in all, this is a great twist on the worn out zombies back from the dead genre."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"A Really well written book in general, lots of action, plot, and of course zombies. If you're into that kinda thing and don't mind the old time religion overtone (it's the cause of the zombies) then you should pick this book up."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"The &quot;guts&quot; of this book are every bit as creepy and frightening as the cover. I read this book almost a dozen years ago when it was first published and it gave me nightmares. After discovering this new edition, with vastly improved cover art done by Mark Rogers himself, the nightmares returned. I have loaned my battered, out-of-print first edition to almost every friend I have and everyone of them thought it a great book.The Dead is terrifying on many levels, but the author's ability to make the premise of corpses clawing up out of their graves, bent on maiming and torturing the living seem possible and believable scared me more than anything else.The story moves along at a furious pace, punctuated by gun battles, martial arts action and conversations with the damned undead. The theology, on which the book is based, is well thought out and argued over from many different viewpoints by the characters, keeping the book from becoming too preachy.I can't recommend it enough."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I loved that it's characters were forced to question their personal religious beliefs as a result of the undead walking the earth. It's an easy read, scary, page turner, etc. If you're a fan of the zombie genre you'll really like this book!"},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"Being a big fan of the Samurai Cat series, I didn't know what to expect from The Dead, it's not a comedy like his other works, nor is it your standard slow moving run into the farm house and board up the windows zombie tale. Mr. Rogers tells tales and paints pictures of his characters and their surroundings as easily with words as he does with a paintbrush. His zombies aren't just a side effect of some toxic spill or virus, but move with thought and a deliberate agenda. Forget those fast running zombies, these monsters will have you looking over your shoulder as you walk to the car at night. This is the best Zombie/End of the World novel that I have read in a long time."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"The Book of Revelations meets Lucio Fulci and George Romero in The Dead. This book conjures up some pretty gruesome imagery without being excessive, and also some thought-provoking theological questions without being preachy. Between narrow escapes, ghastly murders, heated arguments, and hair-raising battles with the undead there is hardly a dull moment; I ended up reading all of it in two sessions because I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"I met Mark Rogers at a fiction convention. Bored and sensing a kindred spirit, I hung around Mark's table, a little lost in the swirl of all the agents, publishers, and hopeful authors like myself.When I mentioned that I write book reviews, Mark offered me not just one book, but all of them - literally, the entire pile of books he had on his table. I just couldn't do take him up on his offer; as much as I'd love to write reviews for all of his books, the odds of me finishing any of them in a reasonable period of time (say, before I see him again in a year at another convention) were low. So I only picked up a few. Then he asked me the magic question: \\"Are there are any in particular you're interested in?\\"I pointed at The Dead, with its disturbing cover of a wicked-looking dead man. And thus I became acquainted with Mark's style of horror.Mark is what I like to call a double-threat. Mark's not just an artist; he's an amazing talent reminiscent of Frank Frazetta. After reading The Dead, it's apparent that he's also an exceptional author. It just isn't fair!When I picked up The Dead, Mark warned me \\"there are typos.\\" That's not entirely true. I found only one actual misspelling. But something happened during layout, such that every few paragraphs two words run together. Somehow, these kinds of errors offend me far less than misspellings.I expected a zombie book. In fact, I was intrigued how one writes a zombie-themed novel. After awhile the zombies have to get a little boring, right? What I got instead was something completely different: a good old-fashioned fire-and-brimstone tale of the apocalypse, complete with the dead walking the earth to claim souls for Hell.The Dead is basically a morality play, detailing the efforts of a few tough characters strong enough to survive. All the familiar apocalyptic elements are here, from nature reclaiming technology to good people suddenly spirited away to Heaven, from preachers touting the end of the world to survivalists loaded with artillery. They're all front and center in The Dead, and Mark gleefully kills them off one by one.Mark's greatest skill is in his imagery. He has an artist's talent for visualizing the indescribable; his description of the palpable evil that one of the zombies gives off, like \\"that scene in Indiana Jones where the Nazi pugilist is about to hit the whirling blade\\" will stick with me for the rest of my life. Mark doesn't just describe events; he actually paints pictures of them in your mind, filling in every color and texture.The book isn't perfect, however. Some characters (notably the wife of the protagonist) seem undeveloped, while others (Steve) show up out of nowhere. The events of the world are summarized in narration rather than left a mystery, which detracts from some of the horror. For those seeking definitive answers as to which side Rogers comes down on philosophically, he dodges the question: what happens to all those folks who aren't Christian? Good question...Still, The Dead is a terrifying tale, especially so for Roman Catholics with a healthy dose of Italian guilt. You'll never look at your zombies the same way again."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"I am a big fan of zombie fiction. I have read most of what Amazon has to offer and will continue to seek out more as more product is produced. After reading some of the reviews of this book, I was pretty prepared to be disappointed in this novel as a real diversion from standard zombie fiction that gets preachy and rather annoying. I was happily mistaken in that presumption.Certainly, this book utilizes christianity as a background with which to play with. The dead here are angry, vicious, damned souls that want nothing more than to destroy the rest of humanity, to pull them down to their own cursed level instead of being mindless flesh eaters. They rip and tear at people but do not devour them-it is not their purpose to consume the living but to have them join them in their agony.Unlike \\"The Rising\\" and \\"City of the Dead\\" by Brian Keene, you do not get the sense that these cursed souls from the abyss or their demon overseer are being forced to act like Romero zombies because the author wants to bridge the gap between Romero and the Bible. At least that is not the sense I got. I am not saying that Brian Keene didn't do a good job of it, but this felt more biblical, more epic in nature. I got the feeling that the Mark Rogers created these creatures and felt no need to slap an added layer of \\"varnish\\" on them to make them more like other similar creatures in other works.I would agree that the main characters do fit into some stereotypical molds-the agnostic, the atheist, the religious zealots, etc. It did not detract from the overall story though. They were only stereotypes on the surface-the character development was still satisfactory and individualized these people quite well. The ones that must fight to live after the \\"rapture\\" have to find ways to escape the ever increasing army of the dead and find ways to come to grips with this new reality-that they must change their beliefs, their attitudes if they want to transcend it. Survival here is not the true goal, at least not on this plane of existence.Obviously, this is not your typical zombie work and if you go into it expecting that, like some other reviewers, you will probably be upset and feel you were jipped. Especially if you feel like the author is somehow getting all \\"high and mighty\\" with his message. In my view, it was very well done though. You don't have to agree with the christian view points or perceptions of the apocalypse to find this work interesting to say the least and quite an fun action adventure to boot. The action sequences are well written and keep things moving at a rapid pace.Some have said there was a lot of editing errors in this book. I just read \\"Zombies in my Hometown\\" and I can say with all honestly this book is infinitely superior as far as the editing is concerned to many of the books out there in the genre. Yes, there were spelling errors and I got the sense that the font was changed before the book went to press and some of the words were jammed together because of it, but unless you cannot tolerate a few mistakes here and there, you should be able to get through it with minimal anguish. After all the self published zombie works I have read lately, I consider this book towards the higher end of the scale as far as editing is concerned. Of course, compared to highly polished works produced by big publishing houses it is lacking, but again it is nothing that will really bog you down.I am a person who enjoys a lively debate; a good argument about religion and philosophy. While some of the conversations going on in this novel did seem a bit contrived they still brought up interesting points of view and commentary that was stimulating to read through. I don't have to agree with everything put in print or get angry at someone for speaking out for something I might disagree with so none of it upset me. I honestly did not feel that the author was preaching but was posing different ideas and giving his characters the passion to state them.I will state for the record that my opinions are influenced by the fact that I grew up Catholic-went to Catholic schools, the whole nine yards. As I grew to adulthood I spent a great deal of time questioning my own and other religions and am not a practicing Catholic or a member of any other churches at this time. Despite that, I am always interested and open to various view points on both God and religion and so reading this book was, for me, an interesting exploration of both of those topics.As I stated in the title of my review, this book is fun, fast paced, and different than a \\"normal\\" zombie novel. If you are generally open to seeking out something a little different in the undead realm that has some religious undertones to it you might enjoy it, but if you are looking for just a traditional undead tale with no hint of the \\"wrath of God\\" then this book might not be to your taste."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"I was a fan of this book from way back, so when I found out there was a new edition, I had to get it. For some reason, the Amazon folks don't mention that this version has a whole bunch of illustrations by the author. Depicting several of the novel's creepiest scenes, they are painterly, atmospheric and thoroughly disgusting. And not just zombies...We also get to see a variety of devils and apocalyptic fauna running amok in the ruins of New Jersey.As I recall, earlier editions of the book had a lot of typos. Those have been cleaned up, as well. (Not that they were a major distraction to begin with.)"},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"When I read a book with numerous errors in it, I normally flip about it. There are a lot of them in this book. In fact, the character names change a couple of times and I could go on, but I am doing something that I never do. I am still giving this book a five star rating. Yes, it is that good. So good, that I actually didn't even care about the errors. Rogers did an excellent job as far as scaring the pants off of me. That is exactly what I want when I pick up a zombie book. Rogers made the demon infested walking dead so thoroughly evil that I felt like running to the local Catholic Church and confessing all of my wrong doings. Great job Mark Rogers!"},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"This book is like a sucker punch to the gut, but in a good way.To be quite honest, I'm not a \\"book reader\\" by nature. Upon constant urging from a friend, I read this book. Once I started reading it, right from the beginning, I was hooked. The tone of the book made me actually FEEL the impending doom surrounding the characters. Mark Rogers has a great way of making me totally feel what the character is feeling.On more than one occasion, my skin crawled at the mere description of the reanimated dead, and I caught myself saying aloud, \\"Uggghhhh.\\" Add to that the religious overtones of the book, and it was definite nightmare fuel. (I would go into more details on this, but I don't want to spoil anything.)Yes, the book does have a religious overtone, but it isn't shoved down your throat in any way whatsoever, and coming from a church-raised background, it actually increased the \\"oomph\\" this book had. Mark does a great job of showing many different viewpoints as well.The illustrations are also a nice touch. There aren't a ton of them, but they are utterly gruesome.If you go into this book with an open mind, it will quickly grab your interest and never let go."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"OR your standard fan of religious fiction, but it's likely to be highly effective for its particular niche.Having recently had my first taste of zombie written fiction, I decided to pick up Mark E. Roger's The Dead based on the recommendation of a friend. I didn't fully understand what I was getting into, and I have to admit I felt somewhat duped when I first started reading. For me, religion is serious business. Zombie fiction is not. Finding out that the zombie book I'd just picked up was coming at me from the pulpit, as it were, was a little like walking into a Halloween haunted house and finding out a local church was just trying to score some pro-life points. It's sneaky and not especially nice. I have to admit, though, that the book won me over. There are long passages that clearly exist simply to proselytize and speeches given by characters that seem far too organized to occur ex tempore. But they were, if not especially realistic, thought provoking and well-written. Badly edited, but well-written.The horror in this novel is secondary to its purpose: to make you question your preparation for the end of the world. If you're okay with that, you may find yourself enjoying the book as much as I did."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"From the man who brought the world the genius of the Samurai Cat series comes this horror novel about the Rapture. Written in the late 1980s, this was reissued in 2000 by a small print-on-demand publisher who clearly have no editors to catch spelling errors. That quibble aside, the book is pretty well-written. It tells the story of two brothers in a seaside NJ town, back there with family to bury their father. Suddenly the sun gets ulcerous, the righteous vanish from the Earth, and the dead rise from their graves and form an army to take over the planet from the living. Hunted through the houses and sewers of suburban Jersey, the family blows away walking, talking corpses while simultaneously having long, drawn-out discussions with a priest about faith, God, the Bible, and other religions. It is precisely these monologues which grind the narrative to a halt. It's great that the book has more on its mind than a gorefest, but I found myself getting frustrated when the characters kept acting like one-dimensional props (e.g. \\"I am a militant atheist, hear me roar!\\") and treading the same ground in their arguments, over and over. Still, this is a fun book and its short length means you can plow through it in a couple of days. It's definitely worth checking out for fans of the fear-based book genres and zombie tales in general."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"I read this book several years ago and I have went back since then and reread the book several times. I really enjoyed the book and the characters especially how the author weaves biblical aspects into the book. He uses the rapture, good versus evil,to show how the world ends."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"This was a gory read. Granted, I have read worse, but not really in such volume. And I can honestly say that I've never heard of the Apocalypse portrayed quite like that before.I enjoyed it though, as much as one can enjoy zombies and death all over. The philosophy and religion were interesting as well. And the illustrations were very good."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"Nature and reality were forever changed on the day the sun's brilliance diminished, and the graves cracked open with their demon-possessed inhabitants rising up to attack the living.THE DEAD by Mark E. Rogers (SAMURAI CAT) is a story about those survivors who are in the midst of the Apocalypse, hoping to outrun the torture and slow death of Hell's retribution.Rogers' story is End Times parable as thrill ride horror, addressing theological questions of damnation and redemption in between the murder and the mayhem.One thing stands out as especially noteworthy about THE DEAD:Leading the possessed corpses is none other than Legion, the demon encountered by Christ in the region of the Gerasenes. For this story, Rogers' places Legion's pre-fall origins in the Third Order of the Angelic Host: the Ophanim (commonly known as Thrones or Wheels), providing an overwhelmingly detailed description of the demon's true form. When you consider that the Thrones are God's humble instruments of His Judgement, it was quite clever for Rogers to show what could become of one of them who was made perverse by vanity, the confusion of its insanity inverting its reason for being.If you have an aversion to Christian eschatology or are repulsed by religiosity in general, then Mark E. Rogers' THE DEAD is not a book for you. On the other hand, fans of both Brian Keene's THE RISING and Kim Paffenroth's DYING To LIVE should find this 1989 novel quite an exciting and more than worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"I don't know where to start with this, but The Dead somehow manages to be as intelligent as it is gruesome; for every face-shredding or grisly mutilation, there's a thought provoking theological debate, and although the story is based on Catholic symbolism concerning the end of the world, at no part is it ever &quot;preachy.&quot; The Dead also manages not to be dull at any point, with suspenseful escapes, heated arguements, and all-out battles with the undead on every page. Do yourself a favor and buy this one."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"What can I say, the book has it all. Never before have I seen the idea of the end of the world addressed quite like this. The viewpoints and arguements about religion present much to think about while the intense action and gory details will make it impossible to put the book down. By the time you finish you will be questioning your faith and giving grave yards a second glance when you pass by."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"I enjoyed reading The Dead. The characters are well written and the premise is totally reasonable. I would reccomend this novel to anyone who wants to read a story that will make you think and entertain you."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"Easily one of the finest Living dead novels ever written.I suppose it doesn't come on the radar of the average Zombie horror maven because the walking dead don't have some unnamed virus or what have you as the cause of their reanimation. THE DEAD has got a decidedly religious cause. And the corpses vomited up from not just their graves, but the scenes of their recent deaths, are PISSED. I'm talking Vengeful, hating everyone not sharing their state and fate. They don't just bite, devour, they drag the living painfully into a state of painful necrosis. Yes there are demons and fallen angels and lots of hints o' scripture. But don't for a moment mistake this for some dumb\\"Left Behind\\" knock off. Think of it as a horror book for atheists, something along the lines of \\"OH CRAP! You mean those dumbasses were RIGHT?\\"(lets face it, is anything scarier to your garden variety atheist?)The imagery is terrific, the violence above the standard of most zombie novels, and the fleeing survivors are well rounded, their circumstances and escapes well thought out. In fact, beyond World War Z, I challenge anyone to find better worldwide depictions of the effects of living vs. dead conflict.(If I'm wrong? tell me. I'm happy to read it and be entertained!)This novel firmly straddles Zombie and Supernatural horror boundaries, and is well worth checking out.Thankfully reprinted... and available as an E-book. By all means take advantage..."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"I had become a born again Christian a few years back. Of course, I was immersing myself in all things Christian at that time. I had just finished \\"The Purpose Driven Life\\" when I came across a worn cheesy copy of \\"The Dead\\" in the hospital libary where I work. I thought for .75 cents I'd give it a try....I needed some brain candy.To my surprise it turned out to be darn good and scary. Plus, I had to chuckle when I read it that it was based on The Rapture in the bible.I've given it to both my adult daughers to read and they thought it was good too. Give it a try, you'll enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"I picked this book up on the recommendation of author J.L. Bourne and a couple of other members of the Day By Day Armageddon forum. I bought it through an Amazon reseller a week ago and got to it this past weekend. Even with the dated background I found it to be a deeply disturbing and twisted take on the whole zombie genre for me. I have always resisted the supernatural aspect that some zombie writers give their creatures and much prefer a freak 'virus' caused by mutation or deliberate science. The view presented by Rogers in his take gives me pause, a very uncomfortable pause. The book had many questions and arguments raised regarding faith or its lack and how we meet the end of life that added to the story for me. In his story Rogers paints, with words instead of his brushes, a very vivid landscape that enveloped me. The tale pulled me in and kept hold of me, so much so that I found it necessary to occasionally rip myself loose from this wide awake and personal nightmare he envisioned and shared. I could nitpick some of the details regarding weapons and all but since his primary character isn't an expert on weapons, I decided to let it slide. The helplessness and horror the characters faced definitively overrode my pickiness on such technical things as correct weapons terminology. My copy was the Permuted Press one with several B & W plates, but the words on the paper were the true canvas for me. Thanks to J.L. Bourne, et al., for the recommendation, and to Mark Rogers for a well told story."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"I had been waiting for years for this book to have been reprinted and issued so i would not have to pay an arm and a leg (no pun intended)to read it and it was worth the wait. There is a lot of religous overtures that debate believers and non believers but i thought it added some brain food (no pun intended) rather than just the typical run through the mill zombie apocalypse books that have no substance. You actually feel for the characters througout the book and it adds a little flavor when you learn each ones fate. I have read many books in this genre with many epic fails as my last feeling afer completion but this is one i felt paid off after i was finished. I am not going into detail about The Dead b/c i feel others have reviewed it well but i will definatly agree on what another reviewer said ....STRAIGHT UP NIGHTMARE FUEL!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"I remember in 1989, I was in 9th grade and in study hall and a friend of mine was reading, The Dead by Mark E. Rogers. He told me that is a very very scary book and that I should definitely read it.So 12 hours later. I neglected every class that day, I neglected my friends, I neglected my homework, dinner, and sleep that night. This book scared the hell out of me! and this is coming from someone who was raised on a steady diet of horror movies, horror comics, and other assorted things that could give a person the creeps.So now fast forward to when I am a thirty something adult and I come across this book on the internet and order it, so I can consume yet again. Even now this book still scares the hell out of me! So naturally I did what any great friend would do. I forced it on every friend I had. I made my girlfriend at the time read it. Even my mother had to read it! Needless to say, I had a lot of calls from my friends telling me in a sarcastic tone, \\"Thanks for making me read this book, it scared the hell out of me!\\" but they had to share my dread of this book! They had to know about this book. It was too important to not tell anyone about. Even now, when I run across someone who has not read this book, I pull it out and read to them the part that hooked me. Let's just call it, \\"When Duncan meets Legion.\\" and then they, just like I did when I was in 9th grade, neglect everything and then call me and tell me that they hate me for making them read this very scary and creepy novel.I just smile and say, \\"you're very welcome.\\""},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"Great Zombie novel with a different angle. Instead of the usual \\"biological / chemical / disease\\" outbreak, the Biblical/Rapture end of the world sparks this outbreak. Was refreshing. Quick read.Some of the character dialogue felt too long in places, but it was very minor. Was interesting to see an actual area referenced from where I grew up (Central NJ Coastline) as the location of the story. Was also interesting to see the author had somewhat of a grasp on the differences between Christian / Catholic / other deviations beliefs.The end peaked a bit too early and left me wanting a bit more. Overall a great book that I would recommend to fans of Zombie / Post Apocalyptic stories. Would make a great movie if the right director and funding were available."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"The Dead puts a theological spin on reanimated corpses, which is a refreshing change from the well trodden Trioxin derivative stories. The cadavers in this tale are physical hosts for demonic energies, acting like the \\"neo-zombies\\" of recent cinema - yet given the date of original publication you can't blame it on current trendiness. These decayed antagonists are ferocious, mean, cunning, and downright homicidal.The story revolves around two brothers, one atheist and the other a reserved believer, who return home for their father's funeral. Shortly thereafter all hell breaks loose. There isn't too much build-up beforehand, but in this sort of story you needn't intimately know characters through extensive pre-catalyst development. The true salt of their being is shown to you via their actions as the story progresses.Things start falling apart slowly and gain momentum. It becomes clear through the eyes of the characters that things are going horribly wrong, and there's a malicious intent behind it all. Before long the numbers are exponentially against the living, and the sense of growing panic is readily apparent.As with any religious discussion, it should be avoided in mixed company. The undercurrent of The Dead isn't a means to preaching between the lines. Rogers provides a different take on old ideological dilemmas in a situation where anyone could entertain the idea of not only fighting for their lives, but for their souls, regardless of denomination.The Dead is still among my all time favorites even after the abysmal editing and typos found in the current issuing. Any fan of apocalyptic fiction should give this a read at least once - regardless of your interpretation of what \\"apocalyptic\\" might mean. After all, isn't every significant zombie story not one of the end of the world?"},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"This is a great zombie adventure with a different twist.This does a great job of showing the a family recognizing and having to choose between good and evil.I recommend this to anyone who can handle the language and violence.It's worth the wade..."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"Couldn't finish it...

It was very graphic and detailed and I felt like I could create a perfect image of what the author was trying to portray, even though some things I would rather not imagine. It had all the must haves for a zombie novel, but provided another point of view that I've never seen before. It was a really good read and recommend it."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"This was an eye opening book. It makes the reader think about what will happen on judgement day and afterwards."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"Its a good thing I caught this book while it was a free download because it was not at all what I expected. I expected Zombie Horror, or even Zombie Survival Horror. What I got was a unique twist on the Rapture that sounded like it was written by an overly intelligent 14 year old atheist. As a Zombie story, it was terrible. As a twist on the Rapture theme, it was actually pretty good. However, it has a slow start that will make you want to skip pages to see when the action starts. Characters were wooden enough that you often lost track of who was who until the death toll knocks it down to the two main characters and their groups. The story itself consists of a few pages of awesome action that pulls you in and makes you worry for the characters. Followed by a chapter or two of characters arguing over the possible existence of a God and his nature. The arguments themselves remind me of the Goth kids in high school, the ones that were raised catholic and turned to some sort of paganism. Just enough education to know what they're talking about but the arguments have more emotion than substance. It got bad enough that every time the characters stopped running or fighting, I'd just skip pages until something happened. All in all I'm not sorry I read it, but its only a mediocre book."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"This book keeps you interested. The battle between good and evil has just begun.

It was a a story that kept you into it. As a writer myself it is hard to find works that grab me. This was a good one."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"The author has an interesting take on the Romero zombie, with several very good gruesome scenes throughout the book. The author also weaves a very compelling setting of despair and gloom throughout his new zombified world. However, he mars the story-telling experience by injecting page after page of theological debates between the main characters. Ultimately the book veers away from the tried and true goodness of zombie killing fun fiction and into a thinly veiled sermon waxing on about Judgment Day and Christianity. I have no problems with religion, but I don't want to be lectured in my leisure time reading. Additionally the climax and subsequent resolution of the book and it's main characters is not satisfying."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"I've already read this book twice and I'm sure I'll read it again. If you liked Brian Keene's The Rising you're sure to love this little gem."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"This book is OKAY, but definitely not a great read. Lots of misspellings and grammatical errors, and the author's own pentecostal religious outloook (which is strange, because all the main characters in the book are Catholic), make it feel as if you're reading the Turner Diaries as envisioned by George Romero.There are still some good scares provided, just don't expect this to be a well-written book."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"Sorry, I have to depart from the general consensus and say that, as a writer myself, this book was awful. Aside from the stereotypical depictions of women being creatures of bovine stupidity, the typographical errors on EVERY single page were outrageous, all the characters were completely one-dimensional, and the ending was utter garbage. This was neither scary nor thought-provoking, but laughable at best. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is that the concept was a good idea. It was, however, very badly carried out. I have not read anything else by Mark E. Rogers, and judging from this I probably never will."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"With very few good zombie survival books to choose from, wasting your money on The Dead is exactly that, a waste of money. Do not let the cover of this book fool you, it's really just a sermon in sheeps clothing. Filled with fire and brimstone, it places the action behind the thinly laid subtext, God God and more God. By page eight you're already tired of the thinly laid debates between all of the main characters (who are all religious figures of some kind). The plot is somewhat pacing for the story but the dialog thrown in is truly a tragity. The characters are predictible and poorly thought out. Do not waste your time. If your in the market for a good book minus the sermon, buy Reign of the Dead and call it a day."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"The author uses this book as his own platform for expressing his religious preference.... disses a very good stephen king... and there are so many freaking typos in this book its hard to read. if you want a good zombie novel go with the Autumn series by David Moody or Day by day armageddon.this book gave me a headache 3 times before i finished it due to the arguments between the fundamentalist preacher, the orthodox catholic priest and the survivalist.... that should pretty much say it all."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"I read this on the recommendation of another horror novel fan; unfortunately, \\"The Dead\\" has significant problems.First, the book suffers from serious editing and format errors. There are numerous spelling errors, examples of incorrect usage, awkward dialogue, and inconsistent proofreading. For example, it's often unclear which character is speaking because the author uses italics to indicate speech AND thought, but doesn't apply this consistently. The author's spelling is atrocious - you would think a book about zombies would spell \\"cemetery\\" correctly. Finally, there are numerous examples of excessive spacing, as well as run-on words (and a couple of run-on sentences as well). The presentation gives the distinct feel of a self-published vanity book.The rather derivative story aims for a James Blish \\"Black Easter\\" apocalyptic feel. The plot involves a supernatural end-of-the-world scenario, with the dead rising to torment the living. Think of \\"Army of Darkness\\" meets \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" with some religious overtones and you've got the feel for this book. We're given some characterization exposition for the protagonists, but the shift from normality to apocalypse is abrupt. This is a difficult topic to write about, but the author is not really able to convey a sense of global doom in this end-of-the-world novel. The world is coming to its end, but we're told this in a sentence or two in an off-hand fashion without descriptive and interesting writing.The \\"rules\\" are a little different than other genre novels - the dead are fast, use technology, are intelligent and organized, and really malevolent. Unfortunately, the logic is somewhat inconsistent in terms of the dead's motivations and weaknesses. Ultimately the threat is somehow \\"bad\\", but we're never sure why. We get very detailed (and confusing) details, then the author \\"gains altitude\\" and glosses over details that would more clearly explain what is going on. The author also is given to pseudoreligious exposition in character dialogue that further serves to confuse the issue. It is essentially a thinly disguised religious diatribe that has more in common with right-wind eschatology than with contemporary science fiction or horror.There are some definite nuggets of an interesting book in here. As written, the reader must work through some editing sloppiness and some confusing artistic decisions to find these."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"I read the Dead by Rogers and I have to say that it was really bad.The story isn't horrible. The action scenes at least work, very reminiscent of either Romero's work or that old Dead World comic.But interspersed are long dialogues about the nature of man and God and the Devil. NOT kidding. This book is fundementalist and the dead coming back to life are there to punish sinners.Thought I'd read it all (I did read this whole book) before but this one was a first.If the author reads this...please in future editions, make the religious sections in a red font so readers know what to skip."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"Here is one of the very best books ever written. Those that would disagree are either fops, knaves, or Bedlamb beggars.

All I will say is that never, EVER in my life did I expect to read, let alone pay for, over 300 pages of religious propaganda.Perfect example of judging a book by its cover..."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"A Catholic fan of Chick tracts, C.S. Lewis, and Cannibal Zombie movies eats some pizza gone bad right before going to bed... this is the Nightmare that results- A Splattergore version of The Revelation, with huge dollops of deep theological discussion. I Freakin' Loved It!Ironically, I had glanced at it when it was first published & dismissed it as Rapture-rip-off pulp. A few years back, Ross Pavlac's C'tian website recommended it as the best Tribulation novel he'd read because it was so dark & gritty. I regret having gone over a decade without having read this.Get it back into print & then onto film, Please!"},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"Though many readers have voiced disappointment in reading Mark Rogers' \\"The Dead\\", their criticism seems to arise from a horror generalist's perspective on zombie fiction rather than a more focussed view on where \\"The Dead\\" stands in relation to its genre counterparts. As others have done with respect to \\"The Dead\\" vis-a-vis end of times novels, I would like to assert the novel's excellence both in thematic and story development as well as in the writing thereof.For many horror readers, mention of the word \\"zombie\\" quickly evokes images of Romero's zombies seeking the flesh of barricaded survivors (I'm sure his brilliant scripts are usually not considered by the average horror reader). However, the zombie/apocalypse survivalist subgenres of horror allows for a much wider range of zombie types-- from the Halperin Brothers' wide-eyed mill workers and David Moody's addled husks, to Romero's and Lenhart's aping stumblers, to Garland's and Snyder's sprinting fiends and finally to Keene's homicidal wiseacres. Not only does zombie type allow for varied semiotic and metaphorical expression, but structures and charges the story to allow for differing tales/narratives of survival and humanity to unfold.Most amateur zombie enthusiasts tend to keep their fiction to the level of Lenhart and Romero-- i.e., survival depends on the protagonists' bonding, survival skills and generally Herbert Spencer/Ayn Rand outlook on life, careful thinking and luck. \\"The Dead\\", however, falls well within the nastier, more complex category of \\"hard\\" zombie/apocalyptic fiction, wherein the undead agents of downfall are fast, tough, smart and savagely tenacious. Survival cannot be a product of careful thought or preparedness, but largely only through the accident of one's surroundings. This is a tough genre within which to write convincingly, but Mark Rogers does so with nary a falter (though the editors at Infinity ought to be ashamed of the typesetting gaffs littered throughout the book). The ease of his prose, and his often mellow sense of black humor, make the work an excellent companion in any type of reading setting.Given \\"The Dead\\"'s genre context, and the divine inspiration of the novel's zombie aggressors, we have the perfect literary crucible in which to test our particular band of protagonists. Many have complained that Gary and his family are unrealistic, caricatures, not well written, incomplete, etc., but Roger's choice to follow the development of this intellectual, sensitive, impassioned, dysfunctional family of overachievers and envelope-pushers is the appropriate one given the nature of the zombie threat. Who better to follow than religiously-minded, curious people in the face of the end of times?Rather than focus on how convincing the characters-- especially Max, with his tiresome litany of lame arguments-- may be to us as readers (it would be as difficult to relate to and empathize with this History Professor/Marine hand-to-hand instructor as it would be to say, oh I don't know, Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan), we should instead be gauging their internal development (and where none, society's) over the course of the crisis.Altogether, an excellent read."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"The Dead, by Mark E. Rogers, is an impressive end-of-the-world novel that manages to combine action and a thrilling narrative with complex character development and even some finely honed theology. The main story concerns a small group of people who have gathered for a relative's funeral. After they share a dream about the end of the world, they learn that numerous people are missing; something like the Rapture has apparently occurred. But this is no simple Left Behind-type story. A chapter or two later the novel takes an unexpected turn when, at the funeral, their relative smashes out of his coffin. Then in a frightening scene, the corpses of the dead rise from their graves and begin slaughtering the living in particularly gruesome ways. These are not George Romero Living Dead-style liches, either. They don't devour their victims, but save them for slow, painful deaths and take a gruesome glee in the infliction of pain. During the rest of the book the main characters flee the zombies and try to stay alive as the earth slowly dies around them and the sun rots in the sky.Mark Rogers is a superb storyteller, with a real gift for gripping narrative that makes the story move very quickly; there's not a dull moment anywhere. His fine eye for both action and suspense adds tension to several key scenes: a tense flight through storm drains; an episode where the main characters are trapped on a boat run aground on a sandbar; a climactic battle where one character single-handedly holds off the zombies to give his companions a chance to escapeBut action is not Rogers' only forte. This book is not a simple zombie thriller. Rogers fills the book with moments of insight and character development that give this book depth. A raving fundamentalist, dismissed by the other characters-and by us-as a nut, is the first one to figure out what is really going on. The most devoutly religious character in the book must face the realization that his faith is sadly lacking. And the head demon, Legion (yes, the Legion from the Gospels, the one Jesus drives into the Gadarene swine), engages in grim theological discussions with some of the characters as he plays with their minds and souls like a cat would play with a mouse. Speaking as someone with a Master of Divinity degree, I found the theological depth of this book remarkable.Even this is not enough, though. Rogers has a remarkable skill with imagery, and reinforces the action and suspense with verbal pictures that stick in your mind: a detached face tied to a zombie's head with a shoestring; engines being devoured by metal-eating maggots; the sun rotting in the sky. And near the end of the book, we see a terrifying glimpse of Legion as he really is, one of the most frightening descriptions of a devil I have ever encountered-a creature of pure malice, and not at all human.Be warned that this book is very gruesome. Not only is it violent, but also Rogers, as I said before, describes the action in a way that will stick with you. This is a book that will enthrall you, frighten you, maybe even get you thinking. One thing it will not do is bore you."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I read it almost two years ago, and plan on reading it again. Mark E. Rogers has a wonderful imagination. I've read several of his other books, and can't believe some of the things he comes up with! The Dead left images in my head that will never be forgotten. I was seeing hands clawing out of the ground everywhere I looked for a long time after reading it.As for the grammer and spelling, who cares??? I read books for the content, not to spell check them."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"Rapture novels as a genre first got rolling in the 1830s. My own earliest exposure to this field of religious fantasy was the discovery, in the 1950s, of Sydney Watson's gloriously wacky \\"In The Twinkling Of An Eye,\\" penned in 1916. In it Watson's protagonist, a Jewish newspaper reporter, finds himself stranded on an Earth given over to satanic forces after its Christian population is \\"raptured\\" to heaven. Among the results of this radical regime change, aside from Bible burning and the extermination of rabbis in the newly reconstituted Israel, is an upswing in popularity of modern art, public nudity, jazz, and racial integration! Yow!Despite the campiness of Watson's early 20th century biases, the novel holds to its major horror: being left behind and unredeemed. You've had your chance; you didn't believe. You were wrong; you've blown it! No hope, Clyde: you're damned!Mark E. Rogers reopens these particular gates of hell in this Infinity reissue of his 1989 novel, \\"The Dead,\\" where his protagonists, the dysfunctional Holland family, face the same hopeless dilemma. The Dead is a truly horrifying reading experience as the world of the living is systematically overwhelmed by the walking dead, the minions of Satan's lieutenant, Legion. Rogers, an accomplished illustrator, brings his considerable skills to paint a believablepicture of apocalypse, a well constructed book you'll find hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"I was very impressed with The Dead by Mark E. Rogers. It is a great horror story, a great adventure story and has characters that you really care about. In one book, it accomplishes more than the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series does in several. It combines a backdrop of people who are not raptured away and throws in living dead that make George Romero's zombies look dull. We find out why these people were not taken away and what they can do about it. We also get terrifying living dead and some interesting philosophy, too. The book also has a sense of humor. It has everything. Buy it!"},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"I initially read this book when it came out 11 years ago and it scared me half to death. I read it again last month and it freaked me out even more! &quot;The Dead&quot; takes terror to a whole new level... Talk about having the writer &quot;inside your mind&quot;. It's as though Rogers finds your deepest fears and drags them into the light. THIS IS A MUST FOR ANY HORROR FAN!! Sleep with the lights on!"},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"From our review on The Fiendish Files of the Black Order ( http://www.blackorder.com )Back when I was a freshman in high school, I found Mark Rogers' The Dead on the paperback rack at the local newsstand. The rather colorful original cover caught my eye, and the title caught the attention of my lifelong fetish for the zombie menace. Like any good read, it should be shared with friends and at some point I lost track of my well worn copy. It was out of print for the better part of the '90s, but thankfully has been reissued (with a far better cover) by Infinity Publishing as of 2000.From the description on Amazon, \\"The Judge came like a thief in the night. No one knew that the world had ended---until the sun began to rot in the sky, and the graves opened, and angels from Hell clothed themselves in the flesh of corpses...Long out of print, this murderous theological fantasy presents an epic vision of damnation and redemption, supercharged with mayhem, terror, and old-time religion.\\"That sums it up to a degree - The Dead takes an entirely theological view of reanimated corpses, which is a refreshing change from the well trodden Trioxin derivitive stories. Since the cadavers in this tale are basically physical hosts for demonic energies, they are more like the neo-zombies of recent cinema - but given the date of original publication you can't say it's part of the current trend. These decayed antagonists also don't necessarily feel like feasting on your brains either - they're ferocious, mean, cunning, and downright homicidal... but I'm getting ahead of myself here.The story primarily revolves around two brothers, one athiest and the other a believer - in a fairly reserved manner. They come home to attend their father's funeral and shortly thereafter all hell breaks loose. There isn't too much build-up beforehand, but in this sort of story you needn't intimately know the characters through extensive pre-catalyst development - we'll leave that sort of bore to the Anne Rice crowd - the true salt of their being is shown to you via their actions as the story progresses.Don't get me wrong, you're not dumped right into the zombie onslaught right away. Things start falling apart slowly and gain momentum. From a sudden rash of coincidental mechanical failures such as planes crashing, or auto accidents - it seems like a lot of bad luck at first. It becomes clear through the eyes of the characters that things are going horribly wrong, and there's some sort of malicious planning behind it all. The Dead aren't just trying to kill the living, they're making more dead. Before long the numbers are exponentially against the living, and the sense of growing panic is readily apparent.Given that Amazon is one of the few reliable sources for ordering this book, you'll probably see some of the reviews posted there wherein people scoff at the religious threads in this story as if that is the dubious underlying message that Rogers is trying to sneak past you - but to be bent out of shape over an entirely interpretive aspect of the story seems silly. Being an athiest myself, I didn't find the points raised wherein athiests are alledgedly to blame for more violence historically than god fearing peoples troubling. Religious doctrine is to me like any work of fiction, to be enjoyed for entertainment value and not taken seriously, and this book is indeed quite entertaining.The Dead is still among my all time favorites even after the abysmal editing and typos found in the current issuing. Any fan of apocalyptic fiction should give this a read at least once - regardless of your interpretation of what \\"apocalyptic\\" might mean. After all, isn't every significant zombie story not one of the end of the world?"},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"The Dead, by Mark E. RogersAnother tired \\"the dead come back to life\\" story?Only if Star Wars was just another tired space movie.The Dead by Mark E. Rogers breathes new life (okay it's a pun, get over it) into the venerable walking dead genre. What HAD become an anemic, self-indulgent genre that has gradually decayed into little more than a never-ending series of pathetic vampire recyclings has suddenly sat up on the morgue gurney and is once again staring you straight in the eyes.This book is alive, and it wants you.I first read this book a few years ago and was stupid enough to loan my only copy to someone who never returned it. I went for years wanting to reread it, but couldn't until its recent republishing. I quickly scooped up a new copy and sat down just to get started. That was a mistake. Hours later I finally was able to put it down, surprised that it had managed to do that to me on a SECOND reading for God's sake.Let's say you wake up one morning and a lot of people are missing. Simply gone. Some of them were people you knew very well. Perhaps your own mother, or your wife. Just vanished. You've heard of that old Revelation thing, but no one ever really took that seriously, did they? That's not worth believing, is it? Then the dead show up, and maybe some of THEM are people you knew very well. Except these aren't your old, slow, stupid movie dead. These dead people are fast, intelligent, articulate, and [angry]. Even the military is having trouble with them. Can it get worse than that? Maybe. What if suddenly they had a LEADER?Some stories are able to get by solely on their plot premise, some on their characters, some on their action, some on their dialogue, some purely on the emotional or intellectual demand they manage to make on you. This is one of those rare stories that has all of that. It is one of the few stories I've read recently that I would honestly like to see show up on the screen. Most aren't worth that effort. This one is more than worth it.This book NEEDS to be a movie.If you pick up a copy of this book, take these two pieces of advice:1 - Don't start reading it until you have a lot of time to kill (yeah, I know, I did it again); you'll be amazed at what happens to you.2 - Don't loan it to anyone. Make them buy their own ... copy.--Dave in Maryland, USA"},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"So often a book has been labled a page turner or a must read which so often is hyperbole. Well guess what? This book is all that and a bag of chips! Those of us who are big fans of the horror genre, especially involving Satan and the undead, will not be dissapointed. In fact one should be warned that they may want to make sure they have plenty of time to read this book because, quite possibly, one might to attempt reading it in one sitting. It is that engaging!Mark Rogers takes the reader on a terrifying journey where Satan and his minions of undead stalk the earth in order to torment those not immediatley raptured into heaven on judgement day.Rogers handily paints vivid imagery in one's mind with his writing and even those of us not accustomed to the environs of the state of New Jersey can easily see in our mind the characters and locations that he describes. Rogers transports the reader into the thick of the battle.As far as rumors regarding the possibility of this work being turned into a motion picture, I am torn with that. If it comes to pass, I can only hope that the movie will be even minutely true to the spirit and imagery conveyed by Rogers in the book. Yes, its that good!With the depth of philisophical and theological questions stirred up by Rogers in The Dead I would even suggest this book could be a required reading in college level philosophy and theology classes."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"I happened to read this novel several years ago, and I remember being thunderstruck. Unfortunately I was unable to relocate it until recently, and thanks to Amazon.com, I was able to purchase it and read it once again.Mark Rogers builds solid characters in record time, to honestly care about what happens to the characters is a true sign of a talented author. The cover art is also a creation of the author!With the remake of \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" and George Romero's \\"Land of the Dead,\\" it is apparent that there is a thirst for \\"Zombie\\" fiction.

The you can harass me for recommending a book that gave you nightmares."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"The Dead is probably my favorite horror novel. The book describes a version of the Biblical Armageddon from the perspective of ordinary people trying to survive a series of horrific events. As in Stephen King's novelette The Mist (though with a very different type of crisis), the story begins with a normal-or mostly normal-world, and its tension steadily increases as the world disintegrates. As the characters struggle to avoid destruction, they also struggle to make sense of what is happening around them. They are not stupid, nor are they pietistic superheroes that always make the right choice. I particularly like the handling of the main villain, who is utterly ruthless and diabolically clever about the strategies that it uses to accomplish its goals. Also particularly good are a few grisly scenes of the dead in action and some of the details of how the world falls apart, which I won't spoil for you by listing here. As a minor criticism, the editing for the Buy Books printing could be better, but that didn't distract me (much) from a fine story, which I would recommend."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"Finally, a novel that brings together my two favorite subjects, philosophy and zombies! THE DEAD is definitely the most well-thought out and SCARY books I've ever read. You'll never look at New Jersey State Troopers the same way again!"},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"This is a hard book for me to review with only one or two paragraphs, so I apologize in advance for being long-winded.Simply put, this is a biblical end-of-the-world story, about the rapture, Judgment, and ordinary people being tempted between heaven and hell. There are believers and non-believers alike, trying to come to terms with the apocalypse around them, which consists of an untrammeled onslaught of the living dead. If you genetically engineered a chimeric clone from C.S. Lewis and George Romero, and hopped it up on amphetamines, it would probably try to write a book like this.I have to admit, my feelings about this book were mixed at first. While reading, I thought some of the characters seemed like simplistic archetypes, and some of the theological discussions appeared to be unfair brow-beatings between the primary characters and their feeble-minded antagonists. But as I read on, and especially when I reached the book's conclusion, I realized that much of what I took issue with was far from simple. In fact, it was necessary, clever, and even daring. So for me, this book was at its most-rewarding when I was finished and I could look back on everything that transpired.Fortunately, getting there wasn't a challenge because the story was very engrossing. It wasn't a typical horror story at all, and regardless of any problems I had, I just had to keep on reading, only to find out how it was going to end. (I guess, in book-review parlance, this means it's a &quot;page-turner&quot;.) All of my predictions of where the book was going turned out to be false, and it moved with a such a grisly momentum that I was compelled to keep reading, regardless of the fact that it was 2:30 a.m.At the same time, Rogers keeps the story accessible. He doesn't turn it into another by-the-numbers eschatological allegory, with the typical Book of Revelations checklist, and he doesn't burden the reader with gee-whiz &quot;scholarly&quot; topics like premillennialism and the tribulation, just to show off his big brain (much like I did just now, I suppose ... sorry). He sticks to the story and the characters and lets it work itself out.Admittedly, I didn't think this book was very scary, but I can go through most horror fiction unfazed. (Well, the last horror novel I can remember having any sort of effect on me was actually made fun of in this book.) So I have to admit that &quot;The Dead&quot; didn't turn my hair white or leave me jumping at every strange sound. But ... the concept behind the story was so effective, it haunted me and begged me to ponder my own personal fate under the same circumstances. That is: if I was a character in the book, how would I react? What would be my fate? What could I do -- what would I be able to do -- to get out of it? So, in that sense &quot;The Dead&quot; lingered in my head and weirded me out.&quot;The Dead&quot; isn't as solid as Rogers's fantasy works, and I think I'm getting spoiled by his illustrations, which this book doesn't have, alas. Even though I'm not a Christian myself, I still thought &quot;The Dead&quot; was a good read. Great imagery, relentless action, and Rogers's rampant, twisted creativity. I'll be candid: if you're a stubborn atheist, then you'll probably find this book to be a waste of time. However, if you're a Mark E. Rogers fan (and you want to see what he does when he takes a vacation from &quot;Samurai Cat&quot;), or if you're looking for a unique and smart mix of horror and theology (honestly, you haven't read anything like this before), then it's definitely worth checking out."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"I picked up this book due to the overwhelming positive reviews here. After reading I have to wonder if I bought the same book everyone else read. Scary? Hardly. There were times I couldn't keep my eyes open while reading it. Far too often the book fell into having various characters discuss theology (like, once a chapter) and it became rather tiresome after a while. This is the type of book where a horde of zombies will appear out of nowhere, attack a group of people who flee, then, as they pause to catch their breath, discuss whether the priest in the group has been true to his oath to serve God. Fortunately I didn't get the impression the author was trying to preach otherwise I never would have finished it.Bonus point for the concept, which was unique in zombie horror, but again, instead of discussing the events unfolding around them (like planes dropping from the sky, etc) the characters sit around discussing if God had turned his back on mankind.Furthermore, Infinity Publishing should be embarassed by this book's presentation. Riddled with typos and completely unformatted. It's almost as if they printed out the manuscript the author sent them on a dot matrix printer, then sent it off to the printing press without even looking at it. For a book costing $20 we deserve at least one go-over with a red pencil.If you really want to read a book that will keep you awake at night, pick up Jack Ketchum's The Girl Next Door. It will haunt you for years."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"Yes this is a Christian zombie story.

I like books in which I can relate to some of the characters. After reading about a third of the book, I wanted to kill them myself. The problem with the book is that it is too \\"preachy.\\" The author droned on and on about religious beliefs, biblical concepts, christianity, etc., which took away from the story. Or was it the story? It was really hard to tell. The book was a mystery to me from the beginning to end. What was it really about? The Rapture with zombies. Not a good mix. The only favorable parts of the book was the commando-style fighting of some of the characters and the zombies, but after a while even that became cliche."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"Story is quite gripping.

Mark Rogers does have the gift of writting, though - I just didn't like this story."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"I have never read a book quite this strange, but interesting as well. A cross between zombies and a dead army in an apocalypse. At least it kept you on your feet. A little slow here and there, but basically an entertaining book."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"I'll have to admit this is the first zombie book I've read, but it doesn't stick to normal walking dead type fiction. With a bizarre look into religion the genre will forever be changed in my eyes. If you're tired of the same old flesh eating zombies read this book. The descriptions paint vivid images of a fantastically demented hell on earth that leaves you yearning for more."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"It was a good book best I've read in a whileMakes you think if the people in this world are doing things the right way and not the way that is popular to man but the way GOD sees forth he is the beginning the middle and the end"},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"This book was a great read. It does start off slow but when it picked up I could not put it down. All the different conflicts both internal and external and all the different view points of the characters made for a very rich story. I recommend this to anybody who enjoys any type of zombie books."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"What's not to love about this book? It's the ed of the world and the zombies have taken over!It's been a long time since I have read a book thats kept me so completely engrossed as this one did. I think the author did a brilliant job of making the characters believable and i actually felt happy when a couple of them got what they had coming. (Steve)I didnt give this book 5 stars only because of the relationship between Gary and Linda. I think a little more time should have been spent creating more of a dynamic between them. I didnt get the feeling they loved each other, and the story would have been better had more emotion been put into that part.If you love a GOOD zombie story that will keep you on the edge of your seat, then this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"I picked this book up mainly on a whim and the author's name. I knew Mark Roger's work primarily as an artist from the \\"Samurai Cat\\" series. To say I was pleasantly surprised by this novel would be an understatement. The book's mythology is almost as engrossing as the characters. I would definitely put this novel among some of the best of the new breed of zombie fiction."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"very well written , and as most here agree , a truly frightening look at the undead ! will recommend that if you like this novel you should also check out brian keenes ; the rising , and city of the dead !"},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"As some have mentioned, some of the spelling, grammar, and spacing makes this book seem self-published. Also, the gripes about the long winded arguements over religion being far too numerous are definitely justified. I suffered through the first such instance, but couldn't help but roll my eyes when the theme kept popping back up.That said, this book is very entertaining. The drawings don't do justice to what my imagination was throwing out in some of these scenes... really terrifying stuff. The long discussions on religion do, at least, lead to something later, but they are still forced and don't really flow with the story. Even with its flaws, I read the book quickly and enjoyed the discomfort some of the scenes brought over me. Very different from most in this genre, and if you consider its age, it's hard not to appreciate this book."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"The Dead in this novel are torturing the living out of sheer envy. \\"The very fact that that were not sharing his pain was unendurable, worse than the pain itself.\\"Consider this state of mind when dealing with a minimum wage earner in a horrendous job who is probably looking up from his grill, mop, shovel, or cash register with the same point-of-view as Mark Rogers' damned souls (why aren't you suffering like I'm suffering).On a lighter note: Max and Gary must be human stand-ins for Samurai Cat and Shiro. Since that series ended it was good to see them, even in pontificating human form."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"This is a book that should be required stocking in all Gorror fans libraries. Non-stop action, outstanding description, writing that elevates you to third person viewing. I enjoy the visceral shock of all Zombie films as much as the next guy, however with THE DEAD the images from the Authors descriptions hit you in a way that celluloid cannot compare. The next time I get someone asking me to borrow a good Flick I am going to hand them THE DEAD and let them know to turn off the tube and turn on the lights.THIS IS A MUST READ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"Plenty of religious sermons....with plenty of flesh eating.Is it just me, or is that a strange combo?But it's a pretty good book...probably 3 and 1/2 stars.I thought the characters were fairly fleshed out and the action sequences were very well done.I'm a big fan of zombie fiction and if you are too...you won't want to miss THE DEAD.The only two minuses in this book are the excessive religious discussions and the typos.And I mean ALOT of typos...words running together, misspelling and so on.Plan on seeing a typo about every other page...if that sort of editing gets on your nerves, you might want to stay away from this one."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"About four months ago, my fianc&eacute; read me an excerpt of The Dead during one of our phone conversations, and knew I had to read it in its entirety. This is one of the most disturbingly beautiful books I have ever read. The gruesome descriptions of death and the dead were utterly appalling, but at the same time extremely fascinating. It's going to take me a while before I feel comfortable going anywhere near a cemetery."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"This is the point where I put this book down: About seventy pages in one the main characters, Max, first reigns down a history lesson on the head of his uncle that Edward Gibbon would envy, then proceeds to kick the crap out of no less than four guys with a series of kung-fu moves that Jean Claude Van Damme would envy. I was actually willing to live with the idea of a smug, super-intelligent butt-kicking philosopher, but no less than three pages after that Rogers has the nerve to try and talk a little smack to Stephen King, not even making fun of a book that deserves making fun of, like Desperation, but instead tries to make fun of It of all books. Word to the author: It's really not a good idea to poke fun at one of the most respected works of a great author, especially when your own book doesn't even begin to equal his in depth, creativity, or just sheer horror. The premise seems cool, a theological fantasy that takes biblical prophecy as literal rendering, but the cast of characters are simply a collection of stereotypes that don't even react like human beings. In an early section of the book, just after the tragic, and presumably painful, death of their father, Max and Gary's mother then goes missing. This horrible turn of events doesn't seem to affect anyone at all. She only gets mentioned in passing, like, \\"I sure hope she's okay.\\" or \\"Any word about Mom?\\" This kind of sloppy writing just doesn't cut it, especially for a book that is supposed to be about The End of the World. We should feel something for them, anything at all. Instead we are left with reactions that are ridiculous, at best, and inexplicable at worst. The book may have been saved if Rogers could muster just a little sympathy from this reader to his protagonist, but I can't identify with a kung-fu-butt-kicking history professor. I couldn't even bring myself to care whether he lives or dies,(unlike a book like It where so much of our investment is not tied up in premise, but in the lives of the characters) so why would I care whether a whole world populated with such stock-characters like this makes it out alive either?"},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"Hi. Taylor Kent, the Snarky Avenger here. I am a known zombie fanatic and I would like to say that The Dead by Mark E. Rogers is a must read for Zombie fans and for that matter fans of quality \\"End Times\\" novels.First off, this is a new and unique take on the way the world will end and on how Zombies will be a part of it. The story is very well written. The characters are interesting as is there struggle to understand the situation they find themselves in, the end of the world - literally, and there struggle to survive in a world now populated by the dead, commanded by demons generals from the depths of hell, and other nasty surprises.This book also contains the most interesting and coolest depiction of the Rapture of the Christian Church I have ever read. And it take a very interesting approach to how our world might end, much a engine that has run non-stop for a very long time finally running out of fuel.I highly recommend this book for loves of horror, zombies, and those looking for a different yet interesting take on the end of the world.So as I do on my podcast and blog (http://www.snarkyavenger.com), I am giving this book 5 out of 5 snark bites. A definite must read.Thanks,T"},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"_The Dead_ is not your typical end of the world horror story.Mark Rogers masterfully combines threads from theology, fantasy, and gothic horror to create a unique page turner.Honestly, it was not what I expected. I started reading Mark Roger's works with _The Nightmare of God_ and was assuming _The Dead_ was something along the same lines. While many of Mark Roger's other fictional works are set in a fantasy world, _The Dead_ takes place in the modern day on the eastern seaboard of the US.The story starts with a version of the \\"rapture\\" (where some of the faithful are spirited away in the final days to heaven before the trials to follow).The main draw for me in this book was that the protagonists seemed to be doing all the right things, and they were still challenged. So many mass market horror novels feature nearly mindless protagonists that the dim witted horror novel hero is cliched. You won't find any half-wit heroes in this book.The really frightening thing about _The Dead_ is that death is only the beginning of the horror. In most mainstream horror, death is one of the few escapes from the horror. In the _The Dead_ the last thing you want to do is die, because it translates into an eternity of suffering.Another neat feature of this book is the level of detail that the author included about the various shops, streets, and scenes. It is obvious that Mark Rogers knows the geography of the area where the story takes place inside and out.Just for point of reference, I did not notice typos, etc. They may have been there, but if there were mistakes present then they were not glaring enough for me to take a conscious note of them.I recommend you buy this book!"},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"To say it like so many other reviewers of this book: I couldn't put it down!I was given this book in college (years ago, at the University where the author's wife teaches, actually). I love sci-fi and fantasy, but this book goes beyond that, adding a spiritual dimension which is often lacking in \\"better\\" books. In addition, it's based in our own world (unlike most of his books) and really makes you question whether some of the biblical \\"end-times\\" stories are really so crazy after all. The blood and guts aspects seem to me to be an attempt by Rogers to make the book as real as possible on all fronts. At the end of the story, guns and muscle and clever thinking don't win the day, and the characters realize that they really have been part of the End of the World.Some of the reviewers complain about the proofreading for the book. I can only say that I have a copy of the original (non-Infinity) book, and there are no such problems with it.In short, if you are not put off by high levels of violence and want to see how the Christian worldview can indeed make for a viable story line, this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"This is one of Mark Rogers's best novels, and one of the best horror novels I've read. Rogers is a terrific writer, and the book (like other Rogers novels) is a masterful blend of hard-hitting action and genuinely insightful philosophical and religious reflection. Rogers has a real gift!"},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"The Bible prophecy of the end of days have come and our world is doomed. The Sun is dimming and it looks like it is rotting in the sky. The Rapture has happened taking the faithful to Heaven but leaving countless people behind. The unlucky souls who still remain on this dying earth are in store for something that even their worst nightmares couldn't have prepared them for. Satan and his fellow Demons have been unleashed from the bowels of Hell upon the earth where they are possessing the bodies of the Dead. The Fallen ones wander the streets in the rotting flesh of the dead seeking to destroy all of the unlucky ones that were left behind. A group of survivors led by two brothers journey though the streets of New Jersey hiding from the legions of Dead all the while trying to make sense of this world gone mad. As their numbers dwindle and the situation becomes more and more hopeless they will soon learn that their salvation is no longer in their hands.The old world is gone and The Dead have inherited the Earth.Ever so often I come across a story that is truly unforgettable. One that haunts me long after I am done reading it. One that makes me want to go back and reread it over and over again. One that I wish I had the talent and skill to write. The Dead is such a story. Over the years I have read this book of Mark Rogers four times and I get something new from it every reading. It has easily become one of my favorite books. The Dead is the ultimate Apocalyptic tale that will grab you by the throat on the first page and never let go. Mr. Rogers crafted a Zombie Classic that has become on of the classics of the Genre. I have read just about everything the genre has to offer and while I have really enjoyed some of the other titles only two books have stayed with me through the years. One is The Rising by Brian Keene and the other is The Dead. To me these two books are the standard bearers of Zombie genre. I long for the day another story grabs me the way these two did.To sum up I highly recommend The Dead to all Horror fiction fans. It is a classic that has stood the test of time. I can promise that if you give The Dead a chance you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"This book scared me death! I slept with the light on for a whole month after reading it. I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this book so much. It's a quick read but there's so much substance to it. The dead are possessed by some evil from the pits of Hell under the command of Legion a demon who plays the role of some dark messiah. The zombies are quick and intelligent not like George Romero's zombies. The zombies in this book don't attack the living out of a hunger to feed but out of deep maliciousness, and for purely sadistic purposes. They like to torture their prey before killing them and adding then adding them to their unholy, undead army. The end of the world scenerio very realistic and quite possible if you consider the underlying religious theme that sorta runs through the novel. The debate between an atheist who in the past murdered his ex-wife and buried her in a basement (his second wife was in on it to and was subsequently murdered by his zombie ex-wife) to be particularly humorous. It was a sense of &quot;poetic justice&quot; but it serves as sort of an injoke. Well I don't want to give away the whole story, but some of the survivors of the initial dead onslaught are so annoying that when a few of them are taken out, I couldn't help but smile a bit. It's a great book if you're into zombie movies. The zombies in this book are more like deadites from the Evil Dead Trilogy!"},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"This is not your typical Christian fiction book. I tried to read it in one sitting but had to finally go to bed in the wee hours this morning.I grabbed it as soon as I got up and started reading it with my first cup of coffee. This book has everything: zombies, demons, the rapture, believers, atheists, horror, and gore; lots and lots of gore. It definitely isn't for the squeamish. It's been a long time since a book grabbed me like this.After the rapture, demons possess the bodies of the dead and earth is transformed into hell. The living try to escape but are usually brought down by the dead. Nobody gets an easy death. They are usually tortured, bit, and finally strangled to death. After a certain length of time, they rise up to join the dead in chasing down other survivors. The group of people we follow are a mixed bunch. One is a priest, another aself proclaimed savedChristian, and the rest are atheists and those unsure as to what they believe. As they run from thousands of demons we get to see the changes they go through. Their lives are changed and they see a side of themselves that they never acknowledged before now.I was glued to the book until I finished it. Unlike another reader, I thought the ending was very good and worth the read. If typos and mistakes bother you, all I can say is get over it. I admit there are way too many mistakes but it has nothing to do with the story. This book is too good to miss."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"I initially read this book when it came out 11 years ago and it scared me half to death. I read it again last month and it freaked me out even more! &quot;The Dead&quot; takes terror to a whole new level... Talk about having the writer &quot;inside your mind&quot;. It's as though Rogers finds your deepest fears and drags them into the light. THIS IS A MUST FOR ANY HORROR FAN!! Sleep with the lights on!"},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"There's a fine line between writing that perfectly captures the raw, plainspoken beauty of a great b-movie, and writing that ends up capturing the unfortunate inanity of your average b-movie - The Dead is on the right side of that line. Intelligently conceived, and well executed, it manages to avoid most of the pitfalls that that haunt apocalyptic horror. The Christian version of the End of the World(tm) is always interesting, and in many ways this is a unique approach to it; if St. Augustine had written Night of the Living Dead, it would probably read something like this.It approaches the moral issues that the apocalypse inevitably involves in a somewhat heavy-handed way, but NOT with the irritating over-the-top prosyletizing of (for example) the Left Behind series. That is basically the one real weakness of the novel: while the events, the action, and the gore, are very much presented in a \\"realistic\\" fashion, the characters are archetypical rather than realistic, to the point that you could basically label each of them with a two-word capital-lettered descriptor by the time you finish the page in which they're introduced.That's something that it shares with most horror works, and if you're used to that type of type-casting, everything else about the work is brilliant. This edition does, unfortunately, suffer from some typographical and formatting errors, but they don't really interfere with understanding the text at any point.This is a solid look at the Christian apolcalypse, as rendered by an author who is very good at doing things that books almost NEVER do well - action-packed and gore-filled scenes that really come alive. I tend to inadvertently skim most action-writing because the sheer level of detail involved in presenting a clear picture inhibits the excitement and pace of what's happening; The Dead manages a brilliant balance. You can (you're almost forced to) visualize everything that's going on, but it never gets bogged down in the parry-riposte-la-dee-dah sort of detail that makes for crappy action.If you like zombies, or millenarian tales, then this is right up your alley, and shouldn't be missed. And honestly? The violence is graphic, but no moreso than the Old Testament, and it's not really lascivious or even full of foul language. This works both as a vicious horror genre work, and as a morality tale; Christians will most likely find it as satifying as angst-filled goth-kids."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"This book is much more than just a creepy horrer story. It all starts with a dream, God has given his final judgement. People are diasapearing into thin air, modern technology begins to fail, and the sun is growing cold. Non believers are faced with the fact that god may exist, and believers faced with gods existance and their own shortcomings. And throughout all this the dead are rising to claim the souls of those that are still alive and to create hell on earth. Fast paced and action packed this book is a great read that makes you think, and those of you who don't enjoy thinking you're in for a treat also the action is very very descriptive and exciteing. If you've never read anything by Mark Rogers you are in for a treat, for those who have you know what to expect."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"The Dead starts with a bang and hangs onto you like a zombie with its jaws set firmly in your neck hungering for not just your brains, but your immortal soul as well.This is no standard running away from lumbering, soporific corpses but a world that has gone mad in the grip of Legion and his rapidly growing whirlwind army of the undead bent on taking as many souls to Hell with them as they can in a spate of vengeful fury. This book not only provides you with the kick\\"butt\\" thrills and chills of a living dead/last-stand scenario but adds a hefty dose of well-thought out philosophy as well. Furious gun battles and a run for survival are interspersed amongst images of life and death debates with members of the living dead that are not soon to be forgotten. I will leave it to you to decide which of these moments provide the most harrowing moments in this novel.Written with a good eye for the New Jersey countryside and vivid images of a world that is rapidly dying (the metal maggots is one of my favorites!), The Dead will leave you with indelible visions of Earth and Man's last days as the survivors realize that the end of the world and Judgment is at hand.I read this in two days and immediately turned around and read it again for I found I had read it so rapidly and was so drawn into the excitement and fates of the characters that I had sped through some of the books most salient philosophical and theological points and wanted go back and savor those on their own. It is virtually like getting two books for the price of one. Mark Rogers has delivered The Screwtape Letters a la Peter Jackson at his most demented!This is an excellent example of the quintessential page-turner that is so often ballyhooed on book sites. This is the real thing!"},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"I've always been a huge horror fan, and am intensely happy when somebody gives it a rough, jolting twist and throws something in that I'm not expecting. The horror throughout book (IE - my idea of 'wacky hijinks') is a great deal of fun, and since I'm also a sucker for apocalyptic stories, I was practically salivating at the 'idea' of the horrific extinction of the human race throughout the book.The story presents a lot of very interesting theological ideas and arguments without being preachy about it, which is a definite bonus. It presents very good points without hammering them constantly into your squishy greymeat.The one thing that I'm most fond of with Mark's writing is that his good characters aren't entirely good. There is a great deal of shade to them, which keeps me from wanting to choke them because of possible overly paladin characteristics. Also, his evil characters are so viciously dark and bile filled that it's really a treat to get to know them. The quips and jibes that his characters trade back and forth always make me smile - if not laugh outright, and his depictions of violence and mayhem are absolutely dreamy.Go buy this book now or you will surely knock your head against that little part of the ceiling that juts out just far enough to crack it painfully as you go bounding downstairs for whatever nebulous reason.:: Rogue ::"},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"I first read the book The Dead, in the early 90's.I was still in high school and this kid beside me in study hall says to me.&quot;Hey man, you want to read something freaky?&quot;He knew I read Clive Barker, King and anything else I could get my hands on.He let me borrow it and that night.

So I ordered it for the library that I work for. I can't wait to read it again.Mark Rogers was a major influence on me as writer."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"This book was incredible! I couldn't put it down. I loved this book because it was not your typical brain-eating zombie book. In fact, these weren't your run of the mill zombies...they were angels from Hell assuming the bodies of corpses. No brain eating here...only torturing and murder for those left behind. The book had a great plot to it and a little bit of religeon and theology thrown in. This book could even make an atheist start to wonder. Read it and you'll see what I mean.Edit: For all you whiners out there who complained about the book, you obviously missed the point. If all you want is mindless brain munching zombies and all out gore, go read about that instead! This is just one artist's representation of what the apocolypse may be like. Just because you didn't like the direction of the book, that doesn't make it wrong or bad. If you didn't like the talk of religion, well that's an important part of the plot and you obviously didn't catch that either. If you want to expand your horizons and experience something different, this is a very good read. But if all you want is the stereotypical brain munching zombies with no real plot, this book isn't up your alley."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"Just finished \\"The Dead\\" from Mark E. Rogers. What a fantastic read! Plus the fact i'm a local Jersey Shore native and I recognized all of the places, roads, landmarks he mentioned in the book. The accuracy of the locale and such made it even better! The one thing i did not understand is that he changed the names of all the towns (i.e. Point pleasant ---> Bayside Point, Seaside Heights ---> Oceanview Heights, Barnegat Bay ----> Barrangaset bay etc etc)regardless of that minor minor complaint, maybe it's legality related who knows.. the story is an awesome awesome read for the end of days with a nice focus on Religion as the main source of the armageddon. The book is an excellent read for any permuted press fan, I would totally recommend this book even if you are Agnostic or perhaps Athiest this is still a fantastic read with a great story/setting."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"A friend of mine turned me on to this when I mentioned I was on a tear through zombie novels. He knew about it because a friend of his was instrumental in it getting printed for the second time. This book was first published a while back before the zombie craze and the \\"Left Behind\\" series. This is not a zombie novel on the classic sense. It's a heaven and hell end of the world the dead walk (and talk) novel. Far, far scarier than you average zombie novel. Being well armed doesn't necessarily do you much good in this scenario. I have ripped through at least 25 zombie novels in the last month or so and this is the only one that actually had me a bit scared. Scared in the sense \\"What could I possibly do to survive this\\" sense. Holding up in a safe place and blasting zombies is easy work compared to this story. I thought the book was very well written and has a lot of religious \\"debate\\" which is pleasant to read because the author is not trying to shove any beliefs down your throat.

A good buy."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"I have never written a review before, but I was so pleasantly surprised by this author that I feel compelled to let everyone else know what a great book this was.

When the people you knew are so angry at being dead that they hate you, and the people you loved will rip you apart because even being a walking corpse is better than being in hell?

If you're going to hell, being tortured to death is just the gentle beginning."},{"Title":"The Dead","review":"When I first picked up &quot;The Dead&quot; I was mainly expecting the normal run of the mill zombie story that I have read many times before but to my pleasant surprize &quot;The Dead&quot; is a totally unique and terrifying tale that you surely will not be able to put down.A must read for any fan of macabre."},{"Title":"Redeye - A Western","review":"It must be said at the outset that &quot;Redeye&quot; is not only slim but lightweight, and its storyline a fragile structure indeed. Having said that, I have nothing left but praise for this book. Edgerton deftly weaves together an adventurous present in 1892 Colorado, a tragic past from 1857, and a framing text from 1915, by which time historic sites and scenic grandeur have degenerated into new ways to separate the unwary tourist from his money. He draws his characters, from the sweet and naive to the most dastardly, with a light and loving touch. He knows and appreciates his setting, and can instill this appreciation in his readers. He has worthwhile things to say on important matters--multi-ethnic society, the role of archeology, the profit motive--but makes his points without being moralistic or pedantic. And, oh yes, the man can be very funny. Edgerton knows what he's about, and has the talent and humanity do it well. An evening with &quot;Redeye&quot; is time well spent."},{"Title":"Redeye - A Western","review":"I don't know what I was expecting after I heard the author talking about this on NPR.

We choose these books first over all the others in our bookcase."},{"Title":"Little Bear (An I can read book)","review":"Else Holmelund Minarik's classic \\"Little Bear\\" books first appeared in 1957 (along with illustrations by the inimitable Maurice Sendak), and they remain in print today because they are pretty much perfect in every way. Collected in this volume are three separate books: \\"Little Bear,\\" \\"Little Bear's Friend,\\" and \\"Little Bear's Visit.\\"My children are eight and five, but they still enjoy sitting down occasionally and revisiting Little Bear. Throughout the books, Little Bear's mother is presented as the all-knowing, all-loving, kindly parent figure (you can imagine how much any parent secretly enjoys that!). The illustrations perfectly complement the calm, simple tone taken by Minarik in her tales. They present Little Bear as the typical kid: by turns curious, goofy, sad, frustrated, content, sleepy, joyful. We see the illogic involved in so many of the rites of passage of childhood without ever feeling that Little Bear is being made fun of. No, this is a protected, dear, secure universe concocted magically by Minarik and Sendak, and it's a pleasure to visit it every time you open the book."},{"Title":"Little Bear (An I can read book)","review":"In this first book of the Little Bear series, we are introduced to our innocent hero.Our first story starts by Little Bear telling his mother that he wants something to put on that is fit for the cold. Mother Bear gives Little Bear a hat. But when our little protagonist goes outside, he's still cold. What can mother bear give her son now? A coat, of course. But,again,Little Bear is still cold. Finally Mother Bear gives Little Bear pants, but he's still cold. Then Little Bear asks for a final article of clothing-a fur coat, and after Mother Bear takes off all the clothes she has given him, he realizes he already has one.The other two stories-In my opinion-are just as heartwarming as the first. I found myself grinning after each of the three conclusions. Minarik's simple text and Sendak's classic drawings make this book the perfect introduction to one of the most loveable characters in children's book history. A must-have for any parent.R"},{"Title":"Little Bear (An I can read book)","review":"These four stories about Little Bear and his friends are a charming introduction to the world of reading for beginners. Little Bear is a sweet child to his mother and father and a good friend to Duck, Hen and Cat. Minarik's simple narrative will be easy enough for young readers, and Sendak's illustrations will hold their attention. The four stories are: What Will Little Bear Wear?, Birthday Soup, Little Bear Goes to the Moon and Little Bear's Wish.A soothing alternative to ninjas and power rangers."},{"Title":"Little Bear (An I can read book)","review":"The lovely and sweet stories easily capture the attention of my three-year old daughter (who has English as her second language). The stories are beautifully read out, with wonderful background music. Almost every night my daughter and I listen to several Little Bear stories before she goes to bed. We will often discuss the stories afterwards. This is the closest and most cherishable moment between us. The unfortunate thing is that she is most unwilling to turn off the cassette player, which somehow often delay her time for bed."},{"Title":"Little Bear (An I can read book)","review":"Love the text & the Sendak illustrations! So many texts try to teach manners by examples of bad manners. I'd much rather expose my 2-1/2 year-old son to books where the characters behave with sensitivity toward others. I remembered this from my childhood, and was not disappointed when I revisited it. For the same purpose, I also like A.A.Milne (Winnie the Pooh) and Jocelyn's \\"What do you say, dear\\" (which is more didatic, but the humorous tone & wild illustrations more than make up for it). Obviously, there's more to Little Bear (and the Winnie the Pooh stories) than sensitivity to others, but the mannerliness of the characters and the great illustrations are a big plus for me."},{"Title":"Little Bear (An I can read book)","review":"Little Bear is a book of four simple stories for beginning readers about Little Bear and his mother. In the first story, \\"What Will Little Bear Wear?,\\" Little Bear's mother helps him find something to wear to keep him warm outside in the snow. In \\"Birthday Soup,\\" Little Bear thinks his mother has forgotten his birthday and decides to make birthday soup for his friends. As they sit down to eat their soup, Mother Bear comes in with a birthday cake and tells him that she did not forget his birthday, and never will. \\"Little Bear Goes to the Moon,\\" features Little Bear going on a pretend trip to the moon wearing his new space helmet. Mother Bear has lunch waiting for him when he returns. In the last story, \\"Little Bear's Wish,\\" Mother Bear tells Little Bear a bedtime story about all of the adventures he has had, providing a nice culmination to the book.I would recommend this book for ages 3 through 7. Children this age will easily identify with Little Bear's adventures and emotions. They will also enjoy the personification of the animals in the book. In addition, children longing for security will be reassured by the portrayal of Mother Bear's love for Little Bear. This book would be appropriate for parents to read to their young children for enjoyment. Older children who are learning to read will also enjoy the short, simple stories. The simple illustrations throughout the book complement the text perfectly by highlighting Little Bear's adventures. In addition, Maurice Sendak has done an amazing job of expressing the love between Little Bear and his mother with his endearing drawings."},{"Title":"Little Bear (An I can read book)","review":"This and the entire Little Bear series are classics: wonderful, witty, warmly illustrated stories of caring that my daughter and I enjoyed reading over and over until she learned to read for herself with these I Can Read books.

I couldnt be stopped about this book. It holds a special place in my heart. I was first read this book by my father when I was a young lad. Later as time went we practiced a new word out of the story each night. The story is about a little bear who is growing up faster than he should in some cases. Having to deal with changing weather and getting dressed for that weather. Later in the book the little bear has a birthday. A heart warming story of the events that followed. They dont write books like these any more. Illustrated by the late great Maurice Sendak of the wild things book and writen by the late great Else Holmelund Minarik.

The simple language tells an affirming story that resonates, depicting nurturing parents and a safe and accepting community. Sendak's simple illustrations are well matched to the text.

As a result, this is a difficult text to approach without either a respectible background in medieval (particularily thirteenth and fourteenth century) scholastic thought, or an expert to guide you through.That said, the text is important if one wants to understand the thought of the fourteenth century. Ockham directly engages Scotus' theory of the simultaneous capacity for opposites as well as touching upon certain of Aquinas' doctrines relating to contingency and related Christian doctrines. Further, the translators have included texts related to the themes of this work from some of Ockham's other works.In short, this is a good text to add to a collection of medieval philosophy and theology, but not likely to be found engaging to the casual medievalist."},{"Title":"Lakeside Cottage","review":"Great book.

As was her last contemporary novel, The Ocean Between us, the setting is beautiful Seattle area and the military is again a part of the storyline in Lakeside Cottage.The pace perfect, winding in and out of the experiences at the lake with good dialogue and just the right amount of a lovely romance. Not bogged down with just one issue, this story offers situations such as the intrusion of media and the effect on society, labeling of children by school authorities, the alarming increase of diabetes in teenagers, managing single parenthood with grace and dignity when the heart is lonely. Foster parenting a teen. What drives one person to running and another down the path of hope. A young boy and the way he sees the world, the people in it and his relationship with them all is touching. You will want to jump in the lake with him and go for a bike ride with his dog too.I am choosing this for a bookclub read because I want to introduce more people to this writer who is a favorite of mine. Also though because there are so many important issues to discuss. This is a good story that leaves you thinking about your own life and how much effort you put into helping others and the responsibility people have to their own families and the larger human family we all operate around.

It is a story of generosity as a single mom easily opens her heart and home to a runaway teen. At the same time she is unwilling to open herself to the possibility of love from JD. There is also the story of how the media hounds unwilling persons and makes life miserable for them. It starts a bit strangely and makes the reader wonder where it is going--just stick with it. It all comes together in a happily ever after manner, but there is much in between. A great read and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Lakeside Cottage","review":"A very sweet romantic book, I would have given it a 5 but it really left me wanting more closure at the end.

Jordan doesn't expect to meet Kate or the feelings she provokes in him.Kate Livingston, fashion writer for the weekly Seattle News, is a single mother raising a son who has behavior problems, desperately in need of a father figure. When her brother moves, Aaron's behavior worsens. Missing one too many deadlines from attending one too many parent-teacher conferences, her boss at the paper fires her. Kate goes to the family cottage at the lake, deciding to stay the whole summer in order to figure out what to do with her future.She meets the attractive JD as he is rescuing a hurt racoon. Later, she finds out he's her neighbor. JD has no intention of getting involved with his neighbor, but finds himself being drawn to her and her son, enjoying hiking and bike riding with Aaron.Callie enters Kate's life when she's found staying in the house. A foster care runaway, Callie earns money by cleaning houses. She discovers JD's secret and promises not to tell anyone, although she feels he should tell Kate.Lakeside Cottage can best be described as \\"feel-good\\". I was touched when JD took Aaron under his wing. I loved how Kate and Aaronaccepted Callie into their lives. I enjoyed the building romance of JD and Kate, especially how hard he fought not to be romatically or sexually involved with her, while she wanted a summer fling. This is a greatbook that will keep youinterested frombeginning to end.TerezReviewed for Enchanted in Romance"},{"Title":"Lakeside Cottage","review":"Single mother and writer Kate Livingston and her little boy, Aaron, make their annual trek to the lakeside house that her family has owned for generations. This is supposed to be the first year they will spend alone in it, but that's not quite how it things go for them. An enigmatic stranger is their neighbor, and while J.D. is very attractive to Kate, she knows he is hiding something. They also take in an orphaned, teen-aged girl trying to reshape her life. If this little group can work through all their secrets and issues, they will have a patchwork family filled with love. Failure can only lead to heartache.*** This leisurely paced novel is filled with sweetness, ambling across the summer as the characters grow. Overcoming heartache and painfilled pasts really supercedes the romantic plot. How the press can completely disrupt lives is also a focus of the story. Somehow, like the family portrayed, all the elements mesh into a cohesive whole. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."},{"Title":"Lakeside Cottage","review":"This story had an interesting blend of drama, action and romance. I especially appreciated that the protagonists were in their late-30's and had mature ideas about responsibility towards family/children and about life's priorities, shaped by the experiences of their careers and other circumstances they've dealt with. It's admirable that the focus was on doing what was best for each of the children, and I was touched at the difference Kate made in Callie's life, and JD made in Aaron's. In the process, everyone's life was enriched and past wounds were able to heal."},{"Title":"Lakeside Cottage","review":"Jordan Donovan Harris is a Special Forces Medic. On Xmas Eve he sees a threat to the President and saves his life. To J.D. he was just doing his job but to the country he's an American hero. The fame that results from this is overwhelming and painful. An unauthorized movie, an ex-girlfriend's tell-all TV interviews, his estranged mother surfacing, stalkers and a woman who fakes a suicide attempt to get J.D. to rescue her. Reeling from the complete invasion of his privacy he borrows a friend's lake cottage, changes his appearance (he didn't have a mullet) and uses his nickname so he can have some peace.Kate Livingston is a single mother to a nine year old son. Having been fired from her job she also has come to her family vacation home to regroup.The first problem I had with this book is that it was at least 100 pages too long. It was filled with repetitive information on the nature aspects, details of making dinner, Kate's obsessive thoughts, etc.Second is with her son Aaron. Aaron has behavioral problems, misses having a father figure and is terrified of water. Kate does not have a TV. I can appreciate a parent not wanting a child to spend all their time watching mindless TV. However, there are a lot of educational programs on the Discovery, Learning and History channels, not to mention watching a particular show is sometimes part of a homework assignment. Aaron has difficulty already fitting in and his not being able to discuss a show or even an occasional tasteful cartoon with his friends just makes him that much more different. Kids can be cruel and they think he's strange.Which brings me to third, Kate is pushy. She goes to J.D.'s house, grills him, and asks him intrusive questions, snoops into a private file, then proceeds to tell him exactly what he should do with his life, even though he tells her it's none of her business. At this point she's spent a total of about ten minutes with the guy. Then she gets miffed with him & thinks, \\"He'd been rude to her just because she'd been nosy.\\" Ya think? The first time they have sex she waits until they're almost naked and then starts grilling him again!On the other hand, I enjoyed the characters of Callie, Aaron and J.D. & enjoy Susan Wigg's writing. One of my all time favorite books, of any author, is \\"The Ocean Between Us\\" which I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Lakeside Cottage","review":"I have never considered myself a fan of the romance genre, but that doesn't mean I have anything against romance novels per se. In fact, I read them almost voraciously during my teen years. Like every other genre, there are good writers and bad writers, good stories and clunkers.Susan Wiggs and Lakeside Cottage stand out as prime examples of quality on both counts. Wiggs' writing is solid, and the story is engaging. Romance is, of course, at the heart of the tale, but there is so much more going on here.Our heroine in this case is Kate Livingstone, a feature writer recently fired by her newspaper. As luck would have it, she has the chance to escape her troubles and figure out her future at her family's cottage. This is her first summer at the lake without her brother and his family, a fact that doesn't sit well at first with her troubled young son, Aaron.Two strangers enter the scene on the first day: runaway teen California \\"Callie\\" Evans and the reclusive JD Harris. Both have secrets. Both will change Kate and Aaron's summer--and ultimately their lives.Wiggs manages to avoid the overdone I-can't-stand-you-but-I-can't-resist-you form of romance in favour of a more natural approach. Kate and JD are a bit leery of each other at first--and both with good reason, given their romantic histories--but the conflict is underplayed.I found it refreshing to read a romance so grounded in reality--JD's secret notwithstanding. After all, it's not every woman who falls in love with a man who saved the life of the US President. (And, no, that's not a spoiler.) JD's subsequent status as a media celebrity drives his actions throughout the book.The subplot involving Callie is equally engaging. Her back story--including exposure to a twisted commune leader and too many years shuffled through foster care--comes to light slowly. We can feel empathy for all she's gone through. We also come to understand why she would choose to run away.Overall, Lakeside Cottage is a well-formed story with intriguing, believable characters. You won't find too many surprises, but you will find an enjoyable read. Wiggs has written a sweet tale that manages to convey positive messages without lapsing into sugary sentiment."},{"Title":"Lakeside Cottage","review":"I am a new fan of Susan Wiggs, after reading one of her books you want to read them all!

She writes about characters I want to get to know better, who live in places that come across to me as peaceful or beautiful, places that are far different from where I live in the city. In LAKESIDE COTTAGE, the story takes place along side Crescent Lake in the state of Washington on the Olympia Peninsula. It's a beautiful place, painted by Wiggs as an ideal spot for summer vacations and families.Every year, the Livingston's head out to their family cottage, which has been in the family for several generations. But this year is different. Only Kate and her pre-teen son Aaron are coming up this year, and Aaron isn't too thrilled. He sees it as a jail sentence, with no one to play with all summer long. Kate sees it as a getaway, to forget about her worries. She was a writer who had been let go from a job that she felt defined her, and now she didn't know what to do. She was barely making ends meet, but because of the rental properties in Seattle she inherited from her father, she was able to eke out a living and support herself and her son.The novel, however, starts with a bang. Special Forces Medical Sergeant Jordan Donovan Harris is one of many who are guarding the President of the United States as he visits patients at Walter Reed Medical Center. It happens so quickly that no one sees it coming, but Harris notices that the patient that the President is currently talking to, a man lying on a hospital bed, is not who everyone thinks he is. As the man on the bed throws out an explosive, Harris protects the President with his body, and before he knows it, Harris has lost consciousness.It is at the lake that Kate meets \\"JD\\" Harris, the man that has now become a celebrity to the world. Kate, who lives without a television set, does not recognize the disheveled looking man who appears to be more of a hippie than a military man. But JD is hiding from the world, and hopes that no one recognizes him. Only one person knows about him, and that's his best friend Sam, who also happens to be someone that goes way back in Kate's life. Kate's son is attracted to JD, as he is to any man that comes into Kate's life. Aaron is desperate to find a father, and she's learned that it's better not to break his heart by dating men who will eventually leave.While LAKESIDE COTTAGE is a love story between Kate and JD, it is also a story of a boy who desperately needs a father's guiding hand as he grows into adulthood. He's got a lot of issues, acts out often, and Kate doesn't know what to do with him half the time. As Aaron and JD bond, however, she notices a miracle is taking place. Aaron responds to JD's words, and for once, a man has not walked out of her life because she has a son.Another important story line centers on a teenage girl that Kate discovers on the first day at the lake, sleeping in their cottage. Her name is Callie, and she is one of the cleaning ladies for the summer. Kate learns that Callie is a runaway, but she doesn't want to return home and begs Kate for a place to stay while she works for her rent. Kate is touched by this girl and agrees. Callie soon becomes a regular member of the family, and she bonds with Kate and with Aaron. Callie also gets to know JD and learns his secret identity by accident. She promises not to tell a soul about this, a difficult thing to do for someone who could use the money a tabloid would pay her for this newsworthy information. In the meantime, she keeps dropping hints around Kate, pointing out whether someone could love another person if that person constantly lies to her. Callie wants JD to tell everyone the truth, as she does not understand why anyone could run from celebrity and being in the public eye.The various sub plots come together nicely, and the reader will get to know and love these characters. I was rooting for everyone to have a happy ending. I also felt the characters were well researched, including Callie's medical condition, which is later revealed in the story. All the main characters felt real to me, and I didn't want this book to end. LAKESIDE COTTAGE is another winner by Susan Wiggs, an author that is growing on me with each novel I read."},{"Title":"Lakeside Cottage","review":"I read this in just a few days and fell in love with all the characters. I can't say much without revealing the end but this story completely captivated me.Kate is a likeable person with a good kid and a big heart. Callie is just a scared young girl trying to do the right thing.JD is hot, lovable and a typical guy with no basis for dealing with his feelings. Somehow, they all mixed well and engrossed me in their lives. I hated for it to end, as I want to continue with these people's lives."},{"Title":"Lakeside Cottage","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Read it in one evening.

One area this book needs more of is parts compatiblity between models. Not all SKS parts are created equal, and some of the more dangerous examples cry out to be covered.

While it does not directly explain how to convert the weapon to full-automatic, it does...shall we say...point the reader in the required direction.Two, it provides a background history of the weapon's development and proliferation. It's not a magnum opus to be sure, but you get a clear picture of the need and how the SKS met the requirment, albeit for a short (very short) period of time. Mr. Simonov was a very good gunsmith, but, I fear, he was no Khalashnikov. I would have liked to see more detail, howveer. This tended to read like a first level internet search.Third, the book provides a means to identify the origin of an SKS in a reader's possession. It's not completely comprehensive or consistent; maybe perfect identification only happens on 'Antiques Roadshow.\\" In that I really cannot fault the authors in this aspect. After all, the folks building these weapons tended to be on the secretive side. It appears this is espeoically the case with Chinese made versions. The book advertised itself as having a section on Chinese factory markings published with the permission of a noted expert. While a number of such markings were presented, very few were annotated with any information about the manufacturing facilties. The end-result was that you have a list of plant codes and some guidance about whether or not the weapon in question was produced at a military plant or a strictly-for-export plant.But, at the risk of sounding overly negative, the volume has value.

The book describes the way of life in about 1900 and relates many of these tales, as well as some poems. However, his story is weaker concerning how the Islanders made their living (but does have graphic tales of seamanship in rowing and steering a curagh through very rough weather).

I give it a lower rating than most others based on this comparison."},{"Title":"The Aran Islands","review":"My dad was born there in the 1950's and i was named after it. not a bad place, not much to do but nice to visit. the book is informal but informative."},{"Title":"The Aran Islands","review":"People have often said to me that they find Synge's account of his time spent honing his Irish and collecting folklore on the Aran Islands to be one of the slowest and most boring reads they've ever encountered.

Synge's narration-- like time on Inishmaan-- moves slowly and steadily, washing over the reader if one will let it.Remember above all that this work is essentially a series of journal entries, meant to document the people Synge met, the conversations he had, the stories he heard, etc. Perhaps the book's greatest contribution to the world is as a document of a way of life no longer in existence. This book is also a document of the the Irish Literary Renaissance, and-- for its occassional pretensions-- should be ! considered as such. This text might also help to give greater understanding to any reading of Synge's plays, as he alleged that the story for such works as &quot;Playboy of the Western World&quot; were derived from tales he heard in the Arans."},{"Title":"The Aran Islands","review":"\\"The Aran Islands\\" is a delightful rendition of the experiences of J.

I have had the privilege of spending two weeks on Inish Mor, one 4 years ago and one in the summer of 2001. The difference between the two visits was enormous . . . where on the first visit I saw perhaps 5-6 cars a day on the little roads, now there are minibuses beetling along everywhere. The pony carts are strictly for the tourists. I missed the women setting up kiosks on the road, selling their beautifully made sweaters. At the same time, throughout the summer, the young people put on a nightly concert featuring traditional Irish music and dance -- and it is fantastic! So wonderful to see the beauty of the old traditions taking hold in the hearts of the young men and women.BUT ... what is quaint to the tourist translates into abject poverty for the native.

Synge's book about life on the desolate Aran Islands is a very well written look into a society that could only exist until that time, and in that place. The Aran Islands, a group of islands off the west coast of Ireland, were at the time almost completely cut off from the mainland, except via the 'hooker' and the skin covered 'curagh' that plays such a critical part both in life on the islands, and in the book. Life there was very hard and made the character of the prople very unique. The islands were, and are, one of the strongest 'Irish' speaking cultures, and the ability to find life in the midst of it all is profoundly apparent throughout the book, as is Synge's obvious appreciation of the simple life and simple beliefs found there (note the comparison he makes to the 'busy' and 'lost' world in Galway, merely across the bay).

William Butler Yeats suggested that Synge visit the island in order to learn Irish and become acquainted with traditional Irish culture as it had been preserved on the islands. Synge followed his suggestion, and made four lengthy trips to the islands. In this book, he recounts his experiences on the islands, together with some of the stories and poems that were recited to him there.The book is a unique collection of travelogue, journal, and research notebook. Synge describes his relationships with individuals on the islands, as well as some of the common traits and customs observable there. He tells us about harrowing sea passages that he took from island to island in small rowed boats, and records a number of folk-tales that were shared with him by island residents. Synge was to draw on all of this material in his later writing career, making the book quite interesting for those who enjoy his plays. The book also provides informative details of what daily life was like in this remote region at the time."},{"Title":"The Aran Islands","review":"The search for authentic experiences is regarded as an important theme in postmodernism. John Millington Synge's book demonstrates that this quest for authenticity has been an important part of cultural inquiry for a long time. This wonderful book was written almost one hundred years ago, but it reads like a contemporary ethnographic inquiry. He provides vivid descriptions of daily life and wonderful presentations of the folklore of the Aran Islands. The book is primarily descriptive, but there are interesting textures and conclusions throughout Synge's writing. I would recommend reading this book and then watching Flaherty's film \\"Man of Aran.\\" Follow up that visual feast with Stoney's \\"The Making of the Myth.\\" To complete your excursion, top things off with a reading of Synge's \\"Playboy of the Western World\\" and \\"Riders to the Sea,\\" two fine plays that he set on the Aran Islands. The stories, descriptions, and textures within Synge's book will become very clear when you're finished."},{"Title":"The Aran Islands","review":"Not only does this book describe a time long past but Synge has a deeper sense of the psychology of the inhabitants of the Aran Islands and how it differs with that of \\"civilized\\" people of the time. Anyone who is interested in this topic and enjoys this book would do well to read Twenty Years A-Growing by Maurice O'Sullivan, which is a personal account by Mr. O'Sullivan of his life on Ireland's Great Blasket Island and is a wonderful, lyrical read that shows alot of humor as well as love for the natural world around him."},{"Title":"The Aran Islands","review":"This book definitely starts slowly, and initially one may be put off by a sense that Synge is trying to adopt an appropriate voice and is uncertain where he fits in with the picture. Give it time, however, and both the description of the time and place, and finally Synge's place in it, become really interesting. He was young but also something of an invalid at the time, and the perspective varies movingly and thought-provokingly, from total outsider to partial insider, thanks to huge but under-stated effort on the part of Synge, driven by both a desparate urge to amount to something in his short life, and a wistful desire to partake of a &quot;normal&quot; life that would elude him."},{"Title":"The Aran Islands","review":"...at least the far western end, if you exclude Iceland, as is generally done. The Aran Islands are a chain of islands, composed of three principal ones, which are just off the western Irish coast, from Galway bay. I learned of this book from Tim Robinson's excellent accounts of the totality of life on these islands, in hisStones of Aran: LabyrinthandStones of Aran: Pilgrimage. Robinson published his accounts in 1986, based on his life on the islands, commencing in 1972. In both of Robinson's books, he references Synge's account of life on Aran around the turn of the century (nowadays, we need to specify that is the beginning of the 20th century). I made that proverbial mental note to read Synge, which I was finally able to fulfill, stumbling on this 1993 version in a used book store in nearby Santa Fe.Synge was enjoying \\"La Belle Epoque\\" in Paris, determined to be an authority on contemporary French literature when he met William Butler Yeats, who was from Ireland's west coast, near Sligo. Yeats urged him, essentially, to \\"get back to your roots,\\" with the ultimate Gallic experience being available as far away from Britain as possible. And these islands fit that specification. At the time, Britain was directly ruling Ireland.Robinson lived on the largest island in the chain, Aranmor. Synge sought out life on the middle island, Inishmann, under the idea that life there would be less \\"corrupted\\" by modern influences. There was no \\"steamer\\" service to this lesser island; transport was by a small rowboat, called a curagh. Picturesque in calm seas, but often perilous, as Synge recounts, in the stormy Atlantic. Synge states that life on Inishmann was the most primitive in Europe, and underscores that with a startling fact: there were no wheeled vehicles on any of the islands.Synge has an ethnographer's ear for native folk tales which he faithfully records, but does not particularly analyze. One of the longest concerns the killing of giants in order to win the hand of the daughter of the King. He also relates the story about a person who promises a \\"pound of flesh\\" as a debt, but does not mention that Shakespeare incorporated this into one of his most famous plays,The Merchant of Venice. Synge also carefully describes the clothing of these \\"natives.\\" He is less strong on the economic basis of the society, but does describe the process whereby kelp is collected, and iodine extracted. He also has a memorable section concerning when the landlords, via the police, evict various residents from their hovels for non-payment of the rents. He says: \\"The land is so poor that a field hardly produces more grain than is needed for seed the following year, so the rye-growing is carried on merely for the straw, which is used for thatching.\\"Synge anticipates Paul Goodman'sGrowing Up Absurdby 60 years: \\"It is likely that much of the intelligence and charm of these people is due to the absence of any division of labour, and to the correspondingly wide development of each individual, whose varied knowledge and skill necessitates a considerable activity of mind.\\" He also focuses on the language abilities of the residents, and even on these remote islands, English has largely penetrated. The descriptions of the natural world are sparser, but he can wax lyrical at times: \\"Looking back there was a golden haze behind the sharp edges of the rock, and a long wake from the sun, which was making jewels of the bubbling left by the oars.\\"Robinson is, by far, the polymath; his account is much longer and more comprehensive. If I was going to Aran (as I hope to do), and could read only one author, I'd choose Robinson. But Synge's account rings authentic; he also is a keen observer of the islands, more than 70 years before Robinson's arrival. Fortunately I've now been able to read both accounts; would recommend them both. Now all I have to do is get to Aran. 5-stars."},{"Title":"The Aran Islands","review":"J.M. Synge might have been one of the best Irish writers in history, but despite that fact and the fact that his subject, the life on the desolate Aran Islands, is a very interesting one, I cannot help but be bored by this book. The Aran Islands is a group of islands outside the west coast of Ireland, and the life there is very harsh. The sea, the wind, the lack of good soil... all this worked to make life here very hard and shaped the culture and the attitude of the individuals. Furthermore, the islands were almost totally cut off from the mainland at the time this book was written (now it's a popular tourist spot where you can visit &quot;Synge's cottage&quot;). Synge went to the Aran Islands five or six times during as many years, and wrote this book to &quot;express a life that never found expression before&quot; (Yeat's words). The life on these islands, far from the modern civilization that takes place only a few hours away on the Irish mainland, is indeed of interest. But nothing happens. In the whole book. It starts with Synge being on the Island, his first day there. It ends with Synge leaving the Islands for the last time. In between, all there is is the interesting description of the islanders' life, which could have been described better in another way, and Synge's mixed emotions of them. As a reader you get the visitor's view of the island, a visitor that wants so badly to be accepted at one time, the next minute, he thinks of them as primitive. It is worth reading because of the informative contains, however. And if you plan on visiting the islands, it's a must-read."},{"Title":"Visions for Change: Crime and Justice in the 21st Century (3rd Edition)","review":"As a Criminal Justice instructor who has reviewed this text (and almost had to use it) I cannot recommend this book. It portends to be a book about solutions, when in fact it essentially attacks every aspect of policing and the criminal justice system as it exists today, and the only solutions it provides are from the left to far left. There is no balance of opinion, no counter-point, and absolutely no effort on the part of the authors to inform students that they are in fact only getting one side of the issue. Far too often do I see this approach by liberal writers and educators: attempting to pass off their out of the mainstream ideas as fact. College is a marketplace of ideas, discussion, and debate. However, this book turns the debate into a one sided discussion on how awful and wholly without merit the current system is. I am not one as a CJ educator that believes we are to be cheerleaders for law enforcement. However, we do need to present the good with the bad, and this book would do nothing but discourage would-be law enforcement professionals. If the goal is to make such persons believe the profession they are about to enter into is completely corrupt and without merit, this is the \\"test\\" to use. If forced to use this book, I would suggest supplementing it with articles or texts that offer a counterpoint. That is, if you are interested in giving your students both sides of the issue - which I believe we as educators are charged to do, not just simply indoctrinate them with the opinions of those with whom you might agree. This book is nothing more than an attempt to indoctrinate, not foster intelligent debate and discussion on the topics contained therein. A candidate for zero stars, if that choice were available."},{"Title":"Visions for Change: Crime and Justice in the 21st Century (3rd Edition)","review":"The authors of this book are truely using this \\"text\\" as a platform to preach their ideals.

I did enjoy it and found it useful for certain populations, although I also have some concerns. The training advice isn't bad, but I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that it seems to be geared toward beginners or women who aren't \\"hard-core\\" fitness enthusiasts. I emphasize that the worthwhileness of this book depends on the exerciser's personal fitness goals. If you're looking for general health and fitness with some moderate shaping benefits, then go for it. As an NSCA Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist, I wouldn't personally use or recommend most of these exercises with my athletes or clients, except for squats, lunges and deadlifts (which can benefit anyone); then again, our goals are entirely different.My main concern is the diet portion of the book. The advice is sound, but the actual diet that Reno prescribes is atrocious. First the positive stuff: the food choices are good, six meals a day is good (keeps your metabolism revved), and the macronutrient ratio is good. Now for the negative: the calories are WAY too high for each meal and hence for each overall day. Day 2, for example, will provide approximately 2300 or more calories (other days aren't as bad). Unless you're an elite endurance athlete, you'll probably GAIN fat weight on this diet - not the kind of rounded butt most people are looking for. I also wonder where she gets her nutrient info from, because some of the stats given can't be right. Case in point: Oatmeal pancakes on p.97. She writes that it has 600 calories per serving (which is a huge amount for most women to eat for breakfast), but the entire recipe has about 680 calories, and the serving size isn't noted. To make the diet more suitable to most people's needs, I'd recommend cutting in half the portions of meals 2,4 and 6 (which are probably supposed to be snacks).Don't be fooled for an instant that the butts of the fitness models in the book are at all representative of the kind of butt the average woman will derive from Reno's advice. Remember that these women have exceptional genetics: that is why they are elite fitness and bodybuilding athletes. Plus I wouldn't doubt that some of them are juicers. I'd also bet the farm that none of them used the kind of soft-core program that Reno outlines. At any rate, normal women with normal genetics and a normal lifestyle (ie. diet/exercise habits) is quite unlikely to build a body-builder Bertha butt.Everyone is different (that's why we're called \\"individuals!\\"), so you really just have to find your own path. As I said, it's good if your goals are fairly modest, but watch the diet."},{"Title":"The Butt Book: How to Build a Non-Cellulite and Fat-Free Butt in 9 weeks","review":"The Butt Book is a good place to start if you want an introduction to exercises for your bottom and thighs. Like several of the other books on the market, it devotes a great deal of time, attention, and book space to diet and eating habits. That stuff seems like a no-brainer to me, and I was disappointed that Ms. Reno didn't include more exercises. If there is ever a revised edition, it would be nice if the exercises were photographs instead of drawings, and if they showed proper technique instead of just one phase of the exercises."},{"Title":"The Butt Book: How to Build a Non-Cellulite and Fat-Free Butt in 9 weeks","review":"Excellent!

(Who knew there's such thing as a \\"Wonder Butt Bra?\\") I read this book as part of my epic, global investigation into the growing cellulite epidemic! As you would expect, Reno focuses on weight training as the key to sculpting a cellulite-free tush. You're probably already familiar with most of the exercises she recommends. Squats, lunges, and hip thrusts are all pretty well known. She reveals an exercise called \\"prone hyperextensions\\" as the \\"well-kept butt-building secret.\\" It's the exercise that prompted her to write \\"pain is progress,\\" so proceed at your own risk (plus, it requires a special machine you'd have to find at your local gym).Several chapters of The Butt Book are devoted to an explanation of Reno's Eat Clean philosophy. She recommends the typical weight-training diet: low-fat, high protein, lots of complex carbs and between meal snacks. She advises that all dietary fat intake should be kept to a minimum since fat \\"is stored away by the body in case of future starvation situations,\\" a theory that endocrinologists have recently brought into doubt. But it was good to see her critique of the calories-in-calories-out theory of eating. As Reno explains, it's more the quality of calories that is important. For a more scientific explanation of why counting calories is useless, read Gary TaubesGood Calories, Bad Calories: Fats, Carbs, and the Controversial Science of Diet and Health (Vintage). If you can make it through that book, you'll never count another calorie again. Guaranteed.In spite of The Butt Book's subtitle, Reno doesn't say much about cellulite directly. In the Q&A; section at the back of the book, she does respond to a reader's question about dry brushing for cellulite reduction. I was really interested to see how she would respond to this one because I noticed a huge difference in my cellulite using this technique. She tells the reader that exfoliating the skin can't hurt, but the problem is much deeper, claiming that cellulite is caused by a junk-food diet and inactivity. I've never been into junk food and I've always been an active person, so this generic response didn't resonate with me.

I work out regularly and play full-contact sport, so the calorie allowance probably would have been ok for me, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone with quite a bit of weight to lose (though you do need to up your calorie intake in order to fuel your body for the exercises in the book).I genuinely don't think there's much in this book that couldn't be found in a fitness magazine article on working your glutes and legs.

You can do the same thing with this delightful book by Stephen Arno, which despite being nearly 40 years old, has many fine descriptions. The prints by Jane Gyer add immensely to this book, which is not terribly expensive.Arno mixes descriptions of the trees with discussions of their commercial uses, earlier uses by native Americans, and their role in the broader Sierra ecosystem. Writing at the time (1973) when the Park Service began to let lightning caused fires burn, this book is one of the first to explain to a popular audience the importance of fire to the life cycle of Sequoias and other pines. Only a small portion of the material is dated. Digger Pines, for example, are now called \\"Gray\\" Pines as the scientific community finally bowed to political correctness in the early 2000s.

It seems to be trying too much to be both a techniques book and a recipe book, but the two are intermingled in a way that makes it difficult to find information unless you go through the book one page at a time. While the index helps this a bit, it does make it difficult to get the \\"big picture\\" for many major topics.The coverage is also a bit uneven. Go elsewhere if you want significant detail on baking and pastry, for example. This has enough to get started, but it's primarily on cooking. On the other hand, despite the author's insistence that sauce-making is less complex than it was generations ago, the section in the book is huge and overly detailed in proportion to other techniques.However, by far the most annoying aspect of the book is the continuous, seemingly uninformed, health advice. Going into the details of Kamman's views on fats and cholesterol (which were dated even when this book was written) would be beyond the scope of a short review. Suffice it to say that on almost every other page, there is some note that seems to be intended to make one feel guilty or think twice about eating any significant source of something Kamman thinks is unhealthy. If she wants to write a \\"healthy\\" cookbook, by all means she should have done so. She could have explained that in the intro, tacitly altered the recipes to be low-fat or low-cholesterol or whatever, and that would be that.Instead, a reader is continuously presented with recipes or techniques and then essentially told not to eat them, except perhaps \\"on Sunday\\" or even \\"once per year.\\" No technique involving any significant amount of fat from any source or even a single whole egg for an entire recipe (cholesterol!!) gets through without a sentence or two telling you why you should feel guilty if you eat this. In some cases, seemingly arbitrarily, she makes a decision to *only* present a reduced fat/cholesterol/sodium/calorie/whatever recipe, while in other cases she includes ridiculously calorie-rich food with little comment (oodles of sugar doesn't seem to be much of a bugaboo for her, compared to the evil egg). In cases of a \\"healthier\\" recipe, she often tells you how good the older version was, but you're left unable to make it. Why?We have an obesity problem today, but no one I know who is obese got there by cooking rich recipes using complex traditional French culinary techniques. Kamman's audience is already much less likely to encounter health problems from unhealthy eating, simply because they are more likely to be cooking for themselves using better ingredients and less likely to be eating fast food and potato chips every day.In sum, her tone is patronizing, her knowledge of what is *actually* healthy ill-informed, and the result is leaving her readers in some cases ignorant of the traditional cooking techniques that she in general says she wants to present, just because of some temporary health fad. It wouldn't be so bad if she simply changed things to fit her version of \\"healthy,\\" but reading ridiculous health reminders every couple paragraphs is simply annoying and honestly spoils the text of the book for me."},{"Title":"The New Making of a Cook: The Art, Techniques, And Science Of Good Cooking","review":"This book is overwhelming but it is worth every penny I paid for it. First of all, although used, it was in excellent condition. Secondly, I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to use the book because it has recipes with ingredients not available in southern Mississippi. But, I found some helpful recipes to teach me. I should mention that I'm simultaneously reading James Beards' teaching cookbook."},{"Title":"The New Making of a Cook: The Art, Techniques, And Science Of Good Cooking","review":"This may be my favorite cookbook I own, if not it is in the top 5 (depends on my focus and needs at the moment). Making of a Cook is a cookbook that provides depth and understanding, which will improve how you view cooking and what you make. The depth around baking is one of the best explanations I have ever run across and now when I talk with professional bakers and start hinting that I understand the differences in water, grains, location, and many other minor elements that combined have a giant impact on the differences in baked goods using the same recipe and similar ingredients.The whole book, it is a good sized volume, was a great joy to read through and all the recipes in it have turned out well (I haven't tried baking anything from it as baking is not something of interest). This is a book I have recommended to friends who have the basics down and are looking to learn more and want more than just recipes and far more depth than most of the cooking shows on cable channels supposedly devoted to food and cooking."},{"Title":"The New Making of a Cook: The Art, Techniques, And Science Of Good Cooking","review":"\\"The New Making of a Cook: The Art, Techniques, And Science Of Good Cooking\\" is a book that should be on the shelf for use in every kitchen."},{"Title":"The New Making of a Cook: The Art, Techniques, And Science Of Good Cooking","review":"This is a much better book than the highly-touted book by Julia Child et al (which simply uses too much butter, fat or sugar, etc. to be suitable for today's life style). This book has very clear instructions and the results are yummy! This is my go-to book together with The Joy of Cooking."},{"Title":"The New Making of a Cook: The Art, Techniques, And Science Of Good Cooking","review":"Better then nearly most of the classes I have taken."},{"Title":"The New Making of a Cook: The Art, Techniques, And Science Of Good Cooking","review":"Its just not as instructional as it could be. It doesn't start at the beginning and it doesn't get you to the end. It mentions what the correct things are but not what those things mean in many places. I think this book is only good for people trying to be fancy restaurant cooks."},{"Title":"The New Making of a Cook: The Art, Techniques, And Science Of Good Cooking","review":"This invaluable reference spends most of it's time on the end table beside my recliner so I can read a page or two between commercials!

If you don't own it, buy it now!"},{"Title":"The New Making of a Cook: The Art, Techniques, And Science Of Good Cooking","review":"I remember watching Madeleine Kamman on television many years ago; she used heavy skillets and casseroles that spoke to me. Since then, I have always wanted one of her books. This one reminds me of her. It's passionate in a quietly serious way. She tells you why you don't like something that she knows you would if the food had been prepared properly. You believe her and you just want to try her recipe. The method and ingredients are so straitforward that you know she's right even before you taste. She tells you what wine or beverage pairs best with your meals, why your bead dough has disappointed you, and when to save an expensive ingredient for a special occasion. Lest you think her a snobby foreigner, she recommends good old Corningware pie plates for baking the truly all-American pie. Everyone can cook from this book--novice to pro, those who think cooking is drudgery to those who can't get enough of it."},{"Title":"The New Making of a Cook: The Art, Techniques, And Science Of Good Cooking","review":"When I was young and had the time to read 2 pages of instructions on how to scramble eggs, I read every word and took it to heart. I can remember my 25 year-old self scrambling eggs for several people in their 40's (I liked older men at the time) and hearing them joke about how they had never seen scrambled eggs take so long to cook. And I remember their astonished faces when they all said that these were the best scrambled eggs they had ever tasted in their lives. And I remember now, as I remembered then, Madeline's words \\"Eggs are mis-scrambled by the millions every morning in America.\\" I have followed her advice ever since, for scrambled eggs, for omelets, for pie crust, for clarified butter, for souffles. I totally understand pie crust, how the butter forms layers between the layers of moistened flour, that it is not good to add too much water, that I am creating the layers with my hand motion and I have been able to adapt what I learned from Madeline to the use of modern methods (food processor) because I truly understand what my goals are in creating a crust. I make a great pie.If you are not up for reading, and just want a recipe, this is not the cookbook for you. But if you really want to know why you are doing something and you want to nail the method, you can't beat \\"The Making of a Cook\\".I haven't read the new edition. I am sorry Madeline had to adapt her book to modern needs. I eat more healthfully now than I did in the 70's when Madeline told me to use 1 tablespoon of butter for each egg I scrambled (no wonder they were so good). But the woman knows of what she speaks. A great book for the serious cook."},{"Title":"The New Making of a Cook: The Art, Techniques, And Science Of Good Cooking","review":"Ms Kamman's book is an exhaustive tome to be sure. She covers nearly every aspect of European cooking and a few forays into other cuisines as well. You also have to appreciate the way her personality comes through. It's not hard to hear her voice guiding you in the kitchen.The recipes are generally clear and the ones I've tested work well.So why only 4 stars? Mainly it is the indexing. It is sometimes hard to navigate the book to find what you want. Unlike the Joy of Cooking which seems designed to be an immediate reference work, Making of a Cook takes more work to find what you're looking for.Also, there are some surprising ommissions for a book intended primarily for an American readership. There's virtually nothing on roasting a turkey other than one somewhat odd recipe, and some commentary following the discussion of roasting a chicken. There's considerable difference between roasting a 4 lb. bird and a 14 lb. one.But, the good stuff is definitely worth the investment of time. The explanations of why certain techniques matter and the recipes themselves make this a must have."},{"Title":"The New Making of a Cook: The Art, Techniques, And Science Of Good Cooking","review":"A true 'Cooking Book' (as opposed to a collection of recipes), this book has changed the way I cook. It helped me move beyond recreating recipes and along the road to becoming a much more accomplished cook. The style is informal, the content up to date, and the instructor is exceptional. It deserves a special place on the bookshelf of anyone who wants to become a better cook."},{"Title":"The New Making of a Cook: The Art, Techniques, And Science Of Good Cooking","review":"Quite the informative book on cooking, which is just what I need. It explains the science and techniques of cooking which is what I have been looking for for a very long time. Recommended to all who love the sweet pleasures of cooking!"},{"Title":"The New Making of a Cook: The Art, Techniques, And Science Of Good Cooking","review":"This is the best cooking resource I have used in the 25 years I have been cooking. For New Years I made Chateaubriand for six for the first time ever, and it was perfect. This book does not just give you recipes, but also gives you step by step instructions on preparation."},{"Title":"The New Making of a Cook: The Art, Techniques, And Science Of Good Cooking","review":"I so looked forward to receiving this book as I had read the reviews and flipped through a copy of another book \\"In Madeleine's Kitchen\\" at the library. In Madeleine's Kitchen was very authentic -The New Making of a Cook is not and I regret spending the money to purchase this book. I suspect that the original version may have been better but \\"new\\" in this case means changed.It appears that Ms. Kamman may have already spent too much time in the US and has fallen victim to the American belief that anything new, complicated is more important than taste and that quantity somehow is more important that quality. Too many ingredients are used when they should not be. I turn to her pork braised in milk as an example. This is a common technique in many cuisines. Never have I seen so many ingredients in a recipe - even the Cordon Bleu method uses a third of what Ms. Kamman does. I also cringe when I see that she has altered Chateaubriand with a new recipe that uses ginger. Some recipes never need reinvention because the original is outstanding. Why ruin an expensive cut of meat?Granted there are cuisines i.e Indian and Asian that combine many ingredients and Ms. Kamman has attempted to include these influences in her book. My opinion is that these cuisines should be left to the experts of those cuisines and that Ms. Kamman should have stuck to what she is expert in - the fine, traditional cuisine that she championed in her outstanding \\"In Madeleine's Kitchen\\" cookbook.Instead of inspiring me, the book has left me sceptical about and fearful of trying the sauce recipes - the opposite of what a good cooking manual should do."},{"Title":"The New Making of a Cook: The Art, Techniques, And Science Of Good Cooking","review":"\`The New Making of a Cook' by Madeleine Kamman is hands down the very best first cookbook for everyone from rank beginners to experienced amateurs who learned cooking at their mother's knee. If you do not own a copy of this book and are serious about cooking, stop reading this review now, go to the top of the page, and click on the button to add this to your shopping cart.No cookbook can do everything, but at over 1200 pages, this volume comes about as close as you can expect a good cookbook to cover every major important subject, including a healthy dose of material on nutrition, sanitation, ingredients, cooking with wine, cooking equipment, references, and the \`why' of cooking. And, Ms. Kamman gives us expert opinions on each and every subject. On every topic with which I typically evaluate a cookbook, this one gets between an A- and an A+, and it covers each and every one of those points.The weakest part of this book may be its title. Were you to browse cookbook titles without noticing the heft of this volume, you may mistake it for a memoir, such as Ms. Kamman's excellent \`When French Women Cook' which is a memoir with great recipes from all around France. In fact, it is a superb course in cooking, and it is, in fact, used as the textbook for many cooking schools. The books to which this volume should be compared are the Culinary Institute of America's \`The New Professional Chef', Wayne Gisslen's \`The Chef's Art' and Anne Willan's \`The Good Cook'. The first two of these are very reliable, but just a bit too much oriented to the professional. The last is excellent on technique, but leaves out just about every other subject covered by Kamman.While the material in this book is heavily based on modern and classical French cuisine and technique, it is not another book on French cooking. That is, it does not compete directly with rival Julia Child's \`Mastering the Art of French Cooking', which remains, in spite of Kamman's book, still the best source of training in French cuisine and recipes. The book also does not compete with that other great manual of French technique, Jacque Pepin's \`Complete Techniques', although these two books side by side virtually cover the entire range of good culinary instruction. One would need to go far to improve on a collection with these two books plus the \`Larousse Gastronomique'.Possibly the only weakness I found in this volume was the fact that the brief chapter on cooking with wine seemed to deal entirely with wines from France and California, plus the fortified wines of the Iberian peninsula (port and sherry). While I cannot fault the author too much for this short chapter in such a wide-ranging book, I did feel an important chance was missed.However, the author more than made it up to me in her truly remarkable and comprehensive bibliography. For the serious student of cookery, this feature alone was worth the price of admission. Kamman missed virtually no major author available to modern American customers of Amazon.com. Child, David, Olney, Hazan, Kennedy, Bayless, Beranbaum, Reinhart, Ducasse, Pepin, Claiborne and many others are all here. The only notable absence was Alan Davidson's three-volume reference on fish of the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Southeast Asia. One cannot even complain about the number of titles in French and Italian, as there are plenty of English language sources.This is virtually the only cookbook I can think of where it may pay you to start at the front and moving through the book, prepare as many different dishes as your finances and market will allow. It is that close to, for example, studying an excellent book on Chess, where each chapter covers an important part of the game, with gradually more difficult exercises.One of the things about the book which most appealed to my neo-primitive \`Whole Earth Catalogue' attitude was the fact that the book gave such good recipes for so many commonly available commercial products such as soft whipped butter and quick stocks.And, on the \`hard stuff', Mme. Kamman is uncompromising in her insistence on quality, as when she gives general rules for dealing with stocks. And yet, while she gives us the professional's take on stock making, she is quite well aware of the fact that the amateur will simply not make stock that often, and tells us how to handle things when we make stock two or three times a year.The very best perspective I gained from this book is the fact that French cooking, at least French cooking of the last 50 years is simply not about high fat content. Just the contrary is true. In fact, Ms. Kamman seems to have figured out the story of French women and fat long before the recent popular book on the subject came out earlier this year.Just one more comparison to place this book. While it has many hundreds of recipes, it is not like \`The Joy of Cooking' or any other \`1000 Recipe' collections. It gives great detailed treatises on all major culinary techniques important to the cooking of Western Europe, but it does not, for example, give us 15 different recipes for an omelet. It just gives us one of the very best essays on how to make a good omelet with a few pointers which even escaped Elizabeth David's excellent little treatise on the subject.If you can only afford a single cookbook, but you really need one, this should be the one. If you are embarking on cooking as a hobby, this should be your first!"},{"Title":"The New Making of a Cook: The Art, Techniques, And Science Of Good Cooking","review":"I took on the challenge of Madeleine's \\"A well-prepared coq au vin...\\" and the end result was well worth it. The flavor was pure heaven and I learned so much through the process. I am looking forward to taking on other challenges in her book - and I agree with many other reviewers that this book is like no other in terms of teaching technique, but at the same time a treasure of recipes. Inspiring, educational, satisfying."},{"Title":"The New Making of a Cook: The Art, Techniques, And Science Of Good Cooking","review":"Very imposing treatise on life! Everything and more that I hoped to ever learn. I just wish I had ten days to read the whole thing. No matter how I tried, I could not find the appeal of the book. It is a classic, but don't be surprised if it disappoints you. If so, pass it along to someone else. Invaluable but dry."},{"Title":"The New Making of a Cook: The Art, Techniques, And Science Of Good Cooking","review":"There are only half a dozen or so cookbooks that I trust implicitly and recommend without hesitation; this book is one of them, and is clearly king of the hill. That makes this cookbook the best ever written. Not until I re-read this second edition did I realize what a terrible cook I am. Now, when I wish to know how something should be done, this is the book I reach for. This is not a comprehensive collection of all common recipes you will ever need, so I do not always find the recipe I need here. Note that many 'standard' recipes are absent; recipes are chosen for training value. Upon reading this book, it is rather hard not to be inspired to go out and become a better cook, no matter what your skill level.The original version of this book was a terse, didactic affair. Her information was so impeccable, that it began to be used in cooking schools as a text. With this in mind, the author re-wrote the book, adding a mountain of educational information, making a real textbook suitable for use in professional cooking schools. It is the best of its type. This new version, at 1200 pages, is double the length of the original. You will find many clever things not found anywhere else, viz a still-frozen sorbet, and a trick to measure the Baume of a syrup without a saccharometer. Almost all recipes have a sidebar that recommends specific wines to serve with each recipe. It has the courage to regularly recommend beer instead of wine due to the strong flavors of the respective recipe.The chapter on eggs was excellent. The first 20 pages have more stuff on properly cooking eggs than all of my other cookbooks put together, and this includes a couple of professional ones. It gives you much info that can only be learned from experience as a breakfast cook (and stuff you certainly will not find in any cookbook I know of), e.g. an egg cooked en cocotte is not only easier for kitchen staff to make, but looks a heck of a lot better than a real poached egg on the plate. Several times in the egg chapter, the author sent me dashing into the kitchen to check out her info. Some of her info was very different, and even exactly opposite of how I was trained in various restaurant kitchens. Darn if she wasn't right every time. If you have some foodservice experience, check out her recipes for creme anglaise, bavarian cream, and folding order for foam-based cakes. This chapter also has what amounts to a souffle master class.The sauce chapter has special merit. Kamman offers a complete discourse about history, preparation techniques, and proper usage of classic sauces. Interestingly, she offers very few actual recipes; contrast this with a standard cooking textbook with dozens of recipes with the student's head swimming with mother and secondary sauces and remembering what ingredient turns what sauce into what other sauce. This is the only book that admits reality: sauce espagnol is too expensive to make in a restaurant, brown stock is of academic interest to culinary students only, and that in her own home, demi-glace was made exactly twice for special occasions. Note that her world of sauces starts almost exclusively with primary veal stock (you will need several pounds of veal breast to make this, and there are no alternatives or substitutes). The section on emulsified sauces is exemplary, and I wish more foodservice professionals would read it. With her production method for Bearnaise, there is no reason why even a modest restaurant cannot offer it on a routine basis.The respectful treatment of vegetables is exemplary, and demonstrates how these wonderful foodstuffs ought to be treated. Those who are in the habit of torturing their vegetables (this includes several famous TV chefs) will have an epiphany with Kamman's sensible and wonderful approach to vegetables. This is the only book I know of that has a comprehensive treatment of swimming fish and mentions the temp at which fish is properly cooked (140-165 F). The meat chapter is what amounts to a master class. The advice on adding salt and pepper to meat, oven temperatures, and pan juices is quite sensible. It shows how difficult it is to properly cook meat, and how tasty when properly prepared. Those who know soup only through the canned supermarket stuff or 'light and healthy' recipes in lifestyle magazines will discover a whole new world in Kamman's rather parochial attitude.The baking chapter has a clear-headed dissertation on flours. It explains in detail flour measurement, protein percentage, and the various flours she uses by name (most cookbooks do not mention specific brands but just refer to them elliptically; not Kamman). It insists that pate brisee be made up using fraisage. Atypically, she recommends against using removable bottom pie plates or tart pans (she is absolutely correct: anyone who has never used a white ceramic tart pan or glass pie pan has never enjoyed proper crisp, firm, flavorful, un-soggy pie or tart crust). The advice on hand kneading bread dough is absolutely correct (if your dough and technique are correct, kneading will take 10 minutes). Cakes get rather shortchanged.My main complaint is the lack of a proper table of contents. Some chapters are quite long and have good internal organization, but subsections are not listed in the TOC and you are left to pretty much thumbing through a 100+ page chapter or combing through the index with a magnifying glass.It has chapters: basics (100 pp,), egg (100 pp.), stock (150 pp.), sauce (100 pp.), vegetable (100 pp.), grain (125 pp.), meat (200 pp.), fruit (100 pp.), and baking (150 pp.). It has an impressive bibliography, so the culinary student can start to build a personal culinary library."},{"Title":"The New Making of a Cook: The Art, Techniques, And Science Of Good Cooking","review":"\`The New Making of a Cook' by Madeleine Kamman is hands down the very best first cookbook for everyone from rank beginners to experienced amateurs who learned cooking at their mother's knee.

How do you spend your time? If it is drinking a little too much wine and looking through cookbooks, this is the book for you. Kamman is a little self important, but she really loves to cook. Her love of food is infectuous and inspiring. I was bored with following cookbooks that telll you how to do things (any idiot can follow instructions). Kamman tells you WHY you need do things. I was looking for a book that would take me to the &quot;next step&quot; of cooking, and this is it. This book goes into a little too much detail, even for me. But I love it. I would rather have the information and not need it, than need the information and not have it. Please take notice that I am a little weird."},{"Title":"The New Making of a Cook: The Art, Techniques, And Science Of Good Cooking","review":"If you only want to buy one cookbook, you must buy this one. It's got absolutely everything you could ever want to know about cooking. The really great thing is that it goes from very simple to amazingly complex, so you don't necessarily have to jump straight into making a veloute sauce from scratch right away. You can sort of adjust for complexity. Also, I really like the wine recommendations that come alongside most of the recipes. They're dead on.It's a great book for the money. Just try comparing it to any of the other really exhaustive cookbooks out there."},{"Title":"The New Making of a Cook: The Art, Techniques, And Science Of Good Cooking","review":"Perhaps the best cooking guide I have read! The wealth of information on technique and cooking science is presented in such a manner that the book is easily readable cover-to-cover. Madeleine Kamman certainly has given as much importance to writing this volume as she gives to her cooking and in doing so, has produced an extraordinary teaching source. She introduces concepts of sauces by presenting a very insightful history of saucemaking citing such masters as Escoffier and Careme. The bibliography itself is worth a great deal as it presents numerous sources which can be used for further study. This is definitely a required book for anyone who is serious about cooking!"},{"Title":"The New Making of a Cook: The Art, Techniques, And Science Of Good Cooking","review":"This is the best transatlantic summary of French cooking since Julia Child's _Mastering the Art of French Cooking_. It goes a step beyond that book (and those like it) by providing exhaustive technical and historical information on the recipes and products, and the author's distinct opinions on cooking and eating. The new edition differs from the first one in many respects, including the elimination of pates (terrines only in this one) and the recipe for demi-glace (the real thing, not the fake stuff found in restaurants these days). She also adds new recipes to address contemporary tastes for Asian and Latin American flavors, but the core is still French. The cover depicts Kamman whisking a generous amount of butter (hooray!) into a sauce. Great reading too, and no glossy pics."},{"Title":"The New Making of a Cook: The Art, Techniques, And Science Of Good Cooking","review":"Recall how your college English teacher used to assign to you a incredibly thick, obtuse novel to read in a week?Mme Kamnan's book is, objectively, quite hefty.

Two days later, I finished the last page.This book is enchanting, informative, funny, insightful and, for the most part, scientifically accurate. I would unhesitatingly recommend it to anyone interested in the history, science or art of cooking. It's rather much like spending a long afternoon with a French housewife in Provence."},{"Title":"The New Making of a Cook: The Art, Techniques, And Science Of Good Cooking","review":"This is an essential book if you are a well-disciplined cook who loves to read, and to understand the hows &amp; whys of cooking.

Everything is explained well without being condescending. In addition, there are interesting anecdotes added with each technique description.

It describes things like why egg whites will be stiffer if whipped in a copper bowl. Very cool book."},{"Title":"Wild Arms: The Official Strategy Guide","review":"No maps of anything (overworld, dungeon, towns). No monster list, no trickster list, no list of items available in a given town or dungeon, no real strategies against defeating certain enemies. At one point, when you are in the final dungeon, the guide suddenly shifts to completing various side quests in Filgaia without ever telling you. If the reader is following the guide, they would have gotten lost. This guide looks to have been designed by an amateur who has never played a role playing game before, ever read a strategy guide, and has never written anything of value. Online guides, which come without cost, are much more informative than this."},{"Title":"Wild Arms: The Official Strategy Guide","review":"When it comes to the RPG genre, a strategy guide has high expectations. You want tons of maps and screenshots. You want several appendices to show you everything. You want every secret revealed. You want to make sure you have all the info you need to get through the good, the bad and the ugly in the game. Wild Arms is a unique game in and of itself. It's a shame, then, that the guide for Wild Arms is so... lifeless. There aren't very many ways to describe it aside from that. If one needs help with the game, the info is here (for the most part) but the guide really doesn't offer much of anything.The guide begins with a quick introduction before jumping into things. It starts withe character bios. Talking about our three main heroes, their tools and their forces. If these opening pages are to help us with anything, it is only to show the guide to be disorganized. The first few pages already give us a sense of this. But even then, what becomes apparent isn't actually the layout, but just how much info you expect the guide to lack as a whole.The basic strategies section is not going to be too particularly helpful either. It talks about leveling up, special items, saving and towns but it at no point in time really talks about the system of Wild Arms. Or going into any depth to the mechanics of the game. True, a guide doesn't necessarily NEED to do those things, but with a section called \\"Basic Strategies,\\" it's an odd thing to see there are strangely no strategies whatsoever to be found. Instead we get a brief description on what towns are. The guide does, however, provide a nice item index as well as a magic index in the front. This isn't so bad and has every item and spell listed, but the strengths of the guide more or less end there. The weapons and armor section is just a list. Nothing about stats or any kind of special properties. Just a list of everyone's different equips. Not particularly helpful in the slightest. Once we get beyond that all the introduction stuff is over with and we get to the walkthrough.In any RPG guide the walkthrough is usually the meat and bones of the guide. It is, after all, the place where most players will spend their time (aside from the secrets section perhaps). It is unusually odd to find that the walkthrough is incredibly bland. And that's saying a lot given that what preceeded it didn't offer much either. Every portion of the walkthrough is done by showing a screenshot with a caption. The walkthrough might help you out with some tips, but this is hardly enough to really satisfy anyone playing any JRPG really. The Screenshot with a large caption under it has never been a very sufficient way to produce and RPG guide. Put more simply, it's easier to talk about what the guide lacks rather than what it actually has.The first big thing is simple: There are no maps. To produce a strategy guide for an RPG, even in the late 90's without any maps whatsoever is a bit of a disappointment. Without the maps there is no ways to tell what items there are to find in a dungeon. There is also no way of telling just where to go should you (somehow) get lost. And the directions provided in the walkthrough are not really enough. Especially because most of the captions are quick one sentence moments that is mostly just there to provide commentary on what you are seeing rather than to tell you what you should be doing. There are spoilers afoot. The problem isn't that there are spoilers, however, it's that the guide simply spends a lot more time explaining to us what we're already seeing rather than helping to get from point A to point B. Along with the lack of maps there is no list of items you'll find in a dungeon and there is no list of enemies you'll find in the dungeon either. Again, these are two things an RPG guide book ought to have without question. Some way of knowing what items to find in a dungeon would've been nice. And even more nice might've been if we knew what enemies to expect and what some of their stats (like HP) might look like.The latter is especially daunting when facing bosses. You'll soon find the guide provides no boss strategies whatsoever and instead just provides commentary and jokes. I can take a good joke from a strategy guide, it just seems odd that there are so many jokes and pop culture references in places where there should be strategy! During the final boss, for instance, the only real strategy it says is: \\"Engage in the battle and fight with great vengeance and furious anger.\\" Ah, a Pulp Fiction reference in a video game strategy guide that tells me absolutely nothing about how to proceed with the battle. Even worse, you'll never know what to expect from the boss. And with no HP listings or weakness to tell you about, it's a wonder why you'd bother with the guide in any capacity at all. It's a quick way to learn virtually nothing about the game.The layout of the guide itself isn't even that good either. The guide doesn't really call out new areas, it just expects you to keep up with it. This makes for a heavily disorganized guide. If you close the book without marking a page, it's near impossible to find where you are because it never calls out the different areas to begin with. The walkthrough just keeps moving along. It's just not user friendly this way.The guide is also just barren on the whole. It's bad enough we have no maps and no items list or even any data on enemies and no boss strategies whatsoever, but we also really just don't get a lot of guidance. In part because, as mention earlier, the guide preoccupies itself with jokes and commentary more so than actual strategy. About the only time the guide provides a lot of substance is when it detailing puzzle solutions. Aside from that it more or less lets you go without telling you much. And while I can appreciate that the guide doesn't wish to hold the player's hand, it doesn't mean much when the alternative is no strategy at all. There's no world map or anything like that either. And the guide isn't willing to really point you in the direction you need to go most times. As I said, it's not like the guide sections off its walkthrough very well into different areas anyway.The inability to section off specific areas in the walkthrough most certainly causes problems when attempting to unearth secrets as well. The optional bosses and areas and secrets are certainly here... they're just mixed into the walkthrough. And thanks to how disorganized the walkthrough is, you simply won't be able to find all that stuff easily when you're actually ready for it. Because the walkthrough just doesn't call attention to it. It's just there.Aside from the items and such at the beginning of the guide, there are no further appendices. It's bad enough the enemies aren't called out in the walkthrough, but there's no adequate enemies list either.In the end there really isn't much the Wild Arms guide can really offer other than sentimental value for those who already have the game. As far as strategy guides go--especially for the genre the game it is designed for is in--you're just not getting a lot out of it. Some of the basic fundamentals of even just a run of the mill strategy guide aren't here. No maps. No info on enemies. No organization to the walkthrough. No item call outs or anything and no actual boss strategies makes one wonder why in the world you would ever consider such a guide. There's so much it simply doesn't have that a guide simply NEEDS."},{"Title":"Wild Arms: The Official Strategy Guide","review":"When I bought this,you had a choice between this one and the 'unauthorized' one.

If you like the game but would like to make it quicker, you could try Phase 10 Twist or just do the even/odd phases."},{"Title":"Phase 10: A Rummy Type Card Game With a Challenging and Exciting Twist","review":"This is a rummy-type game for nearly all ages. It is easy enough for the 8 year olds (it is rated 8+), but my college-age nieces and nephews love playing it, and it is the current \\"game night\\" choice for my adult friends. Because it works for a wide age range, it is a great game for families to play. You can play it with as few as two people but it is more fun and more competitive to play with a larger group.The cards come in suits of four different colors and numbered 1-12, with Wild and Skip cards. The game has 10 \\"phases\\" or \\"melds\\" (e.g. two sets of 3, a set of 3 and run of 4, run of 7, 7 cards of one color) and you need to complete them in order. If someone else goes out by getting rid of all his or her cards before you complete your current phase, you have to try again the next hand. When someone goes out, all the rest of the players have to count the points in their hands and add them to their scores. When you play with a larger group, it gets more difficult because it is more likely another person will go out before you have completed your phase and leave you with a handful of points.My friends and I enjoy playing it because it is not so simple as to be boring but not so complicated that we can't talk and snack while we are playing.I like this newer version of the cards because the Skip cards are now black and not in the colors of the four suits, thus eliminating the inevitable argument that they should be allowed in the phase of 7 cards of one color."},{"Title":"Phase 10: A Rummy Type Card Game With a Challenging and Exciting Twist","review":"Fun game, cards similar to Uno, but different rules - a bit more difficult.

We didn't want to go out because it was far too cold and nothing was open yet anyway. So someone asked if anyone in the room wanted to play a game of Phase 10. Everyone readily agreed to play the game. The rules were explained, the cards were dealt and four or five hours later we finally had a winner. The game is a lot of fun and the time goes by quickly. By the time we realized how long we had been sitting there playing it, nobody could really believe it.The girl who brought the game to the cabin said that it's more fun if you have a lot of people playing but it also takes longer to play it. It goes by quicker with less people.This was the first time that I had ever even heard of this game. After the rules were explained I was still a big confused as to how to play, but after the game had gotten started I caught on pretty quickly.This is a good rainy day game when you can't go outside. Or for one of those days when you're stuck at home with a few friends, your siblings and/or your parents and don't know what else to do. It'll definitely kill a few hours or so of boredom.I love games. I have a closet full of board games that I can't get hardly anyone to play with me.

Everyone starts on the first phase (these can be anything like getting two sets of three, four of the same suit, etc) and the first person to get the phase wins that round.

Once you've laid down your phase you're ready to discard your cards and move on to next phase. You can play for points or play to be the first one out.It's a good game to teach younger children sequences, and counting; and challenging enough to keep kids of ages interested.Since it's a card game, the durability isn't long lasting--depending upon how rough you are with cards.Easy to pick up, and entirely fun."},{"Title":"Phase 10: A Rummy Type Card Game With a Challenging and Exciting Twist","review":"A few years ago (I help with students at church) another leader brought a pack of these cards and suggested a few played.... I joined in and was hooked... So I purchased a pack of these cards for my game collection. I have had ages 8-88+ play this game and have never had anyone who didn't love it.Game Play:Phase 10 is sort of like Rummy backwards. Each player (2-6 players) are dealt 10 cards. You then lay the remaining cards face down in the middle and flip one card face up.On your turn you must pick a card up (either the one laying face up in the middle or one from the pile) and discard one face up in the middle (covering the previous face-up card).Your goal is to go through the 10 phases:(*As a note: a set is the same numbers (ie a set of 3 would be 4&4&4 or 8&8&8.... A run is a numerical order (ie a run of 4 would be 1&2&3&4 or 9&10&11&12)1. 2 sets of 32. 1 set of 3 & 1 run of 43. 1 set of 4 & 1 run of 44. 1 run of 75. 1 run of 86. 1 run of 97. 2 sets of 48. 7 cards of one color9. 1 set of 5 & 1 set of 210. 1 set of 5 & 1 set of 3The goal is to lay down your phase (phase out) and then get rid of the rest of your cards (go out) before anyone else.If you do not phase out you must continue the next round on the same phase you were on. (Ie if you don't phase out on phase 1, although everyone else is on phase 2 you are still on phase 1.)I can't rave about how much fun this game is... You can make house rules, keep points (1-9= 5 pts, 10-12= 10 pts, Skips= 15 pts, & Wilds=25 pts... person with the least amount of points in the end win), play a half game, etc...If I could own only one card game it would be Phase 10."},{"Title":"Phase 10: A Rummy Type Card Game With a Challenging and Exciting Twist","review":"We had the opportunity to spend a weekend camping with our daughter and son-in-law and three grandchildren.

It's simple, fun and a great way to spend time together. Each phase offers a new challenge which keeps it interesting. The real challenge is to get through every phase ahead of everyone else.

It's a good game that set the stage for this woman of 68 sitting down to play a new version of an old-fashioned, sociable card game, face-to-face with two 21-year-olds and also a 45-year old. This kind of game allows for banter, jokes, laughter, sharing, getting to know more about each other, and just plain, good old-fashioned fun !

There was only two of us playing and it was fun, but as I read other reviews I look forward to playing it with a larger group of people. I am going to buy my own deck and have it on hand around the house, and bring it on the family vacation over the holidays. The game has a combination of elements that will make it fun for everybody. It is essentially a great twist on the classic game of rummy. Learning the game is relatively quick, and you will see how it works after a few rounds. Once you've caught on, you will be coming up with your own additional \\"Phases\\" in no time!

His advice is sound, thorough, and easy-to-follow. He has you begin by testing your soil to see what it is missing, establishing your turf properly, fertilizing appropriately, fighting off weeds and disease, mowing properly with the right equipment, and solving problems.Once that grass is in place, he moves on to explain the art of adding patterns to the grass by using rollers with the mower to push the grass down. The color plates show many examples of this art form, which will intrigue you. If you are like me, you expected to see only geometric shapes using straight lines. Instead, you find gentle waves and delicate crossing patterns of all kinds.Having worked in my father's gardening business when I was a youngster, I wish I had known about establishing these patterns. It certainly would have helped to relieve the boredom of cutting the same yards in one of three patterns time after time.The directions are very helpful for how to deal with special problems, like temporary damage, making a mistake in the pattern, and repeating a pattern (you are encouraged to photograph your work to learn from what you have done).Picture Perfect also has a long list of resources you can access, especially from the Internet.Although the quality of the design and the printing are not as high as the contents deserve, the material is strong enough to carry the result to five star level. One does hope, however, that a future printing will create a version more like an art book to better feature the examples.After you finish becoming an expert on turf design, I suggest that you think about where else you can exercise your creativity in your yard. Have you considered sculpting shrubs like they do in the Disney theme parks? How about designing a sculpture garden? Do you have a Zen garden area yet?Create a better balance between the views in your yard and the thoughts in your mind. Let the reverbrations of inspiration take you to new heights of thought and harmony!"},{"Title":"Picture Perfect: Mowing Techniques for Lawns, Landscapes, and Sports","review":"Picture Perfect is the perfect book for anyone who loves their yard! It not only gives you simple advice to maintain your lawn, landscape, or athletic field in perfect condition, but it provides easy step-by-step instructions, with amazing color photographs, on how to mow eye-catching patterns that will leave your neighbors and colleagues scratching their heads asking &quot;how'd they do that&quot;. Mellor, Director of Grounds for the Boston Red Sox has become famous for his work, and has been featured on CBS, NBC, Fox Sports, and articles on his work have been published in several major newspapers inculding the Boston Herald, New York Times and Washington Post.Picture Perfect will show you how to mow the classic &quot;checkerboard&quot; and also arches, circles, diamonds and more. It will also show you the secret techniques of the pros for more advanced pattern-making -- using rollers and brushes.According to Bob Uecker, Milwaukee Brewers Broadcaster: &quot;Some artists use a canvas to create a work of art. David Mellor uses a baseball field. His patterns are so precise and imaginative, I call him the Rembrandt of groundskeeping. He's a cut above the rest&quot;From the Commissioner of Baseball, Bud Selig: &quot;I had the privilege of working with David Mellor for many years and he is one of the most resourceful and creative people in his field. His work is extraordinary and he is one of the finest young men I know&quot;"},{"Title":"Picture Perfect: Mowing Techniques for Lawns, Landscapes, and Sports","review":"One of the first things I notice about people's homes is the way the lawn is cut. Some might say, &quot;get a life,&quot; but to me the landscape design and lawn say a lot. From a psychological point of view, it says something about the people who live there, too! We have all seen lawns cut straight and perfect, every blade of grass precise, row after row - not much creativity there. We have also seen lawns cut haphazardly in every conceivable direction and length, a clump here and a clump there, as if the ride-on mower and its near-sighted rider short-circuited, jumped the fence and rode off into the sunset!If you know anyone who fits that description, buy them this astonishing book. It is amazing what can be created with a little patience, know-how and practice. Some designs are quite simple, others a little more complex, but they are very eye-catching. The book would be ideal for any yard or community with large greenspace. The larger the area, the more dramatic the design becomes. If you are zipping around on your trusty mower at home, just make sure you move the dog....before he has the most stylish haircut of the year!"},{"Title":"Picture Perfect: Mowing Techniques for Lawns, Landscapes, and Sports","review":"David Mellor shares his particular expertise with authority and in a straightforward way.

David Mellor's easy to follow guidelines on mowing make our lawn the prettiest in the neighborhood. Why do people scalp their lawns?This book is not just about pretty pictures. David Mellor tells us about the facinating history of lawns. He shows us how to establish good grass from the ground up beginning with soil testing and fertilization and culminating with how to apply a distinctive design.I am giving a copy of this book to my sixteen year-old nephew who started mowing lawns this summer.

I found this book to be extremely informative and helpful in achieving the ideal lawn. It is very user friendly and makes obtaining the perfect yard obtainable for everyone."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect: Mowing Techniques for Lawns, Landscapes, and Sports","review":"I wish I could recommend this book! I really do. You know when your 13-year old writes one of his/her first research papers and repeats him/herself in every other paragraph just to create \\"filler\\"? Well, that's exactly Mr. David R. Mellor's problem in his book, \\"Picture Perfect\\": he repeats himself over and over . . . and over again. Holy cow!What IS a sign of a good \\"how to\\" book? Well, to me it is its thoroughness: you want to have all the info on the subject in one guide, right? (Or certainly, as close to it as possible.) Well, \\"Picture Perfect\\" is NOT perfect -- far from it.There are many problems with the book. One, Mr. Mellor is a bad writer. His aforementioned repetition of many facts does not create an appreciation for diligence; it signifies a sense of belittlement and ineptitude. Furthermore, although his writing style is accessible for the most part, it is confusing at times during THE moments when it should be the most simple and easy to understand: in the chapter in which he describes how to actually make patterns, he is far too complicated in explaining a simple task . . . such as mowing parallel, adjacent lines in opposite directions! In the first few chapters, Mr. Mellor uses bullets and subchapters to enunciate clear and important points. Great! Yet when he finally gets to discussing the actual techniques of pattern making in Chapter 12, he lumps all points into one, making for a poor overview: the main points don't \\"stick\\" out. That's really too bad.Two, the book is poorly organized. The first half -- yeap, half! -- is dedicated to A-Z lawncare. Come on! All he had to do was to state that there are many other books out there on lawncare, point them out, and get into the heart of THE subject. (That should have taken one paragraph.) And although very important, lawncare is NOT the subject of this treatise, right? (My favorite is Scotts.) Why try to outdo a book like Scotts in a few chapters . . . when the Scotts book covers lawncare brilliantly?! Makes no sense to me whatsoever! This IS, after all, a book on mowing patterns, NOT lawncare. All that Mr. Mellor had to do was to, perhaps, write an opening chapter of HIS advice, findings and nuances on lawncare, all of us having learned some from personal experience over the years. But no, Mr. Mellor tries to reinvent the wheel. In addition, to use black & white photographs in a book published in the 21st century is embarrassing! (No, not all photographs are black & white. But . . . ) Let me get this straight: this book deals with the visual sense, right? So wouldn't you want to use color photographs?! Get real! Furthermore, the illustrations in the chapter on making patterns are not used effectively: all mowing passes could have actually been shown in ONE illustration instead of several, thus making the instructions more accessible. Also, Mr. Mellor tells you that with practice, you will get better. OK, let me get this straight? I am supposed to pay $38.70 to be told that with practice I will get better at doing something? We already know that! That's the whole point of a \\"how to\\" book: it is supposed to teach you a subject so that you will decrease the amount of time for you to get good at something, right? Good Lord! (Nope, we're not done yet.) At the very end of the book, Mr. Mellor writes about some of his personal experiences when he worked at Milwaukee's County Stadium, one of which involved the chasing off of seagulls from the field. Again, let me get this straight: you are supposed to pay $38.70 to learn how another human being . . . chased away seagulls?! Mr. Mellor, you are very audacious! I thought this book is about making patterns on lawns? And finally, here is the greatest downfall of the book. The book is 160 pages long, yet ONLY 32 pages actually deal with creating lawn patterns. And actually, I am being too generous: only Chapter 14 deals specifically with pattern instruction which is . . . 18 pages long! So let me get this straight? You are expected to pay $38.70 for a book which only gives you 18 pages on that subject? Are you kidding me?!Now, having made this last point, let's look at it from a different angle. What does the fact tell you that only 18 pages out of a 160-page book actually deal with the subject at hand? Well, it tells me that the subject matter is NOT all that complicated! Look, if you have, or even HAVE NOT, any gardening experience, but are practical and use common sense, you can create lawn patterns. Sure you can! It ain't that complicated as Mr. Mellor would lead you to believe. I was successful on my first try . . . and so will you.Holy cow! Mr. Mellor, you need to seriously consider writing a second edition of this book in which you leave out the opening half on lawncare (and leave that to others), use color photographs only, and devote MUCH more effort and time to the actual subject: lawn patterns.So, if you have ANY gardening savvy and do NOT need your hand held, then I highly recommend that you do NOT buy this expensive book. If you DO need to have your hand held, then buy this book . . . I guess."},{"Title":"Picture Perfect: Mowing Techniques for Lawns, Landscapes, and Sports","review":"The book is very small.

From the start, Gordon writes about raising the Racoon Roughs and their start in Georgia which carries the reader chronologically throughout various battles. His service to the Confederate cause is covered well from his early beginnings to his involvement with General Lee in the surrender at Apomattox. This book is an important tool for understanding the fairness and qualities of Gordon and his sympathies for the people involved in the Civil War be it North or South. His character in speaking about individuals involved is fair and truly demonstrates that he wasn't just another 'racist' that fought for the South which is typical of only today's modern society. It is a must read for those looking to get into the mind of a great Southern leader. I would have rated this book 5 stars if Gordon would have only covered his involvement in the Civil War instead of writing reports on battles he wasn't involved with, though shaped the outcome of the Civil War. It would have better in my opinion if the book didn't get into explaining other battles or problems which Gordon had not took part in since it didn't appear that those other situations affected him."},{"Title":"Reminiscences of the Civil War,","review":"I bought this book as I recently discovered General Gordon is my ancestor. Curious to learn all I could about this heralded man, I bought his authored book regarding the civil war. Although I thoroughly enjoyed this riveting personal account of the war from the Southern side, I found parts of it to be a little self agrandizing. However, we all of us, have memories that, with time, color our role a little better perhaps than actually happened, and I'm sure General Gordon's memory was no different. This does not in any way detract from his moral and ethical carriage, or his exemplory service to this country and the reunification process post war. But this book does not cover those years. I am now reading the biography of John Brown Gordon, which covers the civil war years, but goes beyond and into his political career. Of the two, I am finding the biography much more informative as to the life of my ancestor, but I am glad to have read this book first and highly recommend it any civil war buff, or those, like me, descended from this great man."},{"Title":"Reminiscences of the Civil War,","review":"This is an excellent book. Gordon may not be as well known as some Confederate Generals, Nevertheless, He was a very good officier and a gentlemen that can discuss the many complex issues with the Battles he was a part of.

Gordon was Georgia's greatest Confederate Hero.After the war, he led the KKK in Georgia and participated in one of the greatest stock market scandals of the Gilded Age.He also formed a triumvirate, along with Aleck Stephens and Joe Brown that dominated Georgia politics for more than a quarter century after \\"redemption.\\" And milked his image as the \\"plumed knight of Appomattox\\", who led the last charge of the Army of Northern Virginia.John B. Gordon, in short, was a piece of work. (Read C.Vann Woodward's description of him in TOM WATSON AGRARIAN REBEL.)Another of Gordon's postbellum achievements was as high priestof the cult of the \\"lost cause.\\" In codifying the \\"myth,\\" he was second only to Jubal Early. Like Early, he maintained that the war had not been about slavery at all, but states rights. Like Early, he would maintain that the South was not defeated but only overwhelmed but vastly superior numbers of men and material. Unlike Early, he downplayed the struggle between northern industrial capital and southern landed gentry and he gave the myth a conciliatory twist perfectly suited to the capital hungry \\"new south.\\" For decades he would dazzle memorial day audiences, with a speech arguing that *both* sides of the \\"war between the states\\" were right and *both* sides won( the North preserved the union and the South preserved \\"honor\\"). (Now *that's* conciliatory!)It is this mythmaking, that is in evidence in his wartime memoirs. His overwritten florid prosedescribes each calvary charge in romantic hyperbole with out a hint of gore attached to the proceeding. (It is just this sort of bunk that Sherman had in mind when he told cadets \\"war is not a gentlemen's game,war is hell.\\")As \\"myth\\" this book deserves five stars, as \\"history\\" two would be being generous--so I've split the difference.If one wants a real soldier's story told with out concern for the memories of marble men or a sense of decorum one would be better off with Edward Porter Alexander's FIGHTING FOR THE CONFEDERACY.If on the other hand wants to wallow in fantasies of \\"moonlight and magnolias\\" then, by all means, knock yourself out!"},{"Title":"Jesus of Nazareth: His Life, Times, and Teaching","review":"How can non-Christian monotheists, or atheists, appreciate the character of Jesus the Man? While this question may be considered as blasphemous by Christian believers, it is a pity that this schism should leave Jesus hidden behind theological curtains.In the troubled land of Israel under Roman rule, many a sect flourished. The Priesthood was corrupt, the Edomite kings of the Herod dynasty were cruel, and people seeked redemption in many different forms. Josephus and Philo of Alexandria both tell us of sects that flourished in this era, as do the findings in such archaeological sites as Qumran.Joseph Klausner took upon himslef the ungrateful task of describing in vivid lines and with great sympathy the character of Jesus of Nazareth. Ungrateful, since most Christians would reject the depiction of Jesus as (a perhaps extraordinary) flesh-and-bones. Ungrateful, since most religious Jews would detest the positive lines in which Klausner paints his \\"Reb Jesus\\", in whose name they were persecuted for almost two millenia.Jesus, in Klausner's pen, is a religious reformist, a man of great moral integrity, acting within the framework of the Jewish people. He is a man of simple (should I say simplistic?) and vivid visions, who is intimately acquainted with the agricultural lifestyle and nature, from which he draws many of his allegories.Despite the impossibility of the task, Klausner achieves a decent result. The book's main weakness is due to Klausner's weakness for a good story and for Romanticism. This is evident in the opening of the book, where Klausner describes in vivid colours the contemporary view of the Nazareth area and conjectures as to the character expected from someone who grew up in such a place. It is evident also in the conjectures he intertwines with the more historically-based facts.It makes for a good, interesting reading, although many Christians may find his point of departure disagreeable."},{"Title":"Jesus of Nazareth: His Life, Times, and Teaching","review":"Joseph Klausner (1874-1958) was a Jewish historian and professor of Hebrew Literature at Hebrew University. In 1922, he wrote (in the newly-revived language of Hebrew) this famous study of the life of Jesus.Rejecting the gospel attributed to John (\\"The Fourth Gospel is not a religio-historical but a religio-philosophical book\\"), he argues, \\"Jesus was born, lived and died in Israel and was a Jew in every respect.\\" He explains, \\"throughout the gospels there is not one item of ethical teaching which can not be paralleled either in the Old Testament, the Apocrypha, or in the Talmudic and Midrashic literature of the period near to the time of Jesus.\\"He rejects Jesus' reported involvement with the Essenes: \\"Jesus' object was not to form a community of solitaries, nor, as we shall see later, did he consistently practice monasticism and asceticism.\\" Concerning Jesus' reported healings, he says, \\"it is clear that many nervous cases and hysterical women were completely cured through Jesus' amazing, hypnotic personal influence.\\"Why did Jesus die? \\"Obsessed by his idea that he was the Messiah, Jesus meditated on the three methods by which, according to the current view, the Messiah would declare himself.... But there is but one way to reach such an end: rebellion against the Romans.\\" Thus, \\"He was delivered up to Pilate as a false Messiah, and as such he was crucified by Pilate.\\"And after Jesus' death? \\"There can be no question but that some of the ardent Galileans saw their lord and Messiah in a vision. That the vision was spiritual and not material is evident from the way Paul compares his own vision with those seen by Peter and James and the other apostles.\\"This book is absolutely essential reading for anyone intersted in the historical Jesus, Jewish-Christian dialogue, or similar subjects."},{"Title":"Jesus of Nazareth: His Life, Times, and Teaching","review":"This is a real research work, with the list of references, attacks at the opponents etc. It is difficult to read, but still very interesting. I haven't managed to read the whole thing, but the first half, which is mostly the discussion of the existing historical sources, is fascinating."},{"Title":"Jesus of Nazareth: His Life, Times, and Teaching","review":"Joseph Klausner's _Jesus of Nazareth_ is still the study to read. A previous reviewer notes that Christians may not appreciate a flesh and bones view of Jesus. That does not matter in the least and a confessional study of the Christian Jesus, the mythological Jesus, is practically worthless and the majority of the well-known authors' works fall into that category. We would know next to nothing about Jesus under Christian circumstances.The most important section of the book is Klausner's treatment of rabbinic sources that are misused and often misunderstood regarding subjects like Ben Pantere, Miriam Maggad'la the hairdresser and illegitimate birth, Bilaam, boiling in filth, and others regarding Jesus in the literature of Tannaim, Amoraim, and later. Klausner sorts through all these claims and shows where Jesus is truly referred to and where he is not. It is a much better argued and balanced than the recent _Jesus in the Talmud_ by Schafer whose goal is not what it should be.Some books are seen as dated and _Jesus of Nazareth_ certainly is not new. I am not new either, but not as old as the book. Perhaps you have noticed what one of my professors spoke of as the \\"dumbing down\\" that has taken place in education over recent decades. You may also recognize the sensationalism and marketing that seems to drive book sales too often. This is not such a book and comes from a time of careful scholarship for the sake of scholarship. Old school? Absolutely.Before reading current work on the historical Jesus, I invite you check two older studies in the order listed then Klausner before the new stuff. You'll often read dedications and introductions which mention the giants whose shoulders the author stands. These are the giant shoulders, Reimarus (in _Fragments_), Wrede, Schweitzer (Quest of the Historical Jesus_), Klausner in historical Jesus studies over 200 years."},{"Title":"The life of Ramakrishna (His Ramakrishna the man-gods and the universal gospel of Vivekananda)","review":"Romain Rolland (1866- 1944) was a Frenchman, humanist, Nobel Prize winner in 1915 for Literature and sometimes pacifist whose heroes were R. Tagore and the famous Gandhi. Fat chance he could persuade Joseph Stalin to waive the death penalty, but he tried. Herman Hesse dedicated Siddhartha to Romain Rolland.In 1929 Rolland wrote Life of Ramakrishna with the cooperation of the Ramakrishna Mission. His impeccable sources were the memoirs of Swami Shivananda (head of the Order), \\"M\\", memoirs of Sister Christine, Josephine MacLeod, Swami Ashokananda and others. The book was written for Western readers and the publisher (Advaita Ashrama) acknowledges the views and interpretations are sometimes different from the Ramakrishna Order.Modern readers may find the flowery language harmless or annoying. Rolland was a big name writer who was building up Sri Ramakrishna, the author's mission \\"the voice of a legend.\\" European references abound such as Hercules, Leonardo Da Vinci, St. Paul, Beethoven, Balzac and Flaubert. A lot of attention is paid to Keshab Chundra Sen, the Brahmo Samaj and their relationship with Sri Ramakrishna. The nature of this relationship is a point of contention (pp. 152, 288). The main criticism, however, is a lack of balance (we now know more about Sri Ramakrishna) and not appreciating Sri Ramakrishna from a purely Indian point of view. That aside, the author's sincerity and spirit is strong, even in English translation, with the book still in print after 80 years."},{"Title":"History and Genealogy of Peter Bert to 1987","review":"Excellent and thorough genealogy source for Peter Bert's descendants.

It has a great cast of characters and probably my favorite villain of any Jacques novel. The story, while not extraordinarily unique by Redwall standards, was robust and very enjoyable, not yet having fallen into the formulaic pattern noticeable in some of Jacques' later novels.I was never much into audiobooks, but after being gifted the original Redwall audiobook and falling in love with the superb voice acting and narration, I wanted more. Salamandastron did not live up to the expectations that Redwall had given me. Redwall was narrated by Brian Jacques, and the main character was played by his son. Many of the other characters had well-known and very skilled actors. Salamandastron is not so much this way: many of the main characters, such as Ferahgo, Thrugg and Pikkle, have downright irritating voice actors (especially Pikkle). Many others, like Mara and Urthstripe, simply lacked the emotion and resolve in their voices that I'd expect from the characters. Some voices did stand out as being exceptional, such as Klitch, but the \\"exceptional\\" actors in this audiobook were few and far between. It's not bad overall, but if you're looking to buy this book after listening to Redwall, you are likely to be somewhat disappointed."},{"Title":"Salamandastron","review":"Another huge hit in the Redwall series. I believe that Brian Jacques has really combined the two main parts of Redwall books in this one:Quests and Major Battles (or wars). I would recommend this book to any Redwall fan."},{"Title":"Salamandastron","review":"Salamandastron was the mos powerfull book ever written i recomend it to anyone please read salamanstron"},{"Title":"Salamandastron","review":"The tale of salamandastron is a simple one. An evil weasel warlord wishes to gain power and wealth by conquering the legendary stronghold Salamandastron. Mixed in some returning friends new allies some traveling and you have the basic idea of the story. The writing is not excellent but the whole idea of this world on which the dominating creatures are animals is very intruiging. Brian Jacques weaves a very good story for young children. While one of the main faults of the story is that it is predictable. It is incredibly similar to so many of the other books in the series. So much time is spent talking about food and other smaller matters. But it remains fun. The only other fault is that characters are either good or evil. It is a monochrome world. Black and white good and evil. There seems to be no gray area as there truely would be. But for an enjoyable book. This is definatly one to read."},{"Title":"Yellow Woman and a Beauty of the Spirit","review":"Silko's collection of essays present an open, expansive view of her mind and art, her background and destiny. If you've read any of her other works, reading this short book will enrich your appreciation as well as assist you on the next step of your journey. If you haven't read any Silko yet, this is a gentle way to ease you into her writings.I read it for the background that she gives about storytelling and the narrative process; for wonderful sentences like this: &quot;The storyteller did not just tell the stories, they would in their way act them out. The storyteller would imitate voices for vast dialogues between the various figures of the story. So we sometimes say the moment is alive again within us, within our imagination and our memory, as we listen.&quot;I read it for the wisdom of the old ways of the old-time people; like this: &quot;...time was round--like a tortilla; time had specific moments and specific locations, so that the beloved ancestors who had passed on were not annihilated by death, but only relocated to the place called the Cliff House. At Cliff House, people continued as they had always been, although only spirits and not living humans can travel freely over this tortilla of time. All times go on existing side by side for all eternity. No moment is lost or destroyed. There are no future times or past times; there are 'always all' [her emphasis] the times, which differ slightly, as the locations on the tortilla differ slightly. The past and the future are the same because they exist only in the present of our imaginations....&quot; and she continues, but, isn't that powerful? As well as good writing?I also enjoyed reading of her political activism and her position on many issues of the west and Native-Americans.For me, highly recommended. Can't you tell?"},{"Title":"Yellow Woman and a Beauty of the Spirit","review":"I was extremely surprised to find this collection of essays not reviewed here. The title essay alone, &quot;Yellow Woman and a Beauty of the spirit,&quot; carries more weight than most books in total, given the revelatory descriptions of traditional Laguna Pueblo culture.Also, Silko's essay &quot;The Border Patrol State&quot; and other notes on border militarism and race related discrimination are important and timely, and increasingly relevant."},{"Title":"Yellow Woman and a Beauty of the Spirit","review":"The essay, \\"Language and Literature from a Pueblo Indian Perspective\\" is one of the greatest cultural bridges ever constructed between the Euro-American, linear mind and that of the Native American. I've read and taught that essay many times and each time I go over it, I find another point that merits reflection. Consider, for example, the story about the little girl who drowns herself with that of a typical fairy tale. First of all, unlike the fairy tale, but pretty true to life, there is no happy ending. There are days that all our best efforts turn into snakes, children do commit suicide on the false belief that their mothers/families have rejected them, and if, as I believe, this story illustrates how stories fulfill the purpose of bringing people together, (the death of a child, particularly if the parent is the indirect cause through lapse of judgemnt, is the greatest grief to bear, and knowing that others have also experienced it does give the strength to go on living), it does so on more than a superfical level. The essay itself illustrates non-linear thinking as it does not go from point A to B to C, but starts at C and radiates out from that focal point, \\"like a spider's web.\\" For those who want a true and accurate insight as to Pueblo thought and experience, this book is one of the best. It also helps that Leslie Marmon Silko is a master writer."},{"Title":"Yellow Woman and a Beauty of the Spirit","review":"The quality varies in this collection of essays, newspaper/magazine commentaries and other textual fragments. Also, because they often touch on similar topics, the book is a bit repetitive at places - especially in the case of \\"Fences Against Freedom\\" and \\"The Border Patrol State,\\" which contain a number of identical passages. Even so, it is in these two pieces in particular that Silko provides some of her sharpest insights and most damning criticism of official U.S. policy toward Mexico and toward its own citizens living in the Southwest. Also interesting are Silko's observations on the concepts of collective memory and consciousness contained in the complex system of oral narratives among her own Laguna Pueblo nation. Although none of the contributions in this book are in-depth studies, taken together they all offer a great deal of food for thought."},{"Title":"Yellow Woman and a Beauty of the Spirit","review":"This book is a book of short stories in which some connect and others do not. My favorite story in this collection is \\"Yellow Woman and a Beauty of the Spirit\\". In this story Silko tells of helping her grandmother in her garden while her grandmother tells her stories from the Pueblo people's mythology and folklore. Silko tells us in this particular story that \\"Many worlds may coexist here\\". It's a beautiful prose piece that will stick with you after you have left it.There are other memorable stories in this collection also. \\"Notes on the Almanac of the Dead\\" is quite interesting and as I have just recently started reading that novel, I found it especially intriguing. It tells of prophecies made 1,000s of years ago by tribal leaders about the future, i.e., the invasion of the white man, his technology, his downfall. Very, very interesting little story!\\"Interior and Exterior Landscapes\\" is another interesting story which describes in detail the beauty of the New Mexico landscape. Then Silko goes on to talk about landscape as a character in a piece of fiction, which I found to be very compelling.This is a really good book and if you have not otherwise read Silko a great introduction to her. As the previous writer stated there are some pieces which repeat but otherwise it is a well written and deeply moving collection of stories."},{"Title":"Empire Builders","review":"Everything in this novel is too simplistically told - the greenhouse cliff that could be avoided by a conversion within 10 years to all fusion engines, to Dan Randolph who double dammed and said rain don't make applesauce too many times for me.

Good explanation of the possible results of global warming without beating it to death."},{"Title":"Empire Builders","review":"As a bit of background for my review, I am attempting to read all (currently 17) of the Grand Tour novels in chronological order (which is not the order they were published in).Empire Builders is the 2nd (or 3rd, depending on which books one includes in the Grand Tour series) book in a long, loosely affiliated group of books begun with Privateers (or PowerSat) and takes place about a decade after the events in Privateers. Many of the main characters from Privateers are back for a return engagement, including protagonist Dan Randolph as the playboy CEO of Astro corporation and antagonist Malik, Russian council member for the GEC (Global Economic Counsel, responsible for all space industry regulation). Jane Scanwell, former president of the United States and on again/off again love interest of Randoph is also back, along with Randolphs Japanese allies in Yamagato industries.While Bova is usually classified as a sci-fi writer, Empire Builders (and its chronological predecessors PowerSat and Privateers) could also fall into the category of near future techno-thriller. While there are sci-fi elements, most of the somewhat limited space/technical details in the book are possible in the present day. In Empire Builders, the world stands on the brink of ecological disaster and only Randolph and his nemesis Malik are initially aware. Malik insists that the only way to avoid the greenhouse cliff is to have the GEC take control of the \\"Big 7\\" space companies along with major energy corporation on Earth. Randolph is out maneuvered legally and forced to go on the run on both the moon and Earth as the Malik and the GEC take control of his company. However, to avert the threat of a greenhouse disaster, all will eventually have to work together against international crime syndicate intent on leaching funds and supplies away from the GEC in its attempt to avert disaster.The characters and plot layout of Empire Builders should be familiar to anyone who reads Bova. Randolph is, despite being at least 50 years old, still a billionaire playboy, sleeping with a different super model every month. Malik is still the throw back to the old Soviet Union. Many of the female characters are beautiful but have slept their way into their current positions, although Empire Builders does include one prominent female role where the character has not slept with every male who bats an eye at her. Empire Builders, like many other Bova books, leaves me wondering who Bova is writing for. Does he want to be Dan Randolph, or does he think all his male readers want to be Randolph? While Empire Builders does show Bova's support of environmental causes, the characters are often cliche enough induce wild eye-rolling.Also like many Bova books, Empire Builders introduced plot elements that seemed to have no purpose. For example, near the end of the book a sub-plot where an earthquake takes place in the Gulf of Mexico creeps in. If there were more of a tie between greenhouse/pollution issues and earthquakes, it might make more sense, but as it stands it's like having the last 30 minutes of the movie Armageddon spliced into your favorite movie in five minute chunks. It probably wouldn't ruin your favorite movie but you'd be left wondering what the heck it was doing there. Perhaps a massive hurricane would have been a better fit, as hurricanes have some probable ties to global warming.Criticism aside though, Empire Builders had a great pace and there's rarely a dull moment. There might be one or two too many self-reflection moments in which one of the characters reflects on the dumb thing they just did and why they shouldn't have done it, but otherwise Empire Builders builds pace and plot into a real page turner that was, to use a clich&eacute;, hard to put down. For a book written nearly 17 years ago, Empire Builders feels only slightly dated and the technological bits seem well done and realistic. There are no sweeping plasma cannon battles in space, but we are given a look at what humanity might be capable of 20-30 years from now.I'd recommend Empire Builders strongly as long as you don't mind a book that is not terribly deep, the tolerance to put up with a mildy misogynistic protagonist and the understand that in 2011 we know quite a bit more about global warming than we did in 1994."},{"Title":"Empire Builders","review":"This is really a unique novel.

There are too many incorrect statements and just plain wrong examples to count.Besides the errors, this book picks very complex examples in which to explain new concepts.I would strongly encourange anybody that is serious about learning Microsoft Access to purchase another publication.Overall Rating: Thumbs down!"},{"Title":"Mastering and Using Microsoft Office 2000 Comprehensive Course","review":"I teach the MOUS certification courses for Office 2000, and this is a great text.

I also purchased the teachers guide and now have the powerpoints, assessments, etc., so the course can really be more effective.

Instead of Potter's delicate pictures, the illustrations are stills of sub-par animation and the stories have been rewritten -poorly. If you find the older English to be unappealing to your children, you'd be better off buying the real thing and changing a few words as you go along. You could do the story better justice rewording it yourself and your children would have the benefit of Potter's stunning drawings."},{"Title":"Cardinal Rules","review":"Would not recommend this book.

The characters are both complex and entertaining. Coulter's use of humor, even in the midst of suspense, makes this book too much fun to put down.

The characters were flat and even by the end of the book I really didn't care what happened to them.

After reading, I was actually surprised to find out that it was not as spectacular as others said. It was not bad but I'd have to say that I've definitely read better. I found the characters a little wanting and the plot was nothing new. I'd have to say that the humor and the surprise ending is what actually saved it for me and made me give it four stars instead of three. In the middle of the book, I found myself wanting to skip and being an avid reader of romances, I realized this was not a good sign.

There are too many things that bothered me about this. First of all, when did the hero and heroine decide they loved each other; when he took her on the lawn or when he took her in the pool knowing what others would think when they found her panties? I understand the bad men being so aweful, but if he is supposed to be the good guy, how could he treat her just like they do? What the hell does she see in him anyways, ever? So what, he is great in bed. I guess it's up to us to assume they had qualities worth loving other than sex. Second, when and how did Rafeal's mother and Cocoa meet? How did they correspond without Mr. Meannie finding out? I don't think that was ever mentioned. I feel like I never got to know the characters, except for a little bit of history.

Antes de comenzar mi rese&ntilde;a de este libro, conviene aclarar que soy un ciudadano bautizado y criado en el seno de una familia cat&oacute;lica; sin embargo, yo no soy cat&oacute;lico (y no lo era desde mucho antes de leer este libro).\\"Mentiras Fundamentales de la Iglesia Cat&oacute;lica\\" es un libro que documenta minuciosamente las tergiversaciones, adiciones, omisiones y francas manipulaciones que una instituci&oacute;n llamada Iglesia Cat&oacute;lica ha impuesto al mensaje original de Jes&uacute;s a lo largo de veinte siglos. El libro analiza y cuestiona de todo, desde las \\"profec&iacute;as\\" del Antiguo Testamento (mayormente escritas despu&eacute;s de que acontecieron lo hechos y no antes), la identidad y el papel de cada uno de los cuatro Evangelistas (quienes nunca conocieron a Jes&uacute;s y escribieron sus versiones de la vida de &eacute;ste contradici&eacute;ndose unos a otros), la personalidad irascible y posible inestabilidad mental de San Pablo, la escena m&iacute;tica del nacimiento de Jes&uacute;s, con todo y animales que le calentaban, y por supuesto, la vida y muerte del mismo Jes&uacute;s y su familia (el autor afirma que no fue hijo &uacute;nico). Objetivamente hablando, se sabe muy poco de Jes&uacute;s, pero una de las cosas que SI se saben con certeza es que nunca pretendi&oacute; fundar una religi&oacute;n. Sin embargo lo m&aacute;s interesante del libro es c&oacute;mo, a la muerte de Jes&uacute;s, su doctrina fue transformada con el paso de los siglos en una religi&oacute;n organizada, institu&iacute;da, cada vez m&aacute;s fuerte y con un poder que se acrecentaba hasta llegar a ser en pocos siglos inmensamente rica (Cualquiera que visite el Vaticano se dar&aacute; cuenta que no se ve mucha pobreza por ah&iacute;).

Their &quot;Border Grill&quot; in Santa Monica (4th and Broadway) is a noisy, splashy, foodie haven with superb drinks, a decent wine/beer list, and amazing food. Mesa Mexicana offers recipes that one might easily see on Border Grill's menu. For those of us who grew up equating Mexican food with Tex-Mex, Miliken and Feniger's inventive take on traditional Mexican cuisine is a revelation.As a cookbook, Mesa Mexicana is interesting, has an attractive layout, and, by the minimal standards of the genre, is well-written. One would not want to use it on an everyday basis. Many of the recipes involve a fairly intensive amount of prep work and/or require specialized ingredients. For the hobbyist chef with access to a decent Mexican grocer and time on his/her hands, however, it is an inspiring and provocative work. Highly recommended on that qualified basis."},{"Title":"Mesa Mexicana","review":"I was impressed by the simplicity of these recipes. Unlike others I've tried, this book calls for simple ingredients that can easily be found at your local grocery store (even in rural Idaho).

Above all... the food turns out delicious even in the hands of a novice."},{"Title":"Mesa Mexicana","review":"I have made several recipes from this cookbook and have had loved them all.

The book is beautiful, the recipes clear, and the results fabulous."},{"Title":"Mesa Mexicana","review":"We love their restaurants and really love this book! The recipes are easy to follow and most are quite quick to make yet are complex in flavor. We particularly like their comments before each recipe that summarize the dish and make recommendations of other dishes that complement the flavors."},{"Title":"Mesa Mexicana","review":"\`Mesa Mexicana' and \`too hot tamales' are the two books currently available from the chef / teaching / restauranteur team known as the \`too hot tamales' of early Food Network fame, Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger. They recently went up against Bobby Flay on \`Iron Chef America'. Not that it really matters, but I don't remember who won or what the secret ingredient was. What is important is that it was easily one of the most entertaining and memorable \`Iron Chef America' episodes, comparable to the very first one featuring Chicago Mexican cuisine expert Rick Bayless and the competition featuring Oriental fusion master, Ming Tsai of \`Blue Ginger'. What I do remember is the imprint of the iron on the back of Susan Feniger's blouse and the inventive recipe they did for Scotch eggs.The first impression of both of these books is not inspiring. The layout is ordinary, leaning toward the garish. The photographs are in a grainy black and white and too small to easily make sense of what is happening, not to mention the fact that most are missing captions. In \`too hot tamales', it is even difficult to tell which of these two delightful ladies is Mary Sue and which is Susan, from the lack of clear identification on the photographs. The flyleaf of \`Mesa Mexicana' clears this up. Mary Sue is the taller with blond hair and Susan is the shorter with dark hair. They also neglect to give a good picture of co-author, Helene Siegel, whose voice seems to be strong in the prefaces and introductions.Based on the strong \`Iron Chef America' appearance, I decided to check out the books from this duo, even though their Food Network show was before my time. I figured two gals with this much energy and a strong showing against the indomitable Bobby must have something to say. At the outset, the book \`too hot tamales' did not impress, until I got to the chapters on soups. At this point, the authors' observations seemed to come alive. This was not nearly as strong as what I saw in Deborah Madison's recent book on soups, but the comparison showed that Mary Sue and Susan clearly had something important to say. That is not to say that \`too hot tamales' is the better book. \`Mesa Mexicana' is actually the better of the two for anyone who is not familiar with Mexican cooking. Having determined that these books have something to say, the next big question is why get these books instead one from the heavy hitters of Mexican cuisine, Rick Bayless or Diana Kennedy.For starters, both Bayless and Kennedy's best books are more strongly oriented toward teaching Mexican cooking, either by technique or by region. Milliken and Feniger's books are more for fun, without straying too far from strong roots in genuine Mexican cooking technique. If all you want are some good, snappy recipes without being tied to the grill (as you are with many of Bobby Flay's recipes), Milliken and Feniger may be your best choice. They are certainly your best choice if you are attracted to entertaining with a Mexican theme. I had an epiphany of insight when I realized that a rather large number of pages in both books, as well as many pages in many other cookbooks are dedicated to \`starters', \`finger food', \`appetizers', \`hors \`d'ourves', \`antipasto' and what have your. But if you live in a typical family, how much time do you really spend making \`party food' in comparison to daily breakfasts, lunches, and suppers. Why don't cookbooks dedicate 20% of their books to breakfast and 35% of their books to brown bag food rather than giving so much room to entertaining food, which the average cook may make once a month, if they are inclined to entertain with food in the first place.All this means is that these books are much more valuable to you if you do entertain often. This is especially true because both books are very reasonably priced, appropriate to their uninspired art work. It is also true because of the rather odd organization of the recipes. In both books, some chapters are organized by function or meal, some by style of cooking, and some by principle ingredient. This means neither book is especially good if you want to find a book to fit a particular function or to use a particular ingredient. The fact that both books are relatively short confirms that neither book may be very useful if you have room for only a very small cookbook collection. But if you can afford the money and space for a large cookbook collection, you will probably already have one or more volumes from Kennedy and Bayless, so why load yourself up with our spicy gals?For most people, the answer is simply that they are great fun to read and their recipes get right to the point. If you are a foodie, you don't need another tutorial on technique. If you are a casual cook who entertains, you can go straight to the largely very concise recipes and get on with it. So, both books are easily worth the room they take up on your shelves.As an aside, it is really interesting to see our gals' comments on the cooking talents of the Mexicans, which is very similar to Tony Bourdain's comments in \`A Cook's Tour', where he states that almost all his line chefs at \`Les Halle' are Mexican with practically no formal training, yet they are as capable as most French trained cooks.If you really like cookbooks or you really like Mexican food, I recommend both of these books."},{"Title":"Mesa Mexicana","review":"This book is &quot;A&quot; number 1!

Needless to say I thought it was a bit presumptuous to give me a cookbook after just a few months together. However, after making the swordfish ceviche, I was completely sold. (By the way, we'll be celebrating our 13th wedding anniversary in a few months!). It continues to be our favorite cookbook. The quinoa salad is our absolute favorite (and loved by our kids) and is what I bring to almost every potluck we go to. Invariably, everybody at the party wants the recipe. Every time I serve the clam and corn chowder for a dinner party, the guests ask for the name of the cookbook and many have gone and bought the book based on this wonderful soup! Cooking a Mesa Mexicana recipe does require a lot of chopping, but that's because every recipe is full of wonderful, fresh vegetables and chiles and you can definitely taste it in the resulting meal. The chopped salad is especially daunting (leave yourself plenty of time), but quite possibly the best salad I've ever had! I continue to try new recipes from this book, and, so far, have never been disappointed.If you like fresh vegetables and chiles, salsas, salads, and wonderful soups, then this cookbook is a must-have."},{"Title":"Mesa Mexicana","review":"Love, love, love this cookbook!!!

The recipes are easy to follow and not fussy and laden with a bunch of ingredients. There is plenty of room to improvise if you like to put your own spin on a recipe.

I have referenced it many times when creating my own worksheets and lessons, and it has even helped me rethink concepts that I thought I understood well and broaden my understanding of some others. I've highly recommended this book to my students and a fair number have bought copies over the years. There is an EXTENSIVE self-test in the latter part of the book that covers the whole gamut of basic (and not-so-basic) English concepts that is very useful to the English learner, the English teacher, and the casual speaker who just wants to make sure his/her grammar is up to snuff."},{"Title":"Master the Basics English (Master the Basics Series)","review":"Well written book.

It is certainly very good, but it lacks a few elements that would enhance its usefulness. However, I like it enough to buy it and rate it three stars out of five. After I purchase the book and use it for a few weeks, I will revise my review."},{"Title":"The Best Poems of the English Language: From Chaucer Through Robert Frost","review":"Forty years ago, I found my first important anthology of English Poetry, Ezra Pound's \\"Confucious to Cummings\\", in which I discovered the poetry I still consider my first choices in the English language, particularly Arthur Golding's translation of Ovid's \\"Metamorphoses\\", and many other poets, including, of course, Cummings. That great critic, Harold Bloom's Anthology has the same feel, a superior range of poets, whose work is of the very best in English verse in his judgement .Most of the poets have extensive, very helpful introductory paragraphs, placing them in their particular age - written by the best teacher - I emphasise that last word - of English Literature to-day. If English Poetry interests you at all, you will hugely enjoy this book - it will give you hour upon hour of intense pleasure, heavy though it is."},{"Title":"The Best Poems of the English Language: From Chaucer Through Robert Frost","review":"Three things caused me to buy this book. The first was the inclusion of two Emily Bronte poems by Professor Bloom: \`Stanzas' and \`Last Lines'. The second was the inclusion of T S Eliot's \`The Wasteland' and the third was that 108 poets are represented in this book.Professor Bloom selected as his chronological limits Geoffrey Chaucer, born around 1343 and Hart Crane born in 1899. Within these parameters is a wealth of British and American poetry to cover a wide range of moods and tastes.There is something intrinsically personal about anthologies of poetry. Those who enjoy poetry will select favourites based on all manner of criteria. My personal criteria owe little to critical objectivity and much more to subjective assessments of evocative language and the metrics of rhythm. So, I've come to love the fierce assertion of the \`Last Lines'. Here is the first verse:\`No coward soul is mine,No trembler in the world's storm-troubled sphere;I see Heaven's glories shine,And faith shines equal, arming me from fear.'And also to love, for different reasons the self-doubt echoing through \`The Waste Land', which starts with The Burial of the Dead:\`April is the cruellest month, breedingLilacs out of the dead land, mixingMemory and desire, stirringDull roots with spring rain.'It would be remiss of me not to mention some of the other poets included:Edmund SpenserSamuel Taylor ColeridgeGeorge Gordon, Lord ByronHenry David ThoreauThomas HardyWilfred Owenand 100 others.Professor Bloom has included an essay on \`The Art of Reading Poetry' together with a range of headnotes on poets and poems. If you enjoy poetry anthologies, this may well be a book for your collection as well.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"The Best Poems of the English Language: From Chaucer Through Robert Frost","review":"For one reason or another, I have been recently reading (and reviewing) poetry collections--from Romantics on. And a review by one of my Amazon friends led me to purchase and enjoy this collection. The author, Harold Bloom, is an eminent scholar, the Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale University. He is a MacArthur Prize Fellow and author of numerous volumes. In his Introduction, he observes that (Page xxvii) \\"My chronological limits are set by Geoffrey Chaucer, born around 1343, and Hart Crane, born in 1899.\\" There is a useful introductory essay, \\"The Art of Reading Poetry,\\" that would be of interest to those who take poetry seriously. As Bloom says (Page 29): \\"The art of reading poetry is an authentic training in the augmentation of consciousness, perhaps the most authentic of healthy modes.\\"But it is the poetry that is at the center of this fat volume (the last poem, by Hart Crane, ends on page 959; I don't know about the reader, but I like big collections of poetry!In high school, we read Chaucer, and I still remember the first few lines (repeated in this work) of \\"The Canterbury Tales.\\"\\"Whan that Aprill with his shoures soteThe droghte of Marche hath perced to the rote,And bathed every veyne in swich licour.\\"Christopher Marlowe's \\"The Passionate Shepherd to His Love\\":\\"Come live with me and be my love,And we will all the pleasures proveThat valleys, groves, hills, and fields,Woods or steepy mountain yields.\\"There is a healthy collection of Shakespeare, but since I recently reviewed a volume of his sonnets, no need for overkill here. But the selections do represent Shakespeare's art nicely.Then there is Richard Lovelace's \\"To Althea, from Prison,\\" with the well known final stanza:\\"Stone walls do not a prison make,Nor iron bars a cage. . . .\\"And so many more. . . . Thomas Gray's \\"Elegy written in a country churchyard\\" or William Blake's \\"The Tyger\\" (I still recall and thrill at the following lines:\\"Tyger, tyger, burning bright.In the forest of the night;What immortal hand or eye,Could frame thy fearful symmetry?\\") to the Romantics' poetry (represented by poets such as Wordsworth, Coleridge, Lord Byron, Shelley, and Keats). Walt Whitman, Herman Melville, Emily Dickinson, Lord Tenneyson, the Rossettis, William Butler Yeats, Rudyard Kipling, Robert Frost, T. S. Eliot, and so on.In short, a cornucopia of poetry in the English language tradition. If that is a genre that you enjoy, running from Chaucer to crane, then this volume should suit you nicely."},{"Title":"The Best Poems of the English Language: From Chaucer Through Robert Frost","review":"I find myself picking up this anthology again and again, which I guess means that it is high time to give my 2-cents about it. I have found this anthology an absolute joy to use for a number of different reasons.From a book-lovers perspective: the pages are thick, and made with nice paper. I am reviewing the paperback edition, and even after toting it all across the United States for a year or two (I travel a fair bit) the integrity of the pages is still intact. The binding is not half bad, either. I did not make a point to break it in and I have not run into any problems as of yet. Also, (and this is a huge perk) the formatting of the pages is also very nice, making it possible to encounter these poets without having to battle with small font or bulky annotations. One will be surprised at the level to which certain poets speak to you once they have been liberated from the confines of onion-thin anthology pages and tiny, cramped fonts.From a poetry-lovers perspective: the book attempts to be the perfect collection, and in many ways succeeds. The old favorites are all here: Chaucer (well-glossed for those unfamiliar with Middle English), Milton (with an indispensable introduction and treatment of Lycidas by Bloom), Shakespeare (surprisingly well represented) as well as some more modern favorites like Dickinson (whom I finally feel I understand after reading Bloom's introduction to her poetry) and Hart Crane (for whose poetry Bloom make a passionate appreciation) are all here. Bloom makes a valiant attempt in the modern poetry section to sort out the poetry that he thinks will ultimately last over time. Unfortunately, one wishes that he would have gone beyond the death of Robert Frost. I would really have loved to hear his more detailed appraisals of W.H. Auden, Dylan Thomas, and perhaps John Ashberry.For it is in the introductions and commentary (spanning sometimes nearly 10 pages) that this book's value is truly found. Mr. Bloom's criticism is eclectic, seasoned, funny (his comments on Poe are priceless), and often frustratingly opinionated. His section on Dickinson made me love a poet for whom I never thought I had any taste, and his section on Spenser makes a valiant effort at reinstating a now much-neglected poetic master. And yet, his section on T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound are disappointing, seemingly limited by his (and their) polemics. Also, his choices of Yeats' poetry make absolutely no sense to me. On a more personal note (for me, a Christian), he seems to slightly depreciate the Christianity that so clearly influences many of these poets, which I found disappointing in a critic so fine as Bloom. Lastly, he spends a great deal of time discussing the psychological influence of poets on one another. However, whereas sometimes I find this a tiny bit tedious in his other works (being of a different critical persuasion), it is here done in a way that always makes one go back to the poems themselves. In the end, I always found myself wishing for more commentary on some poets, but am more than satisfied with what is already there.For all its shortcomings, this book is (in my opinion) Mr. Bloom at his best: allowing canonical poetry to speak with the depth and meaning that it has spoken to him. No anthology will include everything that we want (seeing Eliot's Four Quartets here would have been wonderful), but Bloom makes his favorite selections with no apologies, and in the end one is left with a breathtaking view of poetic history. His essay at the beginning underscores this effect admirably, and he comments on poetic theory in a way not found in many writings of contemporary critics. This was very refreshing.I am soon traveling overseas, and will be away from my library for several years. Not having the money or desire to invest in a kindle library, I am happy knowing that this will certainly be accompanying me in my travels. It is not to be missed, and has provided me with hours of enjoyment. Many thanks, Professor Bloom, for such a fine and respectable anthology."},{"Title":"The Best Poems of the English Language: From Chaucer Through Robert Frost","review":"Bloom's collection here is an excellent start for new poet scholars. He offers more than just an edited collection of poetry. Here he meticulously and intelligently shares his opinion on each and every poem he's handpicked for his collection. The title suggests it is the ultimate collection of poetry for a shelf with no other poetry. However, if you are looking for such a singular text, this is not the right book for you. Bloom at times allows his personal opinions to get in the way of including traditional poems associated with the greatest poetry of all time. If you are interested in the study of poetry, Bloom's collection is an excellent one. However, if you are in search of a compilation of poetry to complete your library, you would be better off with Norton's."},{"Title":"The Best Poems of the English Language: From Chaucer Through Robert Frost","review":"Length:: 4:00 MinsThis is the book Bloom tells us he has wanted to compile his entire life, and, as every thing Bloom edits, compiles and comments upon, it displays both his wide-ranging erudition as well as his wide-ranging idiosyncrasy. But, as the other reviews evince, this 1,000 page collection contains something that will fulfill and enchant every poetry lover's taste, unless they are interested only in poets born after 1899, that is.A word about the commentary here: I've read well-nigh every book which Bloom has written or upon which he has commented, starting with The Visionary Company to this present opus. But I'm no, to coin a term, Bloomolater. He says herein that, since his heart operation, he no longer engages in polemics. This is, for better or for worse, patently untrue. What's interesting here to me is what has changed about the polemics. He is still the High Romantic, Gnostic champion of the Sublime he has always been. But the clarion call for Shelley and Crane has receded more than a bit with the years, and Bloom himself says here that growing old has given him more time and renewed appreciation for poets such as Milton, whose poetry commands many pages in this anthology, and Bloom's commentary on it yet more. If I were asked to point out a common thread here, it would be a, frankly, morbid obsession with the loss of the poetic gift which Bloom finds in almost every poet considered accompanied by a fear, not so much of mortality, as a sort of death in life, which comes not only to the poet who loses this gift, the best and saddest example being Wordsworth, but also to the poetic reader such as Bloom! Hence we find elegies and the like stressed time and again here. If The Visionary Company was Bloom's clarion call, this book is Bloom's swan song, and his commentary assumes an almost dirge-like quality at times.The reason I've chosen Eliot's poem is that I've always agreed with Bloom that \\"Eliot...was a belated Romantic poet, strongest as an incantatory master of Phantasmagoria.\\" The \\"Preludes\\" exhibit this quality profoundly along with that signature Eliotic pessimism, which, as synecdoche, echoes Bloom's undercurrent of disillusionment in his commentary throughout this mammoth anthology."},{"Title":"The Best Poems of the English Language: From Chaucer Through Robert Frost","review":"The book is filled with excellent poetry, however I soon learned to skip the editor's intros and criticisms. Firstly, his opening essay is poorly organized and difficult to read. He frequently refers to other academics that the lay reader has no knowledge of, and his writing itself has an arrogant and snooty academic tone to it. My image of him is sitting in an easy chair with a brandy in one hand and rambling as a secretary writes down everything he says. Even his introductions to each poet can be a chore to read (taking cheap shots at George Bush...really?). Nevertheless, his selections are very good and enjoyable to read, and give a good sampling of all the major english poets."},{"Title":"The Best Poems of the English Language: From Chaucer Through Robert Frost","review":"Harold Bloom has done an outstanding job of compiling a group of the greatest poets through centuries of work. His written passages that precede the author's works are great insight, even if you do not fully agree with them.I also enjoy the fact that he put in Chaucer and others' original works, not whatever he felt would read easiest. Bloom allows you to witness the creativity and brilliance of the author's work, without too much of his own personal influence."},{"Title":"The Best Poems of the English Language: From Chaucer Through Robert Frost","review":"I don't recall why I purchased this book several years ago, but it was a wonderful decision on my part. Not only did Bloom introduce me to dozens of masterpieces, but he also included a brief synopsis of each poet, providing the reader with some insight into the man/woman behind the lyrics. I read most of the poems aloud, and some of them I have returned to time and time again. This is where I learned of Whitman and Marlowe, and the sad but moving Timor Mortis Conturbat Me (the fear of death bewilders me). However, I was irritated by Bloom's treatment of Poe and Ezra Pound. And having read other works by Bloom since then, this is apparently a common theme. Regardless, Bloom is good at what he does, and his introduction to each poet was quite special. Above all, I thank Bloom for including Keats; I've devoured much of this poet's work since then. A thick volume yes, as it should be. I must recommend this collection, particularly if you wish to be properly introduced to masters of English poetry. Purchase the hardback volume if you can, as you will one day be thankful for the added longevity of a higher quality paper."},{"Title":"The Best Poems of the English Language: From Chaucer Through Robert Frost","review":"My wife wanted a compilation of Poems. She hadn't been a serious poem reader but wanted to get exposure to some of the best authors/poems in history. She really likes this book, and it seems to have met her criteria"},{"Title":"The Best Poems of the English Language: From Chaucer Through Robert Frost","review":"Of course this is \\"My favorite poems\\" collection by Professor Bloom. I was disappointed to not find Whittier in here, but after learning Mr. Bloom considers Whitman the greatest America poet it does not surprise me. He could have at least printed \\"Snowbound\\".Space given to Longfellow was very short - far too short for my taste, anyway. I think a selection from \\"Evangeline\\" or \\"The Song of Hiawatha\\" would have been appropriate.I do think he gave a nice bit of space to Dickinson.Overall, this collection is very nice and definitely a keeper. My suggestion is to read this as an introduction to poetry and the buy a book of your favorites to get a broader view.I also think the introductions and annotations given by prof. Bloom are very nice."},{"Title":"The Best Poems of the English Language: From Chaucer Through Robert Frost","review":"I'm not a real big poetry fan, but I did enjoy reading many poems in this volume. I'm not sure how some of these works were included while other better known poems by the contributors were excluded, but the end result is still a good survey of English language poetry.The book is chronological beginning with Geoffrey Chaucer and ending with the 20th Century poets. Each poet has an introductory section that details the highlights of his/her life and some of their political or social views that defined their work.This is a good single volume collection of poems and I think most people with an interest in poetry will find it satisfactory."},{"Title":"The Best Poems of the English Language: From Chaucer Through Robert Frost","review":"I think most will agree, whether they hold Bloom in high esteem or not, that this particular anthology of poetry is truly something spectacular. The criteria which he based his selection on is wholly unbiased, (though some may disagree) as it is based on pure aesthetic merit and nothing else. Therefore overly sentimental, political, moral, or idealogical works are nowhere to be found in this anthology. Here you will only find the best of the best: the most idiosyncratic yet, paradoxically, the most universal sentiments or thoughts expressed in the most profound and unique ways (thus transcending their time and culture). And they are here in spades! That is the difference between this anthology and most others of the sort.Not only are the selections grand, but the notes on the poems and on the authors themselves are wonderfully useful and interesting. Generally, on lesser poets Bloom will give a concise biography and notes that allow one to better comprehend the poem. On more eminent poets he will expound at a much greater length on the poet's life and his or her poetry. This could include (but is certainly not limited to) events that help place specific poems into a useful context, notes about the poet's notions regarding his or her conception of poetry itself, etc. In short, these notes are very varied and always illuminating.I cannot tell you how often I've picked up this book, and casually perused its pages hunting for a poem that adequately suited my mood of the moment. Nor can I count how many poets I had not heard of before that are now among my absolute favorites. Even poets I had long heard of but neglected to read are now open to me because of this book (Shakespeare being the greatest poet I had formerly neglected; thank you Prof. Bloom for opening my eyes to the mighty power of the Bard!).Bloom's introduction (\\"The Art of Reading Poetry\\") can be obscure in some places, but, as time goes on and I read more poems, I comprehend it more and more thoroughly. His notion regarding inevitable phrasing is very intriguing as are his writings regarding allusions. It is a great addition to an already wonderful anthology.I highly recommend all who even moderately enjoy poetry in the English tongue to buy this book. It offers so much more than a purely scholarly anthology one may purchase for a collegiate level course. To conclude, you really can't go wrong with this book because it offers a vast array of poems and poets thanks to Prof. Bloom's great taste regarding sublime poetry."},{"Title":"The Best Poems of the English Language: From Chaucer Through Robert Frost","review":"This quirky collection of poems is light and easy to hold; its optimal physical dimensions motivates me to pull it out of the shelf for another bite-sized morsel. The generous uncluttered layout means poems are given space on the printed page to breathe and thus easy on the eye.The caveat in the sub-title says \\"selected\\", as does Louis Untermeyer's \\"A Treasury of Great Poems\\", so a favourite poem may easily be missing (or de-selected) from a these abridged selections. Untermeyer correctly labels his compilation as an \\"Inspiring Collection\\"; but Untermeyer's introductions to each poet are essentially placid biographies. In contrast, Bloom's \\"Best Poems\\" warns that it comes \\"with Commentary by Harold Bloom\\", so it has his unpredictable brio shafts of wit.Commentary like \\"Poe is a bad poet, a poor critic and a dreadful prose stylist in his celebrated tales.\\"\\"...the astonishingly dreadful \`Ulalume' - you can abandon yourself to them if you want to, but what does Poe give you?...They groan as they roll; as if we were in Edward Lear's Book of Nonsense...\\"Bloom concedes, \\"To dream everyone's nightmare has to be genius, which cannot be denied Poe.\\" Bloom then snubs \\"The Raven\\", and serves up Israfel and The City in the Sea instead.\\"Julia Ward Howe's poetry is copious but ignites only in the \`Battle-Hymn'.\\"\\"Walt Whitman is a difficult poet - complex, evasive, subtle, hermetic - who wants his poetry to look easy. Democratic in ideology, Whitman personally was intensely private and elitest (sic), and his open stance towards his readers is rhetorical fiction.\\" In Whitman's section, Bloom makes the observation \\"Free verse\\" is an oxymoron.\\"I am not always certain that any strong protagonist in Shakespeare ever bothers to listen to any one else, because he or she is preoccupied with self-overhearing.\\"\\"Dickinson's poetry looks simple and is very difficult, ...\\"\\"I confess a lifelong hostility to T.S. Eliot, whose literary criticism did real harm...Eliot was an anti-Semite, though his variety of that spiritual illness never achieved the obsessive intensity of his close friend Ezra Pound. I mention this matter so as to get it out of the way, although I believe it was central to Eliot's cultural polemic.\\" I am entertained.\\"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day\\" (#18), is missing from the selection of 14 sonnets. Notable omissions include \\"Eve of St Agnes\\". The most reprehensible omission is \\"Mending Wall\\" by Robert Frost. If a book were titled \\"From Chaucer Through Frost\\", I would expect Robert Frost to be more comprehensively represented. Louis Untermeyer was a close personal friend of Robert Frost, yet his \\"Treasury\\" also did not include \\"Mending Wall\\", and it falls on Norton's Anthology to pick up the slack. With friends like Louis, who needs enemies.Short staples, like \\"Tintern Abbey\\" are included. \\"Because I could not stop for Death -\\" joins 20 others from the same poet. Bloom explains at length in his 2008 book \\"How to write about Emily Dickinson\\" why he uses this poem to introduce his students to Dickinson's works.Marianne Moore is impressively featured and discussed vibrantly at some length.We are treated to yet another weary re-printing of the lengthy Rime of the Ancient Mariner.Bloom explains that Alfred, Lord Tennyson's works are in a sense elegies for his deceased friend A. H. Hallam, like Ulysses, Morte d'Arthur, Idylls of the King, Tithonus, and they all mourn him - all right, point taken.But to inflict 30 pages of \\"In Memoriam A.H.H.\\" in a book of less than a thousand material pages is sheer villainous indulgence on the part of Bloom. \\"The Charge of the Light Brigade\\" would have been better use of paper. Untermeyer selected only the best verses from \\"In Memoriam A.H.H.\\", showing that even a good poem can be edited by applying good sense. Bloom could have edited most of the longer poems, explaining the retention of the verses chosen, and leave the lifting of heavy stuff to Norton's Anthology.Starting from Chaucer was wise: \\"English\\" before Chaucer sounds like a different language. Bloom anoints some modern day poets in the latter part of his collection.Harold Bloom's book is a highly focused commentary on what he considers \\"Best Poems\\", where he is in his element."},{"Title":"The Affirmative Action Dilemma","review":"I bought the book not knowing what to expect exactly. This is not a new topic but was treated in an innovative way that I 'd not previously considred.

He was able to have a well-rounded understanding of all of the inherent issues, without having to express opinions on all of them. The book's juxtaposition of biblical references and affirmative action policy was eye-opening, to me mostly because of the comparisons that can be drawn between the cultural/racial relationships of today to those dating as far back as biblical times.Overall, a great read for an open-minded person. Would make a nice addition to college course curriculum dealing with race relations and/or religion as it relates to today's society."},{"Title":"The Affirmative Action Dilemma","review":"The author does a great job framing the Affirmative Action debate.

A must read for minorities, Equal Opportunty Advisors, Educators and students alike. Thanks for opening my eyes!"},{"Title":"A Breed of Heroes","review":"Breed of Heroes is an engaging book with hilarious insight into the ups and downs of Army hierarchy. As I laughed at the follies of the officers, I was struck by the resemblance to the follies of any large organization. Judd has demonstrated a grasp of human group behaviour, presented through the prime example of the Army.In the first chapter of Breed of Heroes, I was a bit concerned that this was an Army book written by an author who knows the army for people with a keen interest in all things military. To the uninitiated civilian the military abbreviations, ranks, titles and customs seem like a foreign language requiring at least a phrase book for navigation. I am glad I stumbled through the first chapter because there was no stopping after that. While I think the book is most likely to draw an audience interested in the Army or in the conflict in Northern Ireland, I believe that anyone who has ever been part of a large organization (almost everyone) will find it thoroughly enjoyable.Platoon commander Charles Thoroughgood seems an unlikely person to find in the Army. He is a graduate of Oxford and seems to be an independent thinker of the sort that would avoid a large structured organization like the plague. Charles is inexperienced and unsure of his ability as a leader. His fears about himself seem to be confirmed in his first confrontation with a crowd in Belfast. Indecisive and lacking initiative he fails to properly control the mob of women. His commanding officer is forgiving and assures him that it is inexperience and he will do better next time. Throughout the story the reader watches Charles learn, face challenges, and grow beyond his normal boundaries. And it is through his outsider eyes that we see the Army. His position as platoon commander is well chosen as it gives us insight into both the life of the soldiers and the world of the officers.The story also provides insight into the raw humanity of life in Northern Ireland. In general, it seems to avoid political discussion and instead shows telling glimpses of the people of Belfast. The author succeeds in painting a rather gruesome picture of people at their worst. In Breed of Heroes, Judd touches on many important issues but does not allow them to bog down the story. He has balanced insight into a desparate situation with a lighthearted look at humanity."},{"Title":"Beginner's guide to winning chess","review":"Note that this book was originally written in the 1960s and therefore uses the old-style (non-algebraic) notation.

It is hard as parents to not only counter this, but teach kids to defend the Bible in an understandable way to their own friends. The Way of the Master for Kids is such a tool for handling the difficult questions that arise, as well as laying a sound foundation for salvation.Ray Comfort and Kirk Cameron, co-hosts of the television (and now radio) program also titled \\"Way of the Master,\\" begin by writing an open letter to parents, encouraging them to \\"prepare our children to stand strong in their faith in spite of our secular culture.\\" They then proceed to explain how to do so using this book.With simple and colorful artwork, the first half of the book is for preschool-age kids. It begins in the Garden of Eden, going through the introduction of sin, how we received the Ten Commandments, and then describes each command. Every page contains large-sized text, an illustration, and then below is a smaller quotation from the Bible that reinforces the point. This section wraps up by explaining that Jesus came to take our punishment for not following the laws, how to be saved, and the hope of Heaven.The next portion of the book is dedicated to elementary school kids, and is singular in its presentation of youth apologetics. Before reading this, I was unconvinced that such young minds would be capable of understanding the arguments for the existence of God, the fallacies of evolution, and why bad things happen. Comfort and Cameron treat their young readers with respect, giving ample yet clear information that answers a myriad of questions that naturally cross curious intellects.The Way of the Master for Kids is a book that needs to be on every family bookshelf, and read over and over until it is committed to memory. It gives assurance of salvation, and is an invaluable tool for combating the secular thinking of our postmodern culture. Don't buy just one copy, this is a book that must be shared. - Anne Walker, Christian Book Previews.com"},{"Title":"The Way of the Master for Kids: Teaching Kids How to Share Their Faith","review":"I totally love the Way of the Master series, and think it is \\"THE\\" way to witness to the lost.

The first part is basically the way of the master repeated again in kiddy form, i.e. the 10 commandments with pictures, I already have that. The second part of the book is what I wished the whole book was like. It has questions like \\" how do i know God exist\\", and then gives several pages of answers in kiddy form, so you can talk with and teach your kids and class how to respond to unbelievers! Loved it. There are perhaps 6-7 questions in the second half. Perhaps next time they can do a whole book that asks these hard questions that kids will be faced with and give good solid answers!All in all, if you have never read the way of the master stuff and want to teach your kids, this book is for you!!"},{"Title":"The Way of the Master for Kids: Teaching Kids How to Share Their Faith","review":"I bought a copy of this book through Amazon several years ago for my book collection. Now that I have a 3 year old neice that I take to church every Sunday with me, I decided to show the book to her. I wanted something that was full of illustrations, yet was easy to teach her the 10 Commandments. After reading the 3-5 year old section (the first section of the book), she started repeating some of the 10 Commandments to me and her mom. In fact, she even said that we had to take a nap when I explained to her what keeping the Sabbath Day holy meant, because God took a nap that day. It was a very fun way to teach her something that is very important for all Christians to follow.I would definetly recommend to to anyone with a child, neice, nephew, cousin, or grandkids. They will love it!"},{"Title":"The Way of the Master for Kids: Teaching Kids How to Share Their Faith","review":"This is an excellent tool to help your children with questions they may have and reach them for Christ. My two sons, ages 10 & 13, liked it. They said it was easy to understand and enjoyed the illustrations in it. Also consider the book, \\"How Bring Your Children to Christ & Keep Them There\\""},{"Title":"The Way of the Master for Kids: Teaching Kids How to Share Their Faith","review":"The book was excellent! I found the book helpful in explaining God things to my 5 year old son. Some of the questions addressed are hard for many adults to grasp, yet Cameron and Comfort simply explained key truths in a way a child can understand. What a blessing!!"},{"Title":"The Way of the Master for Kids: Teaching Kids How to Share Their Faith","review":"The Book has two parts. The first one is an overview of the Bible. This is beautifully done and shows the most important parts. The second part helps you teach your children how to defend their faith.This book is a great outline of the Bible and really helps you understand the entire Bible. It is great to help your kids defend their faith. The book is simple to read and gives great arguments.Every Christian Parent should buy this book. If you want your Child to be soundly saved read this book to your kids."},{"Title":"The Way of the Master for Kids: Teaching Kids How to Share Their Faith","review":"I bought this book for my grandchildren ages 3 and 5. It's an age appropriate book to teach God's truths."},{"Title":"The Way of the Master for Kids: Teaching Kids How to Share Their Faith","review":"The Way of the Master for Kids is an excellent book to help kids (and adults)see the simplicity in sharing the Gospel message.But even more than the Gospel, it also helps them show their friends that there really is a God.The book is divided into two sections - one for younger kids and another for older kids.My four kids (ages 3,6,9,12) each sat and listened raptly.I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Way of the Master for Kids: Teaching Kids How to Share Their Faith","review":"I loved this book. It is a great way to keep the interest of young children, while you present the gospel. Informative and on their level. They asked for it over and over."},{"Title":"The Way of the Master for Kids: Teaching Kids How to Share Their Faith","review":"I love this book. It explains sin and why Jesus died for us and why we have the 10 commandments in a kid friendly way. There's a section for smaller children and a section for older children. They included a cool way to remember the 10 commandments so children will visually remember them and learn them-it helped me too! We have them down pat now!"},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"Don't be fooled by this book. These are all second- and third-hand accounts of events. This guy did zero-null-nada extra research to write a book about Jim Morrison. He took all of it from all the other books (Manzarek, Densmore, Sugarman/Hopkins, etc.) written about Morrison. On top of that the book could be organized better. Story after story are strung together with no connection to each other. Davis takes some literary license making it read like a polished novel: he seems to know every facial expression that was exchanged between people and exactly how many drinks Jim had wherever he went.1. Didn't go into the full conversation that Ray and Jim had discussing the full meaning behind naming the band \\"The Doors\\".2. Made a passing comment that Ray and his wife and Jim may have had a menage a trois.3. Stated that The Doors were first on a list of bands at Columbia Records that were being dropped by the company. According to Ray or John's book the Doors were in the middle of the list.4. He said that after Jim hosed down the studio after recording \\"The End\\" that Jim had jumped the studio fence and Paul Rothchild grabbed him as Jim tried to run away. Patricia Butler (\\"Angels Dance and Angels Die\\") states that Jim scaled the fence and returned to Pam waiting in her car by climbing back over the fence and getting his boot caught in the fence. The boot was then found the next day and later traced to Jim. (Mrs. Butler actually did some research in her book if you read her bibliography).5. Davis states that the boyfriend of the girl that Jim was making out with backstage in New Haven had asked the Police to look for her which is how the Police stumbled upon Jim and maced him. According to Ray Manzarek, that's not why the Police were backstage before the show.6. States that the Doors' Buick commercials ran in the South and Midwest. In Manzarek's or Densmore's book it states that Buick pulled the plug after making the deal and never ran the ad.7. States that Robby took Spanish Caravan from Isaac Albeniz Partido No. 1. He took it from Albeniz Spanish Suite 1. (There is no such work in classical music called a \\"Partido\\"!)8. He called \\"The End\\" Robby's \\"Andalusian goat song\\". Yeah, I always picture a goat in the Spanish Andalusian Mountains when I listen to that song.9. He says in The Lost Paris Tape (Paris) that Jim \\"launched into an astounding version of Orange County Suite\\". Sadly, the most amateur, unprofessional poet or musician wouldn't be caught associating themselves with a recording (if you want to call it that) like this. There is no semblance of poetry or music on this embarrassing piece of short sleepy, childlike tape. The most interesting moment on this tape is when Morrison comments on the beautiful Cuban cigar he has and tells his buddy that he doesn't have to bite the tip off.10. He says that Jim and Pam saw the movie \\"Pursued\\" on the night of July 2. Later in the book he writes that Pam said the movie they saw was \\"Death Valley\\". He makes no reference to the contradiction.I made these observations after a few days of reading this book. Too bad Mr. Davis didn't pay attention to these subtleties after devoting part of his life writing it. The more I read in this book the less credence I gave to it. I wonder if Stephen Davis even knows what song featured the words \\"I'm the lizard king. I can do anything!\\"? I highly doubt it. I think I remember his book \\"Hammer of the Gods\\" also came under heavy scrutiny when it was released. This is a good starter kit to get familiar with Morrison. When you're finished with this get the other books and start connecting the dots."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"I am neither a Doors scholar nor have I read extensively in the literature devoted to the band's rise to prominence in the late nineteen-sixties and its subsequent demise. I did see the Doors perform once or twice. And I have screened Oliver Stone's film which, in my opinion, raised more questions about the iconic Jim Morrison than it answered. So, for the record, I came to Stephen Davis's sprawling biography of Morrison without a lot of prior knowledge and without expectations for a fresh take on its subject of inquiry. That said, I found Jim Morrison: Life, Death, Legend to be a cogent, well-written narrative history that kept me involved from first page to last. I was impressed not only with Davis's effective characterization of Morrison and The Doors, but with his panoramic evocation of the turbulent sixties which for me was the emotional highlight of this book. I am unable to comment on the accuracy of Davis's reporting but I can state unequivocally that by the time I finished reading I felt I had come to know Jim Morrison viscerally and to understand how his background, and the times he lived through, had shaped both his personality and his destiny. Jim Morrison: Life, Death, Legend reads like a novel and is hugely informative. For those who came of age during the late sixties, it will provide a nostalgically jarring recreation of a time categorically unlike any other before or after."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"Only a NON-Doors fan, with no previous knowledge of the band, could give this book 5 stars.I am a long time Doors fan. I've read numerous books on the Doors over the years. I give this book one star because there is nothing new or original here. I've read it all before in other books. It's apparent the author did no new research of his own, and simply borrowed from other books on the Doors. Davis doesn't hesitate to repeat the same old incorrect history or fabricated stories on the Doors either.Don't waste your money on this one. Unless you've been living under a rock and never read any other Doors book in your life."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"This is perhaps the best written of all the Jim Morrison bio's. Davis' prose is truly a pleasure to read. But unfortunately, the fun stops there. Almost every quote that he uses is lifted from other source material. On top of that, despite the odd new nugget on Morrison, everything here has been covered already. I had hoped Davis would bring new perspectives on Jim from people who hadn't already been in all the other bios; or at least hadn't been focused on much in other bios. &quot;Life, Death, Legend&quot; just throws the other books into a blender and puts a new cover on the amalgamation."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"If you wonder whether this book might be the \\"last word\\" on Morrison, I am here to tell you that it has no footnotes and no index. There is a bibliography of \\"selected sources\\" without page citations, and a list of acknowledgments which includes Albert Goldman (author of LIVES OF JOHN LENNON) and Victor Bockris (author of unauthorized bios of Lou Reed and Patti Smith).Certain sections are good; for instance, a few pages about dysfunctional military families and how the children sometimes have difficulty adjusting to the \\"outside world.\\" This is general information, though, and it could be wholly irrelevant. It's just offered by Davis as a likely factor in Morrison's abnormal development. There's talk of sexual abuse, Beat literature and a trip to the cinema to see REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE.Overall, the reporting does not seem trustworthy, no matter how much of it is \\"true.\\" 1) Davis frequently asserts a special knowledge of Morrison's mind and body without substantiating his statements. 2) Given a choice between reporting or holding back on a scandalous piece of gossip that can't be proved true, he'll report it (with qualifiers in parentheses, or as the \\"belief\\" of some person who knew Jim). Well, his choices do make the book more interesting, but they also show a lack of respect for his subject and his audience.If you dip into Something Weird Video's DVD of MONDO MOD & THE HIPPIE REVOLT, the audio commentaries by Johnny Legend (a Sunset Strip refugee of the late 60s) can enlighten you further about Morrison and his essentially unknowable nature. Everyone from that place and time seems to have a first-hand tale about meeting Morrison somewhere and failing to communicate with him, as he was blotto on drugs, booze and self-absorption.This book carries on the tradition, falling into the rut of a thousand other rock-bios, in which a \\"rock star\\" is half public image, half his clandestine & recreational pursuit of \\"kicks,\\" with no inner life apart from what might bear on his outward excesses. MORRISON: LIFE, DEATH, LEGEND is a chronological record of known or conjectural sexual activity and substance abuse, with extended musical interludes. That's life?"},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"This has got to be one of the most inacurate books out there.First off the man can't label pictures correctly.Did he not take the time or care enough to label them correct?.There is nothing new here maybe except for a few odds and ends.He is just basically going into things weve already read inother books,trying to put them into his own words and such.This is indeed embarrasing--for the author"},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"He died in Paris in 1971 under suspicious circumstances, leaving behind a very confused legacy of ex-lovers, rich music and bizarre contradictions. Like Marilyn Monroe, Princess Di and other celebrities who died young and beautiful, Jim Morrison is still a subject of fascination.Unfortunately, Stephen Davis doesn't do him justice in \\"Jim Morrison: Life Death Legend\\" -- he seems more interested in the dirt than the man. Morrison came into his own when he was hired onto the Doors, one of the darler, less psychedelic bands of the 1960s. His intense songwriting and kinetic onstage persona helped rocket the Doors to superstardom.Morrison lived fast before dying young -- he doted on his longtime girlfriend Pamela, with whom he stayed until his death, but also became involved with critic Patricia Kennealy, goth-rocker Nico, and many other women. He used plenty of drugs, and dabbled in the darker side of his own nature, before dying mysteriously at a young age.Stephen Davis is best known for his biographies of legendary rock bands like the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin. If he had attempted a total biography of the Doors, this might have worked. But when he focuses on just one person, the biography ends up overstretched and undernourished. There's too little new information of worth here.Unfortunately, little is new about Davis's reporting; most of Morrison's wild excesses and intriguing contradictions have been reported elsewhere. As a result, he tries to pad the book with intimations that Morrison was not the Lizard King, but the Lizard Queen. However, none of his rather smirky gay rumours have much substance.He does, however, manage a balanced view of the people in Morrison's life, such as his various girlfriends.

Not only that, the author wastes the first 302 pages on rehashed information contained in nearly every book published up until June 2004.Most criminal, though, would be how the author does an Albert Goldman (nice eponym, no?), who, incidentally (and thankfully), died before he could finish his Hefty Bag bio on Jim, doing to Jim what he ostensibly did to Lennon in 1988. That said, Davis claims that Jim fit more of the role of a \\"Lavender King\\" than that of the notorious--and beloved--\\"Lizard King.\\"Listen to Jim at his raunchiest (thanks to \\"An American Prayer\\" and the Bright Midnight releases) and you'll know for a fact that Mr. Mojo Risin' dug tacos, not weiners. However, this spin on the Morrison legend only skims the surface of the problems associated with this pitifully written book.Only when we get to \\"James Douglas Morrison\\" (Book Three) does the author tantalize us with palatable minutiae, like \\"Hard Rock Cafe\\" as the working title of \\"Morrison Hotel\\" (actually the name for the \\"A\\" side) and the song \\"HWY9\\" as the original title of the legendary \\"Roadhouse Blues.\\" Flash-forward to \\"The Last Interview\\": we get, what I contend, may be the inciting incident that prompted Davis to write this book in the first place: the confession of one of Max Fink's golf buddies that revealed that Jim would be exterminated in jail unless Mr. Mojo Risin' beat a path out of town. The anecdote reads like a cloak-and-dagger yarn--and pure Hollywood--but, hell, why should fantasy stand in the way of a potential buck, thinketh Davis. Plus, Rolling Stone Magazine--the zombie of all magazines, Jann Wenner the ultimate hougan--paid him well for an excerpt, even though Rolling Stone, that rag, has a history of Morrison bashing.Yet, Davis really goads this reader when he attempts to merge unrelated Led Zep and Brian Jones minutiae with the Morrison universe. Now, don't get me wrong; I dig Zep and The Stones. I just suspect that Davis lacked much by way of sources and felt the need to fatten his calf a bit. And hey, he had extensive sources on The Stones and Zep, having written bios on them, too. Irrespective of the pompous Robert Plant's musings about an over-the-hill Morrison at a 1969 concert in which The Doors and Zep shared the bill and the fact that Jim made sure fans at the Aquarius shows received his \\"Ode to Brian Jones\\" poem upon entering the venue, what worth does it serve to the Morrison universe?Stuff the book under the leg to level out your dining room table, but only do that if you received the book as a present. Spend the $27.50 on some Bright Midnight CDs. Jim lives, just not in Davis' \\"I-can't-get-Zep-or-Brian-out-of-my-mind\\" recycled exploiter. Peace."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"This was the first book I've read on Morrison. It was very interesting and well written but the lack of footnotes bothered me. I'm always curious to see where a particular anecdote in a biography comes from and with this book there's no way of knowing. It seems to me that Davis just rehashed a lot of what had been previously published before him. A good read, but I still don't know any more about Morrison that I didn't know before."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"He died in Paris in 1971 under suspicious circumstances, leaving behind a very confused legacy of ex-lovers, rich music and bizarre contradictions.

No interviews seem to be conducted by this author and the information sited wasn't referenced at the degree necessary to maintain a comfortable degree of certainty. Many accounts were introduced and then left for the reader to determine. Some of these are weakly chronicled rumors or gossip that may have distorted the persona being built.The author did wonderful job with presenting the atmosphere of the time period and describing the eccentric luminaries that often ran parallel to Morrison during the later 60's. The east coast and west coast scenes were well portrayed and the climate of Vietnam percolated into the Morrison identity Davis was defining.I would have liked to read more information on how the Morrison family felt about their son. It appeared that there was a shortage of information which would have completed the story. The author set the background but then didn't expand on it as the story progress except for some small inserts here and there that left many things unexplained.All in all, this was a comprehensive account of the life of Jim Morrison. I enjoyed reading it and would recommend it to anyone interested in the music scene in the 60's or the life or Jim Morrison and the Door's."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"The book is basically a composite of many other Morrison books that have already come out, and the form basically rips off No One Here Gets Out Alive in terms of structure and layout. Obviously, since No One Here Gets Out Alive came out nearly twenty years ago, Davis had the benefit of adding various other stories that hadn't surfaced publicly back in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but that doesn't necessarily make this book particularly groundbreaking or a fountain of new information. Serious Morrison affectionados will have already read about most of what is in this book, save perhaps for some various passages about the Lizard King's rumored homosexual encounters. Davis admittedly presents nothing that runs counter to or challenges previous assertions of Morrison and his private life in terms of the basic facts and chronology, so there's really little point to the book. Particularly since Morrison's life story had already been more than amply chronicled by the time Davis got around to writing this. In short, Davis really has nothing new to say, so why bother?"},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"This is the first Morrison biography I ever read. I found it readable and very worthy, apart from some errors that should have been picked up by the editor. For example, the false statement that Morrison arrived in Paris in June 1971. I also remember Davis quoting a Doors review from the LA Times and saying that was their first mention in mainstream press. But Davis had mentioned another LA Times Doors review about 100 pages earlier. These kinds of errors break the readers' flow and inevitably raise questions about authorial reliability. However, for me, they were overshadowed by the fascinating tale of Morrison's rise and fall. I look forward to reading Hammer of the Gods and Patricia Butler's biography of Pamela Courson."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"EXTREMELY well researched and this author injects personal humor and interest while maintaining an objective outlook and perspective for the reader. I loved this book and I learned a great deal about Jim Morrison. I can't wait to track down other books by this author."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"i found this book to be quite informative. i've read many other biographies of Morrison's, including(unfortunately) 'No One Here Gets Out Alive,' otherwise referred to as 'Nothing Here but Lies.' I certainly find most of his research to be as close as one can get with a 'middle man.'However as with all such topics, his most outlandish claims should be taken with a large grain of salt, or at least weighed heavily. Jim's real days will never be truly known in every intimate detail; but thus far, this is as good as it gets."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"Awaited over 6 months for this book to be published and was let down almost immediately. Almost all but 2 pictures have been published before and the story itself has already been covered by previous bios. Still, it's an ok read for the uninitiated, but for those who have read other Morrison bios, there is nothing new covered here--except maybe that the surviving Doors were not the best friends with Morrison that they now make themselves out to be. One glaring error was the author has Morrison arriving in Paris in June '71 when in fact he had been living there since March. Would've loved new info from post-Miami to July '71 and would've loved to have seen rare photos from that time."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"Nothing new. And who did the edit?"},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"As a major Morrison fan, i felt this book did justice to the poet, not the rock star, and the poet is who lives on today. It is a good read if you have taken an interest in the doors or Morrison. I found it better then jerry hopkins book No One Here Gets Out Alive, and it held to the truth better then Hopkins book. If you are interested in finding out where Morrison got the ideas for his songs, and in learning about him as a poet as well a rock star, this is the book to read."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"The program for this evening is not new, you've seen this entertainment through and through.-Jim Morrison.Stephen Davis is the author of the acclaimed Led Zeppelin biography Hammer of the Gods, so it was probably a no-brainer for someone to think he would write the definitive biography of Doors singer Jim Morrison. Unfortunately, that's not what happened. Jim Morrison is a derivative biography relying on the interview and research of previous biographies. It was the Morrison biography No One Here Gets Out Alive that got me excited about The Doors. However, this book provokes no such excitement about The Doors. At times, it doesn't even seem as if Davis gave The Doors catalog a thorough listening as he claims that on Roadhouse Blues Lonnie Brooks played guitar and that you can hear Morrison yell \\"do it Lonnie, do it!\\" when it's clearly \\"do it Robby, do it!\\" Referring to Doors guitarist Robby Krieger. When Davis does seem to show up for the writing of this biography, it's to claim Jim Morrison was a closeted homosexual based on the evidence that he hung out with some famous homosexual poets. This, at best, seems ridiculous. I bought this book when it first came out. After reading it, I gave the book to a cute girl neither of which I saw again. It's unfortunate about the girl."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"What can one say about Jim Morrison? Surly Drunk, Guy who would engage in behavior when intoxicated or high that not even rowdy college freshman would touch, Brilliant Poet/Lyricist, with a 150 IQ who knew particular books and Writers, as well as about anyone, Drug fiend who couldn't control himself, Mesmerizing Singer with the charisma of a million Men ? All of that and more is displayed in Davis's book.The good-Davis is very good on depicting the many concerts of the Doors, which could apparently go from great to bad, to ultra wierd from night to night. He's very good with Morrison going to College at UCLA & Florida, & also great descriptions of the Doors and Jim playing the Whisky/Sunset Strip in 1966. The first nite there they opened up for Buffalo Springfield for example, not long after this Them wih Van Morrison jammed on G;loria at the Whisky A-Go-Go when people spontaneously danced, and immediately responded, if a song was incredible and tons of songs were incredible in 1966.The book appears to be pretty accurate in General, but here are my problems with it- Davis says\\" that Jim regularly threw up on people and jumped out of moving cars\\"-maybe once or twice who knows the sitution,no corroborating evidence is provided, but I doubt these were regular occurences. The evidence isn't worth a damn that Jim was gay. Nothing solid at all is offered in this direction, so I don't believe the Author should be sensational in that regard if hedoesn't have the goods. He says Light My Fire's instrumental passages\\" are tedious\\"?, I, would say more like exhilarating. He says The great Hollywood Bowl concert of 7-5-68 is tepid. We must have not seen the same DVD, because it wasn't much longer after that his drinking got completely out of control and within a couple years looked maybe 15 years older and was in poor health and literally unrecognizable in some photos, taken the last year and a half, or so of his life. Here he looks great, sings powerfully, and I think it's a fantastic memory of him. Morrison was a true revolutionary, but though it's not addressed in the book, he obviously wanted to change this conformist, dishonest society we live in and it was just too much pressure to be Superman each night. Well, that's a personal aside. It's getting harder and harder to ascertain what is the truth in so many controversial cases and someone as enigmatic as James Douglas Morrison. The ending of this book rea;lly rings true, though I do believe he was a better person overall than he comes across,...who can really say??? at this point I'd like to think if we had few beers it would be great, but is that just wishful thinking??"},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"I recommend this book by Stephen Davis! First, it's comprehensive, well-written and truly interesting. (His research and contacts are cited at the back.) Unlike other bios you will find on Jim Morrison, this book is written in linear fashion and does not jump around, leaving the reader confused. You begin to get a good sense of Jim's development from the time he was a teenager. Unfortunately, it does take many years to discover the reality of a celebrity's existence... While they are alive their reputations will be protected to some extent, so it is often after death that the public will learn what drove a celeb to do what they do. This is one of those books that, I feel, tells it like it really was. It's a sad read, but it is compassionately and honestly written.I love how Stephen Davis develops the two sides of Jim's personality: the sensitive poet and student; the shamanistic freedom-fighter; the romantic and the troubadour... (That side of Jim we would all like to believe in forever, and this was his soul talking to us.) The other side being the hitchhiker, the rebel, the drunk, the chauvinist, the redneck and potential murderer. It becomes evident Jim Morrison suffered from neglect as a kid. His father wasn't nurturing, perhaps actually severely abusive in ways Jim could never name. His life became a statement of rebellion. He was a mentally challenged young man. He had panic attacks and seizures. He was inhibited and shy; he was also a bully. Prior to these situations one is left wondering if Jim, as a child, ever truly felt safe. He was acclimated to death at an early age; also the mis-use of power over others who were helpless. He wasn't able to discipline himself because he did not respect authority (unless they were writers or dead poets). He was too smart for his own pants. After reading this book I get the impression Jim struggled to find intellectual equals. He knew he could easily exploit people through their fears of freedom and truth. He liked to push everyone's buttons. He made this his destiny.This book brings me to believe he became apathetic once he realized most of the people around him were living through him vicariously. So even though he had great fun being the lead singer for The Doors, he quickly outgrew them. He was trapped by the prestige of money and fame. He didn't know how to cope with it. He was an old soul who understood that everything is illusion, so he played with people's illusions. He was not delusional so much as he understood life is not all about living in emotion. When it came to other people and their emotions, he must have felt stifled and suffocated.Jim Morrison was drunk and stoned on LSD for over half his life. He was able to get away with creating all kinds of trouble because people seldom called him on it. With alcohol and LSD, Jim cultivated bravado and used his intelligence to make statements about choices, and about freedom, through his poetry and music performances. It was his destiny to live the life he had; in that regard I think the film by Oliver Stone captures the mystique of Jim Morrison. But in this book, you will find the human being, and he was a chaotic mess.As a final note, it is noted in this book that a bronze plaque was made for Jim's gravestone in 1995. The translation on the plaque reads \\"True To His Own Spirit\\". In another recent photo-bio on The Doors, I read that the plaque with the sentiment had been placed there by Jim's father, who just passed away this year in November."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"I almost didn't buy this book after reading many of the reviews here. I am glad I did buy it. I've read several biographies on this subject and I feel this is the best.Refreshingly, Davis doesn't write with the flagrantly 'hero-worshipping' tone others who have written about Morrison have used. Rather than reenforcing the same recycled viewpoints of others who regarded Morrison as a mystic/mad genius poet, Davis explores and reports the opinions of many of Morrison's contemporaries who were rather unimpressed with the man as a person. The result is the most balanced bio on Morrison that I've read thus far.There are times when he does seem to beat the reader over the head with repetitive examples of Morrison's bufoonish and beligerent behavior while drunk. For instance, he dwells on many examples of Morrison's shouting racial slurs in the street, drunkenly taking the stage and disrupting other musician's performances, and often treating his fans and lovers as something less than human beings. One or two of these examples would have gotten the author's point across without constantly repeating identical examples of the same boorish behavior.I also felt he dwelled on too many hearsay quips and unsubstantiated rumors about Morrison's alleged homosexual escapades as evidence that Morrison leaned that way. At those times it seemed apparent to me that the author was taking a bit too much delight in trying to convince the reader that this was true. The evidence he put forth in that aspect of Morrison's life was unconvincing. All third person accounts cast forth in shadowy rumors.But again, unlike other Morrison bios, I found this to be a unique reporting of the varying, and often extreme degrees, in which those who were associated with this man viewed him. All other bios I have read left me with the somewhat suspicious sense that everybody who knew the man was in true awe of him. Davis confronts that one sided view and names, and quotes, many of Morrison's associates who for the most part viewed him as a belligerent alcoholic who was at best tolerated by them. I especially found it insightful, and sad, when he quotes by name a woman who says something to the effect that near the end of his life many people who knew Morrison felt sorry for him.Overall,I feel this is the only Morrison bio which captured Morrison's brief but interesting life for what he was... A brilliant but very troubled young man."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"I can't disagree that Davis uses conjecture more than would be preferred in a well-researched biography. However - he scores big with his on-the-record accounts from Alain Ronay about what really happened in Paris the week of July 3, 1971. Lots of reviews have complained that there is \\"no new information\\", but I've read all the Morrison books available, in print and out, and until now I'd never read an account of the undertaker arriving at Jim's and Pam's apartment to pack his corpse in ice. Have any of YOU? Didn't think so. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"With the many other books out there on Jim Morrison and the Doors, you have to wade through a lot of \\"fertilizer\\" to get to the real facts. Not so with this book by Stephen Davis. He clears up a lot of the myths, half-truths and legends surrounding this remarkable '60's icon of rock. Unfortunately, he also stirs up some new ones with unfounded hints & suggestions that Jim may have been an experimental homosexual. Beyond this scantily supported bombshell though, the book really delivers the goods on his life and times before, with, and after the Doors."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"Stephen Davis outdoes himself and his previous classic of rock biography with his new book. Well, in my opinion, Jim Morrison is inherently more interesting than the boys of Led Zeppelin, though both flirted with the dark magic of Kenneth Anger. And also now, because Morrison is dead, Davis doesn't need to concern himself much with libel laws, except to protect thr reputation of the innocent who are alive.His focus is on the paradox of ontology, of Morrison's being, and why is it that a boy who on the surface led a pretty privileged suburban life wound up living as an adult a life of creativity, unhappiness, and mystery. No other writer has come close as this to explaining Morrison's art in terms of his childhood and his background, and partly Davis' success stems from his finger on the pulse of US and world history during the 1940s and 1950s. We see Morrison very much in tune with contemporary developments in music, poetry, art and cinema, showing that he was not some isolated genius, but part of an interweb of action and reaction that accompanied the Cold War and its discontents. If, as Davis alleges, Morrison was the victim as a teen of sexual abuse by someone within his own family, a military figure at that, it would go a long way towards explaining how \\"The End,\\" etc, came to be written."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"As with other reviews i must agree, there is not much new material or insight, though what is presented is well written, another book entitlted &quot; the end&quot; was researched on a personal budget, but seems to convey alot more ground work of the authors doing, has to much time passed and no one wants to co operate anymore? its been over 30 years, im sure the clues and memories of all involved are drying up to a point, a good read of something that is already out there, i was hoping for more insight."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"Mr. Davis seems to want to have it both ways. He presents Morrison as an amoral and heavy disturbed alcoholic by urges the reader to take him seriously as a poet. Davis condemns Morrison in spite of himself. Page after page he portrays Morrison drinking and throwing up on people. He shows his bandmates bitterly complaining (and rightfully so)about how he was almost useless as a collaborator. And yet by the end we are supposed to think of him as a great poet and a fine human being and an effective rebel against the war in Vietnam. Morrison's poetry by any objective standard was an artless mish-mash of pseudo-Buddhist bathroom graffiti that even Morrison couldn't elucidate (even on those rare moments when he was sober) The music, of which Morrison did not write a note, was fantastic. The book's strength is that it shows the Morrison's benders were not some effort to break on through to other side but desparate attempt by a sociopath to dull the pain he felt when he realized that all of his calls for trancendence ended in a hangover and a morning spent puking in whatever toliet was handy. While the book is much better than \\"No One Gets Out of Here Alive\\" Davis is still too enamoured of Morrison's mystique and the spirit of the 60's to seriously and objectively evaluate Mr. Mojo Risin's work and accomplishments."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"I love Jim Morrison and the Doors, and this book has some interesting new details. But even I couldn't read through a description of EVERY single concert - Doors sucked, Doors hot. Plus nightly antics of Morrison. Maybe I'll try again to finish. It does generate interest about Morrison as a poet. And I guess the book is appropriately non-commital about Jim's life. Like others destroying themselves, his insane life was both his delight and his hell. And who, including himself, could ever tell when he swiched from one to the other? Careening though life leaving dazed survivors isn't unusual, unless you happen to be a star for a few years. And since he made it all short, he doesn't leave us with any wisdom he might have gleaned in later years. He left that job to all of us. And so his life movtivation becomes a great mystery to be written about in books. When he's really not that much different from any aching, self-destructing soul, who maybe dies with no attention or curiosity at all. Hmm... where is this going?"},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"Stopped dead in my tracks when:1. He states Arthur Rimbaud's \\"brief lifetime ended......... in Ethiopia\\" (it was France).2. He implies that his death was a result of nefarious activities. \\".......as he was trading slaves and running guns to a rebel group.\\"(His activities had nothing to do with his death. He died of cancer).-This next one really pisses me off for it's ridiculous, let's try to give a mystical fateful meaning to Morrison's death-3. He writes that Rimbaud died \\"at age twenty-seven\\". (He was 37, you idiot.)Any child could go online and look up these simple facts. Are you just stupid, Mr Davis? That or you clearly think we are. Don't waste your time or sully the memory of JM by reading this highly suspect collection of rehash. SHAME ON YOU MR. DAVIS. With an equal amount of the effort you put into researching this bio, just about any Jim Morrison fan could have written this book...... From memory and more accurately. I WOULD GIVE THIS BOOK A ZERO RATING IF POSSIBLE."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"Perhaps with the mysterious cover and the grabbing editorial reviews, Stephen Davis thought that he would fool Morrison/Doors fans into believing that this would be THE book, THE final word on this enigmatic man's life and work. In my case at least, he was right.This is nothing more than rehashed, oft told stories about Jim Morrison and his chaotic life, spliced with occasional, unsatisfying references to his private notebooks. You might as well buy &quot;Wilderness&quot; or &quot;The American Night&quot; for all the new information he gives us. Nothing that hasn't been written is revealed about his death in Paris. There are intimations that he was bisexual, but nothing solid. Davis even has balls enough to reference &quot;Wild Child&quot;, the blatantly fictional account of Morrison's supposed &quot;relationship&quot; with groupie Linda Ashcroft. This book is some where between &quot;No One Here Gets Out Alive&quot; and &quot;The Lost Diaries of Jim Morrison&quot;--in other words, like these wastes of paper, it floats between fantasy and truth, melding one with the other. Don't bother."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"As a religious Doors fan, I enjoyed this. First off, I don't understand people being upset over \\"rehashed material.\\" So what? How many times are biographers going to interview the same people over and over again? The story doesn't change! My impression is that Davis went nuts finding every interview, book, article, etc regarding Jim Morrison or the Doors and compiled it to something coherent. Each biography out there has something the others don't and this guy just put it all together, giving us a ton of details. So what? And I did find some weird inaccurate quoting in the book, but it doesn't change the meaning of the quote. This is tedious nitpicking.I found the \\"rumors\\" about Morrison intriguing as well. It's pretty pathetic that some people can't consider that perhaps Jim was bisexual. It wouldn't be outside his character, at least in my opinion. Davis makes it clear that there isn't any substantial evidence for some of these rumors or claims (although from actual witnesses) but mentions them anyway so that you could make your own decisions. Some of the rumors are shocking, such as the an allegation by an ex girlfriend stating Jim was raped by his father. Davis isn't making this up as the ex-girlfriend did mention this in an early publication of her book. But he by no means states it as fact but allows us to make our own decisions. \\"Rumors\\" are an essential part of any legend.The inaccuracies that people are mentioning in here are tedious and have no bearing on the legend that is Jim Morrison. For instances: Whether the Light My Fire tire commercial really aired is besides the point. The point is that Morrison was pissed about it (I heard it did air from some people who say they remember it, just sayin'). This book is extremely thorough. I do wish however, it did have resources and that's why its not getting five stars.It's a good complete compilation of information and I enjoyed it enough to listen to the 17 hour audiobook twice in a row."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"This is an excellent biography of Jim Morrison. It is very readable (both in writing style and subject matter) and keeps you turning the page. Morrison doesn't come over as the most likable guy at times, but you do get a real insight into his character and the things that influenced his writing and development. Highly recommended read.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"Basically, this book is a compilation of Jim Morrison's drunk, drugged, and violence-prone episodes that become repetitious and tiring. Jim Morrison the artist and human being gets lost in the mayhem. The author touches on Jim's music and poetry rather lightly, and for anyone interested in a serious examination of Jim the man and his work in music and poetry, I would go and read elsewhere."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"This is easily the best-written of the Morrison biographies. It's much better than the absurdly amateurish and slipshod \\"No One Here Gets Out Alive\\" which, for reasons that must be due to some type of mass hypnosis, is considered a must-read on Morrison. Some Amazon reviewers have called Davis's book \\"NEGATIVE!\\" because Davis has reported Morrison's astonishing and deeply tragic alcoholism, drug use and loutish, often assaultive behavior. Frankly, if all this were left out, we'd have huge gaps in Morrison's story. That's the unvarnished truth. We'd have no idea why he was arrested eleven times (should that be left out, too?), why the Doors were unable to go on lengthy tours, why so many Doors' concerts either ended up in near-riots, were canceled, cut short, or were so poorly performed that their fans (and the other Doors) were disappointed and disgusted. We wouldn't know what formed the basis for Morrison's increasing estrangement from the other band members and why the quality of their output became increasingly sub-par (with notable exceptions, of course). This is not negativity. It's telling it like it was. Anything less would be a censored, Disney-fied version. Davis doesn't dwell on these episodes any more than he needs to. Charges of repetition overlook the car-wreck-fascination of these anecdotes and their essentialness in explaining the band's disintegration and Morrison's emotional and physical collapse.I'm not sure if we'll ever have a truly definitive account of Jim Morrison and the Doors that will satisfy most readers (especially since Manzarek and Densmore are vying to be the official chronicler of the band's history). In the meantime, Stephen Davis's compellingly readable and polished account deserves a better rating than it's received from so many carping and griping reviewers.If you're looking for a mature account of Jim Morrison, this is your best place to start.As a footnote, the previous Amazon reviewer prepared an itemized list of \\"errors\\" that Stephen Davis has allegedly made. First of all, the likely reason why Davis did not provide Ray Manzarek's reasons behind the adoption of The Doors as the band's name was because that would have verged on plagiarism (a sophisticated reviewer would know this). Of course, a concise paraphrase addressing this topic would have passed muster and Davis probably should have done that. But one cannot just lift material en masse in the way the reviewer seems to expect. As for all the other \\"factual\\" discrepancies (is a boot really worth that much analysis?), if you've ever read more than one book on a subject (e.g., the Beatles, James Dean, Elvis, Frank Sinatra, etc.), it's irritatingly usual for some basic details to conflict. Sometimes, it's the author's fault (and then criticism is valid) but sometimes there is more than one version (Davis did some research, too, and also has a bibliography). It's possible for three members of a group to have three differing versions of the same event. But it is sloppy writing on Davis's part to report, as he does, on Morrison's connection with the Warhol crowd in NYC and then state that Warhol was shot \\"days\\" after Bobby Kennedy when, in fact, Warhol was shot the day before RFK was assassinated. This is indicative of someone who has not done his due diligence and it makes one wonder what else Mr. Davis has not taken the time to verify or corroborate. Also, Morrison visited the site of James Dean's crash (over a decade later) and was feeling a connection with the dead legend until he was told that Dean actually \\"died at a hospital several hours\\" after the crash. If this is what Morrison was led to believe, then it's valid to report. But a meticulous, scrupulously informed author would be aware that Morrison was misinformed, that Dean did, in fact, die at the scene of the crash, and would note this in the text."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"'Jim Morrison-Life, Death and Legend' by Stephen Davis isn't a book, it's a compendium of suppositions, heresay, rumors, inuendo and fiction. One can only assume after reading this that Davis was able to defy the laws of physics and construct a time machine and travel back to observe every obscure moment of the life of Jim Morrison.Jim Morrison's teeth chattered as he drank a dozen beers? Jim Morrison drove their rented Puegot sedan at a relaxed pace southward toward Lyon? Jim gets thrown out the back door of a bar and leans up against the wall for half-an-hour? How the hell would Davis know any of these things without being there to observe?And where oh where did Davis come up with \\"mystic heated wine\\"? Really? Mysticated wine is always what I've heard. And, on 'Roadhouse Blues', Hey everybody..it's \\"Do it Robbie..do it!\\" Robbie?..as in Krieger, that guy who was The Doors guitar player. After reading this drivel I am really looking forward to re-reading John Densmore's book which is the best ever written on the subject of Jim Morrison and The Doors."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"When I started reading this book, I was overjoyed at all the information apparently going into this book of every minute detail and read the entire thing, only to find out at the end, that all of what I just read may or may not have been true! Needless to say, I was upset! I got all the way to page 423 before I found a discrepancy and a major discrepancy at that! Quote \\"One day he opened the herald-Tribune and read the obituary of Wharhol's ex-muse Edie Sedgwick, who had died in California of an overdose of barbiturates. End quote. WRONG! Jim died before Edie! As you can see, I'm pretty upset about this and because of this have wondered if anything I have read was real or not! So, in conclusion, I have to totally disregard this book and move on to more viable sources! Stephen Davis, you suck! You really had me going!"},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"I have read six other biographies about The Doors, Morrison and his girlfriend. What struck me was the authenticity of Stephen Davis's account. A few stories are off kilter but the meaning and outcome are the same. He wasn't afraid to call it the way it was. I felt a few if not other authors held back. He told how generous and kind Jim could be and the extent of cruelty he was capable of spewing on the people he cared for. My one question is: I don't think Davis knew Jim . He relied on interviews? Good read even if you aren't fan."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"This is the first book about Jim Morrison that I have read. I chose it because, due to its publication year of 2004, I figured I would cut to the chase and avoid the myths, deceptions, and outright lies that are said to be in earlier biographies of Morrison. (What led me to pick up the book in the first place was hearing the wonderful 40th anniversary remixed CD. I wanted to learn more about Morrison and how this fabulous Doors music was created. I learned much more through this book.) I could not put the book down and found myself impressed with Davis's interview subjects, his lack of Morrison baby pictures and other family memorabilia (probably due to the non-cooperation of Morrison's family members, including his much-absent father, who was still alive at the time of publication), and a desire to paint all sides of Jim, the visionary vs. the jerk, the scholar vs. the rebel, and so on. I even wrote to Davis to thank him for writing it. What I am left with at the end of Davis's book is a deep anger at Admiral Morrison for writing a critical, non-supportive letter to Jim, after Jim wrote to tell his father about the forming of the Doors, with Jim as lead singer. The admiral wrote back and said that Jim had no talent in this area and was wasting time in not finding a real job. Also, Jim's mother, when Jim told her about a sexual abuse incident made against him by a man (\\"someone close to the family,\\" said a tearful Jim to Doors attorney Max Fink, years later), denied that such abuse could have happened and told Jim not to mention it again. No wonder Jim did not have any contact with his parents from the time of his leaving home until his death in Paris seven years later. Where is the love that Jim needed? Not coming from his parents, apparently. I am struck by the juxtaposition of joy and thrills (making music and writing poetry) and Jim's lack of a sense of belonging, a sense of having no home or emotional security. The book is stark in its truth telling, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"Yeah, the one stars kind of confuse me...it looks like it averages to 3 stars, but I gave 4 so I guess that's done and done. This book is filled with different stories then other books I read. It kind of makes Jim out to be RAD (Reactive Attachment Disorder) which would make a lot of sense. Between his dad being gone when he was young and his mom having to take care of him, but a single mother not use a babysitter would be unheard of, but can be more damaging. So Stephen talks about his early life and things he did, yadda, yadda, yadda, then we get to the rock star/poet/wild child. He makes some great points...then leads to his death (c'mon we all saw that coming)with interesting Hypothesis. reading other several books leads me to put IMO (In My Opinion) that Jim died of congestive heart failure. Basically what Corey Haim/Bernie mac suffered from. It was a great read. I was caught in the story and I read the whole thing. But I was upset when Stephen wants to recreate this DOOR's theme that he seems to make up in his mind. I do approve this book...much better and more accurate then that Stones movie with Val Kilmer. In fact you should compare the 2 and you will see a lot of differences. It's worth it to read it. But this book has been around a while."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"Unlike the other reviewers, I liked this book. I have read many biographies about Jim, and in this one I learned a few things that I had not read (or heard) before. Of course there were a lot of rehashed stories, but to only include previously unknown facts would turn the book into a pamphlet. The author stated which stories were substantiated and which were not. It's too bad the Doors' lawyer Max Fink didn't write a book. That man knew a lot about Jim."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"The book starts out with his early years in Florida as he lived with his grandparents until the age of three. Then desribes his life in high school and college at FSU then UCLA with lots of detail and stories. Tells how the band members formed and how he met Pamela. Discusses his homosexual experiences that he supposedly had. It is loaded with stories of him in the band all the times he got drunk and passed out and got in trouble. There are so many details in this book about his life it even mentions how he showed up drunk to fill out paperwork for the military draft and he told them he had homosexual desires. After reading this book you will get a great feel of who Jim Morrison was. I read another book by Ray Manzerek and this book blows his away."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"While I have to agree that Stephen Davis does seem to focus on the negative side of Jim I would have to say that Jim's negative side is what comes out the strongest when looking back into history. This book did a VERY good job explaining his childhood and how that developed him into the amazing man he would become. I am especially interested in that because I am 15 years old. I disagree with those who say this book wasn't researched, because the author gives a long list of books used while writing it. This book really clears up most of the mystery surrounding Jim and his tragic death so that now there is not very much doubt in my mind as to how Jim died. He wasnt murdered, it wasn't suicide. Overall this is a good book about Jim's amazing life and how he lived it."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"As the lead singer of the Doors, Jim Morrison's searing poetic vision and voracious appetite for sexual, spiritual, and psychedelic experience inflamed the spirit and psyche of a generation.

I read it in two days, which is fast for me.I got this book because I've realized that the doors are the reason why I'm interested in literature, philosophy, hallucinogens, music, Bukowski, etc.I'm very unoriginal.Just for the record, I liked Ollie Stone's The Doors when it came out, but hey, I was 20 years old then. Now I think the movie plain sucks, except for Val Kilmer's resurrecting performance.Davis's book is good in parts, but for someone who studied history and philosophy in college, I'd like to see some footnotes. It has none, giving me the impression he took some liberties like Stone did. At least Stephen Davis tells you when he's speculating.The newest thing for me in this book is that Morrison was bisexual. It kind of fits.Well-written. I found myself reading it with a dictionary close at hand. DAavis's vocab is stellar.A lot of what others said in their reviews is dead-on, not a lot of new info. The part about his death is total speculation. No way anyone can know of the things that Davis wrote.Worth the money, however.And for the reviewer who said the Doors were \\"less pychedelic\\" that person needs some acid bad. I've always thought the Doors were the most pyschedelic band ever. Morrison's lyrics are so trippy, even for me who has not done an hallucinogen in 10 years.One thing that Davis did do for me is he kind of, without intending to do so, showed me that Morrison's death and the death of Kurt Cobain are awfully similar. they both had crazy, heroin addicted girlfriends, and murder or suicide could have been the cause.'til the music's over...."},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"This is the best book I had read about Jim Morrison,is very interesting,it talks about his entire life,and the most sad his death,but anyways if you are a Jim Morrison fan,buy it; you will like it,it takes you inside the book like if you are there with the singer by his side,I own a mini collection about The Doors,and this is a good book to add to your collection if you don't have one,start with this book!!!"},{"Title":"Jim Morrison: LIfe, Death, Legend","review":"Jim Morrison understood the power of mythmaking and history, he was an avid fan of Alexander The Great (Morrison copied Alexander's tilted head stance and hair style) and it is fascinating how Morrrison has essentially ended-up like a rock n' roll version of Alexander. His myth grows bigger and bigger with the passsage of time, his influence on popular culture is always evident, especially in music, always in music. And like Alexander, Morrison is now buried under a pile of could be true or false, he has become lost in a haze of legend and fact. As a result books are always written about the guy, so many that now the harder task isn't actually finding a book on Morrison and The Doors, but finding a book worthy of one's time. Stephen Davis, well-known for his epic Led Zeppelin bio \\"Hammer Of The Gods,\\" takes on the Morrison story here in \\"Jim Morrison: Life, Death, Legend.\\" The result is a well-written biography that for avid Doors fans will turn out to be one of those experiences where you race through the famous aspects of the subject's life that have already been told over and over and over and try to find anything new or revelatory. Some fans will of course check and see how the well-known areas compare to their descriptions in other prominent works like \\"No One Here Gets Out Alive\\" and \\"Break On Through: The Life And Death Of Jim Morrison\\" (which I still consider the best). Davis is not a Morrison basher, on the contrary he seems genuinely fascinated by the man and the way his myth has survived the passage of time, as well as the music and words. Some chapters are written with feverish intensity in the way they describe The Doors' performances where Morrison seemed possessed, collapsing on stage and screaming in ecstacy, in essence he tried to bring a Dionysian identity to rock and as a result created the kind of rock, shock theater taken to the next level by Iggy Pop, Alice Cooper and Marilyn Manson. Each section begins with a memorable quote by figures as established as Nietzsche and William S. Burroughs (Davis uses Burroughs' comic statement about how he never believed Morrison died in a Paris bathtub, it simply seemed too odd to him), this helps enhance the fact that Morrison was first and foremost a poet, a lover of literature and drama. Davis in a sense paints the same picture of Morrison from \\"Break On Through\\" and Oliver Stone's popular movie \\"The Doors,\\" that of an artist who was brilliant and created immortal material, but was eventually destroyed by his quest in excess. There are fascinating stories through-out about Morrison's affairs with figures like the Velvet Underground's Nico, but the most scorching revelation in the book is that Morrison had a bisexual side. This may not seem as a surprise, the tales of rock debauchery are known far and wide, but Morrison has simply never been directly connected with homosexual behaviour. There are also allegations that he was sexually abused as a child and this therefore could have contributed to the inner demons burning inside him. Davis approaches the subject cautiously and it feels plausible. Other than that, the book is an interesting, entertaining study in rock history and one of the 60's most enduring figures. Few rock stars have been placed alongside names like Allen Ginsberg and Burroughs, Davis here gives a convincing portrait that shows why Morrison is also rightly acknowledged as a poet just as much as a rock star. There are little historical notes on The Doors' influence on Punk and how the Morrison myth has evolved through the years. One touching moment describes how Morrison's sister Anne received his award in his place when the band was inducted into the Rock N' Roll Hall Of Fame (Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder sang classic hits with the band). \\"Jim Morrison: Life, Death, Legend\\" is also more up to date than most available books on Morrison and it goes into the recent reunion of the band and their current legal squabbles (the band is now touring with The Cult's Ian Astbury on vocals). Davis has written an impressive book that will be valuable to those barely being introduced into the Doors legend and who are hungry for info on Jim Morrison, the man and myth. Some of the most important rock artists of the past thirty years including Patti Smith and U2, have pointed out Morrison as a huge influence and Davis delivers a fitting biography, maybe a bit controversial, but that is in the spirit of The Doors.
