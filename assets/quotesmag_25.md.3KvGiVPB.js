Alas, I fear that none will be as good as the first one I read - Spring Snow. I really didn't think people could still write like this in the 20th century. I mean, star-crossed, tragic love was an old subject by the time Shakespeare got to it - what made Mishima think he could write something new about it hundreds of years later? But something did, and I'm glad it did. For while there is a [very interesting] historical context to Spring Snow (tell me, what other book paints such a visceral portrait of early 20th century Japan?), the focus is on the love story. And no one writes love stories like Yukio Mishima. Somehow, it manages to avoid the gaping pitfalls of sentimentalism and melodrama, creating instead a world of great beauty and fragility that I was loath to leave when the book drew to its close.If you read a biography of Mishima, you will likely find mountains of speculation concerning his various eccentricities (and that word is putting is nicely, methinks). Some will accuse him of right-wingery, others will rant about his &quot;nationalism,&quot; etc. etc. etc. But I think that none of that applies. He was in no way a political person, just a hopelessly deluded romantic who still believed that romantic ideals had any place in modern society. This he applied to politics as well as to everything else. Spring Snow, fortunately, contains no politics, concentrating instead on romantic ideals as applied to the personal. The result is something that, while being Japanese through and through, is accessible to anyone. This book is worth reading for the marvelously poetic descriptions alone. I shan't say that it will &quot;change your life,&quot; since that's cliche and more often than not utterly wrong, but I daresay that you will have an indelible impression made upon your mind. At first, you may not notice it, but as time passes, you will find that you remember large parts of Spring Snow on countless occasions, and you will find yourself recalling parts of it as examples of great beauty and purity, and reflexively applying them to your own life. And then you will cheer Mishima as quite possibly the last romantic on Earth. That is exactly what happened to me."},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"Mishima has the ability to get underneath the skin of his readers. What seems like an innocent and harmless story of adolescence gradually becomes one of fundamental importance. In my view, this is the most brilliant of the three Mishima novels I have read. It is a masterpiece which leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. None of Mishima's characters seem happy and even the 'heroes' are ambiguous, despite the fact that many of them are perfect in physical terms. We have to judge the character for ourselves without help, rather like a film without background music. There is a strong homo-erotic undercurrent in Mishima's work, even though the central relationship in this novel is heterosexual. The focal character, Kiyoaki, seems to be massochistic and derives a form of pleasure from his own destruction.I would strongly recommend anyone who is interested in the complexities of relationships and the specific cultural life of Japan to read this novel. Above all, it should be read for the intricacy and skill of its literature."},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"Spring Snow is a dramatic, moving work that helps codify Mishima's tetralogy, the Sea of Fertility, as perhaps the 20th century's greatest magnum opus. Mishima writes in a delicately impressionistic style, employing similes and metaphors of subtle, almost fragile beauty, that create a vivid and harmonic unity that simply inspire awe. Like Dante, he moves the reader's spirit as his characters spirits evolve. Like Dostoyevsky, he plunges relentlessly into the dark caprices of the mind. Like Milton, his word choice was so perfect that I put down the Sea of Fertility wishing that I had written it myself.Spring Snow, the first installment of the cycle, stands very well on its own (though its ultimate meaning can only be appreciated as the tetralogy is continued). It takes place early in 20th century Japan, a time of transition in which Japan's decreased isolation leads to a Westernization that ultimately proves Spring Snow to be an elegy for the samurai tradition. It is also a wonderful and tragic love story -- far more convincing than Romeo and Juliet -- in which an impossible and doomed love threatens the young protagonists whose wealthy families adjust to the changing sociopolitical climate of Japan.The other three books in the cycle are (in order):'Runaway Horses,' 'The Temple of Dawn,' and 'The Decay of the Angel'"},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"This, the first book of author Mishima's Sea of Fertility Tetralogy, is a very curious one to read or to attempt to review. Most of the other reviewers here focus on Mishima's life and even more notorious - or perhaps, marvellous, depending on how one views it - death and the author's social/political beliefs which are rather blatant in this book, or so it seemed to me; otherwise, they turn completely to the \\"love story\\" here. All point to what a great novelist Mishima is and what a profound novel he has penned here.Sorry, I just don't see it. The problem is that there is no real \\"story\\". Indeed, a ponderous stasis hangs over the work and the protagonist's, Kiyoaki's, love life and all life in general. What the book IS then is a philosophical treatise presented as a sort of puppet show in which the characters, particularly Kiyoaki, come to represent certain viewpoints on life which end up being, mutatis mutandis, the same perspective. Kiyoaki's world is his dream world, which he regards, to the end of the book, as the most important part of his life to which everything in the physical realm pales in comparison. Consistent with this perspective, he keeps a dream diary rather than a diary, though as is maddeningly commonplace in novels of this sort (Laurence Durrell's Alexandria Quartet is the most absurd example of this contrived lacuna), we readers are never given a glance into it. Rather, what we are given in Chapter 6 of this novel/treatise is the primary thesis:\\"For everything sacred has the substance of dreams and memories, and so we experience the memory of what is separated from us by time or distance suddenly being made tangible. Dreams, memories, the sacred - they are all alike in that they are all beyond our grasp. Once we are even marginally separated from what we can touch, the object is sanctified; it acquires the beauty of the unattainable, the quality of the miraculous. Everything, really, has this quality of sacredness, but we can desecrate it at a touch. How strange man is! His touch defiles and yet he contains the source of miracles.\\"This citation is on p.43 of my edition, and it comes as no surprise on p.267, after Kiyoaki's earthly adoration of Satoko has fallen apart, to hear Honda astutely diagnosing his friend's predicament:\\"From the very beginning you've been bewitched by an IMPOSSIBILITY - something which is outside the scope of authority and money. You were drawn in because the whole thing was impossible. Am I wrong? And if it became possible for you now, would it have any value for you?\\"And, it is also completely consistent and comes as no surprise that Kiyoaki's ultimate reflection on his love is:\\"He was only concerned with when the two of them could meet without anxiety, as freely as they liked, regardless of anyone else. And he feared that by now it could only happen in some place beyond this world, and only when this world had been destroyed.\\"This is the logical conclusion of the Romantic Weltanschauung, as others have pointed out as regards Mishima and this book, one with which I deeply sympathise and which has led to some of the greatest English poetry (q.v. Shelley) and even novels (q.v. Wuthering Heights) ever written. But it doesn't lead to it here, simply because, as stated earlier, the book simply doesn't possess the architectonics of a novel, with engrossing characters, vivid descriptions which imprint themselves on the reader, lively language, the element of surprise or even haunting scenes.Chapter after chapter even unto the tragic end leave one sighing to oneself, \\"Yes, this is all rather to be expected.\\" It seems that many readers have convinced themselves that the one prerequisite for great literature is that it be languid and boring, as this novel is, whilst the opposite is the case: Great literature is writing which utterly transforms your world in the most exciting manner imaginable, as Proust, to whom Mishima is often - for some reason - compared, does.Interesting philosophy. Boring novel."},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"Perhaps I shouldn't review this book in light of the fact that I haven't read the whole tetralogy.

Back then the book presented a very good picture of the aristocratic life of early 1900's Japan to me. I read it at it's face value, as a tragic love story. The story was so intense and quiet full of suspense that I went thru 7 sleepless nights in a row to finish this great book. Eight years later, I have a second reading of this book. Since I had grown more mature since my first reading, I am able to detect more of the underlying ideas in the book. Ideas such as patriotism VS self-interst, self-gratification VS self-restraint, are 2 such forces that drive the plot."},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"Mishima, in his writing, is often preoccupied with aesthetic beauty. His characters slaver after it, long to assume it, and when apprehension is discovered to be forever out of reach, they long to remove this aesthetic beauty, this otherwordly perfection from the earth vis a vis a dramatic spectacle, which in turn becomes beauty itself.Along with this obsession with beauty is a suspicion or a questioning of the intrinsic utility of beauty. What is the purpose of perfection if such perfection is ineffectual and even inimical to the human condition apart from the fact that beauty is beauty is beauty . . . ad nauseum?In many ways Mishima uses Spring Snow as a means of inverting the sentiment of Keats' notion of \\"Beauty is truth, truth is beauty . . .&quot; However, unlike the spectacle that beauty evokes in some of Mishima's other writings (and even his life), the bubble of spectacle never pops in Spring Snow, instead, beauty ferments and spreads like cancer.In this novel, Mishima's main characters, Satoka and Kiyoaki, are destroyed by their beauty, their elegance, their noble breeding. Kiyoaki is analogous to Hamlet in his diffidence and his psychic inertia. Moreover, his brilliant physical beauty compounds the aforementioned with an overly large measure of pride, which, along with noble breeding, hermetically seals him into a jar of dreams, self-doubt, anomie, and ennui. Satoka, likewise, is beautiful, perfect, and her perfection carries and transmits a self-possessed, cold, and almost painful glare to the public eye. However, to Kiyoaki, Satoka is a smoldering woman of passion, full of riddles and intrigue. Kiyoaki, inexperienced, prideful, and nave, desires to reciprocate this passion only when it becomes taboo, and then he falls headlong into a brilliant and lavish darkness full of gauntness, full, blush moons, and supple waves. Their consummation is sweet but tinctured with doom.Had the two had a grander purpose than getting drunk off this surfeit of poisonous love, had their hearts and minds been bound to something to divert them from their egocentricity, the story would have been far different. But in the end, as Romeo and Juliet's love dies, the love of Satoka and Kiyoaki dies.However, unlike Shakespeare, Mishima denies the reader the succor of suicide. Satoka is left a tonsured, Buddhist nun, while Kiyoaki dies of pneumonia. The end of beauty is filled with emotion, but the beautiful are ineffectual, useless, and cannot ever perform substantive act that will secure their happiness or seal their fate (definitely not in the case of Kiyoaki, perhaps in the case of Satoka). However, beauty does not completely fade at the death of their love as Kiyoaki leaves his dream journal to his even-keeled, logical, and diligent friend, Honda. In this way beauty lives on, but exists not as truth but as germ or infection. Beauty dies, destroys, and spreads its seed. It is the spring snow, quiet, pure, each multi-tendriled snowflake delicate, unique, an unusual attenuation heralding the end of spring, girded by the assumption that another spring will come only for the deadly beauty of the quiet, pure spring snow to come again, to take root, and surreptitiously and gracefully destroy idle youth."},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"\\"Spring Snow\\" is unquestionably one of the finest Japanese novels ever written, as well as being a masterpiece of world literature in its own right. It is an eloquent, moving story with a \\"tale as old as time,\\" that of star-crossed lovers who's love transcends social roles and obligations.In another culture, with another writer, this would be a romantic, if not happy, story. But this is Japan, and the writer is Mishima Yukio. In his hands, the lovers Kiyoaki and Satoko transcend literary stereotypes, and become agents of their own happiness and destruction. By the very nature of their relationship, raised together since childhood, playing a complicated cat-and-mouse game of love and sexual tension, their future is never in doubt.It is impressive that a writer such as Mishima, known for his right-wing politics and his samurai dreams, could craft such a tender love story. While knowing the eventual conclusion, the reader savors and hopes for each stolen moment of happiness between Kiyoaki and Satoko, and knows that even their despair is something to be treasured because it is shared. Not that it is a clear path. Even knowing Japanese literature, and the road it usually takes, there are surprises on the way. Things do not turn out the way one would expect.I was incredibly moved by \\"Spring Snow.\\" It is a novel that affects the heart of the reader, and lingers long after the last page is turned."},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"Just finished reading an excellent book, just a few minutes ago, and I feel compelled to write a review, while ideas are still fresh in my mind.This is the first book I've finished reading for my Summer Reading. The book is called Snow Spring (Haru no Yuki) by Mishima Yukio and its the first book in his masterpiece, The Sea of Fertility or Hojou no Umi. The Sea of Fertility is a series of four novels by one of Japan's greatest authors. The book I have is the Vintage International edition, translated by Michael Gallagher.This novel really moved me. In the last 100 pages, I couldn't do anything but finish it. Just like a short story by Edgar Allan Poe, where the reader hangs onto every word until the truth and mystery is finally revealed in the last word, so does this novel grip the reader.On the surface is a conventional tale of the Japanese idea of unrequited love, a theme that is done over and over again in Japanese fiction. What sets this piece apart from others, is Mishima narrative drive and richly detailed characters and the psychological insight into every major and minor character involved.Kiyoaki begins his ill fated relationship with the beautiful Satoko, whom he has known all his life. At first he disregards her and then he is on fire to obtain her love after she is engaged to a Prince. Wealthy families are invovled in making the Wedding ceremony a success and any type of scandal leaking out to the press must be avoided at all costs. But Kioyaki single minded determination to pursure Satoko, despite such obstacles, causes the reader to want him to succeed.On the one hand, Kiyoaki lets his desires and emotions rage out of control and on the other all those emotions put him into action. He used to sit around in his room all day, lonely and depressed, until he just decided to pusure love. Its his drive to obtain love and his selfish quest for Satoko's heavenly beauty that pushes him along page after page. These type of overly romantic novels can quickly turn unwittingly comical in lesser writer. But Mishima combines the richness of Japanese traditional and culture with romantic ideas of love and realistic views, based in concrete reality, that prevent the work from becoming a low form of soap opera.The novel is both realistic novel and emotional charged romantic that causes the entire work to be a cleverly crafted paradox. For example, Honda is Kiyoaki's best friend in high school. Honda has a revelation that he must prevent Kiyoaki from pursuing Satoko becomes of his friend's harmful obession. The fact that Honda can't bring himself to hurt his friend by giving him a cold rational arguement, shows love between friends that isn't distorted by irrational love. Kiyoaki's love for Satoko is more based on his own selfish fantasy. It is this fantastic love that wins out between Satoko and over Honda, who had good intentions but failed to act on them. Irrational love wins out over the gloom of reality.Without giving away any more of the story, let me just end with how this book took over my imagination and wouldn't let it go for 2 whole days. All day Saturday and all Sunday afternoon, I cared more about the characters in this story then my own family. I couldn't do anything else except finish reading it.It starts out slow but builds to a breakneck speed in the end. It is highly recommended for anyone who wants to read an excellent novel this Summer. Forget about it being Japanese and look past all that exoticism and you will see the novel for all its beauty.Today I will start on the second novel in the series, called Runaway Horses.I can't wait."},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"While the last three books of Mishima's Sea of Fertility cycle tend to get bogged down in somewhat convoluted philosophical arguments, which may hold interest for some (Temple of Dawn), or by uninspired writing (Runaway Horses), Spring Snow, the first, displays no such weakness.

What's more, this translation truly does justice to the beauty of the original Japanese."},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"A work of utter splendor, Spring Snow is the first installment of Yukio Mishima's magnificent tetralogy.I read the 4 books as in a trance in the fleeting light of a long gone summer. And like Mishima, finishing the Sea of Fertility made me feel as if it were the end of the world.Shatteringly beautiful, lined with infinite grace, agonizingly moving, Mishima's last work is perhaps the crowning achievement of 20th century world literature."},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"For a Japanese nationalist, Yukio Mishima seems to have had an appreciation for European literature, as demonstrated in his wonderful novel \\"Spring Snow,\\" the first part of a tetralogy. Taking place in Tokyo in the years following the Russo-Japanese war and just before the first world war, it has the atmosphere of a richly detailed nineteenth-century epic with an almost Tolstoyan sense of national history and the scope and melodrama of a Stendhalian romance. Appropriately, one of its themes is the gradual influx of Western influence on Japanese culture, which Mishima, himself loyal to the Samurai tradition, might well have resisted.Most of the novel's characters are members of the aristocratic society of imperial Japan. One of these is Kiyoaki, the eighteen-year-old son of the Marquis Matsugae, a noble of the royal court. Kiyoaki is a handsome boy who attracts many girls but is too sullen and withdrawn to make many friends at school; as it is, his only companion is a bright classmate named Shigekuni Honda who works hard to please his strict parents by studying law. Kiyoaki has a tutor named Iinuma who secretly disrespects his pupil because he feels that Kiyoaki, representing the moral decadence of the new era, dishonors his ancestors and the dignity of old Japan. There are also two Siamese princes who through diplomatic channels are acquainted with the Matsugaes and attend Kiyoaki's school; they make a comical duo, at least until the tragedy that calls them home to Siam.The story pertains mainly to the troubled love affair between Kiyoaki and Satoko, the daughter of Count Ayakura, whose family is close to the Matsugaes and lives on a nearby estate. Kiyoaki and Satoko were playmates in childhood, so it is no surprise that adolescence has brought mutual romantic feelings. However, her assertive and unsubmissive attitude offends his pride; he cannot envision her as his wife. After he spurns her, she accepts a marriage proposal from Prince Harunori Toin, a high-ranking military officer; the engagement is formalized by receiving official authorization from the Imperial Household Ministry.Satoko, aware that Prince Harunori is a dispassionate drone, consents to continue seeing Kiyoaki, their trysts aided and abetted by Honda and her maidservant Tadeshina, until one day when she wakes up with morning sickness. Imagine the imminent scandal--a young lady soon to be a princess in a marriage sanctioned by the Empire, pregnant by another man before her wedding! How could she be so irresponsible, and how could Kiyoaki have such contempt for imperial honor? This volatile situation involving the reputations of both the Matsugae and the Ayakura families advances the story to a nearly Shakespearean plateau, particularly when Satoko, heeding Hamlet's advice to Ophelia, gets herself to a (Buddhist) nunnery. Kiyoaki's desperate effort to visit her in the convent during the unseasonable weather indicated in the title ends the novel with a delicate poignancy.\\"Spring Snow\\" is a masterly composition that portrays a picturesque Japan in transition from the grand ceremoniousness of the imperial aristocracy to the new Europeanized etiquette. The wealthy Japanese are teaching English in their schools, driving British cars, wearing British clothes, listening to German music on German gramophones, even celebrating Christmas without ostensibly observing Christianity. Mishima, perhaps identifying himself with the discontented Iinuma, may have seen this as cultural degeneration, but his chronicle implies nothing disastrous about the beginning of the century in which his country, bolstered by the prosperity of its elite, was to become a world power."},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"This is probably the most beautifully rendered work I have ever had the pleasure to read. Mishima's sense of photographic realism in describing turn of the (last) century Japan is matched only by the precision psychological portraits he paints of his ornately drafted characters.

Once Mishima's words enter your bloodstream, you will be forever haunted by his craft.

Kiyoaki's failings are human and familiar; acting on rash impulses, immaturity, a failure to realise what he wants till he has lost it. Mishima's characterisation is finely drawn and accurate. The scheming Tadeshina turns out to have her own secret heartbreak, enervated Ayakura lacks guile but not luck, the ancient loyalties of the Abessess make her a formidable eminence grice. The characters are at once individually drawn and representative of a unique and fascinating era of flux and change in Japan, as ancient modes of behaviour gave way to modernising forces.

So much happens in this novel (a year of time roughly) but most of it takes place in the minds of the characters, not actually between/among them. In that sense, Mishima builds up a lot of anticipation but this is sadly a case of \\"over-promise and under-deliver.\\"The last 75 pages are quite long considering that so little action takes place. The best moments are when Mishima has 2 of his characters in close quarters, when they actually talk, sense and react to each other. When the book is bad, it goes into the mind of a character and lets us follow his/her ruminations to unnecessary lengths. There are strong scenes here, but (and normally I hate to say this) the novel would have fared better had it been edited more. It is overblown.

Mishima is not only one of the great Japanese writers, but he's one of the great writers, period.Spring Snow is set around 1912-1913 and is about the relationship between Kiyoaki Matsugae, the son of an up and coming rich and influential family, and Satoko Ayakura, the daughter of a traditional aristocratic family. When Kiyoaki was little, his father sent him to live with Satoko's family to learn the elegance of an aristocratic family. As the novel starts, Kiyoaki is 18 living with his parents again, but he and Satoko are in love, even though their actions don't always appear so. Satoko seems to toy with Kiyoaki a bit, and this causes Kiyoaki's feelings to readily fluctuate between love and hate. This is a psychological novel in that Mishima takes us deep into his characters' minds, and we are taken along for a ride with Kiyo's thoughts and feelings, which are by turn self-centered, arrogant, fearful, and petulant. All of Kiyo's waffling instigates the main crisis of the book when Satoko becomes engaged to a Prince despite giving Kiyo ample opportunity to protest the engagement and claim Satoko's hand for himself.Mishima's writing is rich. He leaves very little to the imagination, crisply describing not only the scenes and what the characters look like, but also their inner thoughts. And not just Kiyo's but other characters too like Honda and Iunuma. In fact Honda, who is Kiyo's best friend, serves as the main witness in the novel, and Mishima gives us much of the granularity of feeling in regards to their friendship, which, like Kiyo's and Satoko's, can be moody and wavering. Iunuma is Kiyo's tutor and a frustrated character due to what he considers the degradation of Japan. In fact, the primary themes of the book revolve around the Westernization of Japan at that time. This is demonstrated most profoundly in the contrast between the rising Matsugae family and the falling Ayakura, but also in smaller ways, such as the occasional western dress of some characters and the Western decorations of the Mastugae home.At heart though, this is a romance. The resolution of the book is the resolution of Kiyo's and Satoko's love. And as with any great romance, the result may seem predictable after the fact, but it is anything but when you're reading the book. Spring Snow is one of the great books of the 20th century. I would recommend it to anyone interested in Japanese culture or just a good old complicated love story."},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"Yukio Mishima's \\"Spring Snow\\" is inevitably compared to a Japanese garden, a reference perhaps to the delicacy of the descriptions of the novel's various settings or to the way it evokes the personal beauty of the protagonist and his lover. The love story of \\"Spring Snow\\" also is often compared to \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" in reference to the youth and heedlessness of the two lovers, Kioyaki Matsugae and Satoko Ayakura, as well as to the nurse-figure, Tadeshina, who acts as a go-between. If you have never read a novel by Mishima, however, these comparisons are not especially helpful and don't convey the feeling you'll have when you read \\"Spring Snow\\": that a world has opened to view that is so different that you can only admire it and understand it as best you can.Since the novel is set in a particular historical period, the early Taisho era, at least a cursory knowledge of modern Japanese history is extremely helpful in understanding the tensions in the society of this period between traditional Japanese culture and the powerful forces of Westernization. (A good short history of this period is Ian Buruma's \\"Inventing Japan: 1853-1964.\\") \\"Spring Snow\\" is a historical novel, one that is as distant to a Japanese reader as it is to an American reader, and in the contrast between the characters of Marquis Matsugae, Kioyaki's pompous and rather dissolute father, and the Marquis's old mother, whose toughness and humble origins have not entirely been smoothed away by prosperity, one senses Mishima's interest in an age that was disappearing at the time of the novel's setting: 1912. I use the word \\"interest\\" rather than \\"nostalgia,\\" because the other character who recalls an earlier age, Satoko's father, Count Ayakura, is so genteel, so utterly unconnected to the modern world around him, that he invites contempt. I enjoyed this novel very much (and am looking forward to reading the other novels in the \\"Sea of Fertility\\" tetralogy). However, I want to stress once more that a basic familiarity with Japanese history and places is enormously helpful and will increase your pleasure in this novel."},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"In \\"Spring Snow,\\" Yukio Mishima has chosen the perfect title for his novel. The narrative is as gentle and as beautiful as wet snow on spring blossoms, and indeed there is a poignant scene where two lovers have a tryst in a rickshaw under such conditions. It was my first foray into the world of Mishima -- indeed, of Japanese literature -- and will not be my last.The story of a young and handsome aristocrat, Kiyoaki Matsugae, and the beautiful and mysterious Ayakura Satoko, comes from the same time-honored tradition of as more familiar star-crossed lovers such as Romeo and Juliet, Pyramus and Thisbe, Tristan and Isolde, and Lancelot and Guinevere. Set just after the Russo-Japanese War in the early 20th century, the novel offers intriguing insights into a Japanese culture that is at once in flux and clinging to traditions.If you love a writer whose strength is description of nature, Mishima is not to be missed. His words are as fit as any Nature Channel special on the wonders of Japan and he is equally adept at describing the contours of his young lovers' bodies. In addition to the sensual and sensuous wonders, the inner psychology of passion-plagued minds is a point of expertise for this writer. He deftly avoids sentimentalism while walking the thin line between hatred and love, between passion and pain.Symbolism, description, psychology, and a gentle narrative pace. What's not to love? Readers looking for a fast-paced plot might not be overwhelmed, but those who love it when they stumble upon a \\"writer's writer\\" will be glad they tried Yukio Mishima. It is the first book of the tetralogy, \\"The Sea of Fertility.\\""},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"This is the first of a group of four novels by Mishima called The Sea of Fertility. Taken as a group they are excellent novels or even what one might call a literary masterpiece. The four books are:- \\"Spring Snow,\\"- \\"Runaway Horses,\\"- \\"The Temple of Dawn,\\" and- \\"The Decay of the Angel.\\"I asked another reader if Mishima's book \\"Spring Snow\\" was a universal story or a period piece unique to Japan. They were a bit uncertain. The good news is that it is both. It is a modern 20th century version of Romeo and Juliet - or a similar type of theme but not identical to Shakespeare's drama by any stretch - but having said that, there are many parallels. It is set in Tokyo around 1912; it involves two families and two lovers; there is a problem betrothal involving the female protagonist Satoko (Kiyoaki is the male); and there are outside forces at work - the Royal family. To say more would be to give away the plot. I am not an expert on Japanese literature but I thought that it rated 5 stars.It is a clear and compelling read, and I sat down glued to the book and read 270 pages the first day. For that reason - along with the beauty of the story and the scenery and the characters - it deserves 5 stars. As I reached the end of the book, I thought that the story faltered slightly. Also, the author is great but perhaps not brilliant nor very innovative. He is touted as being \\"like Dostoevsky\\" on the book jacket - a quote from the Christian Science Monitor. Yes, there are some fabulous scenes and excellent writing that transports the reader to Japan, and a rickshaw ride through a snowy spring afternoon. But, before reading the book, I had just finished reading the masterpiece Crime and Punishment by Dostoevsky, and some short stories by Chekhov. In comparison, Mishima's love story seemed a bit light compared to Dostoevsky, but perhaps on par with Chekhov. That is not a bad comparison.In reading the prose, I had the same feeling reading this book as I did when I read some of Saul Bellow's books, especially Herzog. Mishima seems to put a lot of emotional energy into the writing and he says things that are a bit on the edge of social norms. In a society such as Japan, the book must have been a bit racy when it came out.Is it a world class masterpiece? Probably not on its own, but it is exceptional. Taken as a group of four, The Sea of Fertility group might be a masterpiece series. This is an excellent book and I highly recommend the read.As a final note, this book has no introduction or extra notes on the author or the book. It is just the basic book, but it seems to be an excellent translation."},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"Just after author Yukio Mishima finished the final novel in his \\"Sea of Fertility\\" tetralogy on November 25, 1970, he disemboweled himself in a ritual suicide--seppuku. Mishima, aged forty-five, believed whole-heartedly in the strengths of the old Japanese emperors and in the strong, aristocratic culture that had evolved from the samurai. Spring Snow, written in 1966, is the first of the four novels of what is generally regarded as his masterpiece, a series which explores the essence of life, the spiritual beliefs which make that life meaningful, the obligations of man to a wider society, the relationship of chance to free will, and the glory of dying for one's beliefs. By using a historical approach, with each of these novels taking place later than the previous one, and by repeating his characters, Mishima allows the reader to see Japanese cultural and social history change over a fifty-year period.Spring Snow begins in 1912. The Meiji dynasty has ended, and Kiyoake Matsugae is a schoolboy at the exclusive, but rigidly spartan, Peers School. By age fifteen, Kiyoake, schooled in courtly manners, appears ready to make his mark within the court. He does, however, hate the militant atmosphere and prefers a more artistic, emotional life. Satoko Ayakura, two years older, is the daughter of the family where Kiyoake grew up, and when he begins to have romantic feelings for her, he is caught in the philosophical no-man's-land between the harshly rigid values of his school (and much of his culture) and his own feelings of need for warmth and communication. Though she is also attracted to him, he refuses to admit that he needs anyone or anything to be a man, and he alternately encourages and rejects any future relationship.The novel uses this relationship to illustrate Mishima's themes of change. Though Satoko has virtually no importance because she is a woman, the reader cannot help but identify with her, and Kiyoake, at eighteen, is so conflicted that many contemporary western readers will despair of his achieving any enlightenment at all. The reaction of his friend, Shigekuni Honda, a fellow-student, and of Iinuma, his personal tutor, both of whom are repeating characters in the tetralogy, keep the conflicts in focus and guide the reader to an understanding of the author's purpose. Mishima's several forays into philosophical analysis, in the course of the novel, provide wider perspective into his own attitudes toward life, love, and death, and though they do sometimes feel intrusive and not quite integrated, but they counteract the melodrama and romance which might otherwise overwhelm the narrative.Mishima describes the houses, clothing, rituals, and even hairstyles of the period in detail, adding to the epic sweep of the novel. The need for a character's real feelings to be hidden, as the required patterns for communication are observed, is both frustrating and enlightening, and his use of symbols from nature add to the atmosphere and the novel's meanings. Despite Mishima's awesome reputation and his notoriety as a result of his ritual suicide, his writing is not esoteric. Instead, he writes in an accessible, descriptive style which graphically conveys the culture of Japan in the days leading up to World War I. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"&quot;See just the trees, but not the forest&quot; is an old Chinese saying, meaning to comprehend, and thus evaluate, things only from partial angles and views. To assess/critic, even compare any one of the 4 &quot;Sea of Fertility&quot; novels is to do just that. The 4 novels are all part of a grand design in a way very much like 4 movements from a symphony. Yes each novel stands on its own as a great literature accomplishment, but so does each movement of any symphony by Beethoven or Mahler. Now, I am not a write or a literature critic in any shape or form, but I have read the complete &quot;Sea of Fertility&quot; twice before, and am onto &quot;Runaway Horses&quot; for the third time now. Just want to remind every one that, these novels are not meant to be read individually."},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"It is truly rare nowadays that a novel with such depth, emotion, and poetry lands in our hands. Yukio Mishima put every ounce of himself into this amazing work. Many of the other reviews touch on the characters and events in the novel, I will instead provide a little background information that helped my overall appreciation for this novel and the novels of Yukio Mishima in general.First, most of his novels are greatly influenced by his past and his upbringing. Mishima's family was very strict and adhered to the bushido, or the loyal and honored code of the samurai. Mishima loved and respected the Emperor and believed, as many did, that the Emperor ruled by divine right. His beliefs were smashed at the end of World War II, when the Emperor admitted defeat, admitted that he was not 'a god', and then did not commit seppuku (ritual samurai suicide). Mishima spent his life (especially the Sea of Fertility tetralogy ) bemoaning the fall of the code of honor and the influence of Western society and culture on the emerging, modern Japan. This message is often subtle, but does lie at the heart of most of his later works.Mishima stated that once he finished his tetralogy he would die, and thus on the day he finished the final novel, he committed seppuku in defiance of the modern Japanese government and ideals.This novel is so well written that it does not read out as a political manifesto; instead the reader is drawn into a Japan that most westerners never experienced. Japan had just finished the Sino-Japanese war and was heading towards their minor role in World War I (and eventually into WWII). Western influence is evident in many places, but it is never looked down upon. Though Kiyoaki seems overly childish at points, he is a perfect metaphor for the entire country of Japan. Those who clung to outdated codes of honor were left behind; those embracing the power, the zeal, and the thirst for Imperial expansion profited and move ahead in life (this was also key in Mishima's own life).Again, reading the novel as just a love story is utterly satisfying, but adding in the historical aspect, this is unbelievably rich and rewarding. Please read some of the other reviews and pick up a copy today; at the library or online. Just read it."},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"I'll keep it short here. This is a wonderful book like nothing I've ever read before. I recommend it to anyone who loves a good, non-mainstream classic. Specifically, the characterization in this book is wonderfully done."},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"I read this book after a friend's strong recommendation. Overall this book is beautifully written and absolutely captivating. The central plot on its own for this first book in the tetralogy is not something that we have never seen or heard before, but Mishima is unparalleled when it comes to his unique style in detailed character development. Though slow moving at first, by 1/2 way through the book, you are completely immensed in the world he so delicately paints. I find myself thumb a few section of the book over and over to truely get the multiple meanings Mishima is trying to convey. Aside from great character development, the book is FILLED with facts and descriptions of the different flavors of Buddhism, Japanese history during the 1920s and tons of other subjects (reincarnation etc), which makes the reading experience all that more complete. I am moving onto the 2nd book in the tetralogy, as for the ending of this book left many questions unanswered. I have a feeling Mishima was in a bit of rush towards the end, hence I am hoping to get a more complete picture of the author's thoughts after completing the whole tetralogy. This is not to say this book doesn't stand on its own, but I am sure when viewed as part of the tetralogy, it has more meaning than just a love tragedy. Spring Snow is definitely not for the faint of heart, but if you are a true fan of fine literature and Japanese culture, this book will be at the top of your list as well."},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"This work is mesmerizing - so much so that I read it instead of studying for the Bar exam. It is not a fast read by any stretch of the imagination but it is difficult to put down once you are drawn into the world Mishima draws. It took me two attempts to get past the first twenty pages but four years later it is the last book I read which had the potential to transform. I also confess that the novel is confusing and I don't believe that I understand the subtle dream world that Mishima writes of on a conscious or intellectual level. But the novel is haunting and presents a story of love (not, I believe, the one that is portrayed on the novel's surface) in such indescribable complexity and depth that the novel is felt in and remains in the heart of the reader who will walk away from the novel with a profound sadness. The novel is one of the few worth the effort of reading. And the title, a beautiful image, is a perfect recapitulation of the work."},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"Briefly, the Sea of Fertility tetrology has much in common with Dostoevsky. Mishima's characters act within the tight confines of aristoocratic Japan in the early to mid 20th Century. However, the real story underneath the cultural one involves a brilliant and sustained discussion of the Budhist conceptions of samsara, karma and reincarnation. Mishima's investigation of this subject covers Hindu, ancient Greek, 19th Century German and countless schools of Budhism."},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"I purchased this as 'used, hard cover' A real nice copy of this excellent Mishima book. Well packed, quick shipment, more than fair price.This is a love story with epic proportion, a story of tragic love. Spring Snow deals with romantic ideals. Kiyoaki, the main character, is proud, haughty and often childish - his life is one of privileged which is rapidly becoming more and more in question as pre WW II Japan emerges to a modern nation. The love which he works so hard to deny eventually consumes him. Along the way Kioaku tests friendships, his family, and the traditions which, in part, form him."},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"I don't know how many Japanese authors count as \\"well-known\\" in the US (the guy who wrote \\"The Remains of the Day\\" and \\"Never Let Me Go\\" may be the closest we have to that), but I've heard of Mishima and I'm far from a student of Japanese literature. If any Americans have heard of him . . . well, it may be that his work has been translated into English (a plus for me, as its easier to let someone else do the work) or because he infamously finished his \\"Sea of Fertility\\" quartet and then proceeded to kill himself (after attempting to overthrow the government). As a person he seems quite fascinating and is probably worth a more in-depth look than anything I can attempt here. So we'll stick to the book.This novel is the first in the \\"Sea of Fertility\\" series, and the title hints at a kind of evasive delicacy, a kind of event that looks absolutely beautiful and pristine but doesn't last very long. Which is pretty much what we have. Set in early 1900s Japan, just as the country was beginning to become modernized, it shows the relationship between the members of two families. Kiyoaki's is a kind of new rich and Satoko's family is part of the old aristocracy that has fallen on harder times. In the course of the novel, the two of them fall in love, which goes okay until Satoko is betrothed to a prince, cutting the love affair short. Or it would, in a perfect world where everyone is sensible. Here, of course, because everyone alternates between the world of romance and the world of tradition, the affair keeps going until it starts to go wrong and veers toward the tragic.Mishima takes a great risk by making Kiyaoki the main character, as he spends a good portion of the novel being obsessed with his own notions of romance and drama and tragedy. He's casually cruel to other characters, callous to others, for no better reason than he's a lovestruck man flush with hormones with a rather large ego. But at the same time it rings true. He not only believes he has the worst problems in the world, on some level he believes he has the only real problems in the world, everything that happens is seen through the filter of himself, and different era of Japan or not, chances are most of us were like that at that particular age. Especially when a member of the opposite sex (or the same sex, to be fair) were involved. Fortunately, every so often the narrative will cut to his friend Honda or his servant Yamada, when the story requires a different perspective.Yet the story is romantic, often achingly so, and not in the Harlequin romance kind of way where everyone is heaving bosoms and torn bodices, but in an oddly delicate and touching way. For these two people it turns out to be their first real love and Mishima, whether through stylistic preference or cultural proclivity, seems almost shy when depicting any physical acts of love between them, the prose shifting to an even more poetic style, dancing around the action and leaving memory to color in the blanks. But because they're in a novel we're almost trained to believe that this won't end well, which adds a looming hint of tragedy to the proceedings, just at the edges.If the bare bones of the story was the only draw I'm not sure how well it would be remembered except for being very pretty. The plot itself is almost melodramatic in parts, especially as the consequences loom for two young people making love in the days before really effective birth control and most of this if written in a more straightforward style would veer close to cliche or predictable, a doomed romance headed by a surly artsy type who is convinced he knows how the world works and can make it work for him. Even the setting, while nice, isn't revelatory. So what happens?As with any classic, its the little things. The book could be about Kiyaoki ticking everyone off, until you reach the point where his friend has a long discussion about how no matter how forward thinking or rebellious they are, in the sweep of history they're going to be lumped in with all the other faceless masses that live at the same time they are . . . all the radical ideas that they specifically have will be lost and even if a seed of it down the line ignites a spark that changes the world, who cares because they won't be around for it. At this point the book began to take off for me, and it becomes clear that there's a deeper realm of thought at play underneath the Thai princes and people getting married into the royal family. There's an obsession with passing time and a certain stillness held in the moment, and its a sensation that can only occur when the prose gets the tone exactly right. And Mishima does . . . the narrative is beautifully poetic and sometimes the story almost stops as Mishima observes or sketches out the scene, focusing on details or small touches. A lot of detail is given to nature and while there's never an entropic feel to events, there's a sense of events laconically being steered to an end no one can really avoid. Beyond the aspects of star-crossed lovers, there's a notion of people living out philosophy, or trying to, of being bound to ancient notions that are beginning to unravel, or trying to find a way to make both work. The problems here become both old and new, and the solutions are just the same. No matter what century it is, you're never too old to embarrass your family.Still, it ends pretty much as you'd expect a tragedy like to this, with everyone either getting their just desserts or being unfairly punished by fate, depending on such of the line of morality you fall on. The consequences of it seem larger than it should be and yet it feels right. The stillness infests and invades it all, and the final lines of the book manage to be both tragic and hopeful and dramatic and unbearably peaceful and sad all at the same time, rendered with just the right touch and beautiful in that way a decaying landscape can be right at the cusp of its descent, if you were able to isolate a frame of it for only a moment, and hold it."},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"I am not sure how I first stumbled on to this book.I ended up reading it twice. It was that good. In some ways his style of writing, at least in this book, reminded me of Stendhal or Doestoevsky. Namely, in his uncanny insights into human nature. However, like a true literary genious he depicts the characters though their thoughts and actions and does not tell the reader what to think about them.There is no question that this book is a stunning literary achievment up there with the greatest works of fiction ever written by writers like Joyce, Nabakov, Flaubert, Dickens, Steinbeck, Naipaul, Fitzgerald, Stendhal, etc...Because of the author's personal politics (right wing nationalism) and his unusal death (suicide after leading a failed coup against the Japanese government shortly after the publication of the Sea of Fertiity tetraology of which Spring Snow is volume one) the book undoubtedy does not get the acclaim it is due.I agree with some of the other reviewers that this first book, Spring Snow, of the four books of the Sea of Fertility four book cycle is the best one. However, the other three books are also worth reading and take the reader up through Japan in the 1970s.Read the other five star reviews which may do a better job of doing justice to the book than I can.This book will haunt you. I guarantee it."},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"When I was halfway through this book, I ordered the other three in the series!I have struggled to describe why I liked this so much. There is no radical writing style. There were few characters I actually liked. The story has been told by others many times. Though the setting is in the Japan of a hundred years ago, I have read Oriental and historical fiction many times.I think it boils down to this: the style, plot, setting and characters have a subtlety that pulls you into the story. Though detailed descriptions are sparse, I could \\"see\\" events taking place. Mishima didn't use a hammer - he whacked me with a feather - but it left a lasting impression. I'm ready for more!"},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"Suprisingly, after reading the reviews for Yukio Mishima's literary masterpiece \\"Spring Snow,\\" I was unable to find anyone who interpreted this tragic Romeo and Juliet like love story the same way that I did. Perhaps, because of my own right wing and nationalistic belief systems that were similar to Mishimas I was able to catch the subtle hints of greater depths beneath the somewhat simple and cliched story of two lovers whose desire to be with one another was thwarted by unfortunate circumstances. I understood \\"Spring Snow\\" to be an elegantly written allegory full of symbolism and metaphors and describing the decline and gradual dissolution of the traditional world of the past; a society that existed as a thriving, living hierarchy wherein the Emperor represented the peak. I understood the main protagonist Kiyoaki, a son of an ancient traditional samurai family, to represent a weakened and diluted traditional Japanese society that has become listless and frail due to the inroads that \\"progressive\\" Western society and influence had made on it, but which still retained some residue of its health. Satoko, Kiyoaki's love whom he is obsessed with, is the soul of that traditional society. Honda, Kiyoaki's best friend, represents the modern world with its emphasis on all of its afflictions such as rationality, reason, \\"progressiveness,\\" intellectualization, and industrialism. The ending is a tragic scenario describing symbolically and microcosmically what has happened on a macroscopic scale. The life and spirit of the traditional world has separated (Satoko willingly renounces this world and becomes a nun at a Buddhist convent, swearing an oath never to see Kiyoaki again in this life), Kioyaki, representing the traditional world, lacking the very spirit that gives it life, dies, leaving only his dreams to Honda (the best friend who is compassionate, caring, and sympathizing, but incapable of understanding Kiyoaki) the new sterile modern world which replaces the old. However, once our declining civilization finally self destructs, a world will be reborn in which Kiyoaki and Satoko will be reunited, and a mechanistic sort of life will be again reinvested with a passionate spirit. Also described is the corruption in the nobility who no longer follow principles and modes of behavior that arise not through the acknowledging of rules and ideas that are imposed on them from the outside, but a way of life that permeates from within, overflowing and filled with an organic livelihood, and who are instead preoccupied with pettiness and a pathological preoccupation of appearances.\\"Spring Snow\\" is the first book I have had the fortune of reading by this luminary literary figure from Japan and it will not be the last."},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"This is the first work of Yukio Mishima's works that I have read. His writing style is beautiful. By passionately describing every aspect of the area where the scene takes place, he makes it feel like you are there, standing beside the main characters.The main characters in Spring Snow are Kiyoaki Matsugae and Satoko Ayakura. Kiyoaki is the son of new money type of family. His peasant-born grandfather led the Matsugae family to greatness, and now they are a lower part of the nobility. To make their son elegant and refined, the Marquis and the Marquise Matsugae send their son, Kiyoaki to study with the ancient, noble Ayakura. It is there that Kiyoaki and Satoko meet. When the novel takes place, the two have never had any feelings for each other. But, the news that Satoko is engaged to marry an Imperial Prince causes Kiyoaki to realize that what was in front of him all along, Satoko, was the love of his life. So, they embark upon an affair.I read this novel for pleasure, not for insight, and as such did not pick up on the underlying messages Mishima was trying to impart to the reader.

Mishima evokes an astonishingly vivid Japan of the early 20th century. I simply don't know enough about Japan's history and culture to know if the general setting is historically accurate, but if it isn't he has created a rich, complex world of great beauty tinged with sadness. This is one of those rare books where I will catch myself thinking about the characters as if they were people I know. His descriptions at times border on poetry even in translation. I think that Mishima was facinated by the idea of karma, how actions plant seeds which eventually blossum into effect. I think this accounts for having his characters almost stop the action in places to discuss Buddhist philosophy (which also lets the reader in on how the story will unfold). I am starting Runaway Horses and looking forward to meeting Kiyoaki in his next incarnation. Will he see Satoko again?"},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"Mishima's Spring Snow is a rare jewel of a work! The passion, tragedy and intensity of this novel left me wanting to pursue the entire 'Sea of Fertility' series. I will shortly be reading 'Runaway Horses' which follows it, but have been forewarned not to expect anything quite on the scale of 'Spring Snow.' Luckily, this doesn't concern me, Mishima's writing style is visual, entrancing and magnetic. He takes hold of your imagination, curiosity and emotions from the very first chapter, and you just can't stop till the final page. I myself was dreading reaching the final page of Spring Snow, as I knew that to read such a glorious book again may not come for a long while.To me the book could have been twice the length and it still would have been too short.

They then guide their students through correcting the mistakes and improving the writing until it pops off the page.Why this approach? The authors finds sharing stories hooks the students. They also discovers students feel less pressure when they practice on their teacher's faulty writing first. It shows that even seasoned writers don't expect perfection from the first draft.My only complaint is the book is not very user friendly. You have to read it cover to cover with a high level of engagement to extract all its meaning and well-honed advice."},{"Title":"The Power of Grammar: Unconventional Approaches to the Conventions of Language","review":"I acquired this book because of the title: \\"The Power of Grammar.\\" The list from which I was choosing left off the subtitle, \\"Unconventional Approaches to Conventions of Language.\\"That would have been a clue that basically the authors, who claim a love for grammar, actually see conventions of \\"received\\" or \\"standard\\" English as restrictive to voice.Some conventions they decry are the standard \\"do nots\\" like do not begin a sentence with a conjunction, do not split an infinitive, and do not end a sentence with a preposition. They model their contempt for such convention. On two pages, four sentences and one paragraph began with conjunctions. (As a side note, the same two pages saw a simple series punctuated inexplicably with semicolon and a faulty use of parallelism with compound sentence later. Also on the next page, an introductory adverbial clause was left unadorned by comma.) Okay, I'm probably just being picky. The book addresses fanatics such as myself and notes that we are \\"erroneous\\" in our views.I find it interesting that the authors and myself have read the same texts on achievement gap but have come to radically different viewpoints. I believe that we must maintain an achievable standard of English grammar so that it might be mastered by all, and the ruling class cannot simply change the rules to maintain a barrier of social mobility. The authors seem to understand that viewpoint as they give voice to the concept, but then they disregard those conventions in favor of individual voice, which is important I grant. However, I'd have entitled the book to reflect that emphasis.One of the examples the authors use in the book as an exceptional use of fragments in writing is this: \\"When Chris caught you in tackle tag, he lowered you to the ground gently, so that you lay in his arms for a minute, looking up at him through the tangle of yellow hair, the green lawn wet below you. Sticks in your back. Blue eyes laughing at you. Wild knowledge in your heart.\\" I would argue that while it's very poetic, the structure requires the reader to re-read. First, you're looking up at the tangle of yellow hair, then you're looking at the green lawn wet below you?I don't understand why the same passage could not be just as poetic using conventional style. For example, \\"When Chris caught you in tackle tag, he lowered you to the ground gently, so that you lay in his arms for a minute, looking up at him through the tangle of yellow hair. The green lawn wet below you sticks in your back. Blue eyes laugh at you. Wild knowledge floods (or pick any more appropriate verb) your heart.\\"Just my opinion."},{"Title":"The Essays of Elia","review":"The product description for this book advised that the book had been recreated from the original using optical character recognition software. That notice should have been highlighted in flashing red lights. The quality of this publication is exceedingly poor. It's not a typo here and there; it's fraught with typos, strange line breaks, and the inclusion of odd characters. If only one -- just one -- person had bothered to read this book after it had been produced using OCR, the copy could easily have been cleaned up. As it is, the book is practically unreadable. The transcription problems are so numerous that they completely distract from the pleasures of the actual text. In their efforts to keep costs low, the publisher, General Books LLC, has produced a book that is un-buyable -- a complete waste of money. I had hoped to add this classic book to my personal library, but now it's only getting added to my recycling bin."},{"Title":"The Essays of Elia","review":"Lamb is one of the great secrets of the nineteenth century. He's witty, spiky, elusive and puzzling. His essays lull you into a false sense of charm and nostalgia, but within them are sharp and penetrating comments on human behaviour. They run alongside great Romantic works like Samuel Taylor Coleridge's 'This Lime-Tree Bower My Prison' or William Wordsworth's 'The Prelude' as wonderful, moving pieces of autobiography and self-examination. Plus they are beautifully written, with their descriptions of forgotten places in London, the slowly decaying 'South Sea House', for instance, or the pastoral green of the Inner Temple Gardens, hidden away in the midst of the capital. And behind them, always, is a sense that these nostalgic descriptions are all the more enjoyable because they are hard-won; they come out of the tragedy and courage of Lamb's personal life, and his lifelong struggle with his own depression and with his sister's serious mental illness. They also have a sharply political edge to them - they were published in the 'London Magazine' alongside essays by Hazlitt and De Quincey, and while they seem at first glance simply charming, they often slyly comment on contemporary prejudice.Lamb hasn't been popular through the 20th century - an attack on him by F. R. Leavis and his disciples in the 1930s was the start of the rot, and the gradual decline of the essay has meant he's been almost completely overlooked (though not by the Charles Lamb Society, who are still going in London and meet regularly for lectures - and for Lamb's birthday drinks). So a new edition of Lamb is really to be celebrated, especially one as beautifully produced as this.But alas! This is a lovely edition, but it has one huge flaw for me. There are only 27 essays here and there should be 28: the edition claims to be a reprint of 'Essays of Elia', but it leaves out one of Lamb's most important essays, 'Imperfect Sympathies'. There's not even a note to explain this omission. Why is this important? Well, 'Imperfect Sympathies' is one of the most difficult, challenging, shocking of Lamb's essays - it starts off with a funny skit on why Elia doesn't like Scotchmen: 'I have been trying all my life to like Scotchmen, and am obliged to desist from the experiment in despair'. Scotchmen don't get jokes. They're terribly literal:\\"I have a print of a graceful female after Leonardo da Vinci, which I was showing off to [a Scotchman]. After he had examined it minutely, I ventured to ask him how he liked MY BEAUTY (a foolish name it goes by among my friends) -- when he very gravely assured me, that \\"he had considerable respect for my character and talents\\" (so he was pleased to say), \\"but had not given himself much thought about the degree of my personal pretensions.\\"But then, terribly, the essay takes a darker turn, as Elia voices prejudices about Jewishness and black people. I've always read this essay as a reflection on the nature of prejudice. It's not LAMB who's voicing these opinions - it's Elia, and he's doing so (I think) to make us see how an innocent sounding joke (against Scotchmen), and a bit of 'harmless' prejudice can be the slippery slope to something much worse - as such, it's very timely.But it's up to us, surely, to read this difficult essay and decide for ourselves. Simply leaving it out - without any word of acknowledgement - is bad editorial practice (though the notes to this edition, too, are pretty much non-existent). And it's also giving people a false sense of Lamb - a kind of misguided political correctness which actually amounts to admitting that these editors do think Lamb is a racist old bigot and there are some aspects of his writing which we'd just better not mention. Disrespectful to Lamb, and to his readers, I'd say..."},{"Title":"The Essays of Elia","review":"Shamefully I had not read Lamb before. Delightful.

This is such a book. I am indebted to P.M.H. Atwater for citing it in her _We Live Forever_._The first of the five parts of this volume deals with the true nature and structure of both the human body and the worlds in which it functions. The human being is a multi-dimensional entity composed of physical, bioplasmic (etherial), astral, mind (subconscious, conscious, superconscious), and soul bodies or levels. Above all, it is hammered home that the brain is not the mind._The second section deals with the evidence of survival after physical death. Extremely good, succinct, descriptions are given of eleven types of evidence: 1) historical and religious writings, 2) death-bed, near-death, and out-of-body experiences, 3) apparitions, hauntings, and ghosts, 4) obsession and spirits, 5) spirit doctors, 6) spirit photographs, 7) materialism, 8) reincarnation, 9) space-time relationships, 10) conservation of matter and energy, and 11) communications through mediums and telepathic channels._Part three gives detailed descriptions of the interpenetrating planes of existence: the physical plane; the low, middle, and high astral planes; the mental-causal planes, the celestial planes, the cosmic God Head, the end of manifest creation, the void of pure consciousness, Nirvana, and beyond._ The fourth part gives 50 specific questions and answers to the system put forth. This includes the proven path for individual soul development (which agrees with the perennial philosophy and the core teachings of all the great religious founders.)_Now, part five gives some truly mind-boggling examples of communication with the dead via electronic instrumentation. I had read Sherman's work years ago, but this goes far, far beyond. The heart of the historic O'Neil-Mueller communication is included._Not only did this book strike me as having the \\"ring of truth\\", but it verified so many of my own experiences and conclusions over the years. Perhaps that is why my \\"library angel\\" didn't point it out to me- it was to serve as independent verification._By the way, there should be a large, full-color teaching poster included in the back that clearly outlines the planes of existence and their nature. As for those people who smugly tell others that they will go to hell for disagreeing with their social and political dogma, well, it seems that the lowest astral planes are populated by greedy, resentful, unloving, self-centered people- often with dogmatic religious obsessions that fuel fear and hate..."},{"Title":"Legal authority: Giving someone the power to act on your behalf : planning for possible future incompetency","review":"This is the best book I have ever read about life after death and more.

In truth, we are all evolving Cosmic Beings and have lived many lives. We cycle through lifetimes in the physical plane and we then go to the level of afterlife that corresponds with our highest level of spiritual attainment. People that live bad lives and hurt others and cause harm and start wars do not ascend very far when they die and some even go to environments that correspond to the state of their inner life. No one \\"sent\\" them there. They simply find themselves in an environment that resonates with their consciousness. People that kill other people wake up after death in a world where everyone is trying to murder everyone else. People that steal from others may find themselves in an environment where everyone is stealing from each other. These lower levels have been traditionally called \\"hell\\" or \\"hades\\"....the only difference is that no one is sending them there. They created it themselves. It is all for learning. When the lesson is learned...the soul advances. The same thing happens on Earth....where we are co-creating our lives with our thoughts, feelings, ideas, and actions. Meeks provides the evidence for this paradigm that he collected over many years. The book is somewhat diminished by Meek's belief in the bible and Christianity...which is at best, only a partial and symbolic representation of Universal Truth.

Unlike the author, however, I view my learning as being an individualized study and not something from which I should/could write a book from which I can make money from an unsuspecting and curious public. The 'research' that the author claims to have made are from peripheral and secondary observations at best. The 'evidence' that he claims to have unearthed comes from a variety of both questionable religious dogma and highly reliable scientific sources. But yet George Meck puts them side-by-side as if they both had equal validity.This author obviously was not trained to seek out scientific, observable nor untainted data and while the overall conclusion that he draws (eternal life after physical death) may be true, there is absolutely NO way this can be determined from his writings. He equates the ancient writings of Greek philosophers and Biblical characters along side of scientifically provable facts! And then he takes these facts and stretches them to their literal breaking point. In addition, he cannot seem to get beyond the bias that he had prior to his investigation. The prime examples of this are; 1. That persons are capable of becoming possessed by incarnate spirits because the physical body is only 1% solid matter! 2. That because the ancient philosophers, Native Americans and savages (whoever they are!) believed in the existence of 5 to 7 layers of existence that this, with no question, is to be accepted as being true! 3. That in spite of the fact that the field of Medium ship has a history of being filled with charlatans, we are to accept the pronouncements from the author that he is able to depict the false from the true! 4. That the brain and the conscious mind are two different entities. While this has neither been proven nor disproven, it is too early in the research process to make such a conclusion. 5. He claims that psychologists, of which was my previous profession, refuse to recognize spiritual possession as a potential mental health issue! Of course it hasn't! Anyone who has taken Psychology 101 fully understands why we have not nor will not. On what grounds does Mr. Meck disagree? Lastly, that his 'research and studies' will lead to a break through that will only be equaled by the previus works of Isaac Newton or Alexander Bell! My, my, my! This is a terribly narcissistic viewpoint no matter how one views the validity of his writings!While the author railed against religious tenets and misheld beliefs, he then prescribes his own; persons who commit suicide, alcoholics, drug abusers are doomed to a lengthy period in purgatory and persons undergoing psychosis are simply possessed by evil spirits and, being so, are on a very low spiritual level. Oh please! All of these maladies have greater causes other than a spiritual disturbance. They are probably not the 'lesser spiritual beings' that the author suggests they are. They are merely undergoing psychological, addiction or other maladies. There are no easy, dogmatic answers to the highly complex issues such as eternal consciousness. Maybe the answers truly lie beyond the scope of our scientific or religious understandings. Let us not pretend that we have the 'easy' answers. We tried and failed at this since the beginning of time. Let us not create the 'Meck Religion'. We have far too many religions already. Instead, let us all remain curious, insightful and open to possibilities.Charles Dickens once stated that the greatest threat to a society is the eternal spread of ignorance. I would like to expand on that point by stating that the greatest threat, as I see it, to society is the spreading of false or unproven information to a gullible and uninformed public for the sake of ones own monetary benefit and/or ego fulfillment.It is a much wiser investment to take the money that you would spend on this text and donate it to a traveling circus than to buy this tome.

Instead the author spent more time talking abotu the film process than anything.I did like the presentation though"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"From the age of five when we learn to read, to the age of six when we learn to write, to the age of eight when we learn to write with plots, we know to use quotation marks when someone speaks. \\"Yes,\\" said the cat.\\"No,\\" said the dog.Moreover, we are taught vocabulary, and encouraged to use \\"big words\\" in our writing. The lethargic woman opted to reside in her domicile while her vigorous spouse desired to trek throughout the globe. However, Kent Haruf, author of Plainsong follows the message of the title: describing the intricacy of human nature by illustrating its simplicity. He does this by abandoning quotation marks and using vocabulary a fourth-grader could follow. Haruf uses style in order to show the theme of Plainsong, because he shows complexity masked by simplicity.I logged on to amazon.com in order to find out what my fellow readers thought about Haruf's unsophisticated style. October 23, 2000, someone named janmcalex said, \\"[Plainsong's] simplicity of style gives the reader the opportunity to emotionally participate in the lives of the characters.\\" However, I do not think that Haruf's style has to do with emotion; it has more to do with the theme, which is how it is human nature to hold a careful, straightforward faade while deep, complex needs are hurting inside. This faade can even fool the one hiding behind it. Haruf's easygoing writing style masks the complex needs of the characters inside it. True, there is no excess of punctuation or verbiage to get in the way of one's understanding of the characters. Another reviewer, skoneill, wrote, \\"... my heart aches for his protagonists...\\" I felt this way as well, but I think this simplicity of style is a kind of metaphor for the human ability to seem simple and carefree while unknown intricacies are brewing inside.Later in the review, however, janmcalex touches on the theme. \\"Such simple gifts to salve over deep needs.\\" Simple gifts, in this story, are the influence of other people. Old bachelors, the MacPheron brothers, need the touch of a young lady in their neglected home and graceful teenager Victoria Roubideaux comes to stay with them. Tom Guthrie and his two sons need a mother figure in their lives and then they meet Maggie Jones, a lovable and strong woman. They live in a small town called Holt, where nothing puts it on a map. Even the town they live in seems like what some might call a \\"hick town,\\" but the relationships of the characters are so complex that as I was reading the book, I forgot the setting was in a place where the population was no more than 5,000 people. By omitting quotation marks that the most elegant of authors would use, Kent Haruf conveys a sense of simplicity in the beginning. I found, though, that I forgot about the simple vocabulary and punctuation; I concentrated on the far-reaching needs of the plausible characters in which everyone can find characteristics of him or herself. Both skoneill and janmcalex agree, saying, \\"... [the characters] are human and recognizable archetypes who might well live next door\\" and \\"...in these misfits, we find elements of ourselves.\\"On the other hand, a person called rhymeswithorange wrote a review on June 11, 2003, and said, \\"While I did enjoy some aspects of the plot, other storylines annoyed and distracted me from my overall satisfaction.\\" However, I completely disagree. Haruf hid the true intricacy of the plot and characters behind his simplistic style. Perhaps he hid this intention too well for rhymeswithorange. Having multiple storylines shows that even in an uncomplicated town with uncomplicated dialogue, unbelievably complicated things could be happening. rhymeswithorange also stated that, \\"Overall, I believe that if Plainsong lacked the storyline of Victoria it would have been much better.\\" Then again, Victoria's story was the most telling plotline in this book. She acted strong even though she was pregnant, homeless, and unemployed. Maggie Jones healed her needs by giving her a mother figure to look up to and by delivering her to the door of the MacPheron brothers, who seemed like typical old ranchers. On the contrary, as Victoria's story developed, they turn out to be generous, wise, and almost saintly. They give Victoria everything she wants, material to the simplest gift, rebuilding her trust in men, when in the past the men she knew had practically no redeeming qualities.Haruf's simple style puts up its own faade around the intricacy of the characters and plot beyond. It is similar to human nature, the nature of those characters with which we can identify. A reviewer called spencer625 said, \\"...I'd like to read it again some day.\\" I agree, and I cannot wait for what reviewer nashvillebear said on July 31, 2003: \\"CBS plans to present Plainsong as a Hallmark Hall of Fame film.\\""},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Of all the books I have read this year, this stands out as one of my favorites. Having grown up in a small town, I resonated intensely with this book.A small town has its ups and downs. One of the great beauties of smalltown life is the deep sense of community that develops. You know everyone, everyone knows you. When you run to the store to get a gallon of milk, chances are you'll run into your neighbor or possibly your tenth grade teacher. The commonalities shared by those who live in a small town forms a bond that fosters a sense of community rarely found in large cities. However, small towns can be a source of maddening frustration for the same reasons. Personal privacy is sacrificed when close community is formed. Everybody knows everybody else's business. In a closely-knit group of folks, you're bound to see the best and worst of everyone.The best is so wonderful sometimes that it often makes up for the worst. For example, the McPheron brothers are two of the most selfless and endearing characters I have ever encountered. Their unconditional acceptance of Victoria and deep-rooted love for her and her baby will pluck at the heartstrings of even the most hardened reader. On the flip side, there are the nasties. Russell Beckman is a prime example of the kind of stagnant, small-minded bullies that have a habit of forming in small towns. His perversity and cruelty plunge Ike and Bobby into a harsh reality that taints their innocence.Despite the stifling nature that often characterizes small towns, there is a rich beauty that forms when a group of people are so intricately bound together. Haruf captures this brilliantly in his novel."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I dont know how Haruf did it, but he made me care passionately about his characters, and their stories. I am so different than the two older brothers in the novel, yet I felt that I knew them. The quiet stories linked together in this novel are emotionally deep and satisfiying. A REWARDING READ!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I found this book at a booksale and picked it up for a dollar. What a treasure!! This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. There is something in the writing style that reminds me of A Land Remembered, Gilead, and The Optimist's Daughter: if this makes any sense. Perhaps it is the straightforward descriptive style of writing that works in harmony with the characters. Whatever the secret, this book went far beyond my wildest expectations."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The author is so good at developing characters and they are characters! You want to read more about them. He also makes Holt seem like a real place and describes small towns so well. He takes you through all the emotions from happiness to heartbreak. One of the best books I have ever read! After reading this book, I read all his books and I hope there are many more to come! Five enthusiastic stars!!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Here is a simply brilliant book, a slice of life, deceptively simple, in Holt, Colorado, a tiny farming town in the middle of nowhere.We are introduced first to Tom Guthrie, the good and decent high school teacher whose wife lies in a deep depression in her darkened room, refusing to get up. So Tom, a good man through and through, is single-handed raising their two boys, Ike and Bobby, who are only a year apart and who cope with their mother's \\"disappearance\\" with a stoicism beyond their years.Then there are the two old McFaren brothers, bachelors who have farmed their cattle for some 60 years after the death of their parents. They are gruff, taciturn, set in their ways, and the adult version of Ike and Bobby.Turning their world completely upside down is the young, pregnant teenaged girl, Victoria, who winds up in their care through a series of events I won't describe here...but who opens their craggy hearts to love and longing after too many years to count.And that is the whole simple story: how human love and kindness, juxtaposed against the roughest of realities (and there are plenty of them, especially those described on the farm), can bring redemption and meaning to any life.I found this book to be completely brilliant, in a way that Richard Russo's \\"Empire Falls,\\" which it vaguely resembles and which won the Pulitzer Prize, never was. \\"Plainsong\\" is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Kent Haruf's writing matches the title of the book so well you fall into a certain rhythm as you read. Every simple but masterful description of a character's mere appearance, or even the way he or she smokes a cigarette, adds to the mood of small town quiet desperation until the characters are walking around in your head like real people.Haruf makes every nuance of their behavior fascinating and laden with gathering doom. Even the boys, Bobby & Ike, doing their weekly collections as paperboys for the Denver News are un-put-downable literature. You feel you don't want to miss a word or tiny action of their interchanges with the adults--both crass and kind-hearted--who make up their morning rounds.These are people you can care about as their lives and secrets unfold. The writing transmits the emotional state of each character so vividly, you wonder how the author can reach into your living room and so deftly control how you feel as your eyes devour each page."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong is a wonderful book with a real American Heartland kind of voice. Without giving away much detail, it concerns the intertwining lives of a number of citizens of a small town in Colorado. I suggest this book to anyone who is a people watcher, anyone who loves small stories with big ideas; anyone who likes their novels filled with authentic atmosphere and finely crafted detail; and anyone who (like me) is cooped up in a city most of the time.While not a traditional three act structure, Kent Haruf's plot is immediate and very real. I think a great measure of any plot is whether we care about what's at stake in the story. In this case, I found myself truly caring and appreciating the lives of the characters- actually worrying about them. Also, Haruf is a master at creating plot twists that are very natural (but you often can't see them coming) and yet convey the way life can sneak horrible catastrophes and amazing good luck into perfectly ordinary days.Kent Haruf loves his characters and it shows. The main characters are created in loving detail. Each has his or her own way of talking, their own way of doing things. But even the minor characters have a vivid life of their own, whether it be an amiable drunk that shows up for just one scene at a bar or a terrified school girl delivering an oral report in history class. Even the bad guys, the mean characters in the book, come across as authentic people and not just evil cartoon characters.In regard to way of talking- Haruf has created a wonderful (for lack of a better term) sort of Western Cowboy dialect for his characters that rings true to my ears. He's also very good at showing you what characters are thinking when they aren't talking. Almost none of his main characters are big time talkers and therefore, Haruf develops all kinds of other ways for them to communicate. In fact, Haruf brings us a vocabulary of silence: happy quiet, sad quiet, stunned quiet. It's an amazing thing.Haruf is also a magician of environment. Basically, the story takes place over a little more than one year- all four seasons. And most of it takes place in the same small town so we wind up going back to the same places and Haruf ends up describing the same front yard, the same trees over and over again. In the hands of some writers, this might become dull (how many times do I want to see a description of the sky?), but Haruf pulls it off with grace and style. Because he describes how things change over time. He talks about the winter sky, summer sky and all the other skies in between. In Plainsong, it makes sense too, because the characters lives are governed, in many ways, by the season.The story is interlaced with real conflicts, real things at stake, wonderful poignant moments of sadness and love, moments of rage and some great underplayed comedy.I think there are a few tiny details that didn't quite work for me. I had a bit of a hard time with one of the main characters named Guthrie- a history teacher- but I had some trouble understanding what his motives were. And, another minor note, is that the story is very much about white America which makes sense I guess because maybe a small town in Colorado might be all white but, for example, my older Armenian relatives might not really get into it because it's so alien to their experiences. But these are very minor complaints (I gave this book 5 out of 5 stars)So, I'd say buy this book. Take it on your next trip, read it on the crowded bus on your way to the office, read it during your Thanksgiving Holiday or at Christmas when it's freezing outside. I think you'll appreciate it."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong is such a gentle story. The book is great for lying in a hammock or in a comfortable chair with a glass of ice water by your side and reading very slowly. His characters just draw you into their town and lives. My favorite characters (very hard to pick) are the McPheron brothers. The images that come to mind are the brothers from that very surprising movie, \\"Secondhand Lions.\\" This book an overall has a positive attitude on life despite some of the speed bumps that arise. I really enjoyed the fact that the Haruf allows us to enjoy the story without having to tie everything up into a neat and tidy package at the end. Life isn't like and neither is this story."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I grew up in a small farming town in Oklahoma which is an awful lot like eastern Colorado. I actually do now live in Fort Collins, Colorado, which Kent Haruf refers to many times in &quot;Eventide&quot; (also excellent). The feel of this book is so familiar, it made me homesick. The characters make me ache they are so real and portray every day life with such truth. I feel for the farmers and the isolation and routine of running a ranch and the fatigue that comes from a hard days' work. I also relate to Victoria's situation of having lost her way and finally finding people who do love her. A most touching book!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plain is a word with many synonyms. Candid. Artless. Clear. Humble. Ordinary. Simple. All of these adjectives describe this book only on the suface. I was engaged from the very beginning of this book. At first I was fooled into thinking that this book was mostly about small issues, really not much more than brief glimpses into the lives of a few characters. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised to find the novel encompassed more examination into the lives of the characters."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"&quot;Plainsong&quot; lived up to its reputation and more. It was with real reluctance that I came to the end of this novel. Every word of praise that I have read about it was certainly earned. Above all else, I cared about each and every one of the characters in this book. Maybe it was because I grew up in a town like Holt, albeit in Massachusetts and in the l950's. But I knew every person in this book. But what is more important I came to care about them intensely. There is a scene of an outrageous attack on two of the characters in the book which was so real and so frightening that even though I was in a doctor's waiting room, I wanted to scream &quot;NO! &quot; as loud as I could. Rarely have I had that experience with what passes for contemporary fiction Maybe this is an &quot; old-fashioned&quot; novel where nothing much seems to happen. But if you have ever lived in a small American town, much of what goes on there seems to be &quot; nothing&quot; until one looks back at it over time. I can't thank Mr. Haruf enough for this experience and I look forward to reading his earlier works. This is grand stuff!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"In a time where there is so much flash and glamour and self-indulgence in the world of writing, it is truly a breath of fresh air to find something so glimmering and pure as this book. Deceptively simple, heartbreakingly honest, and unflinching in its portrayal of humanity trying to connect, move, and grow individually while holding on to each other, it breathes hope and joy into a world where sadness and despair dominate so much of our perspective. Kent Haruf has given us all a gift here -- one to embrace, love, and wonder over; something purely and truly human -- a rare look into the lives of human beings he has fully realized in the struggle to realize themselves."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This is a book that runs counter to our fractured hyperspeed society. It is tender. Full of sentiment without being sentimental. Plainsong is an artful piece of writing that has a pace that some can't wait for. Once it engulfed me, I was made to feel... at home. Thank you Kent Haruf."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I couldn't put this book down and I didn't want it to end. Although the characters and story line are simple Plainsong is remarkably suspenseful, intriguing and exciting. One of the best books I have ever read - and for once a book that doesn't have a tragic ending. Very realistic."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"After reading &quot;Where You Once Belonged&quot; by Mr. Haruf, I was anxious to read this book. I was not disappointed. The story of the two boys is very touching and we wonder if they will &quot;become&quot; the McPheron brothers. The lives of these small town people is real. Most of the time, nothing out of the ordinary happens, they live as best they can with what they have and what they know. Plainsong touched me, not only because &quot;Holt&quot; is modeled after the town I grew up in but because I know these people. A wonderful story."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The characters are the strongest aspect of this novel. I couldn't help caring about each and every one of them. Although the story is warm, heartfelt and interesting in regard to small town life its not necessarily profound. If your seeking entertainment without feeling you've wasted your time when the final page is turned, Plainsong will deliver."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This is, without question, the best book I have read in a very long time. I started reading one Saturday morning at 6:00 and couldn't put it down. The two older brothers are some of the most warm and wonderful characters ever created. The young brothers will break your heart. A great book for the holiday season."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Having wanted to read Plainsong for some time, I began it with high expectation (another reviwer of Peace Like a River, which I gave 5 stars, suggested I get the \\"real goods\\" with Plainsong ... so I thought, \\"okay, time to read Plainsong\\").This book's strength lies in characterization, with each chapter devoted to one or two of its characters: Guthrie, father of two mature and responsible young boys; Ella, his wife who cannot rise from bed (depression, we suspect, perhaps from a marriage gone dry); Ike and Bobby, the two sons; Victoria Roubideaux, a 17-year-old high school girl who finds herself prematurely pregnant to an unlikable young man from another town; the McPheron brothers, two kindly prairie farmers who know little about anything but farming, but whose fundamental wisdom will see them through anything life presents (as we see); Maggie Jones, a teacher like Guthrie at the high school in Holt who's tenderhearted and loving spirit provides a grounding to others, especially to Victoria and Guthrie.This is the simple rendering of the book, the life and inter-connectedness of eight characters in a Colorado prairie town. Like the apparent simplicity of prairie life, the challenges and conflicts unfold simply, told in caring but dispassionate prose, somewhat like a story by Chekhov.Maggie Jones's basic goodness holds the important relationships together, first taking Victoria in for a while (who had been told to leave home by an unforgiving mother -- true to plains thinking and religious eccentricity), and later asking that the McPheron brothers open their home to Victoria, as unlikely as it seems initially. (We, the reader, watch with relish as the brothers learn, haltingly, to give her the comfort, security and love she needs to come to a healthy delivery). Maggie also embraces Guthrie -- tenderly, teasingly, and lovingly -- admiting a long-standing interest and offering the comfort he needs after his ill wife leaves to live with her sister in Denver.Otherwise, the book presents what it says, a \\"plain song\\" --plain and unadorned -- about the lives of small-town folk (insert \\"plain's\\" folk) -- simple lives, complex issues (as with people anywhere), who build meaning in the middle of nowhere. In a way, it's a Seinfeld rendering in a different setting, but as true to its characters and milieu as any episode of Seinfeld. Nothing much seems to happen to characters as eccentric and endearing as Seinfeld's -- except life in all its humanness and aberration.So ... this is a fine book, and deserved to be a finalist for the National Book Award, no argument here. It has an enduring feel and pace and delivery. Is it a stronger performance than Peace Like a River? Not in my estimation. Is it more enduring than Peace. Who knows? We, readers everywhere, through the timeless stream of analysis and comparison, will determine that. Without question, both are compelling novels, though each comes to its strength by different styles. Without belaboring my point, Peace engaged me more, as a reader and as a critic. My hope is this: a Pulitzer Prize or National Book Award for Peace Like a River."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I picked this book up with the intention of beginning the read. 12 hours later, my eyes watering from exhaustion and emotion, I replaced it on my library shelf. Now I miss my friends, Victoria, the homeless unwed mother, Maggie Jones, the helpful teacher, Ike and Bobby, the two boys in search of a mother(I wanted to adopt them), Guthrie, the boy's troubled but loving father, and my favorites, the McPheron's, bachelor brother's with hands of steel and hearts of gold. I adopted these people because Kent Haruf's simple, but brilliant style invites this union. These fictitious yet believalbe folks of Holt, Nebraska will live in my mind and heart for decades.My one wish......write a sequel, Kent, and let all of us who adored this book follow on in the lives of these simple, flawed, reedemable characters.Both this book and &quot;The Tie That Binds&quot; grabbed me at the first sentence and never let me go. Only brilliant writing can do that. Gift yourself with this read....from the picturesque cover to the last word, you will be entralled. And I dare to make this prediciton as well....your insights into human nature will be richer and more optimistic for the read."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"What is up with &quot;no quotation marks&quot;.

Everyone would think I am a legend."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"this book is quite boring. It does have some exciting parts, but i often found myself getting bored and spacing out."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This is a plain story in a plain book. The lack of quote(&quot;&quot;) marks makes reading the dialogue a bit more of a challenge."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"It reeked. There is no plot, no storyline, no build-up, no climax, and pretty much no point. The author must feel that he is above proper punctuation because he almost never uses it. I wish I'd saved myself the time and money this book took from me."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I was not impressed. The book read &quot;just ok.&quot; It filled up reading time, though I would have liked a more fulfilling book. I suppose the mundane bits of life do have a story that can be told. I guess I'm not into average liturature. I must say that the veterinary sceene was graphic, detailed, and far too extensive. I wonder if the author missed a calling?"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"It's interesting to me that some of the best books have critics turn their noses up at them because they are truly inspiring and uplifting -- unlike Plainsong, where at the end of the book sad people are still sad, they've just realized that it's better to have a group of friends with whom to share your life. \\"..exalt the reader\\" it says on the cover. Not this one. Is it a new literary trend not to use quotation marks around spoken lines? Or for authors to repeatedly have characters say \\"should of\\" instead of \\"should have\\"?"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This was for sure a wonderful book, and so true to life in that life is tough and not everyone lives happily ever after. ..The characters become friends, and you live each moment with them. For sure a five star book! If you liked this book, or want to read one that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Tried to read this, couldn't get into it. Maybe I'll sell my copy."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I read the entire book waiting for some lightbulb to come on that never did.Improbable: A teenage girl living with two old men?

I'll be wary of anyone else's choices in the future!Why is there no ZERO STAR rating?"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I read this book before I checked any reviews on this site. Wow, what a dissapointment. A friend told me, \\"You will love it, just like Faulkner!\\" I guess I won't try anything by Faulkner now. Nothing is resolved, the characters are lifeless, the lack of quotation marks a constant annoyance. I kept looking ahead to see how many pages I had left. When I missed a point, I did not go back to reread a passage because I just didn't care. Why did so many people like this book? A case of the \\"Emperor's New Clothes\\", yet again."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong is almost entirely about its characters, and both their personal challenges and their interactions with their fellow rural neighbors. The writing is as sparse as the action, as it moves along leisurely, with occasional very poignant and moving moments.The strongest arc is that of the pregnant girl and the bachelor brothers. That whole thread seems highly unlikely, and I was tempted to roll my eyes at the premise. Even so, the author pulled it off, thanks to the strength of the brothers and the persistence of the girl.Maggie is not one of the highlighted characters, but in many ways she is the most important, bringing the girl and the brothers together and coming closer to Guthrie. I wanted to know more about her.The threads with the boys, Guthrie, and the mother simply didn't get enough of my interest. Above average, just not compelling.3.5 stars"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong is as complex a book as you get. You gain an intimate knowledge of each character and see their world they live in with vivid detail. However, I believe that the strength of the book lies in its simple structure.There are eight main characters -- Guthrie, Ella (his wife), Ike and Bobby (his two boys), Harold and Raymond (the McPheron brothers), Victoria Roubideaux, and Maggie Jones. We meet them one at a time, each having their own chapters. None of them are perfect.But as the book progresses, the lines between the chapters blur. The characters enter and interact in each other's small worlds -- helping to push each other closer to perfection. But you get a sense that none of the characters seek the fairy tale &quot;happily ever after.&quot; All they seem to want is for things to turn out alright in the end.Holt, Colorado seems an analogue to our world, our towns. And this book seems an analogue to our own life.I give it only four stars, though, because I was disappointed at the ending. Some threads of the story are left undone. The biggest question I was left with was:What was wrong with Ella? Did her condition have anything to do with the dent in Guthrie's pickup truck?And we, the reader, never do find out. Maybe that is the point. I just think we have gained the privledge to certain information after following these characters through 300 pages."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"A damn fine book. Truly. Just a really good, really well-written book. Get it."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I found plainsong quite unsatisfying. There is no way that it should have received four stars. I felt as though I were observing a community from the distant perch of a computer screen. Haruf keeps his readers secluded from the feelings and possible depth of these characters. The ending left me yearning for something more. (Possibly a better book.)"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"At first I was distracted by the writing style. It gave me a feeling of distance from the characters. After a while I didn't notice that so much because I was wrapped into the story line. This is a really enjoyable book dealing with community and family. The humanity of the characters is genuine and real. None of them are perfect but they are all believable studies of human nature. I would recommend this book to others, although some might find it lacking in action. It is a slow moving, small town story that I found interesting and gentle."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"A simple, beautiful book. This is a book about simple folks who must deal with complex situations during the span of the read. There are many life lessons to take away from this book."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I can't recall what drew me to buy this book, but I guess the cover reviews were enticing (on my copy, Roddy Doyle gave great praise). I have to say I was disappointed in the novel itself. I could'nt find a story to get into and there was a deal of contrivance in linking the rather disjointed episodes that make up the whole. In the end I decided it was either a writing exercise (Haruf is an academic after all) or a short story puffed up beyond its entitlement. While I'm not entirely put off reading more by the author, I will take the time to look beyond the reviews in future."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I was really disappointed in this book. I guess it's supposed to be a portrait of small town life in America, but to me it was just dull and dated. I found the characters to be lifeless cliches. Instead of getting absorbed in the story, I would say to myself \\"Oh, so this is the part where the author's trying to drive home the harshness of rural life\\" or whatever point the author was heavy-handedly driving at. It's also quite predictable. Gee, once the sick old loner gives the kids her house key, do you suppose they'll find her dead??? Please. The worst disappointment was how utterly unengaging the pregnant girl is - as lifeless and uninteresting as cardboard."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I listened to this book on tape. I had to go back and read the cover to see if this book was written for adolescents. The plot was so trite and the writing sophmoric. Why did the mother leave?

The characters were underdeveloped and a lot was left unresolved."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Had to read for a book discussion group. If not for the group would not finished.

While reading the book you will notice how important things such as setting are because they not only describe the area/weather but also the feelings of the characters. For example, when Victoria becomes pregnant things start falling apart and this is shown by the fall season and trees are loosing their leaves and it is becoming colder. His style of writing is amazing because of the fact that there are subliminal messages hidden throughout the book. Not only is it a exilerating story, but there is a lesson behind it that can be applied to anyone."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong has been one of the best fast moving story I have ever read. When first told to read it, it sounded like a soapopra based around my home town. But I was wrong Ike and Bobby reminde me about my child hood. Allways trying to get in the middle of things and trying to explain things on my own. I really enjoyed his writing style it is very chalenging but very quik to read.

So read this fast moving creative story."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"When we were first assinged this book, I thought it was going to be just another boring book. I think this book is great. It keeps me interested because most of what is happening in plainsong happens to most highschool students and we can relate to it. It is a very quick and easy book to read, but it skips around a lot. You really have to use your imagination throughout the whole book to put pieces together. I recommend this book to everyone but you should be mature about it. Again I would almost read this again, just to laugh some more, because I have never laughed so much while reading a novel."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"My high school English class was forced to read this book, which to everyone's surprise turned out to be very enjoyable. The characters were very realistic and you could appreciate their situations and circumstances. The fluid writing style made it an easy read dispite the absence of quotation marks. This actually made the novel confusing at first, but these new fangled authors and their unconvientional writing styles. Will they ever learn? Altough there is no, what do you call it?

It's exciting and the different senerios make you wonder just what's going to happen next. For an example, Ike and Bobby's parents getting a divorce, it makes you think, are they going to get back together? And what will happen to Victoria when she has her baby? The book was detailed throughout. It made you feel like you could be part of it , or be standing there watching everything that is going on.

This book captured my attention and curiosity. It took me and my emotions on a &quot;roller coaster ride.&quot; This book captures the innocence of life, as well as the troubles, it doesn't try to hide anything. When reading this book you can't help but find yourself pondering what you would do in this particular situation,and asking yourself what would you have done differently? Personally I loved this book! It is not often that you can find a book that captures all of your emotions, and then just when you think you've had all that you can, it adds another twist.

I really enjoy reading this book and would recommend it to everyone, not only is this book an easy read it goes by very quick. Part of that is dew to the way the book is divided up into chapters based on the characters. You finish a chapter about one character and then start on the next characters chapter and you want to get through that chapter just to see what happens next. This book deals with everyday life and that keeps me interested. Most people know someone that they can compare the characters in the book to and that makes it very interesting.

Haruf weaves his various plotlines so expertly, the reader has no choice but to read and read.Haruf's Plainsong makes for a satisfying melody."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Very nice story. I think more towns need to get back to knowing their neighbors."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"\\"Any simple and unadorned melody of air.\\" That is the definition of a plainsong, and a fitting title it turned out to be for Kent Haruf's novel. The portrayal of his characters is simple; they are unadorned and as realistic as any character could hope to be, a fact that draws readers in due to the remarkable ability to relate to them. The cast consists of a high school teacher with two sons whose wife has just left him due to her depression, a seventeen year old who has found herself pregnant and alone, two old brothers living alone on a farm, and Maggie Jones, the tie that binds them all together. Mysterious Maggie is the one that causes all of their lives to be entwined, though the specific details of how this happens will have to be discovered by the readers themselves. All of the characters face hardship, pain, but in the end this is what binds them together in a slightly dysfunctional pseudo-family that makes up for the genetic family they were missing before. As you read the book you find yourself rooting for the characters, you become invested in their lives and the decisions they make to the point that you just want to step into the novel and give them some good advice so they won't make the stupid mistakes you know they will.In this novel, Haruf creates a whole world, or at least a town that is completely believable and so simplistically ordinary, but is strange and unique. This is where Haruf excels with this novel. It is their very foibles and eccentricities that draw us in, that show us their humanity and make us laugh. We can all relate the characters, perhaps the town itself, to people we have known or places we have been in our own life. Haruf is extremely detailed in his portrayal of Holt, Colorado and it's interesting characters, yet he does not make it appear so. He manages to weave everything together seamlessly into one large painting so that it all appears as a whole in the eyes of the reader. If I had to summarize the essence of this novel into one word, it would be healing. The healing of the characters in the development of new relationships is the central focus of the novel, though this healing does not come easily, the reader is left with a great sense of hope that this new family will make it through the hard times."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong was a enjoyable read, but if I didn't have to read it for a class I probably wouldn't have. The book lacked depth into the characters feelings'. When I read a book I don't like having to decide what the character is feeling, I'd rather the book spell it out too me. Haruf does a good job at describing situations and conveying his thoughts in the book, but he lacked the depth required of a great book."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I read Plainsong in January and I still think of it, often. It is beautifully written. It is perfectly straightforward, but enigmatic. It is deeply involving, but not for everyone - several people to whom I have raved about the book have reported back that it was - well, just too plain. The thing I love most about Plainsong is the character of Maggie. As with only a few other literary characters, I find myself thinking, what would Maggie do in this situation?"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"What a joy! I loved every page and wished I could spend lots more time with these people. Often I read books and watch films that matter, but I don't like any of the people who live in them. I can see that they're masterful creations and important, but I don't like spending time with folks who irritate me, so why read about them? Now the people of Holt, I want to invite them all over for dinner. Maggie is who I want to be when I grow up.Every time the McPheron brothers showed up, I began by laughing out loud and then weeping. Why is this book not in paperback? This is a book I've been searching for for a long time, one my freshmen students (all ages and backgrounds) will love so much they may even start to enjoy reading. PAPERBACK! Thank you,Mr. Haruf"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I cared about the characters and enjoyed the way their lives were woven together. I think people who enjoy this book will enjoy Reason For Leaving by John Manderino."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Sweet, simple characters, good, strong dialogue. Haruf does a good job of weaving their lives together."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong is an affirmation of community and simple living. In the midst of the crazy harshness of &#8216;real&#8217; life, Haruf offers us hope. The contrast is stark and therefore all the more powerful. Throughout the book, Haruf juxtaposes life&#8217;s ugly and beautiful moments: a girl is rejected by her mother when she becomes pregnant out of wedlock, but a teacher takes her in. She decides to keep her baby and live with the consequences, and two old farmers welcome her into their simple home. Two little boys watch teenagers having sex, but they are accepted as men by the two farmers. The same boys watch their mother leave their father, but are welcomed and loved by a lonely old woman. The girl runs off with her boyfriend; the boys are beat up because of something their father did; their father has sex with other women from school. As life gets more complicated and painful, Haruf weaves a resolution. He does not shy from the reality of life&#8217;s difficulties, but instead points to the redeeming power of community. He makes us believe that there are people in the world like the two farmers, people whose love shines through their crust and who can bring comfort to those around them."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"If love love a good story and real to life characters then Haruf is a must read. Be patient when you open the book. Let the story come to you. Like a lasting relationship you need to get to know the author's style and characters before you can become fully committed ... but when you do there simply is no better contemporary novels out there."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This is one of those books that make me proud to be a writer. Not only is his writing nearly perfect in it's precision (not an extra word, not a single imperfect metaphor, every detail exactly chosen), Haruf's compassion, his simplicity, his understanding of the human soul are inspiring. Unlike so many contemporary writers, who expend vast quantities of energy being oh-so-clever, Haruf eschews wit for heart. His characters are glorious -- messy, broken, complicated, kind and cruel, funny, bitter, despairing, rejoicing and utterly complete. These are not people who sit around in cafes discussing the problems of the world; they are people striving, quietly and with enormous dignity, to do the right thing, to be kind, to overcome cruelty. Haruf's portrayal has turned them into my heroes. I can't recommend a better book to to anyone who yearns to be a writer, or who yearns to understand more about what goes on in the hearts and minds of our fellow humans. I'm almost finished another of his books, EVENTIDE, and I suspect -- since it's equally splendid -- I'll post the same review for that one."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I don't know if it's because the McPheron brothers remind me of my father's people-- salty language, tidy kitchens and the hours that pass in hard labor between bits of dialogue included-- or if it's the school principal's strong-arm efforts and getting Guthrie to pass Russ, or if it's that I've lived most of my life in the same small town. Something about this book just speaks to me. It's lovely, and haunting, and makes me laugh. It's just about the most perfect book I've read recently (and that's saying something.)"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Story OverviewThe setting is the small town of Holt--located in the prairie not too far from Denver. The type of town where people know each other's business and papers are still delivered by boys on bicycles. Yet as much as people know you in a small town, they don't really know you or what goes on behind closed doors or closed mouths. In this small community, we get inside the minds and lives of several Holt residents--all of whom are suffering from some form of loneliness, sadness or isolation.* Tom Guthrie--a teacher at the local high school whose wife has become distant and unreachable* Ike and Bobby--Guthrie's two sons, who are confused by their mother's distance and looking for a way to recapture her love and attention* Victoria Roubideaux--a high school girl who finds herself pregnant and cast out of her home by her mother* The McPheron Brothers--two older bachelor brothers who live on a farm outside of Holt and keep mostly to themselves.* Maggie Jones--a single woman who teaches with Guthrie and cares for her elderly father and serves as the glue that begins to bind these individuals together.Each of these characters alone has a voice that is aching to be heard and understood. And as they move ever closer together to form a type of family of their own, their voices and lives begin to intertwine and harmonize together in a way that is true, touching and beautiful.My ThoughtsAt the start of the book, Kent Haruf provides the definition of plainsong:The unisonous vocal music used in the Christian church from the earliest times; any simple and unadorned melody or air (e.g., Gregorian chant is type of plainsong).I didn't fully appreciate the meaning of the title until the end of the book. But upon finishing the book, the title just made so much sense and was so fitting. In the book, each of the character's individual lives comes together to become part of a bigger whole--with each voice complementing and harmonizing with the other voices. At its heart, this book is about seeing a new community being formed from lives that were previously lived separately and parallel.The book is both simple and subtle. It doesn't hit you over the head with things. Rather, it lets you experience the lives of the characters through simple narration and dialogue. Even the dialogue is unadorned with quotation marks (and sometimes attribution). I could see that some readers might find this book a bit slow-paced or even frustrating. But if you stick with it until the end, you'll appreciate the author's skill in giving you much more that you thought you were getting at first glance.Frankly, I was surprised at how satisfied I was by the end of the book. I struggled to get into the story for a little bit and found the shifting viewpoints a bit off-putting at first. It was almost like drifting from character to character like a ghost--getting a little bit here, leaving for awhile, and then coming back and getting a little more. Once you adapt to the rhythm of the book, though, it turns into a rich and rewarding read.My Final RecommendationI don't think this book is for everybody. If you're the type of reader who likes big, loud, obvious books (i.e., ones that read like a summer blockbuster movie like Transformers), I don't think you would care for Plainsong. However, if you're the type of reader who has patience and an appreciation for slower-building, more subtle books (i.e., ones that read like an art house film), then this book would be perfect for you. Think of Plainsong as a cup of tea--it takes time to steep and brew and you drink it slowly but, at the end, you're filled with warmth and satisfaction.And for those of you who care about such things, Plainsong was a finalist for the National Book Award."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I really enjoyed Haruf's novel, \\"Plainsong.\\" The characters were intriguing and like-able. The individual stories of the characters were woven together to create a larger story in a way that was simple yet beautiful. Containing reoccurring themes of innocence lost and redemption, the novel maintained the raw element of reality throughout. The portrayal of small-town life seemed pretty accurate. The novel ended on a positive note without being overly cheesy, which is refreshing. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"In this wonderfully told story, Haruf shares with us a beautiful story of the decency of plain folks and the goodness of spirit residing in each of us. His simple style mimics the simple lives of his characters; not only is it an easy story to digest, it is also a delight to read. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This book echoes the gentle prose of Cather with the redemption of Silas Marner. Perfect in it's simplicity. Beautifully written."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Holt is a small town in eastern Colorado where young boys on bicycles deliver papers in the early morning hours and collect each month from their patrons. It's a place where everyone knows everyone and where their problems and their successes become the main topic of conversation among the citizens. In this story, the \\"good\\" guys are: Tom Guthrie a conscientious high school teacher; his two young boys who long for their mother, lost in a deep depression; Victoria a shy, pregnant seventeen-year-old girl whose mother has kicked her out of her home; two old farmer brothers, Raymond and Harold, openhearted and generous, who have lived together all of their lives; Maggie Jones, also openhearted and generous, also a high school teacher, who cares for her aged father stricken with a form of dementia; and the old lady who lives and dies in her apartment above the barbershop. The \\"bad\\" guys in this story are: the father of the baby, Victoria carries; the local barber who has a tight, mean heart; the spoiled-rotten high school boy and his parents who enable their son to be a failure; the pregnant girl's mother; and the boys' aunt, sister to their mother, so insensitive as to be cruel.In this story of fragmented lives intertwined, we see how even non-related people can become family. Plainsong, also now a movie, is an excellent story. Eunice Boeve, Author of Ride a Shadowed Trail"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I enjoyed the writing style and interesting characters in this book. It is really many well crafted stories woven together to make an excellentbook. The author uses a minimalistic writing style that speaks volumes and is fun to read. I anticipated each new chapter. Give it a shot."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"\\"Here was this man Tom Guthrie in Holt standing at the back window in the kitchen of his house smoking cigarettes and looking out over the back lot where the sun was just coming up.\\" This is the first line of Plainsong, a novel set in Holt, Colorado, a fictional town on the edge of the prairie. And it is quiet moments like this that are the joy of this book.There are no unexpected plot twists in Plainsong. There is little action other than small-town fistfights. But it is a poetic and gentle and real. And it is surprising how much it draws you in. The characters are vivid and the dialogue is excellent. There is not an over-written word in the book.The story is of the intertwining lives of several characters: a high-school teacher whose wife has become too depressed to leave bed but eventually finds the energy to leave him and his two sons; a pregnant high-school girl and the teacher who tries to help her; and two brothers who live on their farm 17 miles out of Holt and have little interest beyond their gates.Plainsong was a deserving National Book Award finalist and an unlikely national bestseller. Describing the plot doesn't do it justice. You kind of just have to be there."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I listened to the audiotape version of this book. I had listened to Eventide by this same author and really liked that. He has a skillful way of letting you know people and care about what happens to them without a lot of action. The books take place in a very small town in a simpler time and the caring between various characters is touching. He seems to always weave in some unexpected interaction between two characters whose stories had been presented independently up to the point that their lives intersect. Plainsong actually comes before Eventide and I enjoyed knowing how some of the people's lives had developed before I listened to this one. Minor drawback--the taping is not done well in that you aren't told when a side ends or whether that is the end of the tape or the tape needs to be reversed. Those little touches make listening easier, particularly when one listens sporadically. Highly recommended book."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Part of the beauty of PLAINSONG lies in its simplicity. It is absent such things as petty squabling that you might expect between two women competing for the attentions of Guthrie, or irritated ramblings of Ella's sister when the boys visit. It does contain just a glimpse of insight into the feelings which contributes to the feel of how this story proceeds. The chapters tell the stories of people in Holt and how some connect in unusual ways. Each story pulls you into their world through strong character development, and the absence of quotation marks for spoken words by the characters uniquely adds to that overall effect. This is a very enjoyable read for its peacefulness, a good book for a good feeling of the heart."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I have had this book sitting on my bookshelf for over 2 years. After just reading it, I'm kicking myself for not reading it earlier. I'm not usually a fan of male authors but Kent Haruf has *made me a believer*.From beginning to end, this book just oozed a wonderful comfy and cozy feel! I could almost feel the warmth in each and every word. The characters were all far from perfect but they were people that were easy to enjoy sitting down with everyday. They didn't live the perfect lives ~ none of them. But, they were strong enough charachters to make the most of what they had. To me, those are the characters that jump right out of a book.Thank you, Kent Haruf, for writing such a touching novel that will remain in my mind for years to come!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"An enjoyable read, &quot;Plainsong&quot; compassionately looks at the verities of life - the good and the bad. Haruf write with a realistic, yet kind and graceful, style that ultimately leaves one with hope.Interesting to hear that this will be a Hallmark movie in November. This book isn't sentimental and I hope that will be true of the &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; special on CBS. The casting of Aidan Quinn and Rachel Griffiths is promising."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I had the privilege of hearing Mr. Haruf read from Plainsong this month at the One Book AZ book festival in Phoenix. The organization chooses a book, each April, that they encourage all Arizonan's to read. This year, Plainsong was the worthy recipient.As he read from the chapter which has a teacher, Maggie Jones, asking the old bachelor farming McPheron brothers to take in a pregnant 17 year old Victoria Rubideaux, I was instantly engaged. Haruf has a gift of enabling the reader to envision his cast of characters and the desolate Colorado plains on which they reside as richly as if they were watching it unfold before them. Plainsong walks you through the lives of several individuals and exposes you to the grief, pain, fear, joy and sometimes mundaneness they experience. While their situations may not be envious, Haruf maintains their dignity in sharing their stories and does so by writing simply and without exaggeration. Many authors attempting such direct and honest storytelling would faulter, yet Haruf succeeds.Simply written, the story covers a wealth of complicated situations and unconventional definitions of family. To fill the pages with fancy words would have detracted from the elements and not allowed the reader to accurately view the rawness and beauty that life brings.While I do not believe everyone will appreciate Haruf's style, I, for one, am a new fan."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I gladly fell into the trance woven by Haruf in this book. He shares such a feel and empathy for each character. I want to send him a note saying thanks for the experience of joy without the encumberance of deep misery that makes modern literature sometimes difficult to swallow. There could be no better title-Plainsong. Thanks for not ending in a death swamp of surprise, gore, or cliffhangers. Thanks for not overdoing it. It's not a perfect book, but neither am I and neither are his characters and neither are the places he writes about. The world from which he writes is simply imperfect as well, giving Kent the artistic freedom and Freudian allowance to share that with us. Thank you again for the experience and without shock. Just like the title says, and then some, and less some. How often can one judge a book by it's title alone?"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Having lived around small rural towns myself, this rings true. The characters seem to drift in and out of events that eventually force them to move ahead in new directions. The McPheron brothers are brought into the mainstream of life through their relationship with Victoria. Victoria seems to be so helpless that she can't rebel against her past, yet her baby brings her to a sense of responsibility and purpose. The two Guthrie boys are introduced to the evil that happens to people through no fault of their own. Ella needs help, and why didn't someone recognize this? As a former teacher, I don't know why the problem Guthrie had with the Beckmans was not handled better. The principal seems to have been a total wimp in face of parental anger (not a total surprise!). As a matter of fact, teachers haven't been allowed to rack up a student against a row of lockers for thirty years, even in a place like Holt. The sexual encounters seem to be included as a bow to popular expectation; none of these teachers was very discreet, and I find that very surprising. Even in these liberal times, most teachers would be smart enough to outwit, at least for a while, the nosiness of a small town. Any reader who has qualms over the description of the horse autopsy needs to understand that this is part of farm or ranch life, and not as offensive (to me, at least) as graphic descriptions of depredations against humans, which one encounters in some crime novels. In spite of the flaws, I find this novel well written in that it evokes a time and place with sparseness yet preciseness of detail, and at the end the characters have moved outward and upward to a higher plane of understanding of themselves and their world. It is at once realistic and idealistic, and I find it a pleasant surprise."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I thought this book was really good. I had a hard time getting into it and I found it frustrating that the author did not use quotation marks. I was drawn in and really enjoyed the writing and learning about the characters. I won't go into the plot since others always do that but I feel this is definitely worth the read!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"PLAINSONG is overtly simple: unassuming town, modest characters, usual circumstances narrated and executed with unpretentious style. However, simmering beneath the surface is a sweet, heart-wrenching novel - complex in human emotions and interactions. I truly felt Victoria's confusion, the McPherons' loneliness, Ike and Bobby's coming-of-age realizations and undeserved cruelties, Maggie's desire to help others but her ultimate need for love, Tom's unfortunate circumstance...Though the main theme is 'plain', there are intense moments sewn throughout the novel - the sexual witness, the heifer's delivery, Tom's confrontation. These scenes surprise the tranquil, sympathetic reader and demonstrate Haruf's ultimate manipulative (and thus great) powers as a writer.A truly heartfelt, delicate novel with OOMPH."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong was an assignment given to our Senior English Class, and before reading this book, I was not excited and prepared for what it contained. Inside this book, I learned a lot about the character's lives through the authors Motifs using the weather as characters feelings. I live in a small town, and this novel is about a small town where it is easy to know others stories. I just moved here and can relate some of the situations. This novel goes into great detail about a few characters lives and their actions, and this took me by surprise. I do not enjoy reading much, and yet, I found this novel easy to read and understand. Kent Haruf seems to have much wisdom about the topics this novel holds within, and I was impressed with his knowledge and skill. Kent Haruf tells an amazing story of a community and the people who make it up. I recommend this novel to anyone who is prepared for some powerful words."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"On the high plains east of Denver is the small, fictional, gray town of Holt, Colorado. Seemingly a small, dying agricultural town it would be easy to miss. But stop and spend a little time there. Yes, the streets are sparsely peopled and the farms lie a good distance from town, but real life is here: intense, tragic and redeeming. Two old bachelor farmers, a young pregnant teenager, a high school teacher deserted by his wife are among the folks who admidst loneliness begin to pull together and discover community, family and love. A truly beautiful, understated scene near the end of the book--the old farmer brothers at the birth of the teenager's little girl--is worth the whole read. The author's style--sparse and understated--captures the town and the people. Read it!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This is quite an unusual book, or perhaps it is the author's writing style, but despite the fact that the characters are not very deeply explored, the prose somehow allows the reader to fill in the blanks and come up with a beautifully told story peopled with individuals about whom we care a great deal. The emotional tone is insightful and true, and the physical descriptions are evocative. Before I even finished this novel, I ordered two more books by Haruf, because I want to see what other things his style can do. This is a thoughtful meditation on being human and caring (or not caring) for others despite ourselves."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"An avid reader for nearly 60 years, I enjoy a well written book and have cut a wide swath through the works of many authors. Rather than repeat what the story is about or attempt to compete with some well written descriptions in Plainsong, all I can say is that I consider it top shelf, an absolutely wonderful book that I have recommended to quite a few people. It deserves a 5-star rating."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"What a great read. Just what i was looking for. the characters are deep, well thought out and really capture your attention. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Life, in a nutshell, sketched with the outlines of just a few people in a prairie town on the edge of the Rockies. All the usual big emotions for a novel - loss, abandonment, fear, grief -- are there, but somehow move like shifting prairie grasses into the broader context of life, so that even death is embedded in the unsentimental compassion that two old brothers offer two very young ones.Most of the people in this story feel so true. Decent people with flaws, they keep putting one foot in front of another to get through each day. The exception is two old brothers, cattle ranchers, who I could not really believe but loved so much that I didn't care. In some ways, the book is really the story of how these two men take one step away from a half-century of isolation to find a larger community and family."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Brace yourself to fall into this subtle, character-driven novel. Haruf skillfully brings the reader into the lives of a select collection of individuals living in the rural town of Holt, Colorado. In their stories you will observe a poignant display of humanity. Each of their unique and yet interconnected stories will remind you of why you believe in good people and leave you with a sense of hope. On the contrary, it will, at times, also remind you of the ugliness that lurks in the world as well. Ultimately you will lose yourself in these characters' lives and feel as though you have come to know them as you know people in your real life. This book has a quiet yet profound impact that I surmise will stay with the reader long after the last page has been turned."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong was a pleasure to read and a visit into a community with the usual family trials.

In this, Mr. Haruf does fine with male characters, but makes every woman in the book sound the same .. flat, lifeless, depressed, and indistinguishable one from another. That's too bad .. it was a lovely book to listen to, if not for this one problem, but problem it was indeed."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong is set in the rural community of Holt, Colorado. It's the story of a pregnant teenage girl, two lonely teachers, a pair of old bachelor brothers, and two young boys abandoned by their mother.I've said this many times before, but I'll say it again. I'm a huge fan of character novels. Stephen King and Richard Russo have always been my favorites, but I can now add Kent Haruf to that list. I was captivated by this story. I fell in love with the characters, especially the McPheron brothers. Haruf had no problem putting you into their lives and making you care for them. I look very forward to reading more of his books."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Holt Colorado is indicative of every small town in America. It is full of angst and triumph, and the coming together of community members to the betterment of each person. Each character in Haruf's story is someone recognizable - the pregnant teen, the twin boys whose curiosity leads them to vivid and unexpected lessons on sex and love and kindness, the old McPheron brothers and their knowledge only of farming, and the ever kind and helpful teacher who orchestrates help for those in need.The story of Plainsong reminded me a lot of my childhood hometown of 4,000 people. I easily could have swapped into Haruf's story my classmate who gave birth on graduation day or the regulars I would see drinking black coffee at the local mom and pop restaurant when I would happen there with my father. I can picture vividly the exact teacher, with the heart of gold, who would have gone the extra mile for any student.In the end of Plainsong and of life, we all long to be with family and dear friends, even if that means dad will be sitting at the dining room table with a dishtowel around his neck, holding is silverware and absently staring out and asking; Hello, Is anybody there?"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"PLAINSONG is beautifully crafted, yet simple, like a piece of shaker furniture.

The ending left me with the feeling of. . .&quot;okay, so what was the point?&quot; This book was, by far, not the best that I have ever read, but it did manage to hold my interest to the very end. I just wish I could have found the same inspiration that others have reported:)"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Simple to read, funny, sad, real -- all at the same time. Very perceptive author. There's more to this book than the simplicity that it originally appears to be.I read some of the reviews provided by other readers -- for those of you who did not like the book -- you missed the whole point of the book.I did not want the book to end.Hope you appreciate reading this book as much as I do."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"In the first several chapters of this book, Kent Haruf describes the bleak lives of seven characters--each wrapped in his or her own form of loneliness, each living without much hope. Even the barren cows on a cattle ranch seem to have tragic existences.But as the book goes on, all the characters find their lives intertwining, their solitude alleviated. By the end, seven disparate people have formed a small community, and it is clear that the community will last for years to come. The cows seem a little happier, too.While this book is not without its flaws (many of the characters lack complexity), its improbable outcome is the one we all like to think can happen, and the one we are often denied both in real life and in fiction. Sometimes it's very satisfying to read a book where things just work out okay in the end."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Absolutely wonderful telling of a hopeful tale of the meaning and future of family.

I was disappointed that the promise of what could have been an engaging story had not been fulfilled."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Haruf's novel which starts out so well splutters and dies less than midway through and glib violence doesn't rescue it. Stock characters drift through pointless scenes like sleepwalkers, and I wondered if Haruf gave a damn.The five-star reviews astonish: to earn fewer stars from his fans Haruf would (apparently) have had to leave the book's latter 200 pages blank, or moon them directly. Either performance would have improved over the cliched yawnfest we're treated to instead.If this review seems resentful, it is. The novel's first chapters are good, the writing fine, the characters real and moving (the cattle auction scene is exemplary). Then to see it all turn to cowplop.Haruf, editor, agent: feel shame for letting such shoddiness reach readers."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This is the type of book that one might expect to see onOprah's book club: young girl warms the heart of two older bachelor brothers; high school teacher and colleague fall in love; small town where there are no secrets. But is has some serious problems, the most serious of which is that the character's actions do not really make sense. ... The reasons behind the character's decisions are not believable, especially when dealing with the bachelors. These characters are creating their own chaos, and to be plausible, the reader needs to buy into their reasoning. But there is too little conflict, too little soul-searching. The drama seems manufactured and banal, and that is really the most important part of a novel like this. END"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This book is awesome!

It related to me since I, myself live in a small town and know how small towns consume you and your life to the point where you can't get out of it.I thought Haruf's use of motifs throughout the book kept me enticed to see what would come out next. He filled my mind with thoughts and pictures of what was happening and filled my heart with joy and sadness at the same time. Haruf created more than words in this book.

It started with a good plot that was very close to the town I live in. The characters were easy to relate too and were well developed. He painted the picture one piece at a time and finally used the rope of Maggie to pull it together. The book was quick reading which is nice for those of us who aren't that crazy about reading. It wasn't necesary to have to trudge through hundreds of pages of material. It was presented in a quick and easy manner that made it almost like reading for fun. If you aren't in to reality based reading though, I wouldn't recommend this because it is very real."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong is the type of book that is easy for anyone to read. It is not just one story but rather several that all relate to one another. While reading the book you will find how important things like setting are. For example, when Victoria becomes pregnant everything starts falling apart and at this same time fall season has started and leaves are falling off the trees. Everything in this book has meaning and is crucial to the plot. Throughout the entire novel there are subliminal messages that tie the story together. These messages are ones of our society today and are eye opening to the world we live in. Harufs style of writing is unique and exhilarating. Behind every story there is a lesson that can be applied to anyone."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong. The first english book that I actually liked reading through out high school. It draws you in and doesn't let you go until you are finished. Haruf opened my eyes to the real world out there. Before this book I never realized how tough life is for everyone.

I think I have only read about 2 books that have been assigned to me by a teacher. However, this book kept me interested and made me keep reading. Kent Haruf wrote a fine book. By creating a story that has Pulp-Fiction like nature in which many stories are interweaved and connected, he kept me on my toes. The plot seems simple enough: a pregnant high school girl, two boys without much maternal guidence, two lonely farmers, and a school teacher all living in a small town. But with his amazingly talented writing skills, Haruf created a fast reading novel that seems almost like a short story. You won't be able to put it down. Be careful, the words seem as if they are jumping of the page at you. So be prepared for a good time. Yee haw. Read it. POW."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Kent Haruf has written the easy reading novel plainsong. It was a very simply written story tying several members of a small town together. The Characterization and decription throughout the book was exceptional. And the exceptional language used made the text jump off of the page. This book was about the community of a small town in Colorado, and I live also live in a small town in Colorado, so connecting to this book for me was very easy. The detailing of the characters seemed to be very boring when reading it, but it became very intreuging and hard to put down.Final throught-Nice work Kent"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This book was outstanding. I am a hard reader to please, but Kent Haruf was able ato do just that. His words jump out at you and pull you in. He does an great job of keeping the readers on thier toes.

Yet it's more than that. It's a story of struggles. A story of love. A story of despair. A story of Hope. A story of learning. A story of LIFE. It takes place in a small, secluded, town in eastern Colorado. Yet the characters problems are no different than those of people in any other place big or small. It shows that little towns are equally as important as the big ones and people have the same problems all over the world. Yet in a small town the problems seem even more monumental. The towns people are thrown around in a whirling storm of despair and hope. The life of a pregnant teenager inwhirled with the lifes of two old ranchers. Two young brothers trapped in the middle of thier parents separation. A troubled teacher struggling with a troubled studdent. Plainsong is heartwarming must read."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The book Plainsong, by Kent Haruf, was full of interesting reoccuring motifs. The motifs enhanced the overall quality of the book. One of the main motifs that I encountered was the use of setting to describe what the characters were feeling. This made the book a quick and easy read. The characters had very normal problems that anyone can relate to. Reading this gave me a sense of homliness that you can only get from a very well written book. The uncommon punctuation (not using quotation marks to show who is talking) was confusing at first, but actually made it faster to read. This is one of the only books that I have read in the past few years that I could follow and enjoyed."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I took a writing class over the summer and one of the novels we had to read was Kent Haruf's Plainsong. This novel was well written and made me feel like I can become a better person because of it. It makes the reader emotional as you get angry, sad, laugh and cry throughout the novel. I'm really grateful to my Professor that made us read Haruf's novel as I'm definitely keeping it!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Well written, it took me away."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I can't imagine why this book would have been nominated for any award. I didn't feel it was well written or worth my time. As an example: what was the intent of the chapter on the pet horse? It just didn't seem to fit with his story. It had no purpose other than to take up page space. I would suggest you pass on this book."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Thank heavens I found a few people to agree with me. I was beginning to think that Amazon.com only published favorable reviews! Finally, found comments from Peoria, Ann Arbor, Tampa, and Sydney who shared my feelings. The characters had no effect on me except for the two little boys. I just couldn't believe all the hype for this book. Now I can stop nagging all my discriminating reader friends to read this."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I have to say that I was really disappointed after reading this book. I believe that Haruf had a good idea and theme to write this book on, but did a horrible job of putting it all together. I felt like I was thrown a bunch of characters and plots that weren't related, and was expected to make up my own story. I liked the cover and think that it will look nice in my library, but that's probably where it will stay. I won't recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"As a result of all the hype I had heard about this book prior to reading it, I was untimately disappointed. If the author's intent was to write a simple story about simple characters in a simple town, then he has been successful. No one character jumps out at you except for Maggie who seems to tie everyone together. The lack of quotation marks adds to its simplicity....this is something I enjoyed while I know other reviewers found this less than appealing. It was a well-written book -- just not for me."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This book centers around a small Colorado community and 7 of its citizens. First is Victoria Roubideaux, a young high school girl who is pregnant and has no place to go. Then there is Guthrie, a high school teacher, and his two boys Ike and Bobby whose mother stays in bed most of the time and eventually leaves the family. Guthrie has a friend named Maggie Smith, who is also a teacher, and the final two characters are the McPherons, two bachelor brothers who run a farm outside of town. The author titles his chapters with the names of these characters and gently weaves a story about their everyday lives. His prose is simple and spare, and he does not even include quotation marks when his characters are speaking. There are several situations which are never really explained nor are they resolved, and I found this frustrating as a reader. The strength of the book is in the characters, but the plot lacks structure and closure."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This book started off with promise as it introduced the characters and illustrated the setting of the town of Holt for the reader. This might be a small, sweet town but the main characters have the morals and depth of a raunchy big city.The characters of Guthrie and Maggie who later in the book just have sex for no apparent reason as did the school secretary one night with Guthrie (still a married man, mind you) just turned me off. There was no love there at all.The McPherson brothers were interesting characters. Victoria, the pregnant girl was a surprising character. She starts out practically in denial of her pregnancy until her mom orders her out of the home and she is played as a sweet, forlorn character when taken into Maggie's home. Then she goes to the McPherson brothers to live and just when she gets real settled into their lives to the point of them actually buying her a baby crib, she up and literally rides off with the boyfriend that dumped her because he shows up one day in the school parking lot! She tells no one of her whereabouts, even after all that everybody has done for her! I tired of her immediatlely at that point. She does come back, but from then on the story is so that it doesn't make me care about any of the characters anymore, even Guthrie's 2 poor young boys. I expected more of this book but was let down."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The plot, characters, and prose of this book have been well analyzed by the many reviewers, and I see no need to add my opinions on these issues. I will, however, comment about the lack of quotation marks. Given that publishers do have literate staffs, I assume that the omission was deliberate, and, in my view, very effective! I found that without quotation marks, the dialog and descriptions interspersed and flowed seamlessly. The characters' conversation became part of the greater whole of the novel and the portrait it creates. So don't be concerned when the characters speak without punctuation, just sit back and enjoy the ride. I certainly did!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Like a plaintive wail, this book resonates with a simple and honest beauty that strikes the soul of the sensitive reader. The beauty is in the stark simplicity and the ease it is to visualize the characters so frankly revealed. This is a work of genius, a work where less is more, and the relationship of land to man offers extraordinarily significant reflections.Those that are portrayed are etched firmly in the reader's mind. Each are struggling with hardships and begin to intersect and connect so that the plot takes on an immensely hopefull tone, one that is not stretched beyond one's endurance, but so sweet and lovely that the joy of the story is indeed your reward."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I had been meaning to read Kent Haruf's \\"Plainsong\\" for some time. So when this National Book Award finalist was chosen as the One Book AZ selection of the year, I thought there was no better time to finally get around to it. But as often seems the case, the anticipation of reading a \\"chosen\\" book only seems to lead to disappointment. While this is certainly nothing terribly wrong with this \\"slice of life\\" tale of life in a fictional small town in Colorado, Haruf's work just did not do much for me. Normally I am eager to finish a book &#65533; but with just one more sitting left -- it took me nearly a week to find the time to come back and read the closing chapters. As with most of the book, the \\"plain\\" ending was a bit underwhelming. While I do not feel novels need to be wrapped up in a nice tidy package, \\"Plainsong\\" provides minimal closure. With the exception of the old rancher brothers, I did not see a whole lot of growth in the characters over the course of the novel. In the end, they still strike me as a bunch of losers who could stand a good talking to from Dr. Phil. But maybe that is the point.That said, the book is a pretty quick read and well-written. The only technical quibble I have, as other reviewers have noted, is Haruf's abandonment of quotation marks for dialogue. Although this did not personally pose a huge reading hurdle, I still found myself constantly distracted by their absence. Haruf is adept at creating a small-town feel, but overall I just did not feel a whole lot of satisfaction after finishing \\"Plainsong.\\" Not awful, not awesome &#65533; just okay."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Kent Haruf has put together an amazing book. Wonderfully well written, with intereasing well-developed characters, and great mini pots intertwined throughout the chaptres. Each chaptre is like a mini story in the book. In which the characters end up intertwining with each other at different parts in the book. He uses many literary elements in his writing. Such as motifs, &quot;ing&quot; pharses, and he uses great detal to paint a picture in the readers mind. He shows how life goes in small town, and the bond that a small town has with each of its town members. The way he the characters in the book make me wonder if he came from a samll colorado town. He knows samll town life all to well. It is a fast read, and it keeps the attation of the readers, with something that relates to you. A novel that feels like a short story.

By the end of the story, you are sure to appreciate the simple goodness of both the characters and the writing.The book is told from the perspective many different characters -Ike and Bobby, two young boys in Holt; Victoria Robideaux, a pregnant teenager, and the McPheron brothers, who take her in. Most central, however, is Maggie Jones, a teacher at the local high school. Through her words and deeds, she links together the various characters, and helps to make their county into a true community.The stories is perhaps well-known: a town, a child in trouble, a marriage failing. The writing is what makes this book worth reading, and makes these often-told tales come alive again."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"the word plainsong is said to mean a hymn or prayer. the citizens of holt may need this, as every person does. i would like you to meet Victoria Roubideux, Bobby and Ike Guthrie, Tom Guthrie and the McPheron brothers. all of these are key players in this intricate story of life in a small town. this story is so life like that you will wonder if you are reading a piece of fiction or a biography. i give this book 4 3/4 stars, and strongly recomend it."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"If Faulkner ever decided to write a &quot;come-together&quot; book, this would be it.

Things worked out the way you wanted them to, leading the story to be uplifting at the end. So many books today are tragic and sad, reading Plainsong was an enjoyable change. My only criticisms are that I felt the author didn't connect the characters as much as he could have. I didn't really identify with the group of them at the end, as I did individually throughout the book. Maggie is a lead character that &quot;ties&quot; the small rural community together and I feel the author could have made her a &quot;stronger character&quot; for that role. All in all, well written and fun."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Yes, Plainsong is written simply (no quotes around the words that are spoken, some run-on paragraphs, but these are evident immediately and set the writing style of the book). It is a &quot;quick read&quot;. Why? I am not sure, because it is very descriptive, verbal, you are there, personal, yet it flows so well... You clearly and quickly understand where you are, who you are with, and what is going on (to a limited extent, only because you have not lived there through the duration). You learn of the situation and circumstances and want to go on with these people. You are with them - you know them... They may err in the eyes of human culture and rules, yet they do or don't (I have my opinion, but...). They go by their guts, their ideas, and ideals of rights. (Does it sound like our current elections!) This is a plain book, a simple book, a story that is basic. What is right for one person is their right (are we not a free country?) - not the right of others to judge (this is difficult for all) and rule ( elections again)!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I feel like Anna is a good writer, but spends to much time builing the characters, she tells us all about them and how their feeling but there isn't much real drama involved, while reading the book I felt like, come on, come one, lets get to the &quot;good part&quot;..... and when the &quot;good parts&quot; would come it was over so fast that I was let down."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I would like to think it is because I am only 22 and this novel was written by a man 40+ my age and that I cannot relate to him, but I have read Faulkner and Hemingway and McCarthy and can't rationalize anymore. This book was horrible. In Haruf's attempt to emulate great novelists, he fails with intermediate and weightless prose, reminding me of many 'authors' in my middle school. The characters had no feeling. They were as vague as the setting and I had no impression of the novel except that it was a waste of time. The dialogue was highly implausible and the situations the characters fall into are so desperately lacking feeling that I don't feel for them. If this book was a finalist for the National Book Award, then literature is going downhill. It's violently upsetting."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"What is the deal with the run-on sentences? They are distracting at best, incomprehensible at worst. I can't comment on the story line because I haven't finished the book...and don't know if I will after reading, &quot;Overhead the sky was as blue as just-washed cafe crockery and the sun was shining brilliantly.&quot; I would expect to read something like that in a college creative writing class. I'll stick to Irving and Vonnegut...this &quot;flowery&quot; writing makes me cringe and distracts me from the story as I critique the poetry. In my opinion, if distracts from the story, it simply doesn't work."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The town doesn't know whether to believe Tom (a career teacher with no history of trouble) or Russ beckman (the town bully with a laundry list of priors)?Victoria, who has been presented as sensitive and caring, doesn't ever think to call theold men from Denver?Come on.But for all its 'All the Pretty Horses'-wannabeness, Haruf has written a genlt, engaging novel. Only, its more of a supermarket-Oprah bok than real literature. To me, anyway."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Yes, this novel IS simple, eloquently phrased and astutely observed. I can see why people are reading it in droves. However, Plainsong is strangely boring! I know nothing is really supposed to happen and plot development is kept to a minimum but the story is turgid and ultimately unexciting. The novel does &quot;sing&quot; like wind rising across the Colorado Plains and there is a nice lyrical flow to the prose but there is also a lack of anything else happening. This lack of substance is all the more peculiar when you consider the themes Haruf is exploring - teenage pregnancy, small town politics, physical abuse, drugs and alcohol etc. Actually this novel could really read as a Sunday night tacky, sensational miniseries - a made for TV movie! Everyone comes together to experience the multi-generational joys of motherhood, so what! Does the exploration of this topic really demand three hundred pages, especially when it has all been done before. The angst of small town working class America is becoming a little passe now re: Billie Letts. This certainly wan't go down as a great work of American Literature but it is readable nonetheless."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"PLAINSONG is just plain sorry! What has happened to the American reader's intellect? I'm not opposed to &quot;dumbing down&quot; in order to clarify if an author's writing about, for example, black holes, or the Zero, but PLAINSONG's character portraits and plot lines read like the outline for a movie script, or like a volume in an Introduction-to-Reading series. Fair enough, but not great fare for the average reader. To Haruf, I say Harumph! This book is the Son of Bridges of Madison Crummy -- if you loved that, you'll go bonkers for this!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I've heard praises of PLAINSONG for a long time thus far but have only recently picked it up to see what everyone's been talking about. Unfortunately this book has failed to capture me as it did others. While I did enjoy some aspects of the plot, other storylines annoyed and distracted me from my overall satisfaction. The plight of Victoria, a pregnant teenager kicked out of her mother's house and subsequently taken in by the generous townspeople, bordered on the sentimentalism of a Lifetime movie. [Amazingly, Billie Letts' WHERE THE HEART IS kept popping into my mind, as there are many parallels between the pregnant teenagers in these two books]. I also was frustrated several times as I doubted the authenticity of Victoria's actions. Regardless of my annoyance of Victoria, there are some redeeming qualities in PLAINSONG. I believe the characters with the rough edges around their corners were the best developed and most interesting (i.e., the McPheron brothers, Maggie Jones' senile father, Guthrie's estranged wife, and the old woman on the paper route.) I also enjoyed the setting of Holt, a small town in the high plains of Colorado. Kent Haruf should be commended for his portrayal of a small town as I could easily envision it in my mind.Overall, I believe that if PLAINSONG lacked the storyline of Victoria it would have been much better. Evaluating the good and bad aspects I come to the conclusion that PLAINSONG is an average book that has potential for more."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This Book was a very well written and great novel in the first 100 pages. Then it was downhill from there. The settings and new characters introduced in the first couple chapters made it very interesting. When all of the characters had been introducted then that is when the book went downhill. From page 100 to the end the book was a bore. I was struggling to read it and stay awake at the same time. The only good thing that was used in this book was its wonderful use of participles and the way that they depicted the setting very well. They made a boring book somewhat interesting, but in the end the novel was a compleat waste of time to read."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"There were parts in this story for everyone to identify with. A teenage girl with a strained relationship between her and her mother. There's two old men that farm and are rather bland in an interesting way. There's an unwed teenage girl who runs off with the baby's father. There's concerned school teachers. Just an all around interesting book with writing that makes you feel like you're actually there. Very good book.....Highly recommend it....You'll enjoy it"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I had read more than a few glowing reviews of this book and was hoping that it would live up to its reputation. Thank goodness I wasn't disappointed. I had a difficult time trying to explain to other people exactly what made me put this book in my &quot;top 10&quot; favorites, but I believe that it was the fundamental &quot;true-ness&quot; of it. Several unpleasant things happen during the course of the story -- you will see just what people are capable of doing -- and yet Haruf shows us the inherent goodness that (many) ordinary, everyday people have and share with others. I laughed out loud at some of the dialog but my husband was perplexed to find me weeping towards the end of the novel. He said, &quot;I thought this was a laughing book.&quot; It is both things. (And in case you were wondering, the crying was the sort that you do when you see something beautiful and not the sort from an unhappy ending.)"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Because it was a very fast read (skim), simplistic &amp; superficial, and on our book discussion group list. It must be of regional interest, it hardly seemed like any real people were involved - agree with earlier critic, in that, the characters never said anything in quotes. It was as if I were looking in on play characters running around the scenery; and the convergence of characters was a stretch of early childhood imagination."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"An easy read about the lives of ordinary townspeople and how their lives become intertwined.

Victoria is character that is caught up in a serious problem. Haruf brings to life the trials and tribulations of this girls problems. Ike and Bobby are two boys in the town of Holt. Haruf shows how their thought of sex is molded through their society.

The reader gets the experiance of living in someone elses shoes."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This book is amazing. It shows closely life in a small town. Reading it reminds me of everything that has happened to me in my own life. Having parents who are highly profile I can relate to Ike and Bobby, having everyone watch me closely. Victoria is your normal troubled teen that needs help, and certain people in the town will help them out. Every character in this book is showing the life and profile that people are expecting them to be, such as, having a stereotype and having to keep it on them at all times. Plainsong is a great book if you are curious about small town life or if you live in a small town and want to relate to it in your own life."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This story didn't seem very appealing to me when we were first assigned to read it. Once I began reading and got involved in the book, I couldn't put it down. Thick books aren't usually the first things I go for, but this novel is a very quick and delightful read. The author has a way of painting pictures with his words and that is what keeps me interested. I enjoyed reading Plainsong very much and in the future I plan to read more of Kent Haruf's novels. His way of writing is extraordinary and a style I have not seen in a while."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Our senior English calss was assigned to read Kent Haruf's Plaisnsong.

It's a story of love and a story of hate. A story of seperation and a story of unity. It's a story of struggles and a story of accomplishments. It's a story of life. A small town of people swirling in the tide of loneliness, finding each other. A pregnant teenager inwhirled into the lives of two old ranchers. Two young brothers tossed in middle of their parents seperation. A troubled teacher intangled with a troubled student. Plainsong takes the simplist troubles of big city and makes them monumental in a small town."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Although Plainsong comes off as an ordinary book about the life of people in a small world in Colorado I feel it had a deeper meaning in it than the author Kent Haurf meant it too. This story is jammed packed full of symbolic motifs as well as metaphoric symbolism's. I found this book to be very compelling and insightful as a coming of age adult that I can relate and reflect myself too. If it is one thing I learned after reading this novel is that you have to read books on a gray scale not just black and white. After reading this fine piece of literature I can appreciate much more now."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong, written by Kent Haruf, is a wonderful and easy book to read. It kept me pretty interested throughout the book. I have to admit that there were some parts where I lost interest, but not very often. I really liked the integration of the stories. It always kept me wondering how everyone would finally meet and how the stories all came together. I grew up in Colorado, so I can picture the whole setting, yet there was still much left to my imagination. In addition, all of the stories seemed very realistic. I especially liked the story of Victoria. Her life seems almost unimaginable. She is a very strong girl. Waking up to two old men that you just met; walking around school knowing that everyone is gossiping about you; and living in a completely unstimulating life; now that is amazing. The stories of Guthrie, Ike, and Bobby are equally incredible, though being a seventeen year old girl myself; I understand the character of Victoria best."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"When I was assigned the book Plainsong by my English teacher, I groaned inwardly, thinking to myself that this was another Lord of the Flies. I procrastinated horribly, and the day before our first quiz I finally picked the book up and began to read. I was instantly pulled into the story and into the characters lives by Kent Haruf's spectacular writing style. That night I read over three-quarters of the book, loathing to set it down. The characters became so real and familiar that I was wishing that the story would never end. Victoria, especially, jumped out at me; drawing me almost against my will into her life and reminding me of my own. This is an amazingly well-written book, brimming with emotions that depict the reality of small-town life. Plainsong is definitely a book to read."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong is the kind of book that is revealing but its almost not intense enough. Plainsong is a contempory novel written in a time zone a lot like ours. The book starts out with a pregnant 17 year old, a pair of boys with bairly no mother, and a lonly teacher. Throughout the book the characters are faced with problems that are overcome with friendship and love.Throughout the book most of the stories kept me very interested. But some of them had to many description in them and that got really kinda old to read. I did like how the story reflected modern day situations and had lots of detail to back it up. The book was worth the read but its not like I would ever read it again."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"If you savor art rendered with grace and understatement, put \\"Plainsong\\" on your reading table. A perfectly balanced high wire performance with no safety net in sight, this amazing celebration of the ordinary conceals its considerable craft in the guise of \\"effortless\\" writing. Is this The Great American Novel? Of course not. But it is among them. Yes, it's that good."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong is a lovely, well written story. The true genius of this book is the graceful manner in which Haruf approaches the story and its characters. As a reader this book is a true gift; as a writer it challenges many of my assumptions about the art and the craft of writing. Those reviews that dismiss this book as boring or without plot miss the fundamental point of this work."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I actually bought this book to pass it on again, Ive already read it nurmerous times and seen the movie, Its an easy read with a simple story that just leaves you happy, I wish more people could have the opportunity to read this... just average people who can take the time to help each other out. shipping was beyond fast... if you are questioning buying this book I say just give it a try, its one of those books everyone should read, I made my husband read it, he got through it in 2days, and for a non-reader thats shows that he even enjoyed it"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"With its unassuming simplicity and compelling characters, Plainsong weaves a gentle narrative of life on the high plains. I have read this book several times and each time I come away with a feeling of reverence. My heart is full and not everything is alright just like life anywhere.Haruf has the ability to bring the reader fully into his vision without being too wordy. Read it and treasure it."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Mr. Haruff tells a beautiful story about compassion, friendship and caring with a sparse tenderness that frankly took my breath away. A simply wonderful read, pure pleasure."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong comes before Eventide, which continues the story so be sure to read in order of publication. I believe Hallmark made a movie of this but the book is a thousandfold better."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Can't put it down. The writing style keeps the reader interested from the first page to the end of the story."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The small town of Holt, Colorado, could actually be any small farming town, in any State, in any time period. In fact, there is never an inference as to what year this is with the exception that when you paid the newspaper carrier, you received a paper stub for your receipt. I remember these from the 1980's and before.Tom Guthrie is a high school teacher with a wife and 2 young sons ages 8 and 9. His wife, Ella, stays in the dark guest room suffering from depression. We never learn exactly why she is depressed. Guthrie is left to take care of the land, house, and children along with his own job at the school. At school he is under pressure to pass a student who is not doing his work and is a bully. The school just wants him to graduate and leave, whereas Guthrie does not want him to be the exception. Through out the book, this student, Russell, will cause trouble for Guthrie and his family.Victoria Roubideaux is a high school teenager who is kicked out of her house by her mother when she becomes pregnant. She goes to her high school teacher, Maggie Jones, for help. Ms. Jones makes arrangements for her to stay with 2 old bachelor brothers, the McPheronsThe McPheron brothers lost their parents when they were young and the two have stayed on the farm ever since. When Ms Jones ask them to let Victoria stay with them, they take her in. They develop a bond and relationship with this young woman and her unborn child.The book is written without using quotation marks for the dialogue. At first you have to figure out who is talking but it doesn't take long to understand who is talking to whom. The flow of words is smooth as is the storyline. It is a simple story of a few people in a small town, how they look after each other, and how their lives intertwine."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Kent Haruf has a beautifully spare way of writing about which draws me in completely. His tale is that of ordinary folk going about the business of living with all of the pain and joy that this encompasses. Not many books make me sob and laugh out loud, but this one did.In some respects I enjoyed Eventide even more than Plainsong."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This book is immediately gripping and has a lovely, spare narrative voice, enough that I didn't care that the plot had few surprises. The direction of pregnant teenager's subplot is too good to spoil here, but safe to say that some of her scenes with other characters are among the sweetest I've read in a novel in some time, while Haruf's tight prose keeps the novel from verging into the over-sentimental. A good, swift read that I'd recommend to any lover of contemporary fiction, particularly anyone from the American Midwest or West."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I really enjoyed the book and liked the author's style of writing. I found the characters believable and likeable and wished I could know them for real and that life was really like the way it was in the book."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I thought this book had great potential. The characters were interesting and the plot was cleverly interwoven to include all the main characters eventually but the book just kind of ends, leaving me hanging and wanting more. I guess it is a sign that a book is good if you want to read more, but it tends to leave me feeling unsatisfied. Was the author intending to write a sequel to this book because he certainly left a lot of questions unanswered. Maybe that was his intention but I always say if you got a story to tell, finish what you start and don't leave so many things dangling. I would still recommend this book but I wish the author would write another book to tie up the loose ends."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Haruf's characters are at once brilliant and foolish, simple and complex. I loved this book, and could barely put it down. It's a story of regular people living in a small town, and the problems that plague us all. The motherless boys, the lonely school teacher, the old woman in the stuffy apartment . . . we know these people. It's the first Haruf book I've read, but by no means the last. Beautifully written and presented, in easy to manage chapters . . . a perfect book. I'm telling all my friends about it."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I just finished this book, I wish I had just started. Most people don't think of Washington, D.C. as having small town neighborhoods, but we did when I was growing up. Of course, there's very little resemblance between then and now, but Plainsong reminded me of those times. They weren't all good, financially or emotionally, but they were real. There was time to consider, to think, and we lived lives with real people, Plainsong reminds of those real neighbors who had each other's measure. The busybodies, the old ladies who cornered you and knew you would be respectful because they knew you had manners, the bullies -- young and old that everybody knew about, the women who were independent and helpful in their own woman-like way, and the people who you could count on because they meant what they said. Read Plainsong, you can go home again."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong is the story of three groups of people - a pregnant girl, a father of two, and two old bachleors. These three groups will become intertwined in very realistic and ordinary ways. Plainsong presents a look at everyday people dealing with their life issues.Haruf paints a picture for the reader of the need for family and challenges the reader to think about what constitutes a family. The message that I gained from reading Plainsong was that of family by choice. Once you have love, caring and commitment within a group of people you have the seeds of a family.Plainsong was an interesting novel to read. Often as readers we expect the deep and dark rather than the ordinary. This is a new concept to behold. I have spent alot of time reflecting on Plainsong and the strongest message is of the necessity family in any form. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The pace of the story mimics that of the small town it takes place in . The characters are richly drawn, but not caricatures. Not a lot happens, but I believe that's the point. There is no urgency to the story, and I liked it that way. The author, like James Lee Burke, has an affection for beauty of the land. Reading this book is like taking a stroll down the main street of Holt County, in which the story takes place. Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This book is a great novel and I loved it! It took me a while to read because I got into it so much that I had to stop, but when it was over, I wanted to read more about the creative characters that Kent HAruf made up. It was a great book, as are Haruf's other books (The Tie that Binds, and Where You Once Belonged.) When you read this book, look for eight main characters that make up Kent Haruf's wonderful, compelling Plainsong!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"After reading Plainsong, I will read Kent Haruf's other books with the expectation that there is the same gentle message that is pervasive throughout this book. The kindnesses that the characters extend to each other have the greatest immediate and long-term effects on their lives. I was so touched by the brothers who received as much as they gave through sharing their lives with a virtual stranger when her own family had abandoned her. This is a book that will remain in its readers' hearts."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I could have just as easily enjoyed an entire book about the McPheron brothers and Victoria Roubideaux, but all of the characters were real, likable people. Part of the book's charm is that some of the plot lines were left unresolved--it's like you're able to look in on these people's lives for just a moment, but you have to guess what happens to them after you leave."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"With one exception, the sexual references in this book aredone with subtlety. The one overt scene is absolutey necessary to thecharacterization of both Ike and Bobby, and the high school kid who runs afoul of Guthrie.

It earns every emotion we feel towards the characters. END"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"A touching story about plain folks on the Plains.

I thank them and Mr. Haruf and look forward to reading more of his work!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"like 'snow falling on cedars' plainsong has received great reviews... too great. the sparse prose and sparser punctuation is similar to cormac mccarthy, giving us two modern western authors who apparently believe the silence of big empty spaces is best rendered without quotation marks. at the end of the day plainsongs foreboding juxtaposition of stories is ultimately only Plainly interesting, neither cathartic, nor uplifting, nor artful enough to qualify for greatness sans plot. but now we know: what would 'my antonia' be like set in 1996? for the angst of the modern small town west mcmurtry's 'duane's depressed' goes a lot deeper, and is a lot more fun, too."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Whenever you are assigned a book in class you instantly expect to hate the reading. This was true when I was assigned Plainsong in my Senior Contemporary Literature class. Although I will admit I can see why other people enjoy this book. I am more into fantasy, I read mostly Salvatore and Goodkind. When I read a book I enjoy I always get into this zone where I can read page after page and lose track of time, this book did not do that for me. I was weirded out by Haruf's not using quotes. Some people were confused by the switching between the four main characters, I was used to this from my earlier reading. Haruf is an author you must get used to, not jump right into.The book did hit home on a couple of issues, such as when Victoria was kicked out of her house for being pregnant, this happened to a very good friend of mine a couple of years ago. Ike and Bobby reminded me of my cousin, getting up at the crack of dawn to deliver papers just to help his parents out. This book does deliver when it comes to relating to real life.Kent Haruf is a good author, don't get me wrong there, he is just not an easy author to be a fan of. This book will probablly become a classic and torment highschool students for years to come, I think it should, due to Haruf's unique writing style. Some people might think this is truly a masterpiece, however, as I said at the beginning, it is simply not my style."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong has characters that catch the reader's attention early in the book and holds one until the reader grows to love them with all their quirks. Kent Haruf gives us enough insight to each of the character's stories to arouse curiosity over what he or she is going to do next. Although the style is never told in first person, I am reminded of Kingslover's Poisonwood Bible, for it was in that novel that I felt so strong a connection to the characters. I will take the time to read more of Mister Haruf's work, as I am happy to find a novel that I enjoyed this extensively."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"a constellation of great characters, the lack of \\\\pretense, a compelling story (several, actually) and a deceptively simmple style that is the mark of great skill.

A truly superb story by an obvious master. highly recommended -- it was a life enhancing novel, thank you mr. Haruf..."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I found this book annoying to read. The style has potential, and appears to be letting the characters speak for themselves. However, the author's prejudices come through way too strongly. It is very clear that some characters are &quot;good&quot; and the others are &quot;bad&quot;; some of the characters are very close to being caricatures. There is no character development to speak of."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The title of the book is at least a triple play on the word &quot;Plain.&quot; It refers to the plainsong of the medieval church, which proceeds straightforwardly, without added harmonies. Like the music, this story proceeds simply and straightforwardly. Thirdly, it takes place on the high plains of the American continent -- a semi-arid area always on the brink of disaster because of drought. And perhaps the title also reflects the fact that in the intelligence community, an unencrypted text is called &quot;plaintext.&quot; It is as though the author has decyphered for us an encrypted song -- seven months in the lives of high plains people. These people are at first hard to like, they are so harsh and dry like their land, but by the end we care about them, largely because of a baby born to an unwed teenage mother who is taken care of by two old (harsh and plain) bachelors. The only criticism I have is that the author has perhaps taken on too much -- there are some distractions in the story that need not be there."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This was a great book to read on a long train ride.

I thought the scene in the shack with the boys was totally unneccessary. Not enough plot, or understanding of it in the book as a whole. Liked the old men though, and Victoria. What did Guthrie have to do with this story anyway? The characters didn't seem to mesh. Oh well. It was a book."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"&quot;Plainsong,&quot; by Kent Haruf, is a book about people and how they react to difficult situations. A teenage girl becomes pregnant and is kicked out of the house for being so. She has no where to go and no one to turn to, until she meets two old men who take her in. There is also a teacher who is forced to raise two boys alone after his wife abandons them all. These people overcome their fate and come together to solve their problems.In &quot;Plainsong&quot;, Kent Haruf uses setting to help develop the theme of when you are alone it is comforting to have someone there to help. Being set in a little town called Holt, Colorado, east of Denver, he creates a setting that anyone can relate to. He develops regular people, places and events that allows the reader to feel the problems of the characters. Even though Holt is a little town with a small population, the people are still faced with everyday problems that are universal. Everyone in this world appreciates having someone there when they have a problem, this is the theme demonstrated in Plainsong."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The characters became actual friends. The story was real in that not everything had a happy ending, life can be tough. Can certainly see this being made into a film (but the book is always better). This will be one I recommend to my reading friends..."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Wow! Simple yet absolutely brilliant. I look forward to more novels from Kent Haruf."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"A entrancing novel, I won't forget it and am now impatiently waiting for Kent Haruf's next book."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"At the end of American culture, with nothing but hardness in life, in love, in entertainment, the longing for sweet old-time niceness is intense, and can be re-sold back to people. There is no sense of community in this book, and yet people act gratuitously &quot;nice.&quot; There is no real plot, only scenes that alternate between bad people and nice people and their encounters. In such simple terms, the book might have been rendered better through the eyes of one Guthrie's boys. As it stands, the book assumes a community that doesn't exist, and then everything flows from this space of non-existence. Note: Maggie Jones tells the two brothers who take in the pregnant girl &quot;You need to do this.&quot; If that line ever worked at all, things wouldn't be so screwed up. So, in this sense, the book rests upon the imaginary of community--perhaps similar to what William Faulkner said about love &quot;It's a good thing they put it in books because that's the only place it exists.&quot; This in no way means that there aren't nice people, or nice gestures, just that as a &quot;vehicle&quot; for a novel, it seems to be all promise, and no delivery. It might keep readers going until the last pages, but in the end its the same old same old of the imaginary resolution to problems that cannot be solved by relying on the kindness of strangers. Of course, Williams knew that, and Haruf should too."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Sometimes simplicity can be more beautiful than complexity, when all the excess details are stripped away and you have the unadorned essence of a thing. I feel like this is what the author was trying to do in Plainsong, but unfortunately it didn't work. It turned out to be a drab, uninteresting portrait of life in Anytown, USA. Reading Plainsong, I got the feeling that I had read it before. The scenes and people were all standard and predictable. The characters and their conflicts seemed one-dimensional, cut out for their roles in a novel (the teenage girl with the abusive boyfriend, the single dad trying to raise two innocent boys, the heart-of-gold neighbor, the crusty old farmers...) The result was that I had lost interest in them after their first introduction, because they were so plain and familiar, almost cliche. I don't need a novel to be full of excitement and bizarre plot twists, which is why I thought I'd like an understated, quiet book like this. But Plainsong had nothing original or interesting to say about its characters' plain, ordinary lives. It was like a black &amp; white photograph of the great plains - if it's done right it can be beautiful in its simplicity, but if it's not done well, it's just a gray snapshot of a flat landscape. Plainsong was the latter for me."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"All the praise which has been heaped upon this books is well deserved. Only wish I could give it more stars."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The story was choppy and hard to follow. I had to put the book down after 10 pages. The writing style reminded me of the camera work on NYPDBlue, too keen to show the reader everything at once rather than what is pertinent."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"II am not very fond of reading and I had to read this book as a class room assignment. Other books that we have read I have likedbut this one I did not like because it seemed too boring and confusing. I also don't see how the characters connect. I think that this book might have been more appealing if it had a better title. In this book i thought that the characters were going through alot of turmoil and mental anguish. I also didn't see the climax in this novel it gave me a headache while reading. I suggest you take some ibuprofen before reading this novel."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Haruf's composition is make of unadorned prose and characters whose lives reflect and move through each other and yet are each vivid and singular.

Flat characters. Trite \\"deeper meaning\\"."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I was duped by all the wonderful reviews I read of this book. I found it boring, contrived and meandering. The characters just seemed to wander around bumping into eachother occasionally, with no real sense of purpose. Like the title says, it is &quot;plain,&quot; but not in a good way. I guess I just expect more from a book."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Kent Haruf's Plainsong is set in Denver and tells of a father's increasing alienation from his two boys after his wife dies, and a teenage girl's pregnancy and outcast condition which brings them together. Small town life and limited personal concerns blend in this warm and realistic novel of sets of lives entwined by circumstance.Diane C. Donovan Reviewer"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The author tries to pull you into the lives of too many people at once. I really wanted to find out more about some of the characters but it got to a point where I just didn't care and I couldn't finish the book. It's got sex, love and trouble but never at any point does Kent answer any questions. How this book won an award is beyond me.Skip this book unless you like being confused and cheated out of a good read."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I listen to a lot of books on tape in my car and this was one of the worst. A vulgar, angry waste of time. There is no interesting dialog or plot and we are left hanging at the end. Don't bother - there is nothing of value here."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I beg to differ from almost everyone else--from the title I anticipated something more serene until my reading was jarred by gratuitous sexual scenes and white-trash swearing, which did not contribute anything to the story. It seemed that some of these paragraphs were just &quot;stuck in there&quot; to satisfy todays taste for the gross and crass, making sure the book would be bought. To repeat, it disturbed me that some of the language and sexual encounters were very gratuitous. For the remainder, the book wasn't all that well written, no jewel of the English language. Sorry, but this is my opinion."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"PLAINSONG is one of those novels that sneaks up on a reader, beginning with understated prose and culminating with such authorial affection that the reader does not want to leave the fictional world. Haruf follows the lives of several characters in rural Holt, Colorado - Guthrie, an honest school teacher whose wife has suffered a nervous breakdown; his two sons, Ike and Bobby, who find themselves facing death, independence, and growing up; Victoria Roubideaux, a pregnant teenager thrown out of her mother's house; the McPherons, Harold and Raymond, bachelor brothers who know more about cattle prices and corn cribs than they do about people; and Maggie Jones, the woman who connects them.I did not fall in love with this novel until the hundredth page or so, and then I could not put it down. The narrative flows like a meandering river - steadily but without visible ripples on the surface - and so it takes time to become fully invested in Haruf's characters. Fortunately, the characterizations, fictional details and the quality of the prose are strong enough from the start to keep one reading. The rhythms of life in Holt and the honest, almost innocent, way its citizens face their trials give this novel a graceful elegiac quality.PLAINSONG is a quiet character-driven novel that evokes small town life on the American Plains. I heartily recommend it to readers who like this kind of fiction."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This is one of the very best books I've read in a while, and I read 2-3 books a week. I had to force myself to read it slowly so I could savor it. The writing is simple and beautiful, the setting and climate are evoked descriptively, the main characters are honorable, courageous, and likable, and the McPheron brothers are fabulous. I knew it would be excellent when I saw on the back cover that Richard Russo and Howard Frank Mosher, two of my very favorite authors, praised it."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I believe this book was nominated for an award or two, and it is well written and easy to read in a sitting or two. The story line is familiar--life in a small town in a rural setting. Most of us live in urban areas these days, but many have parents or grandparents who lived in small towns, or can imagine life in a place where everyone knows everyone.Any number of books including murder mysteries are set in towns or villages. This is a refreshing book because the characters are real but not psychotic. They all have too much going on in their own lives to meddle with others or murder a neighbor. Haruf depicts the day to day struggle--to get out of bed, to get to work, to do your job, to find love. You come to care about his characters, particularly Maggie Jones the school teacher who brings people together. It is Maggie who understands the needs of the McPheron brothers, Vitoria Roubideaux, and Tom Guthrie. She isn't a do-good Mrs. Fix-it either, just a kindly person who cares enough to make a useful suggestion, lend a helping hand, or offer a word of encouragement. In the end, all the characters whose lives have been touched by Maggie's simple grace have formed a better life for themselves.My only criticism of the book is that it lacks a sense of connectedness with the setting. The characterization is strong and the plot is straightforward, but I did not feel &quot;present&quot; in the story. I had the sense I was moving underwater and only vaguely comprehended my surroundings. It's the feeling I've had when coming out from under general anesthesia. I could not latch onto the story the same way I did with Jane Smiley's &quot;Thousand Acres&quot; where I could almost see and touch and smell the land.I sent my 85-year old Aunt (retired school teacher and high school counselor who lives in rural Wisconsin) the audio version of the book and she thoroughly enjoyed it. She said it sounded &quot;real&quot; to her and Victoria reminded her of any number of girls she had known while she was teaching."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Beautiful, beautiful book. The authentic voices allow the reader to co-create the characters, making for a rewarding reading experience. The style is a tribute to Strunk &amp; White: less is more, nouns and verbs win out over adjectives and adverbs. I stayed up til 2:30 a.m. reading this one, and never felt as though I'd missed the sleep."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Like Kent Haruf's previous books, Plainsong looks unflinchingly at the cruelty of &quot;plain&quot; human beings, and counterbalances all that's ugly with a remarkable &quot;song&quot; of human kindness and care. Two old brothers, who know little more about the world than birthing calves, take in a young woman rejected by her mother, abused by her lover, and take care of her as she prepares for the birth of a child. Two young brothers go through a terrible journey of loss--their mother, an old neighbor, their innocence about the world of sex and human cruelty--and find solace with the two older brothers who've built their dignity on a lifetime of shared losses. And a teacher, accused of abusing a boy who's bullied his sons, finds love when his wife has abandoned him and the sons he tries to protect.This book, nominated for the National Book Award, is subtle, understated, lovely. And like Kent Haruf's other remarkable novels, it is fully grounded in the plain and beautiful language of ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. You must read this book."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Unlike the reviewer from Sydney, I am one Aussie who really loved this book. Like all of Kent Haruf's work, this novel is finely crafted to the point where it all seems deceptively simple. It is not only a wonderful character portrayal (and a surprisingly good read), but like all the best American fiction, integrates its characters with the landscape. This is something Haruf has done well twice before and I urge anyone who liked this book to get hold of his first two: &quot;The Ties that Bind&quot; and &quot;Where You Once Belonged&quot;. The latter, in particular, is a masterpiece employing the same spare style but building to a tragic climax that is truly heart-rending. It is out of print, but hopefully the success of &quot;Plainsong&quot; will encourage the publishers to re-issue it. Angolphiles won't like &quot;Plainsong&quot; or, indeed, any of Haruf's books, but what do they know?"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong offers you snapshots of several lives interwoven into a story set in the small town of Holt. Its prose is simple, without exaggeration and unnecessary stimulation, yet as you continue reading, it pulls you into caring about its characters and their troubles.I started out reading this book impatiently looking for a punch-line or a twist. But I soon learned to enjoy Plainsong like a vacation with no agenda or urgency. There is no build up, climax or low point. But it is involving just the same. It's a novel about regular people that will remind you of friends you may already have, with problems that are timeless yet contemporary- teenage pregnancy, divorce, depression, as well as a healthy dose of the good things in life - friendship, generosity, the support of a community, new beginnings.A peaceful read; Plainsong's charm creeps up on you if you allow it. But you have to be in the \\"right\\" mindset or mood for it. If you're one who only gets a thrill out of an adventure-type of book, with many twist and turns, or prefer the surprise of an unpredictable ending from a fast paced novel or mystery, this book may disapoint you."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong, by Kent Haruf is one of the most satisfying reads in years. It seems an oxymoron to expect that a novel titled \\"Plainsong\\" and written in a style to mimic the \\"unadorned melody\\" found in the early Christian church, should provide so much depth. The novel is simple to read. And yet, it is in the simple characterizations that seems accurate to small time people they portray and the seemingly accurate dialects that Haruf patterns in the speech of these characters, which makes the reader feel the lives and experiences of the characters that people this book.A girl pregnant; a teacher who rises to the ocassion to help her; the McPherons', seemingly incapapable of providing the support they do or of growing as human beings, which they do. Ike and Bob, good kids, growing up on the best that small town life can give them. Guthrie, a teacher, unsentimentalized in Haruf's portrayal, doing the best he can as a single parent. There is some sterotyping here, but through his method of presenting the small town of Holt throught the lives of ten or twelve characters, Haruf appears to capture the unsimpleness and complicated issues of living life in a small town.I did not want this novel to end. The way it did end may have opened the door for a sequel. I hope so."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I read voraciously, mostly contemporary fiction, and I have been very disappointed with most offerings I have read in the past 12 months. Plainsong is a great exception to that rule. It is definitely plain, if you're looking for a pot boiler, look elsewhere. On the other hand, if you're looking for a novel with real, complex human emotions and truly touching characters, then this is the work for you. It will allow you to reconnect with your humanity."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I generally enjoy books that create an image that I can easily visualize. Kent Haruf has created these images for me thus making an impact not just from his wonderful narrative but because I can see his countryside, his dusty roads, his starlit nights, and his abandoned houses. But I can also see his emotions.I can see the fear in Ike and Bobbie's eyes, the lonliness in the heart of Victoria and the hope in Tom Guthrie.The characters in this book are no more special than each one of us. Tom Guthrie is a teacher whose nutso wife has left him with two sons. Victoria is a pregnant high school girl who doesn't know who to turn to. Maggie is a woman who hasn't found the right man but has a good heart. Ike and Bobbie are two kids learning about life.Sound familiar? That's because the author has captured us all in this book. He then winds us together makes us real and fills us with emotion. The images stay with you. The emotion disturbs you. I love reading books like this. You will not be able to read this book and not feel the same way!!!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Kent Haruf has created a book that is closely aligned to the works of our country's icons Edward Hopper, Aaron Copeland, and Robert Frost: spare, lean distillations of place and person that become quintessentially American.By confining his attention to a very small town in the middle of this vast country and isolating characters who, individually, represent our foibles and attributes but who interconnect by fate and by need, Haruf has given us a tool as manageable as one of those glass balls that when inverted swirl artificial snow on imaginary scenes - mesmerizing, wholly absorbing our atttention. With a writing style that excludes quotation marks, long sentences, and wordy diatribes, he crisply draws identifiable simple people from birth - the newborn infant through wide-eyed children, confused adolescents, deserted middle-aged loners, the elderly - to death. &quot;Plainsong&quot; is a clear, unfettered story, one that gives the reader a warm sense of understanding the purpose of the cycle of life.If you can put this novel down before finishing the last page in one sitting, you've a strong will!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I read on average two books per week and I have to say that, without question, this was my favorite book of 1999. It was touching and thought-provoking and much deeper than so much of the &quot;bubble-gum writing&quot; currently available. The fact that the book has not been one of Oprah's picks is further testament to the book's worth!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This book was about 2 kind old bachlors, who live on a farm knowing about nothing but the life they had lived for the last 50 years.It is also about a young pregnant girl, 2 young brothers and their father who is a high school teacher.This story tells a song about living in a little town such as Holt, Colorado.I have grown up in a large town, so I did not know the differences of living in a small town, but I still felt as if I could relate to this book. It will go in the top ten of my favorite books of all time. I can't wait to read the sequal."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This novel is not so much the story of a pregnant girl, two bachelor farmer brothers, and two teachers and their respective families. Instead, the author seems to wish to convey two main ideas: first, he wishes to paint a vivid portrait of life in rural Holt, Colorado. Second, he seeks to illustrate that both evil and goodness are all around us--you will be touched by both, but if you're lucky, hopefully you will experience more of the latter. In both of these goals, the author succeeds tremendously.The other reviewers have summarized the plot, and I will not describe it again here. I would argue that Victoria Roubideaux is at the center of the plot; through her, we experience all of the best and worst humanity has to offer. Among the best are Maggie Jones, the McPheron brothers, the bus driver who drives her from Denver to Holt. The worst include her mother, Dwayne, and the high school bully. Because Holt is a small town, each of the character's lives intersect with one another. The victim of life's unkindnesses has the opportunity to pass the unkindness on, or to start over again and be good to others.This is the simplest of stories. There are no earth-shattering plot twists and no real surprises. But the writing is so beautiful, and the story so simple and true, that I was simply mesmerized. This was a wonderful read from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"When I first purchased Plainsong, I didn't think the book would equal the hype which had surrounded it. Thus, I wasn't too surprised when it didn't reach those lofty levels. However, while I didn't find it equal to the hype, it is still a very entertaining reminder that there are great stories to be found in simple everyday living.Haruf clearly understands that life is made up of a series of little triumphs and little setbacks, instead of the grand drama that is common in most novels. He conveys this knowledge with a sparse writing style that mirrors the landscape where the story is set. The style appears at first glance to be very simple. However, it becomes clear that the language powerfully and convincingly conveys a multitude of actions and emotions going on underneath the surface. Nowhere does this quality become more apparent than in the development of the characters. Initially, they are so recognizable that one is tempted to call them stereotypes. However, Haruf uses simple, powerful language to flesh out his characters through their everyday exchanges with each other. By taking this action, the reader is able to more clearly focus on their shortcomings and their goodness. The result is that their successes and failures seem more personal and realistic.Plainsong has such a comfortable tone that one feels at the conclusion like they have been on a vacation in the book's setting. Don't get me wrong, it's not a perfect book (some of the plotting, particularly the \\"kidnapping\\", felt a little forced). But, it does possess a wonderfully accessible style that allows for the development of fascinating characters in recognizable situations. In this era when people seem to have less time to do anything, this paean to life's nuances is a gentle reminder that the most powerful moments in our existence are often the most common."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This story is a great book about everyday people who live everyday lives and is written in an astonishing way. Kent Haruf brings these characters to life. Mr. Haruf does a wonderful job you can feel all these people feel and you can even visulize the setting. The people all discover from each other and come together to make an amazing small town in Colorado. You have a pregnant teenager, a lonely schoolteacher, and old farming spinster brothers. The McPheron brothers and how you see their lives changed through loving a young pregnant girl who happens to spear on their doorstep. Maggie Jones is the one who binds all together through her strong, wonderful, helpful person she is. The boys Ike and Bobby go through some bad times but make it with their brotherly love. This is such a simple, plain story of everyday people characters that everybody should enjoy this excellent written book!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Sometimes how we feel about a fictional piece depends solely on whether we can identify with the characters or plot. If you've ever: lived in a rural community; known simple, honest, and hard-working country folks; had your heart broken; helped someone get through something ugly in their life; or had the privilege and tribulation of raising two boys, my bet is that Plainsong will be Yoursong. I found it similar in tone to The Earth Is Enough, which I liked very much, but with the added bonus of even more realistic characters. Tip: Don't start it too late at night if you're working the next day, because you'll likely not put it down 'til the wee hours of the morning."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"One of the best books I've read. A real story about real people, written in a down-to-earth style. It left me feeling warm all over and with a sense of renewal of faith in people. The style of writing intentionally matches and reinforces the substance. Great character development."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Every now and then, there comes an author keenly attuned to the rhythms of our speech, the conflicts of our hearts and the values which motivate our actions. Kent Haruf's spellbinding &quot;Plainsong&quot; so deftly recreates the atmosphere of a small, isolated, rural American town and populates that community with such compelling, conflicted and endearing characters that the reader simply cannot put his novel down. As did Steinbeck before him (and as do such gifted contemporaries as Kaye Gibbons and Ivan Doig), Mr. Haruf truly believes common, everyday Americans have much to say about what defines the national character. There is such dignity and decency in this book, shown against backdrops of cruelty, isolation and loneliness. Perhaps that is one reason I found myself humbled, by book's end, in reading it. This is a book to cherish and to share and will become one of the most memorable reading experiences in your life.This profoundly important work will remind readers what the purpose of literature is: to inform us, through the action of an absorbing narrative, that humans serve a distinctive purpose, and that purpose, though obscured by personal anguish, desperate lonelines and unfair circumstances, is to understand, assist and grow to love each other. Each of the seven central characters, who evolve into their own community, seems driven to comprehend and act on the central premise of human frailty and interdependence. Thus, whether it be a father coping with the fragility of his sons' emotional health in light of their mother's evolving emotional and physical removal from life or a quietly resolute teacher searching for solutions to a teen's unexpected pregnancy or two old bachelor brothers awakening to the confusing, liberating possibilities of life, Mr. Haruf invests them with uncommon purpose and promise.Thomas Jefferson once said that our nation possesses &quot;hope enough and to spare.&quot; Reading this triumphant novel, a reader will find renewal in the belief that our national purpose -- built on a sense of optimism and hope -- continues to live and to thrive in the hearts and minds of our most uncommom common people."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Kent Haruf, Plainsong (Vintage, 1999)Sometimes the simplest stories are the best. Haruf paints a picture of half a year in a small Colorado town, intertwining the lives of seven people into one powerful novel. While it wouldn't be accurate to call the book plot-driven, it's not your typical character study, either; too much goes on. Haruf's book inhabits the same literary terrain as does Cormac McCarthy's wonderful novel Child of God; it's a character-based book that reads too well to be a character-based book.The main plot thread, if there is one, concerns Victoria Roubideaux, a sixteen-year-old high-school junior who gets pregnant and is thrown out of her house. Her story touches that of the rest of the folks the book centers on, including two of her teachers, the two sons of one of those teachers, and a pair of brothers who have never known anything but the farm upon which they were born and raised. It is partially Victoria's plight that brings about the changes in these characters, but it's also just the way life goes; you live, you experience things, you learn from them. That's the way it's supposed to be, anyway, and Haruf creates a controlled world in his small town where the hand of the creator is, at least, invisible. This lends the book a fascinating realism, as if there weren't enough here in the simple stories of the simple people portrayed to keep you going anyway. I doubt there are more than a handful of people who haven't already read this book; hopefully, they'll get around to it soon. ****"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I skipped over this book while perusing the library shelves many times. But finally I noticed the audio version and decided to give it a go. I often find myself really enjoying the audio versions of books I would not normally read.The reader did a great job at bringing the characters to life for me. He did an especially good job at representing the McPheron brothers. I am glad I took the risk because this book is now counted among my favorites. I am going to search out other books by this author."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I wanted to read this book because it's going to be the feature book for &quot;One Book&quot;. It started a little slow, but I grew to love the characters. I ordered it in the unabridged version in CD format as I listen to books on my one hour commute each day. I found myself sitting in the car, unable to turn it off, in several places. Make the effort, you'll love it."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I agree with the professional reviewers in that the book is an enticing slice of rural, small-town America. The author has been there: He has seen cattle separated from the herd, witnessed life on an isolated farm, been a young boy on the loose trying to figure it all out, and experienced the cruelty of the restless teenager.My only quibble is with occasional lapses in wording. The author overuses the word &quot;about&quot;....&quot;about 10:30,&quot; &quot;about ten feet from here...&quot;And his time sequences are infrequently off kilter, as when Victoria goes out to the barn at 5:00 to report her labor pains,but the three of them then &quot;waited the rest of the afternoon&quot; to make a decision about the inevitable hospital trip. Time seems to be very important to Haruf, as if he constantly reworked time sequences, but there needs to be a tad more editing.Generally, a very good read."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Take a long walk down a country lane, particularly a lane out along the plains and the prairie. Hope that it is cold - a bit - but enough for you to enjoy the sound of the wind as it dances around you.Then consider the meaning of Simplicity. Think of how simple things are most profound; how the deepest wells lie unadorned along the rocky paths of insignificance; how still waters run deep.This novel - this plain song - brings together all these graceful images in a most subtle way. A man lonely for a life once lived; a woman trapped in the black night of eternal sadness; a young girl thrust into a heartless world thinking all the while about the joys it will bring her; and most beautifully, the rhyme and rhythm of a brother's love, of two old men or two young boys forever wrapped up in each other's destiny.Kent Haruf has created a world within these pages that will always be refreshing to anyone in need of a respite from the wrangling world, or a cold drink from the deepest of wells."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong by Kent Haruf is a very intriguing, fictional novel about small town life. The events in the novel seem almost factual because they are based on Haruf's personal experiences. Haruf's father was a minister who was occasionally relocated giving his family a broad view of different places and people. After reading an interview of Haruf, in which he explained his life experiences, I understand why he chose the topic he did for his novel. Lines like, &quot;he fit his hand inside her and pawed out the loose green warm manure...&quot; and &quot;When her clothes were off Maggie was soft and creamy, as rich as if she were painted,&quot; are so vivid that they undoubtedly came from Haruf's first hand experiences.The novel is filled with the largest variety of characters that could possibly be found in a small town. There is Victoria, who is pregnant when she is introduced, already bringing drama to the novel. Dwayne, the father of her baby, is neglecting and controlling of Victoria. Ike and Bobby are two young, adventurous and wholesome brothers that befriend an old and lonesome lady. Tom Guthrie is a local schoolteacher, and the loving and protecting father of Ike and Bobby. Maggie Jones is Tom's counterpart, who plays somewhat of a mother to Victoria and companion to Tom. Tom's wife is a troubled woman who &quot;...can't or refuses to get out of bed&quot;. And the McPheron brothers are two old, cattle ranchers who know nothing but cattle, but take Victoria in under their wing anyway. These are the major characters found in this novel.The connection between people in need and those that can help them is the central theme of the novel because every important character develops a bond with at least one other person who is in need of someone to care about them. Ike and Bobby, Maggie Jones, and the McPheron brothers are precisely the characters who embody this theme. There are several scenes in the novel that epitomize the theme. Ike and Bobby befriend Iva Sterns who had nobody because her relatives had either &quot;...moved away or they had died.&quot; She entrusted them with the her front door key so they could visit her when they wanted. Maggie took Victoria in &quot;...welcoming her into her house&quot; after her mother expelled her from her home. Maggie also became a companion to Tom, who was lonely and in need of affection after his wife abandoned him. Finally, the most important connection was the one made between the McPheron brothers and Victoria; the brothers took her in after Maggie's senile father assaulted her. It was most important because they each filled a void in the others' lives that, unlike other characters, had never been filled before. These are the characters and scenes that exemplify the theme."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I picked up this book at the airport before a long trip over Labor Day weekend... I chose it because of the fact that it had been a National Book award finalist (and typically books of any substance are hard to find at airport news stands). I soon realized that it well deserved the nomination (if not the award itself- I believe &quot;Waiting&quot; by Ha Jin won out, which I can't agree with).True, the book has no unsurprising plot turns, but still somehow keeps the reader totally engaged. The characters are so convincing (my favorites being the McPheron brothers)- Kent Haruf has a gift for making them such real and engrossing people. I am not generally the sappy-type, but I was near tears at a couple points in the book. I like the most that the story inspires- that like Victoria we can persevere through hardship, and that like Maggie and the McPheron's, we can find reward through helping others. This was definitely a good read."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I don't agree with some of the reviews that refer to this book as sappy. It has some very touching and tender moments but some very violent and nasty ones as well.This author does not seem to believe that people must be defined by what is awful about humanity. Although he sees and portrays the very violent nasty, and self-interested side of people, he believes in their goodness--and that is not the coming of age of an adolescent but rather the considered views of someone who has faith.Though you get the impression that the author sees and understands both sides of human nature, he chooses to let the beauty of reaching out to another be the flavor of his prose that stays with you after the story is over. It's quite an optimistic view of life, and will please those a with humanist orientation--I was enormously moved by it and will look forward to reading other works by Kent Haruf."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong describes the lives of some of the residents of Holt, Colorado; each of the different plots deals with issues of life, death, and the bonds that link a community together. Because of this simple style and interaction between characters, an extremely great story unfolds. Haruf makes this novel an interesting read, both comical and emotional, and I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"What a nice experience. Here is a book that has been so lauded by critics that by the time I got around to reading it, I was expecting to be at least somewhat disappointed, figuring there was no way it could live up to all the hype it has received. How nice to be wrong! Kent Haruf really hit the ball out of the park with this one. It is hard to argue with the ultimate moral of the novel, that in a too often unkind world, people can always find at least some semblance of happiness by being kind to one another and caring for others in their community. But the danger in writing a novel with a message like this is that it leaves open so many opportunities for oversentimentality and sappiness. Haruf miraculously was able to avoid both, while still remaining a highly optimistic, if also realistic (in realizing that bad people don't always change or go away) novel. The only small criticism I have of \\"Plainsong\\" is that some of the plot points, such as a high school teacher being pressured into passing a star athlete, were somewhat cliche (didn't I see an episode of \\"Eight is Enough\\" with that same plotline over 20 years ago?). This is a very small complaint though, as the strength of \\"Plainsong\\" is not the originality of particular plotlines, but in seeing the characters learn to be good to each other and create their own extended families. It has been a long time since I've read a novel that was so genuinely uplifting, without ever feeling the least bit cheesy or unrealistic."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"In his novel Plainsong, Kent Haruf manages to gently enter the lives of several people in a small Colorado town. Kent Haruf writes in a wonderful unembellished style that paints a picture in your heart. The story involves the falling apart ,salvaging and rebuilding of families. It defines what really does make a family a family. The story involves a high school teacher , his two young sons and the emotionally unavailable wife and mother. There are the Macpheron brothers (two older bachelor farmers) and an abandoned 17 year old pregnant high school student. The weaver of the fabric of this story is an unmarried teacher named Maggie. She shows true compassion and understanding and reweaves these &quot;families&quot;. The story moves gently and beautifully and pulls you right in. Plainsong is a true joy to read."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I agree with all the other one star reviews. I forced myself to finish as the cover indicated it got good reviews. But it is cloying and dull. Reading it is like trying to have a meaningful conversation with someone who keeps going off into pointless, boring tangents in an attempt to be interesting. The language tries to be colloquial but comes off as just too precious. The cover review actually compared this book to Chekov, which is like comparing Brittny Spears to Renee Fleming. Just not very good at all."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I was so out of breath reading \\"and then, and then, and then....\\" I couldn't read the rest of it. I stopped after: \\"He went out into the hall again past the closed door AND on into the bathroom AND shaved AND rinsed his face AND went back to the bedroom at the front of the house whose high windows overlooked Railroad Street AND brought out shirt AND pants from the closet AND laid them out on the bed AND took off his robe AND got dressed.\\" (page 4, 4th paragraph) FINALLY!!! A PERIOD! WHEW! It was nothing but one continuous sentence to me! My sister enjoyed this book and wanted me to read it. I really don't think I can! I can't seem to get over the long sentences."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The book tells a patch of lifetime of very different people. It turns out that their stories are connected to each other and the picture created is really a masterwork. The story is really plain and minimally told. This book teaches you about storytelling and about avoiding useless words. As it happens, the book does not have what I like most about books. It does not tell you about the characters. It only documents what they are doing. The author says nothing about their hopes, their dreams, not even their past. We do not learn a single thing about the people that fill this book, why they are what they are and what makes them decide what they decide. I would say it is a good book, as I would say Van Gogh did good paintig. But I wouldnt put a Van Gogh in my apartment because I simply dont LIKE them. So, before you decide to read this book find out, what you like about books. If it is the plot, you might like it. If it is the people, you might not like it. As I dont like it."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"After all the hype and reviews, I was disappointed.The author seemed to lose focus, and the book was a bit slow, though the underlying theme was good."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I found travel through this book to be difficult without the familiar sign posts of quotation marks! I'm not at all sure what this new &quot;format&quot; is supposed to accomplish, but this is the second book I've read that did not use quotation marks and I find it disconcerting. It was as if I kept passing beautiful landscapes or scenic rest areas and had to stop and go back to really enjoy the views. It seemed to me to be a waste of energy and a source of frustration just like driving in an unfamiliar town where the street signs are obliterated or missing. Still, once used to the terrain, I was able to appreciate the marvelous scenes unfolding in Holt. The people became real and their stories were that of middle American life. Their problems, concerns, and interactions were familiar, not fake or contrived. Heroes lost fights, good people made mistakes and normally thoughtful, caring people did thoughtless, careless things. The values of individuals and the community can be discerned as we watch Ike and Bobby grow up. We see the work ethic as they deliver papers before school and their father takes over for them when they are out of town. We learn of human values of compassion as the McPheron brothers take in Victoria Roubideaux and give her a safe environment in which to live. We are witness to living, loving, and dying and the manner in which these rites of passage are received by the new friends in Holt. Plainsong is the song of middle America. It is told in engaging detail, helping us feel at home in Holt. The characters are revealed to us over time, and eventually, we know just about the whole community. No wonder this was a New Yorker Book Award finalist. Well worth the read."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"As part of a book club, I read this book. The point of my joining the bookclub was to read books I might normally not have picked up on my own, as I am open to reading about new ideas and subjects everyday.

I see that the book has now been made into a movie and I told my friend such. All she could say is 'NOOOOO!' My favorite part of the book was 'blah blah blahblahblah, BLAH?' Oh, wait that wasn't part of it but the whole book sure READ like that."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This book was given to me as a gift and I knew as soon as I read on the back of the book that it was a NY Times notable book that it probably would not be a novel I'd enjoy reading. For a book to catch the NY Times' attention, it has to be filled with angst-ridden characters living miserable lives with little resolution of their problems and well-written depictions of how these dysfunctional people suffer.The book is about several characters whose plot lines come together in the end. You have Tom Guthrie with 2 young boys (9 and 10) whose wife is suffering from severe depression and leaves him. You also have a pregnant teen who gets kicked out by her mother when her pregnancy is discovered. Finally, there is the McPheron brothers who are 2 middle-aged ranchers who live together and never married. Of course, their parents died when they were young in a tragic accident.The reason I gave the book even 2 stars is because it is well-written and depicts small town life in rural Colorado well. The reason I gave the book 2 stars is because the characters' world created by Haruf is so bleak and joyless. Yes, he does have some key characters get to know each other and come to support each other in their depressing lives, but in finishing the book I found myself grateful that the world is not how Haruf portrays it. Further, the book has several gratuitous sex scenes as well as profanity throughout. Almost everybody in this book uses profanity at a drop of a hat even when around the two young Guthrie boys. Well, why not? Even the young boys use profanity. I have to add here my irritation at the lack of quotation marks for conversations in the book.The whole book was depressing and devoid of joy and just the kind of book that the NY Times would love."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I am not impressed with this author for the following reasons:1. Blatant disregard for proper punctuation - this makes the text difficult to follow and the story without emotion. The character's dialogue isn't in quotation marks. IE: Look out there is a car coming, said Mark. VS. \\"Look out! There is a car coming,\\" exclaimed Mark.2. Author was completely ineffective in developing characters and finishing storylines. Too many unanswered questions and things left unsaid.3. Author was completely ineffective at creating a timeless story. At first it seemed like the 50's, then he talked about stick pregnancy tests and VCR's so that brought it to 80's then the tone seemed 50's again.4.

Plainsong overall was a good book; it's not a very hard book so it was a quick read. Kent Haruf portrayed different characters in very different situations in the small town of Holt, Colorado. Even though these people went through very different things they were all binded together by the simple fact that life is not all roses. Not necessarily going through anything the characters have, I could relate to some of the feelings and thoughts of the characters. In the book, Plainsong, it is divided to where the chapters each portray one or two of the (about) eight characters. At first it was kind of confusing to follow but as you get deeper into the book, it all comes together. All the characters come together at the end of the book and all can relate somehow. I would definitely reccomend the book because it's a simple book of extrodinary things that happens in a few people's lives in the small town of Holt, Colorado."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I've often been asked why I read. It's a high-tech world, there are other options with Internet accessibility, and films and television should feed my need to be informed and entertained, right?Kent Haruf's well-chosen, intense prose is what I need to feed my spirit and my need to read. I was given this book by a friend who knows I like quirky characters. Strange, but the characters contained within aren't odd, but familiar, comforting and real. Most real to me are the two bachelor brothers - true people, them. I've met them, watched my father work side by side with them, and cooked and served to them. I think every small community has a pair of these brothers - kind, strong, loving, but closeted.This is a truly a beautiful addition to my collection of minimalist fiction. The beauty of the description, after all, is the lack of it."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I read all the time. This particular book was not recommended to me.

Be very good to yourself and buy this book."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This book was a pleasant surprise to me. It is filled with a lot of depressing, if not tragic sub-plots, but it shows the overwhelming benefits in the strength of community. The novel reminds me of a short story. Nothing is final in the novel, yet the reader get just enough information, a snapshot if you will, of these characters' lives. Wherever there is good, there is bad. Wherever there is bad, there is a lesson to be learned. The most beautiful things in life may lie in the most unlikely of places. I recommend this novel to anyone who wants a little pick me up."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"There was this man named Haruf and he wrote in a terse style that reminded you of Hemingway or of Carver but then again not like Hemingway and Carver but with a long run-on style to reiterate the fact that this was a plain novel with a plain theme and plain people living out on the plain. And there were little epiphanies where people reckon this and that and that like a dead horse havin' its belly cut up and the profound feeling the kids have watching this dead horse with its belly cut up and some of the other scenes were touching and made you smile but never mind that you could skip whole pages of dialogue because quite frankly you know nothing happened but a this sparse, dry style with sentences that reminded you of Hemingway or Carver but then again not really Hemingway or Carver and oh well this was an OK book but if you're sick of this style then skip this book."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This is a wonderful book. I wanted to read it all in one sitting and yet I wanted to read it slowly and savor it. What a dilemma! It's so nice to know that there are still some really good writers out there. I plan to read more of Mr. Haruf's books so tell him to keep writing!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Kent Haruf does a good job writing about many people and their life in the town of Holt. He interweaves many different people and their lifestyles together. At first the book was slow but then it started to pick up and i found myself wanting to keep reading wondering what was going to happen to this character next. I would recomend this book to some people but not to all. If you like a book that skips around and keeps you thinking then you will like this book."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"What I loved about this book was also what I found least believable. The characters are all, in their own ways, so graceful, so earnest. There is one exception to this rule, but even then, the feud that results is not really enough to cause the type of tension one might expect in a literary work. For this reason, the characters are somewhat unbelievable. The real mastery of Plainsong is that Haruf makes them believable. Though readers may see Haruf's emotional landscape as a nostalgia, I don't think any society has ever lived in this type of bliss. In this book, poverty is not crippling. Teachers fail undeserving students--and they don't have to teach to standardized tests. Believable? Well, in Haruf's hands, it is, which is what makes him such a fine writer. I would like to see Haruf extend his talents to more challenging terrain. What if the book's pages were inhabited by a more culturally and ideologically diverse group? But that would be another book altogether. This book is excellent as it is."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I was given this book and I didnt really sit down to read it until I was faced with absolute boredom. Since I am an avid reader, I finished the book in a few days. I liked the fact that the setting was in a small town where everyone knows everyone because that is a setting I am familiar with. The charectars were true to life. Maggie was the compassionate school teacher. Tom Guthrie is the loving father who suffers through his wife's &quot;illness&quot; and then through her leaving him. Ike and Bobby are good kids who have nothing better to do than roam around the neighborhood. Victoria is a pregnant high schooler who has nowhere to go. The McPheron brothers are two old men who know almost nothing about life beyond cattle. These are the kind of people we relate to, and the kind of people we love. I liked the novel for the people, and for the unusual dialogue. The stories intrigued. I wanted to see what would happen to Victoria. I wanted to find out why Mrs. Guthrie wouldn't get out of bed. I have to give Kent Haruf my credits for creating charectars that you can love, and giving them the hardships of ordinary people."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong was a beautifully written book, and I could never put it down. Kent Haruf took into consideration the different aspects of what is means to be an American, even when the times got rough a friend was nearby to give them a helping hand. This book was a cycle of charcaters all relating to one another somehow throughout the story. The book takes place in a small town named Holt, and the characters range in age, from elementry school, to high school to adults. This is a book for eveyone, and I suggest for parents to read this book with young adults. This book will change your views on some of the issues there are today, and it will also let you see the problems in society from a different perspective."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This story hooked me from the very beginning and I read it in one day. I was driven to know more about these charactors and how their lives would turn out. Unfortunately, I was never given these answers. This story is more or less a brief glimpse into the lives of a group of people living in a small western town in Colordo and how their lives eventually interconnect. Very little is given on their backgrounds, who they are, why they behave as they do, etc. The only charactors that we are allowed some of their history are the McPheron Brothers. I wanted to know more about Tom Guthrie's life and why his boys were so solemn, why his wife couldn't get out of bed and what drove her to her actions, who was Maggie Jones, what about Victoria's mother, etc. I'm fine with a story leaving us to draw our own conclusions with some issues but not the entire work. The prose was beutiful and the charactors were interesting to a point but not enough was given to ever allow me to care about them. The expletive \\"GD\\" is extremely offensive to me and it was used way too much. Even once is too much for me. And what is it with authors not using quotation marks? Please give me quotations marks or I can't keep up with who is talking!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong, was truly one of the better books I have read.When I first bought the book I tried to read it but found the start long and drawn out.

Plainsong has so much emotion and feeling it actually made me cry. The way that everything is described in this book is unsurpassed by most authors. I think most people are able to identify with at least one of the characters.If you are looking for a good book to read on those cold winter days curled up in a blanket, or in bed, then this book is for you, but if you're looking for a book to read on the train, subway or bus, you will probably have some trouble focusing your attention on this book.~Happy reading!~"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong, was truly one of the better books I have read.When I first bought the book I tried to read it but found the start long and drawn out.

Personally, I often find myself dissatisfied with many modern novel's endings. This one was complete and gratifying. After sharing his characters with us successfully throughout the story, Haruf doesn't let readers down in the last few pages."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong, by Kent Haruf, was a story about a community of non-traditional families, mended together through their own individual troubles. It is hard to follow at first because it skips around from character to character, and what is going on in their lives. As the book goes on the different scenes for each character seem to flow together better and become easier to read because the reader gets used to Haruf's style. It starts out as a tragic story for several different characters. By the end they all become friends. Though they are not a real family tied together by blood, they still form a traditional family. Tom Guthrie is a high school teacher who is having trouble in his relationship with his wife, Ella. She is becoming more and more depressed each day. After struggling with her depression for a while she moves out. Their two sons, Ike and Bobby, are just alike, even though they are a year apart. They have to deal with their mother's sickness, and the feeling of being abandoned when she leaves. Victoria Roubideaux is a 17-year-old high school senior that is pregnant. Her mom kicks her out of her house because she thinks Victoria's pregnancy is unacceptable. She has to deal with abandonment and the fact that she is going to have a baby that she will have to raise on her own. Maggie Jones, the central character in the story, is the one that Victoria turns to for help. Maggie is the strongest and most flawless character in the book. She asks a couple of elderly ranchers, the McPheron brothers to take her in. They don't know anything except for ranching. Their parent's died when they were only in their teens. Since that point they raised themselves on their ranch. Even though they have no idea what it will be like, they graciously take Victoria in. Overall, I thought this was a good book and I would recommend it for a pleasurable read."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"What a joy to read! This book quickly makes the reader feel a part of the characters' lives. It quickly introduces us into the lives of a variety of seemingly unrelated people from a small town - a school teacher, a pair of lonely bachelor farmers, a scared, pregnant teen. Even though I've always lived in large cities, I immediately felt that I understood this town, these people. I couldn't wait to keep reading to find out what happens. And, in the end, the stories of all these lives come together in a warm, heart-filling way.This book is beautiful. Read it."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The front cover of this book set the stage for me. Big sky, small town. Inside this town there is Tom Guthrie, a school teacher and facing separation from his wife, and his sons, Ike and Bobby, carefully trying not to tread on anyones' toes. There are the Old McPheron brothers who have lived together so long they have no need for words, until a young pregnant school girl has nowhere to go and no one to turn to.The dialogue is simple, often charming and even heart breaking as all these characters shuffle along and try to find their way in life. Not much of a plot, but this story doesn't suffer from the lack of it."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I was unable to finish this novel, after giving it one hundred fifty pages worth of a chance. There are too many unread books on my life's list to continue wasting my time with this one. I rarely give up on a book. Starting one is a comittment I take seriously. But there is just nothing in Haruf's &quot;Plainsong&quot; to hold onto. The spare, simple writing that is praised on the book's jacket is almost childish at times. The lack of quotation marks and long, rushed sentences are truly bothersome. But to me, a book's foundation is character. The characters here are like sketches of people, stick-figure drawings, none of which brought out any feelings whatsoever in me. I can't believe this book was a finalist for the Book Award and a bestseller. I take starting a new book very seriously, and I wanted to do my part in helping other people who might be considering this one. Buy a classic instead."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This is the last book I read for the year 2000 and I was delighted that it was a memorable one. Plainsong is the story of a community and the sublte, yet intricate ways in which people are connected to one another. It was an optimistic book--without being sentimental. Showing that human nature has the ability to forgive, give, and learn. Each of the characters has voice and teaches something about humilty and grace. Perhaps you'll discover a song of your own in one of them."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"In the tradition of Faulkner, this book follows various characters living quiet, interwoven dramas in the small town of Holt, Colorado. While the storylines are only moderately interesting and do not reach a grand climax like in traditional storytelling, the characters themselves are compelling and feel real. A recommended read."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Kent Haruf's books Plainsong and Evensong are compelling, beautifully written book whose characters are vividly and concisely developed. It is a book about small town life and the very real people who live in those towns (at least a few of them). I hope he keeps on writing."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Kent Haruf's Plainsong reads like a collection of intertwined short stories more than a novel. I suppose the title emphasises simplicity, both in the writing and in the protagonists' destinies, as well as that plainsong is the music of several overlapping voices. Still, the technique is hardly revolutionary. And the problem with Haruf's novel is that only one of the stories really appeals, that of the pregnant teenager who finds refuge among the unlikely, old farmer brothers. That one is touching and even has good moments of conflict and suspense. But while the rest is readable, it tastes too much of the worn-out, divorce-among-academics-and-the-impact-on-the-kids theme.The book is set in rural Colorado, and if verisimilar descriptions of heifers giving birth or horses being autopsied are your thing, it may appeal to you more than it did to me. Even that, though, can get maudlin at times, in spite of the austere title. And the author constantly makes use of the article \\"the\\" instead of the indefinite to refer to as yet undefined things or people. This is all right once in a while, but Haruf over-uses the trick; it forces the reader's attention artificially and gets annoying, the written equivalent of people who finish all their sentences with an interrogative up tone. Right?"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainson appears to be a narrative of a visit to a small town in Colorado. The author brings the reader into the ongoing lives of people. Characters and personalities are introduced. Everyone has their problems (maybe more than in some places)and they go about their lives. The reader leaves as unobtrusively as arriving. There is no resolution to the text (just as often happens in real life) except that maybe the presence of new life in the form of a baby binds people together in hope. There is the feeling that the story goes on. I thought the book started slowly and then found myself hooked. The author weaves the reader into the events so you can't wait to see what happens next. There is no climax in the plot - just good people and not so good people going about life in their own way. It remineded me of the play \\"Our Town\\". By the way, I did not read this book but listened to it on tape. The performance was superb. I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"wILL SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY THE BOYS PUT THEIR MOTHER'S BRACELET AND THE COINS ON THE RAILROAD TRACKS? tHIS IS A WONDERFUL NOVEL...JUST A QUESTION ABOUT THAT EPISODE.

I feel like I can get up from reading this, turn on the tv and watch a Lifetime or Hallmark channel movie without even knowing the difference.

Where is the nuance?A different writer who also writes in plain prose deservedly won the National Book Award the year this was nominated - Ha Jin for Waiting. Years later, I am still thinking about that book. This one will keep my attention while I read it, but it will be gone tomorrow.Why do contemporary readers have such a taste for sentimentality?"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"You don't have to go past the cover to realize the overall mood of this book. The title is called \\"Plainsong\\" and it is just that PLAIN. This book is OK if you are looking for a quick read requiring little pondering."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I found it a bit irritating that the author always referred to Victoria Roubideaux as \\"she\\" except for naming her in chapter titles, but perhaps his purpose was to emphasize how a number of other people saw Victoria and how they treated her.The fact that I was unable to tell when the story took place also frustrated me. At times I thought it must have taken place in the 50's, but I don't think most teachers hung out in bars in the 50's.Surely today a teacher would not place a teenage girl in a home with two old bachelor farmers. And surely today a teacher would not knock down a student and still be allowed to keep his job.The willingness of some characters in the book to go out of their way to help others made them quite likeable. And how nice to read of the love and closeness brothers had for each other!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Kent Haruf's \\"Plainsong\\" is a simple and satisfying story set in a small town in the high plains east of Denver. The book follows the lives of six main characters through a long dark winter and into the spring. Each of these individuals -- two pairs of brothers, a high-school girl, and a middle-aged man -- has his own cross to bear and does so with quiet determination.Although the author's style may strike the reader as melancholy, or even a little sappy, you'll probably find the book uplifting. Plenty of bad things happen to our protagonists, from the mundane to the serious, but each pulls through to reveal a generous and caring personality.\\"Plainsong\\" is a thoughtful little book written in a sparse and lucid voice. The chapters are a bit choppy and disconnected at first. But once the interrelationships are established, the story moves along much more smoothly. You may be frustrated at first, but stick with it -- \\"Plainsong\\" is worth reading to the end. My only quibbles are with punctuation (perhaps there's a good reason for not using quotation marks), a couple of loose ends at the end of the book, and some icky scenes involving farm animals. But that's nit-picky feedback for an otherwise wonderful book."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This is a terrific little novel, one of those books that you hate to come to the end of. Set in eastern Colorado, as usual with Haruf, it's about a pregnant teenager abandoned by her family and two bachellor farmers (brothers) who take her in. Everyone should get a real kick out of those two farmers: Haruf portrays them poignantly and with a tremendous amount of humor. One of my favorite novels of the last 10 years."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This book is nothing short of lovely.

There was so much that I could relate to in this book and I hated to see it end."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This book was an interesting read.

Deals with the simplicity of small towns. Some pointless cruelty, but lots of simple decency. Loved the McPheron brothers. Well worth it."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This book felt like a slow, tentative dance. It's a small town where everyone knows one another, and yet each character is isolated in his or her own way. Watching them clumsily, reluctantly reach out to one another and form a family was incredibly comforting."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"and read this book. It's close to perfect, and I was sad to see it end. Yes, it was a nice, simple, feel good story...the kind that's nice to read now and then."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"A month or so ago, I stumbled on a TV movie while putting in my treadmill time. I knew I'd read the book but couldn't bring the name to mind and the \\"guide\\" insisted I was watching The Golden Girls. It took an IMDB visit but the name came back and the desire to revisit the book came with it.This was my second read of Plainsong. Set in a small town in Colorado, the novel introduces the reader to a number of residents who feel both very ordinary and also a bit extraordinary. There's a pregnant teen cast out by her mother, a pair of boys whose mother leaves them emotionally and then physically, a set of old farmer brothers who never married, and a teacher trying to do right in a complicated world. The chapters shift focus but the stories all overlap with some frequency, much as one might expect in a rural town. These are people trying to get by and do right. They are never fancy, nor is the language flowery, but there's a beauty in the simplicity that reigns even in the face of some complex challenges. I love character-centered books and this certainly qualifies, though it also has a strong sense of place. Things DO happen, but it is more about how the events shape the people (and how the people, in turn, shape each other).Strong four stars. I didn't see the whole TV movie but it seemed worthwhile too...a good warm cup of hot cocoa and a blanket kind of movie (by the Lifetime folks)."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I didn't hate this book but I definitely didn't find it to be the kind of book that had me up half the night because I just couldn't put it down. The first thing I noticed and disliked about this book was the lack of quotation marks in dialogue. There are absolutely no quotation marks! I eventually got used to it. The second thing I noticed was the very long sentences. That's just the writer's style I guess.I found this book to be a gentle weaving story but I didn't find it to have an exciting climax. It was just....well....for lack of a better word...plain. It's a fairly short, easy read. I like the chapters broken out by character. I just wasn't riveted by the story."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Kent Haruf is yet another great writer that hails from the high plains of the Western United States. His books reflect the atmosphere that he grew up in and are amazingly lifelike in their portrayal of the culture of the Midwest. Plainsong is just such a book. It combines the relaxed and casual culture of a small Eastern Colorado town with the harshness of everyday life in a way that the verisimilitude is unmistakable.Refusing to fall prey to the traps that many modern novelists fall into, Haruf sidesteps the sentimental and the overly-harsh realism that many writers try to simulate and heads straight into an impactful and compelling story about the individual and collective struggles of a group of people.Moreover, Plainsong exudes compassion and goodness in a bunch of very bad situations. The genius of this book is not the roughness of the characters, though that is part of the beauty, but it is the heroism of everyday people. This book isn't about idyllic notions of what it means to be a hero, but rather the positive impact that everyday people can have on each other.As a warning to more sensitive readers (like myself), Plainsong is often graphic and harshly real. Several scenes contain sexual content that is bluntly real, but not pornographic. I would feel irresponsible if I didn't make note of this so that potential readers can decide for themselves if this is something that they want to subject themselves to. All that said, I realize that most modern novel fans have already confronted the fact that most modern novels contain some graphic sexual content.Overall, Plainsong is one of the most enjoyable books that I have read recently. Potential readers may be discouraged by the slow start of the novel, but let me assure you it picks up soon enough and you are left with a very compelling story that you won't want to put down."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This novel was just superb. Plainsong has characters that catch the reader's attention early in the book and the reader grows to love them with all their quirks. Kent Haruf gives us enough insight to each of the character's stories to arouse curiosity over what he or she is going to do next. The novel is not simply based on one character but a handful. Haruf brings an amazing story to light, and his characters are simply beautiful. They are all well rounded, and completely believable. This story is a true test of how one person can grow up without a close family, and in the end find the family they always needed through other people. The ending of this book brings all the characters together, and the reader will be able to see how their stories are linked. An important lesson can be learned from this novel, that we need to understand that sometimes what we lack in life can be filled through people we least expected. Every day is a building block to something better and the ties that we allow will to bind us together.I will being reading more of Haruf's work as I am happy to have read a novel that I enjoyed this extensively."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The simplicity of Plainsong is so beautiful. Haruf has created such characters, like Harold and Raymond McPheron, which this reader would want to have in her own life. The characters are also believable-each has made mistakes, learned from them, been loved, been hurt, mistreated but has survived. These characters' lives aren't anything spectacular; they are the everyday heroes and people I would much rather read about.The main characters: two sets of brothers, one set young, the other old, two teachers, and a pregnant high school girl, are faced with their separate trials, yet bond together, as something like a dysfunctional family.Too many books published currently are filled with characters who are god-like in their perfection, intellect and physique. Their trials are superficial and often unbelievable. The writing is face-paced in an obnoxious way-and for this reader at least, depressing because I am sure my life will never be that exciting.I find Maggie, Raymond, Harold, Victoria, Ike, Bobby, and Tom to be people I can relate to and their struggles to be real and honest. I appreciated the ending of the novel as something like a beginning: the main characters about to eat supper together, assured that they are all there for one another. I haven't read Eventide yet, but I look forward to seeing where Kent Haruf takes these characters."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong and its somewhat sequel Eventide are each excellent and perfect in their own right and even better together. The simple eloquence of each deserves a simple review. In keeping with that, I will say these books are like letters from home. Imagine you've moved from the small town to big city-ville, or another country, and you want the latest news from the folks back home. How are Raymond and Harold doing? How about Victoria and Katie? Or anyone else you may think about. Kent Haruf, as if he's the reporter/editor of the Holt Daily, keeps you up on what everyone is doing, and how they're doing. These books are simple tales of everyday life, and it is this simplicity that is their strength. I highly recommend these books to anyone who appreciates language used simply and excellently."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"One of the great things (among many) about Haruf's novel is how he creates story lines that he doesn't necessarily resolve. And while the story here is so compelling, it's exceeded by Haruf's style, which is simple and pure. I had trouble putting this down and was sorry to see it end. Thank goodness I have Eventide to look forward to."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"What I appreciated about this novel is its quiet, graceful movement, its development of various story lines that piece together in the end. Haruf is a skilled narrator, and I kept turning page after page, wanting to know what would happen next.Unfortunately, many of the stories felt incomplete. I certainly appreciate an author who doesn't spoon-feed information; the trick is to show not tell. But this novel did neither.I didn't understand the character's motivations; many questions remained unanswered: Why, exactly, did Victoria want to keep the baby? She insists that she does, but why? Why does she go with Dwayne, when he left her so suddenly? Why does she not call the McPheron brothers to tell them where she is? I understand that she's only 17, but she always seemed relatively responsible before. And what about Bobby and Ike? They were such mature kids, improbably for boys who are 10 and 9. Why was their mother so depressed? I could go on.The point is the book didn't delve into these characters. Haruf doesn't use quotation marks, which made the dialogue feel a bit surreal. Sometimes I wasn't sure if I was reading what the characters were speaking or thinking. I felt like I was wading through mud, waiting for something, anything, that never came."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I thought that this book was a great book for many reasons. Most importantly, the book draws the reader in very closely and does not let go until the end. This is accomplished mostly by vivid characterization. The book does an excellent job at \\"showing\\" the characters instead of \\"telling.\\" This helps the reader develop connection with the characters on multiple levels. And because the characters of the story are always going through some type of hard time readers feel sympathy for them. This is how they draw the reader into the novel.Also, another main reason this book is great is because it teaches the readers an important lesson. It teaches the reader that there are two main types of relationships-good and bad. The former should be kept, while the latter should be discarded. It shows this through numerous relationships that develop throughout the novel.Therefore, I think Plainsong is a great book for many reasons, but mostly because of its closeness with its readers and moral lessons."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"As soon as I started reading this book I realized that the author has an immense ability for getting the reader involved in the story through his passionate descriptions of people and places, interesting dialogues and three-dimensional characters. The fact that the novel revolves around everyday events, and pays homage to its name in the sense that there are no big surprises or twisted plots, contributes to make this one of the best written books I have read in a long time.Tom Guthrie is a school teacher in Holt Colorado whose wife is secluded in bed at the time in which the story starts and who is abandoned by her shortly afterwards. He is left to live with his two kids, Ike and Bobby, and to try to find new interests in life. The two kids deliver newspapers in the morning before school and have to deal with a myriad of colorful characters, from the grumpy and mean Ralph to a lonely old woman looking for someone that cares.Victoria Roubideaux is an adolescent who is pregnant and is still in school. When her mother finds out about this, instead of offering support she kicks the girl out of her house. That is why Victoria ends up living with the McPheron brothers, two old men who own a ranch and take care of it themselves. The relationship that begins between the rough old men and the lost girl is narrated with great ability, and conveys a beautiful message.The author describes events like a cow giving birth with such a level of detail and accuracy that it reminded me when I saw this happen for the first time when living in Uruguay. People falling in love, having to deal with sick relatives, being pressured at work and facing death are the kinds of events that populate this novel. The final result is absolutely delightful, and I do not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone that enjoys good literature."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Really this book has four stories in it - some more interesting than the others. Definitely the most interesting story - and the one which keeps you reading - has to be about Victoria Roubidoux, a pregnant teenager who is taken in by two older, uneducated farmers who are also brothers who never married. This, in and of itself, was a leap of faith for me. I found it difficult to believe that two men in their 50s would take in a pregnant teenager who is not a relative and someone whom they'd never met before - especially in a small rural town. In fact, wouldn't a young girl be afraid of living with two single older men?While Haruf's writing in this book is very good, unfortunately it's the only good part of the book. I was prepared for a brilliant ending which would bring the four stories together, but the ending fell severely short of brilliant. A different ending would've made this an incredible book. Instead, I finished the book and thought to myself, &quot;So?&quot;"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"A book I have to say, I could not put down. Starts off a little slow but as the story unfolds grabs you. You feel like you are living in Holt, Colorado and surrounded by the people in the book. I fell in love with the McPherons, Victoria and Guthrie. I absolutely loved this book, I can't wait to read what happens next."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong is a slow, marching story based in a small Colorado town. The story centers around a diverse array of characters. There is Guthrie, a school teacher whose wife is basically a ghost that wants to leave them. There is Ike and Bobby, Guthrie's two boys, who are trying to make sense of their parents' deteriorating relationship. Then there is Victoria, a teenage girl who is pregnant. After her mother kicks her out of the house, she goes to live with two elderly brothers, the McPherons, who live on a farm on the outskirts of town.This novel is character driven, but the characters don't exactly come to life. They are realistic, moved by their own egos, wants, desires, and needs. There are pointless story lines that do not move the plot. The characters often do foolish and boring things that aren't the norm in novels. But that is exactly what makes this story great. It is a realistic look at life in small towns, and Haruf paints a story that is more a documentary than a novel. Don't look for tense, gripping action in this book. Instead, you'll be treated to characters that are actually human.Plainsong is a subtly good read. The first one hundred pages are dreary and drag along, but somewhere along the way you are sucked into the lives of these small town Coloradoans and can't put the book down. A good read, but my advice is that if you try it, commit yourself to read the entire novel. The only bad point is that Haruf, for some odd reason, chose not to use quotations for the dialogue. I think the idea was to create a monotonous, hazy read(in which he succeeds), but overall, it gets confusing. But overall, great book."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong is an interesting story, but it is more or less just a story about regular people living through tough situations. It deals with pregnancies, sex and violence, and how everyone experiences hardships over the course of life. It it just that, a Plainsong. Delving into the everyday acts of the various characters. None of them are crazy, or extraordinary in any way, but they are just like you and me. That was the best part of the story was in the way that it was real. This was not a fairy tale or fabricated tale, they were stories about men and women much like all of us. So it was quite easy to relate to them in many situations as they face the many troubles that the world has to offer. Great book to read once, but I probably won't remember a whole lot of it down the road."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Kent Haruf paints the life of a small Colorado town through a series of short chapters that read like short stories. The lives of many members of the community are intertwined in thoughtful, creative ways, and the reader feels like a spy on the goings-on of a small town. The characters and stories are interesting, with stories that will keep a reader's attention. The prose style is beautiful and easy to read, and the chapter order well-designed, implying connections between the characters on a thematic level as well as their interactions. I found myself slowing down to enjoy the scenery as I took in the small town of Holt."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"In Plainsong, Haruf describes a couple of plots. The first plot describes a girl impregnated in high school who comes to live with a couple of gruff farmer's brothers. Unprepared and unused to having women in their lives, the brothers struggle to adapt and integrate the girl into their lives. The other plot describes a family where a father and his two children are learning to live without the mother. Haruf develops marvelous themes of brotherly love, as brothers' fight together for justice in each new difficult circumstance. This simple town warms the heart as seemingly impossible situations turn beautiful, and hardships and obstacles are overcome with diligence and perseverance. A beautiful novel."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This is one of those books that I finished questioning rather or not I liked it. There are many horrific events in this novel that I didn't enjoy reading, yet it is written in such a way that you are compelled to read more. And in continuing the story you are rewarded with some lovely acts of humanity.For me, the overall theme of this book was finding one's self. There are two children and a teen that, through events mostly out of their control, are forced to grow up quickly, and in doing so find their true selves. Also the majority of adults in this story are put into scenarios where they must redefined who they truly are. The main characters in this book are rather likable. I especially loved the quirky old farm brothers. The villains, however, have no redeemable traits.The authors simple writing style is quite inviting and he is able to almost seamlessly merge several different story lines. However his lack of quotation marks around the dialog drove me crazy and I didn't understand the meaning behind it. I also feel the story ended rather abruptly, leaving me unsatisfied. There is a followup book, \\"Eventide\\", that I will probably be checking out, though I can't say I am in a terrible rush to do so."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Haruf tells the story of several people in the small town of Holt, CO. Although the story is somewhat simplistic, he tells it well and makes you feel for the characters as the story draws near its end.This book won't blow you away with anything new, but it's a touching story that's well worth the read."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This book is an engrossing story. Seven seemingly unrelated people form a bond of friendship and love in a small town in Colorado. The author's narrative style makes one feel they truly know the characters. The author does not use quotation marks around the dialogue. At first I found a little disconcerning but soon i found that the story followed better. There is so much in the book for book clubs to discuss."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"What a quiet surprise and delight this book became. It was a book club choice and one I started reluctantly. I dislike the lack of quotes in dialogue and rolled my eyes to begin. I'm so glad I stuck with it; and soon fell into the rhythm of life in a small town in Colorado. As other reviewers have noted, the characters really start to develop in second half of this book. I ended up just loving the characters, story, country and plot. By the end, I was truly sad to see them go. I also thought this novel showed a sensitive kindness between human beings that I have not seen in a while. This really is a beautiful book that makes you feel yourself wanting to do a random act of kindness."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Every single one of the people in my book club loved this book, and we are a varied group. We all breezed right through it and looked for a sequel."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Sometimes simplicity is beauty. Plainsong is one of those times. Haruf has a talent for conveying the emotions of his characters through physical description and dialog alone. His style is reminiscent to Hemingway -- short simple sentences and plenty of detailed descriptions of nature.There's a nice intermingling of 2 1/2 storylines, but I found the section about Victoria and her cohabitation with two hermit brothers the most compelling piece.I did have a couple of minor quibbles. First, the lack of quotation marks around the dialog. I'm not sure what the point of that was. Second, the evil of a few characters seemed a bit sensationalized. Haruf was relatively even-handed with the flaws of his heros, but he seemed to neglect any redeeming characteristics in the villians.Overall this is still a strong effort and among the best modern novels I've read in the last couple of years."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"As I was reading this book, I found myself waiting for 'something big' to happen. When I was finished, I realized that what had happened was not anything 'big' but rather an array of smaller life events of enduring significance. The rendering of the eastern Colorado setting was wonderful. While I found one or two of the storylines to be a little shallow, the way the author weaved them together was excellent. It's worth a read."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong is a brilliant story about normal people dealing with normal people's problems. Haruf's prose creates a comfortable feeling allowing the reader to imagine being a friend to the character they most relate to. No matter who you are you can relate to any one of the characters. Guthrie's ordeal with facing single parenthood and a bout with loneliness, Victoria finding herself pregnant, out of wedlock, with seemingly no one to turn to and who could forget the sweet McPheron brothers. They are old, crusty, hard working ranchers who find it hard to relate to anything outside of the family business, let alone a 17 year old girl.Haruf wonderfully arranges this story around the one character we knew the least about: Maggie Jones. The two main things we know about her is that she is loving because she takes care of her senile father and that she has a fiery side through her declaration that she would not compete with Judy, the school secretary, for Guthrie. Maggie Jones is the tie that binds and brings every one together on Memorial Day at the McPheron ranch.The reader isn't left with a sweet, feel good story but one where we applaud the characters for their change, maturity, acceptance of responsibility. We watch them face and handle their problems. We are allowed to imagine a future for the characters. Ike and Bobby have accepted their mother's decision, Victoria is now a mother and more than likely will seek to achieve bigger and better things for her and her daughter. Maggie and Guthrie just might get married and the McPheron brothers now have a family to fill the void they had from the loss of their parents. Life is good."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"PLAINSONGWe all desire to be accepted. At the same time we struggle with believing it. It is as if we question whether we deserve it or not. The one who feels as if they don't deserve it though is the one who really does. Kent Haruf, the author of Plainsong, describes this feeling so well. \\"I wanted someone who wanted me for what I am . . . someone who wanted me, for myself\\"(116). Amidst all our baggage we desire for someone to accept us despite our past.There is a moment in the novel where Guthrie finds himself in that place where all his baggage makes him feel unworthy. He says to himself \\"you don't deserve it\\" and \\"don't ever think that you do\\"(235). For the mere fact that he feels that way means that he deserves it through and through. It seems unreal and for Victoria it took her awhile to feel accepted by the McPheron brothers.This novel is about unison. A coming together of broken and battered souls that long to be accepted. Each character relates to old china dishes. The \\"old dishes that had been unused for decades, that were chipped and faded but still serviceable\\"(299). Each character has been broken and has been unaccepted for all these years. From Victoria and her boyfriend to the McPheron brothers to Guthrie. They all have been mistreated in some way and so they all come together and accept the past but look on ahead to the future. This novel is about taking in and caring for each other despite the baggage in our lives. It doesn't matter where we have been it only matters where we are headed."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Kent Haruf's \\"Plainsong\\" is a down to earth, intertwining of lives in small town Colorado. The tone, language, style and content all reflect the simple complexity of relationships and loneliness. We get a glimpse into a world where just being together through the hard times is a more effective coping tool than running. We get to see two little boys start to come of age, a teenage girl whose life seems over give birth surrounded by love and joy, and two old men who find the courage to love. Contrasted with typical modern reality the small town of Holt is a comforting place where each life actually impacts the others. There is no anonymity; each life matters. And as we get to know the characters, their lives matter to us as well. I would definitely recommend this book if you're craving a journey into a simpler place where good and bad are plain as day and life is determined by people rather than day planners."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Several respected reader friends told me that this was one of their all time favorite books. Another respected reader friend warned that it was very slow going. My experience was closer to the warning friend. The characters are truly memorable, but I would have like those memorable characters to be a bit more active. You really had to love the batchelor brothers, but the other characters were sort of underdeveloped I thought. Also, I hate it when a book just ends without resolution. This one does that.But, the above said , I plan to read more of Haruf's work."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I really enjoyed this book, and I do not even enjoy reading. I did not like the fact that it took a while to get to the interesting stuff. This book goes through rough times as well as real life situations, and almost anyone can relate to. Victoria is a year yonger than me and I would not want to be in her &quot;shoes&quot;. Even though she struggles she still has the love from the people that do care about her. In the future I will try and read another one of Kent Haruf's books."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"As flat, plain and lovely as can be. Yes, the characters are as flat as their high plains, but there are mountains of trouble lurking for each, troubles that aren't entirely resolved by novel's end. And, besides, what's wrong with some loveable bachelor farmers who really don't turn out to be perverts? And what's wrong with a pregnant teen who ends up being a mostly quiet seventeen year old who tidies up the farmers' home. Never really got to hear her voice, but when you call a book \\"Plainsong,\\" why should I expect her to discover the strengths of her implied native ancestry or to transcend the smallmindedness of small town life? I'm glad that nonesuch BS occured. The book sets out to be a plainsong about plain, decent people and it succeeds. I didn't find myself wondering whether the farmers were dull cardboard stereotypes of rural life and why in the hell Bobby and Ike went out to the old men's house. Maybe I enjoyed it particularly because we're all in a mood to like simple heroism and decency after September 11. Maybe I enjoyed it because the author so clearly achieved what he set out to do: write a spare, unadorned tale about plain, decent people. Whatever the reason, I loved the book and would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I just finished Plainsong and found many things to admire, most of all the writing itself, which was generally graceful and unadorned. The best parts of the book were the sections focusing on daily life on the prairie -- a glimpse of a world that seemed very genuine.And yet, some of the central relationships in the book didn't ring true. In particular, there is a plotline about a pregnant teenager who goes to live with two elderly bachelor brothers. Haruf isn't so successful with this: I had the feeling that he hasn't spent as much time around pregnant teenagers as he has around cattle. Also, this set of brothers (and another pair in the book) are not developed as well as they should be. It's almost impossible to tell one brother from the other.Nonetheless, I read Plainsong today on a rainy afternoon and was very glad of its company."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This was the first full length novel I listened to in audio format, and while I enjoyed listening to Plainsong better than the morning weather and traffic reports, I must say I expected a little more.The story seems heartwarming enough, including the story of how the lives of a couple of old bachelor brothers were warmed up by young, pregnant Victoria, who comes to live with them at their cattle farm when she quite literally has nowhere else to go. I just thought there were so many gaps in the plot, I kept wondering if my copy was missing an audio cassette.For example, the Guthrie family goes through some changes, as the mother (I don't know if we ever get her name) starts out the novel upstairs in isolation, and later leaves her husband and their 9 and 10 year old boys Ike and Bobby altogether. We're not told why she leaves, although I assume she had some form of clinical depression. There is a completely illogical, unexplained scene in which the young Guthrie boys saddle up a horse and ride at least 17 miles outside of town to visit the old bachelor cattle farmers, although Haruf never tells us what motivated the boys to do so. (In fact one of the kids asks his brother &quot;why are we here?&quot; - good question, I couldn't figure it out).There was another scene, which is given away by another Amazon reviewer here, in which a baby is dropped and noone seems to care - the old guys are more worried about whether the mom is okay, since her arm was yanked, than about the newborn on the floor. Come on, as a finalist for the National Book Award I expected a little more.At times Haruf's prose is lean and poetic, and I enjoyed many of the subplots. But I have to agree with some of my fellow reviewers, Plainsong is interesting but very uneven."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The simple beauty of this book is like the title. Spare and yet evocative. You get to know the people of Holt, Colorado like they were members of your own community.I loved this book! Thanks, Kent, for time well spent."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The author has definately given this book the right title. Plainsong. This book was about a few people who had some sort of connection to each other but not in a direct way. The characters were not quite as interesting as they were destitute in some fashion. For instance, Victoria has no family or support, Guthrie has no romantic love, Ike and Bobby have no parental supervision, the McPherons have no life outside of farming. It goes from there. At times I wondered where the story was going... at others I wondered when it would end. I found the most interesting parts involving Victoria and the McPherons. Their relationship was heart warming; the men were very loving in their own way. The one thing I definately liked was the narration. There wasn't the standard quotation marks around the characters dialoge. This made me think it was a story told by some one who was told by someone else and is just repeating it. An interesting view of narration."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I kept hanging on to the chapters of this book hoping that the story would pick up. This book was quite boring to me. I expect a book to grab me and this one didn't..instead of being a page turner this was a put-downer. There didn't seem much thought at all put into this book. Definitley a let down..."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This book was an easy read but there was no charactor development, it was boring, and it left more questions unanswered than I could possibly lists. There was one high point to the story, a couple of unmarried brothers who take in a pregnant teen. This storyline was touching and funny, but when all was said and done I still had to ask myself &quot;Is that it&quot;? Haruf, better luck next time."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"In a quiet, unassuming Colorado town, life involves the connections that human beings make with others. The writing is plain, like the title, and honest, like the McPheron brothers - older bachelor farmers in Holt, Colorado. The school teacher, Maggie sort of makes the links in town to better the lives of a young girl who has been kicked out of her house for getting pregnant and abused by her ignorant boyfriend, of another school teacher whose two sons are trying to understand why their parents' marriage has failed and their mother is handling depression (and some of the hard knocks that come from being the teacher's kids), and of the bachelor farmers who take in the pregnant girl against their better judgment and are changed in a powerful and lovely way by the experience. These people all interact with and have a positive impact on the others' lives - in a place and a community that are not happy, simple, or kind. A very well written novel and a reinforcement to the reader that kindness and support are still found in a world where one does not expect to find them."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I enjoyed this book - maybe because I lived for twenty years in the plains of Colorado. Small town life, including the Legion Bar, the &quot;bad&quot; families, the school environment, were so real. There was humor with the socially misfit brothers. (Are we to believe that's what the young sons will become?) If you like realism, dry humor, and interesting characters with emotional appeal (I would have liked to get more background on the mentally ill mother.), try this novel."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"There are some beautiful moments of dialogue to be found in this novel, unfortunately they serve only to make you wish the author had crafted more original characters and a more orignal story. We've all met the pregnant teenager, the gruff men with hearts of gold, and the self-sacrificing femal teacher in countless novels and movies. That their stories merge here is no surprise, though one is surprised that the author doesn't even bother with creating a plot point to justify the convergence."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Reading your book &quot;Plainsong&quot; has given me many emotions, your writing has taken me on a wonderful journey of true feelings, some overwhelming. Thank you for the wonderful trip. Jean"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This story had me engrossed the minute I started it. It has complex characters and it has simple characters. Loved the book very much! Don't miss the chance to read this one."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This small book packs a big punch.Good,quiet,and strong characters throughout. I especially like the chapters concerning the young boys and the older brothers."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Like other reviewers, I found the book not riveting but still readable. I was interested in the characters and was eager to see how things would turn out. An enjoyable, quick read. True, there does not seem to be much deep character development yet, as one reader pointed out, the characters stay in your mind days later. Not the best book ever but a satsifying way to pass the time."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I kept thinking this book would get better as i read but it just didn't. There was nothing spectacular to it. Yes, it's a &quot;nice little story&quot; but not worth your time."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"At first this book seemed very boring. But as time progressed I felt like I was part of the story. It seemed very sexually graphic at the begginning. The boys were exicted to hear about people having sex, but they felt very sorry for the girl in the story. The author was not afraid to say what he felt. It would be very hard to be the girl that got pregnant. After all the bad things that happened the boys turned out alright."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I am a senior in a highschool, and I'm reading this book for a class. Personally I wouldn't recommend this book, for it's pointless and dull. The book drudges on page after page in a small town setting where ordinary life is the key. There is nothing in this book that is remotely interesting, no humor, no plot, and if there is a plot it is extremely sketchy, or just so ordinary it's hardly noticeable. To me this book is not even well written, which makes it dull and not a good book."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"One of the most enjoyable books I have read in quite a while. Kent Haruf creates people you would love to know. The dialect used to form the characters of Raymond and Harold McPheron is priceless. (I looked forward to the McPheron chapters beyond all the others.) None of the story was predictable, all of it was very human. Makes you want to know what happens next to all of them. A very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Kent Haruf's third novel Plainsong wants to be a modest book, judging by the title. And it is. It depicts the disintegration of several dysfunctional families in the little town of Holt, Colorado, and then the seemingly random formation of new and better units. The prose is laconic yet it creates rather beautiful, subdued portrayal of everyday life in the smalltown. Problem is that it is also rather pretentious in its solemnity, and cannot really hide the fact that this story is painfully plain as analysis of the domestic problems in today's society. There are several nicely done scenes, but Haruf likes his world black and white, resulting in good guys that are so very good and bad guys that are so very bad. Ending is also too saccharine, almost reactionary in its firm appraisal of traditional family values. Disney will not need to change a word if they ever make a movie out of this."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This book was horrible. The characters were not developed, there was absolutely no plot, and no point. I didn't care abouth the characters because they were so underdeveloped. I felt this book was a ramling book with no tie up at the end. The McPheron boys sounded stupid instead of like humble farm people. Pointless parts: Mrs. Stearns, Guthrie's fling with the school secretary, and Bobby and Ike going to the McPherons house after they find out about Mrs. Stearsn.Horrible book. I can't see how anyone liked it? I like how a previous review said a case of the \\"Emperors New Clothes\\". That is exactly how I felt."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Just to say I totally agree with Kent. This book was a large disappointment after all the good reviews I had read."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This book was an quick and easy read for me, reasonably enjoyable and not too mind taxing. The central characters were likeable enough, especially the two adorable little boys, and the dialogue and insights into farmlife were definitely the main strengths of the book. There wasn't much of a plot, and the book, like life in most country towns like Holt I guess, just meandered along. There was no conclusion as such, the story was just a short glimpse at a piece in time of these people's lives. I would have liked more emotional depth and insight into the characters, a bit more complexity. I felt annoyed when Victoria left the McPheron brothers to go and live with Dwayne, without ever calling them to let them know where she was and that she was alright. I felt that was selfish and my opinion of her changed from that point on. Obviously she wanted things to turn out between herself and Dwayne for the baby's sake, but she could have at least called! And as for that revolting and completely irrelevant sex scene, what the hell was that!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"(And no, I've never read Finnegans Wake either.)e.e. cummings abhored capital letters. Evidently, Kent Haruf thinks it high literary style to eschew quotation marks - or, as Tom Robbins calls them: \\"earrings.\\" Yes, Mr. Robbins, they are \\"earrings\\" when the author wishes to note that something is being called something which it may not be - for example \\"a good book\\"- but quotation marks also perform the very useful function of letting the reader know when a character is speaking. This midwestern reader found this book to be too disconcerting - the lack of punctuation impedes the flow - makes one constantly have to \\"translate\\" as one is trying to read.Life is too short - and there are too many readable books out there to waste time on this one. I gave up on page 62. It's interesting that, on the jacket where they are trying to sell the book, the publishers know quite well how to use quotation marks!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The book is in OK condition.

I will not make the mistake of reading anything by this author again."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The cover on this book is beautiful, but I was sorely disappointed with the content. The plotline is weak (never did figure out how all the characters come together), the language is filthy and negative in a lot of sections, including an immoral, disgusting, and irrelvant sex scene. On the positive side, it did show some of the characters helping each other and enforcing proper moral values. However, with all of the wonderful literature out there, don't waste your time or money on this book."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I had to read plainsong for school and it was a horrible book. It's boring and has no depth. As others have said, this book is littered with nothing but useless information and too much sex. Some sex is relevant to a book- however too much sex is just like an erotic story. I warn anyone who has to read this book- drink massive amounts of alcohol before reading."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, and would suggest it to others looking for an entertaining novel . . .If you want to read a book that goes straight to your heart, read Stolen Moments by Barbara Jeanne Fisher. . .It is a beautiful story of unrequited love. . .for certain the love story of the nineties. I intended to give the book a quick read, but I got so caught up in the story that I couldn't put the book down. From the very beginning, I was fully caught up in the heart-wrenching account of Julie Hunter's battle with lupus and her growing love for Don Lipton. This love, in the face of Julie's impending death, makes for a story that covers the range of human emotions. The touches of humor are great, too, they add some nice contrast and lighten things a bit when emotions are running high. I've never read a book more deserving of being published. It has rare depth. Julie's story will remind your readers that life and love are precious and not to be taken for granted. It has had an impact on me, and for that I'm grateful. Stolen Moments is written with so much sensitivity that it made me want to cry. It is a spellbinder. What terrific writing. Barbara does have an exceptional gift! This book was edited by Lupus specialist Dr. Matt Morrow too, and has the latest information on that disease. ..A perfect gift for someone who started college late in life, fell in love too late in life, is living with any illness, or trying to understand a loved one who is. . .A gift to be cherished forever"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Mr. Haruf writes in a clean and simple prose that is beautiful and easy to read. His characters are very well-developed and draw the reader in from the start. His treatment of the landsape reminds me of Wallace Stegner and Ivan Doig. The story line is believable and moves along briskly. Most of all, his dialogue is as real as the breakfast banter in a small town cafe.One of the jacket quotes calls &quot;Plainsong&quot; &quot;the best new novel ... since 'Cold Mountain'&quot;. Amen."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I don't go out of my way to read fiction, but three things brought me to this novel:the cover showing the low-rise turf hills and big sky of the Great Plainsthe title implying a paean to the plains or a simple hymn sung in a country churcha newspaper story relating how the author, when working, drew a sack over his head to banish light and sound in order to focus on simple, truthful usage unadorned by conscious style.It wasn't the story but the central characters that turned the pages. At the beginning, they were unrelated and lonely each in their own way. But at the end, in a picnic under cottonwoods in an isolated farmyard, they were brought together from helping one another. Similar stories are probably replayed in wind-bullied small towns from Manitoba to Texas, but we'll never know of them. Thanks to the author, we know this one.Haruf has paid his dues over the years to get where he is. I'm pressing Plainsong on friends whom I think will appreciate it."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I loved this book, but when my wife asked me what it was about, I replied, &quot;Nothing.&quot; And to me, that is what this wonderful book depicts.Set in the rural town of Holt, Kent Haruf meshes together the stories of a recently separated high school teacher (Tom Guthrie), his hard-working pre-teenage sons (Ike and Bobby), a couple of old-time farmers (Harold and Raymond McPheron), a pregnant high school girl (Victoria Roubideaux, and the other high-shcool teacher that connects them all together (Maggie Jones).This narrative story builds the character development quite nicely, and allows the reader to feel for the characters. Haruf does a tremendous job of simply describing life (waking up for work, cleaning the house, making oatmeal cookies, etc.). These simple smaller stories bring together all of the characters in one exceptional voice.This book shows how people can adapt to their lives, and eventually redeem themselves. This book is not about one story. It reminds me of Seinfeld. Everyday life instances captured in the written word, interweaved together. It is fabulous and one terrific ride.Haruf's language is very crisp and clear, and makes for a real nice and easy read. He is very descriptive in his writing, including one scene involving a horse autopsy that I swear I could actually see it in front of me.This was a wonderful book, and one that I would clearly recommend to anyone. It deserves more than five stars."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"...in awhile, along comes a sweet and simple book that finally has a profound impact. PLAINSONG is such a book. It doesn't drag you into a whirlwind, it simply tells its story via various characters. It's a departure from the frantic nature of most of today's books and films because of its low-key, soft-sell approach. It's funny, touching, painful, and uplifting, and in an odd way, calming. It deals with the fine possibilities of the human spirit within the harsh realities of life. And that's a theme we see too little of in our culture. Haruf declines to surrender to ugliness, preferring to insist beauty of spirit is still posssible in our world. Good for him."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong, a book by Kent Haruf, is a book that describes the lives of some of the residents in Holt, Colorado. Different plots deal with various issues of life, death, and a community that connects together. A tale of Tom Guthrie, who is a history teacher at the area high school. He is left to raise his two \\"twin-like\\" sons, Ike and Bobby, after his wife abandons him and their family. Victoria, a 17 year-old high school senior, is thrown out of her house by her crude and bitter mother after she had learned that her daughter is pregnant. The McPheron Brothers, lonely, sheltered, and isolated from the rest of the world, are a couple of aged bachelors, and all they know are themselves and life on their ranch. When they were fourteen years old, they were left to live on their own after their parents died. They have missed out on important and \\"normal\\" things in their life after choosing to stay with each other and to not get married. Ken Haruf interweaves the lives of these characters beautifully through the character of Maggie Jones. She is the most \\"flawless\\" character of the bunch, because she is compassionate, generous, and beautiful. Not to mention, the responsible party for helping and improving their outlook on their lives.This book started slowly at first but once it started to pick up, I couldn't put it down. I constantly found myself wondering what was going to happen next with each character. Ken Haruf also does a wonderful job making the reader feel what the characters are feeling. He also painted a vivid mental image of the setting which helped me visualize Holt, Colorado. This is a warm, heart-felt story in which Haruf reminds us that in hard times, people come together to mend each others hearts."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Let's start by admitting that we all know the difference between great books and those that are merely a delight to read. &quot;Plainsong&quot; surely falls into the latter category. None of the many characters in this highly readable novel are, in and of themselves, particularly memorable. None are fully fleshed out, and a few border on being little more than caricatures. But none of that takes away from the fact that Haruf can tell a fine, engrossing story, in which there are mildly heroic heroes and somewhat unpleasant villains (this is the High Plains, after all -- everything is of necessity toned down in keeping with the title of the book) and a series of different stories weave together nicely towards a deeply satisfying emotional payoff.A rich read for the airport or the beach (not a bookclub), and well worth the paperback price."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"While reminiscent of Annie Proulx and Willa Cather, this book's voice is all its own. Haruf's quiet authority and sharp eye draw the reader in from the first page. If you liked Cold Mountain, you'll respond to Plainsong. This is everything a book should be. I'll be buying copies for all my friends."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong is a triumph and a tribute to the sturdy people of small town America. It is a story of two sets of brothers -- the young Guthrie boys and the elderly McPheron brothers -- both of whom overcome the loss of parents and redeem themselves in in a peculiar mix of kindness and coarse pragmatism. The book pivots on the caring fulcrum of Maggie Jones, a teacher who unites all the main players. Disaster seems to lurk at the turn of every page only to be vanquished by the essential honor of Holt, Colorado's pillar citizens, the principled school superintendant, the confident small town physician, the skilled veterinarian and, most of all, Tom Guthrie, the overwhelmed high school history teacher who overcomes his personal travails and teaches us all a lesson in loyalty and tenacity. Most of all, Plainsong is a story about loneliness and how the resident strength of the human spirit can beat it and soar even on the barren plains of a ugly place that only looks more beautiful the closer you get to it. Plainsong must be savored, if not for the sheer joy of a delightful read, then for lessons we take from it. Five stars with no reservations."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Very starkly written, &quot;Plainsong&quot; was a quick but deep read. Its simplicity of style gives the reader the opportunity to emotionally participate in the lives of the characters. Haruf doesn't give anything away cheaply or lavishly, but allows an opening for the reader to crawl into the story.Two main story lines play out and connect in the end.In the first, Tom Guthrie is a man who would be attractive to any sensitive woman -- a schoolteacher who loves his sons and faces single-parenting with determination. His wife, who is &quot;not a strong woman&quot;, also loves the boys, but she is rendered useless to them by depression. The children are as stoic as their father, needing love and a woman in their lives, but they put up a tough front about it.In perhaps the most touching part of the book, the boys, Ike and Bobby, befriend an elderly lady on their paper route. They find in her a woman who will bake a batch of homemade cookies. She finds in them a brief opportunity to enjoy little boys again (her only son was killed in WWII) before her death. Such simple gifts to salve over deep needs.In the second story line, Victoria Roubideaux is a pregnant unwed teenager, fatherless herself, with a mother too damaged by life to love or help her daughter. Left on the streets, Victoria turns to Maggie Jones, one of her schoolteachers. Maggie hooks Victoria up with two old bachelor brothers who have withdrawn from life to their ranch. They give Victoria a home and the male influence she lacks and she gives them an interest in something beyond cattle and the female influence that they lack.It's a book of lonely misfits reaching out to each other. But in these misfits, we find elements of ourselves. We have compassion for them, wish to reach out to them, and cheer them on."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"It has been a long time since I have read a novel as lovely as Plainsong. In some ways the story may seem contrived, but the author's ability to evoke the scenes and emotions of the townspeople of Holt is nothing short of amazing. From the very first page I felt a lump in my throat as I tried to hold back the tears. Those two little boys - they broke my heart! And the parallels between them and the McPheron brothers was brillant. A wonderful novel, not to be missed."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong is the kind of book in which there are moving connections between 2 old bachelor brothers and a pregnant teenager; 2 young brothers and a lonely old woman; and in which even a one night stand is full of tenderness. The young brothers have a good father, but surprisingly this is the one relationship without much warmth. Plainsong is endearing without being sentimental, and all the characters are worth spending time with, especially the boys. Plainsong does not totally lack a hard edge, but the few mean personalities are movers only: the novel is never told from their perspective"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I first read this novel in 2000, then just recently read the latest novel by Haruf, &quot;Eventide&quot; which I also give 5 stars. After finishing &quot;Eventide&quot; I read &quot;Plainsong&quot; again, I had forgotten some of the story and it made me appreciate all the characters in both books all that more. I especially love the relationship between Victoria and the McPherson brothers."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"My wife praised this book for a long time, then I read it. I don't read many books, don't have the time, and when I do, it has to be good by the end of page one, or I abandon it. This is a good story, and the author keeps himself out of the way and lets the story, the people, and the land speak for themselves. How the land speaks for itself--minute details like the items sliding back and forth on top of the dash of an old pickup--this author knows his subject. I had a real affection for his characters by the end of the book, and a real antagonism for the antagonists. I read the book in an afternoon, and I'm glad I did, and I'd like to read it again some day."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Kent Haruf, in &quot;Plainsong,&quot; describes some of the troubled people in the community of Holt, Colorado. In alternating chapters, Haruf gives voice to the lonely and the lost. There is Tom Guthrie, a high-school teacher whose marriage appears to be dying and Victoria Robideaux, a pregnant teenager whose mother cruelly locks her out of the house. In this novel, Ike and Bobby, Tom's pre-teen children, learn some grown-up lessons about love, death and letting go. Although they are very young, no one shelters Ike and Bobby from the harsh realities of life. The McPhersons are two crusty old bachelors who are set in their ways until they are asked to perform a tremendous sacrifice in order to help Victoria during her pregnancy. In his realistic dialogue, Haruf perfectly captures the nuances of emotion expressed by each character. The author is particularly adept at describing the loneliness and despair that a person feels when he has lost a loved one, when his pride is wounded, or when he doesn't know how to face the future with dignity. Another theme expertly explored in &quot;Plainsong&quot; is how the members of a community reach out to one another and provide support when such support is desperately needed. This book is earthy, with graphic sexual situations, profanity and even a vividly described autopsy of a horse! The book has a little humor, but it could have used a little more humor to offset some of the bleak and tragic situations that Haruf describes. &quot;Plainsong&quot; is not always entertaining but it is an unflinching look at the troubles that tear people apart and sometimes bring them together."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"A lovely and simple book, looking at life in a small town. The characterizations and interactions of the main characters was very real, drawing you into their complicated lives easily. I loved the McPheron brothers and their simple but heart felt attempts to connect with the young Victoria Roubideaux. Tom Guthrie as a father stuggling to bring up his sons as a single parent was interesting, but I found his sons Bobby and Ike even more interesting. I like the way each persons life crossed into the others, all courtesy of the kind and seemingly all knowing Maggie Jones. My only complaint is that I wish the ending had more resolution to it. But life is like that, not everything is wrapped in a pretty package with a bow on it. All in all a very enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"&quot;Plainsong&quot; is an unusual book in that you really feel like you have walked into a small town for a brief stay, in the middle of the characters' daily lives. It is clear that significant events have occured and relationships have developed prior to your arrival, yet you are never sure exactly what those events were, or how the relationships formed. Similarly, at the end of the book, not all of the loose ends were cleanly and neatly wrapped up. As a result, it is like viewing a snapshot, or at least a video excerpt, of the characters' lives.The book describes events in the lives of several people in a small town which appear, at the outset, mostly unrelated. However, these stories end up woven together, as the characters lives eventually overlap. The main characters are a teacher and his two young sons, a fellow teacher who takes a young pregnant girl under her wing, two elderly bachelor ranchers, and a school troublemaker.I agree with other readers that there are some distractions in the book, primarily the author's affected failure to use quotation marks around spoken words. There was no need for this unusual writing style; I, too, found that I had to reread certain paragraphs to figure out what was said and what was not. However, after a while this becomes less difficult.Otherwise, the book is well written and seems to be a realistic description of the ebbs and flows of a small Plains' town."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Every year, I travel across the Colorado prairie where I imagine Holt is located on my way to the mountains. It is more desolate than the Nebraska sandhills. There is some sense of this geography that permeates his characters and their really quite ordinary lives. I do have a problem with the way Haruf romanticizes the good people of Holt. Shows that he is a big city guy at heart. It is nice to think that the good souls of Holt would generally do good deeds like the MacPherson brothers do for Victoria and Maggie for everyone, but we know that in the real, plain life in the Holts of the world, people aren't so nice to one another and not everything works out. And if it does, it is only after everyone talks about you behind your back interminably. Still a fine book."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This book was enjoyable, easy to read and an all around delight! A friend shared this book with me and I'm so grateful she did. I loved the different characters, the small stories within the story and the way the author brought them all together without you even noticing! This book was refreshing and I loved the writers' style. A must read if you're ready for a break from the routine."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"It was very easy to get in to this book. The short chapters could be consumed in a five minute break. The character development moved along, but I wanted more from the author. For a story that dealt with a lot of very difficlt issues, mental illness, teenaged pregnancy, and marital breakup it just moved along. Yet, it was a good story and one I would recommend."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This book is a beautiful albeit raw and rugged account of life in a small Colorado plain's town. Ironically, it's mirrored after the very town I grew up in. Even though now I live in LA, &quot;Plainsong&quot; transports me back to my youth. Kent Haruf taps into the essence of rural life and the people that live out there lives there. The genuineness he captures - whether the folk are &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; is very real. And the amazing sense of community is the bond that still binds - even when one moves far away... This book moved me in a way that makes me proud of my roots... &quot;Holt&quot; is my hometown."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"As much as I liked the writing, I found the story puzzling and disjointed and saying Maggie tied it together is ridiculous. What I mainly want to know is, why did those boys ride their bikes out to the McPherons? What did I miss there? The lack of quotation marks didn't bother me, and I actually enjoyed the minimalist dialogue, but it just wasn't much of a story."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"There are no quotation marks in this entire book. Haruf handles this style very skillfully, creating dialogue that is not confusing to the reader, but it's a device that isn't necessarily a welcome innovation. (You be the judge.) This is one stripped-down style book. I thought it was interesting enough to read in its entirety, but I wasn't moved by it."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong is &quot;any simple or unadorned melody&quot; and that aptly describes the characters in the book. It is small time life at it's best with honorable and hard-working people. I enjoyed all the characters, especially the McPheron brothers (worth reading just for the meeting these two guys :). I felt sorry for Bobby and Ike and do wish the author would have spent more time detailing the 'how and why' of their mother's behavior. All in all, Plainsong is just about 'plain' people with problems, joys, and sorrows just like all of us. The characters have to come to terms with loss and rise above it. Haruf does a good job showing how these characters grow and learn some hard lessons. An enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This is certainly the best contemporary book of fiction I've read in a long time. The spare writing is incredibly effective -- and almost cinematic in its absence of internal reflection. Somehow, by the end of the novel, you are absolutely engaged with the characters, crying at their pain and smiling at their simple joys. A wonderful example of contemporary fiction."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I listened to this story on Recorded Books audio and unlike a previous reviewer, I loved it. I wish there was a sequel; Kent Haruf writes dialogue that is so real and typical of the area. I am from a small farming community and the two older brothers were so comical, they reminded me of lots of people I know. The story centers around Victoria, a teenage girl who finds herself pregnant and kicked out of her mother's house. With nowhere else to go she ends up depending on the kindness of a few people in her community. The author has really captured the personalities of all the characters. The only thing that disappointed me was that the story had to end. I am looking forward to reading anything else by Kent Haruf and will definitely recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I liked this book very much. I felt it described people as they are, not as someone else thinks they ought to be. I have often been in small towns like Holt, so it was very familar. I have felt the emotions of the characters in my experience -- they were not a surprise, but they were almost inevitable. People don't act the way you think they should; they don't always use logic; they are the way are they are. I felt this book could well have been a true story, though if not true, it reads as though it were a report on human behavior."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"that has graced every horizon upon which I have stood. Characters who made me laugh at their beauty and weep at their tragedy. If you don't care about these people you need an EKG. Words sculpted with such economy its as though they wrote themselves. And I thank Mr. Haurf for the reunion. To be reaquainted with old friends and associates and someone I thought I had lost forever. That child within me."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"If you're looking for riveting reading, this book is not it. It is quiet and as unadorned as the Plains it describes. And it ends without climax as life usually does. Yet its humanity slowly seeps into your bones. The characters stick to your ribs and make you wish you could mail them a postcard wishing them godspeed."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong is a thoroughly enjoyable novel. The characters are so real, you can see, hear, feel and smell them. They are characters you care about. Although the character's lives are dramatic, they are completely believable. This is the type of book you can read in bed and the story will not keep you awake with grim thoughts after you have finished reading."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This book was such an easy read, and such a simple story, and yet several days after finishing it I find myself still thinking about the characters. If you grew up in a small community, you'll find this book to be extraordinarily compelling. Even if you didn't, I think it would be hard not to feel compassion and endearment for the people in this little town in Colorado. Great stuff."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"&quot;Plainsong&quot; was a good book. I especially felt connected with Victoria. She just reached out a grabbed your heart. Sure, she was 17 and pregnant, but she was mature and quiet. The McPheron brothers were also great. They went from old, opinionated farmers to kindhearted guardians to Victoria. I was very into this book and I wish it had been a bit longer. Well, maybe there will be a sequel!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"In some ways this book reminds me of &quot;All Over but the Shoutin'&quot; by Rick Bragg, though this is no autobiography as his was. This is a marvelous book. I can't understand one reviewer's comment that there was a lull of about 20 pages. There was no lull for me. I was swept along and read it at one sitting because I couldn't put it down.Some will praise the book for its prose and language and images; others will be captured by its morally uplifting people who are at times tested in the midst of tension and ugliness. For me, I was most enchanted with the reality of the dialogue. So natural; so real--in no way contrived. It's the way people in a small, rural town--all of whom know each other--would naturally interact. I can't wait to recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I've owned a copy of PLAINSONG for a while, but now that I've finished reading it, I wonder what took me so long to pick it up in the first place. As a matter of fact, if it were not a selection that a book club I joined read, it might still be sitting on my \\"to read\\" shelf. I'm not sure why this is the case. The summary on the back cover seemed interesting enough for me to purchase. It's probably due to owning too many books, all of which I want to read, but don't have the time.PLAINSONG tells the story of a group of people living in Holt, Colorado. The main characters are Tom Guthrie, a high school teacher who is trying to keep his life together, his two sons Ike and Bobby, Victoria Robideaux, a pregnant young girl who finds herself homeless, and two bachelor farmers Harold and Raymond Mc Pheron. Each shares loss and loneliness in common and all of their lives intertwine in one way or another. The mastery of the novel come snot from its plot, but from the characters themselves. Author Kent Haruf writing style, at least in this book, could best be described as sparse in details, but the sparseness serves to create complex characters and situations. The plot of the book is somewhat predictable, but Haruf avoids clich&eacute; by adding twists and turns that would be consonant with small town life but come as a surprise to the reader. There are no easy resolutions in this book, if it can be said there are any resolutions at all, but this too is an advantage. Haruf continues the story of the people of Holt, Colorado in his novel EVENTIDE, so readers don't want quick fix endings, readers want to discover what happens by reading the next novel. I'm only a few chapters into it, so I can't say for sure whether we discover how all the characters make out, but I am engaged and interested.I am writing this review after the book club discussion. People were all over the place as far as reactions to the book. Comments ranged from complex thoughts about relationships and meaning in life to the minutiae of why the author chooses not to use quotation marks (annoying to some, interesting and eclectic to others). Yet as the discussions got lively, I discovered what may account for the book's popularity and its critical success. Haruf may not create characters we see ourselves in right away, but he does create memorable characters we want to know and understand, and shows us a side of life we may not always see. Since the discussion went on for two hours and could have continued for another two hours at least, Kent Haruf certainly gives readers a good bit to reflect upon, and if a writer can get a reader to think, something great has been accomplished."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"A very economically-written, precisely-edited story about human kindness found in unlikely places. Haruf's Colorado community is the quintessential small town, where everybody knows not only your name, but your business--or thinks they do. It is hard-working, undemonstrative, and--this is the meat of this book--it takes care of its own with quiet concern and a minimum of fanfare.Haruf's characters carry the story, mostly through dialogue and description; there is very little introspection. It works: my heart ached for his protagonists, a quietly righteous teacher, his two young sons, his estranged, depressive wife; a pregnant highschool girl whose mother kicks her out of the house; two wryly hilarious old farmers who perform an unlikely act of mercy. Even the villians--the parents of a surly, lost teenaged boy and the kid himself--are human and recognizable archtypes who might well live next door. Bit-players, minor actors--although they might have spent little time in print, these too were fully fleshed and caught in as few words as possible.The writer's approach reminds me of Larry Brown's--the tightness of the editing, the simplicity of the imagery. Amazing, too, the mood he sets by not using quote marks; I kept asking myself how it would have changed the book to do so. An interesting stylistic gesture, but one that made a subtle but profound mark on the way I read the story."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Not easily impressed by &quot;book award&quot; titles, however I truly enjoyed reading &quot;PLAINSONG&quot; once I got rolling. The book I purchased had the silver &quot;NATIONAL BOOK AWARD FINALIST&quot; seal and I thought it should be a good read. Even though I am not always sold on titles with so called award status. I started this book and put it down. It did not immediately take me away or even hold my attention. After seeing this on Stephen King's book list from &quot;ON WRITING&quot; I decided to give it another try. I am happy that I did. For whatever reason this time around I picked it up and did not put it down until I finished it.The story is set in a rural town with tweedy characters. Most seem like simple folk with their struggles into inter personal relations. The hero is often the friend and not a family member. A story where community and friends often become the support and the family to those who have become estranged by family for their own frowned upon social misgivings. Love rises to the fore leaving the less desirables behind, those most often being the blood relatives.A nice stringing together of words forming a story that is delicate, often simple and at times redeeming. The ending is one of grace and ultimately good winning over bad."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"First, the lack of quotation marks was distracting to me and I don't understand it. Most of the time it didn't matter but a few times I had to go back to discern who was saying what and what was narration as opposed to dialogue.Second, some of the plot was downright unbelievable. Most notably, how could this supposedly sweet Victoria never even bother to call or get some message to the McPherons? And then after she pulled a stunt like that they open right back up to her.Perhaps for my taste the novel would have been much more interesting if it examined one or two of the eight or so main characters. I never really grew to care much about any of them, with perhaps the exception of the young boys."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"In Plainsong, Kent Haruf creates a convincing &quot;realistic&quot; novel as he plainly (both straightforwardly and simply) relates a story of the daily lives of characters in the isolated, small town of Holt, Colorado, through what seem to be the eyes of ten curious townsfolk. Left to discern the plot from only the characters' spare conversations and actions, the reader becomes one these inquisitive folks and is free to interpret the growing pains of individuals forced to find &quot;family&quot; in the surrounding community in less-than-conventional ways. Diguised by undemanding prose, Plainsong's intricacy appears when the reader dares to take up Haruf's challenge to read between the lines and evaluate each character's motives according to the readers's own individual experience. In this way, Plainsong resonates with a different melody for every reader, every audience. After all is said and done, the reader may well feel as though he or she has a new lick of gossip to contribute to the banter of the folks at the local diner."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Some years ago, I read Haruf's &quot;Tie that Binds&quot; and thought it was one of the best books ever written; I was sorry he did not receive more acclaim for that book. Now I read this book which is equally as memorable as &quot;Tie that Binds&quot; The characterization is so much on target and the situations so realistic - perhaps one has to grown up in a very small town in the country to understand this. I say &quot;Amen&quot; to all those positive reviews and encourage readers to also read &quot;Tie that Binds.&quot;"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Haruf's Plainsong is a wonderful read. I became immediately impressed by the diverse characters in the quaint small town. Plainsong reminds me of Where the Heart Is. I would love to read a sequel. Victoria's adventures would make an excellent novel. I hated to turn the last page!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This story is a great book about ordinary people who live ordinary lives and is written in an extraordinary way. Kent Haruf is a wonderful author who really brings his characters to life. Not everyone in the book is perfect but reading this story you can feel the warmth in their hearts. The characters all learn from eachother and come together to make a wonderful small town America. I loved the McPheron brothers and how you see their lives changed through loving a young pregnant girl who happens to come upon their doorstep. Maggie Jones is the one who binds everyone together through her strong, helpful character. The boys Ike and Bobby go through some tough times but hold eachother together with their brotherly love. I have not read such a plain, simple story of wonderful characters in a long time. This is a book that anyone can read and love."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The book seems fragmented at first until you start to link the characters. The motherless boys, the pregnant teen, the school teacher, and the two old bachelors take turns being the focus for five or six pages, then it jumps to another one. The situations of each depressed me, but the descriptions of the small town, the people and their conversations gripped me and would not let me quit.I felt much better towards the end as good things happened, mainly through Maggie's efforts. Her character intercedes in several situations but I felt I really knew little about her.I guess I really wanted this book to be more like Ivan Doig's This House of Sky. Try that one if you haven't read it yet."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"As you've doubtless read in the fine Spotlight Reviews, this book explores the lives of several people in rural Holt, Colorado. These folks at first glance seem to have nothing in common, but, as often happens in small towns, their lives intersect in surprising ways. The plot moves along gently at the speed of life, and along the way, we get to know the characters and their lives intimately, just by observing what they say and do.For the most part, I enjoyed Mr Haruf's writing style -- spare, yet descriptive. But sometimes it seemed to me that he was in a metaphor-writing class and was getting a failing grade. Some were good, but others were dreadful and seemed forced.But that's my only complaint. I was drawn into these people's lives. I enjoyed watching brothers Bobby and Ike interact so lovingly; I thought the bachelor farmer brothers were hilarious. There was actually a plot without their seeming to be a plot. I'm looking forward to reading Eventide, which is the book our book club is reading this month. I had to read this one first, though, after hearing some of the same characters will be in Eventide. So pick this one up. It's short and a quick read. And if you like it, check out Eventide. Once I've finished that book, I'll report back with a review."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Mr. Haruf is an extraordinary storyteller as he interweaves the threads of the average into a plain, yet beautiful reality. Plainsong is quintessential Americana without the sense of false rhetoric that encumbers so many novels in this genre. The novel's multiple protagonists are painfully honest characters who embody life truths and complexities without melodrama. The interaction of the novels characters testify to a greater sense of connectedness with those around us, no matter where we may live. Haruf lays bare many graphic details without sensationalism in order to produce one of modern fiction's most sincere depictions of everyday life.Readers who enjoyed Richard Russo's Empire Falls will likely enjoy this novel about community and everyday heroism."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I purchased this book after reading all the raving reviews in the front of it. I couldn't put it down once I started. Parts of the story literally brought me to tears. The McPheron brothers were probably my favorite. They come to life off of the pages. The conversations they have with one another made me laugh and smile. I found all the characters in the book to be interesting and exactly the type of people you would find in a small town. The book was an enjoyable \\"getaway\\" from the fast paced world I live in. After I finished the book I went out and bought \\"Eventide\\" to see what happens next!!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I picked up Plainsong on a business trip and finished up in the Cincinnati airport. Not in the airport per se... on the tarmac, still 8th in line for take-off, actually, leaving me wanting more for the hour and twenty minutes we were in the air.I loved it. Unlike some books with multiple story lines, no one story over another held my interest more. I was equally engaged in all. That balance is very delicate and was surely thought out to the nth degree in the editing process.The characters were the heart of the story, way above the plot. They were lifelike, real, human, etc. These could have been members of my own family, had I come from the Plains.Those quiet and beautiful McPheron brothers were at the core of the story. I would have loved an entire novel just about them, but then I would have missed out on other gems like Tom, burnt but not quite broken, and Maggie, who, as Haruf describes her (I'll have to look this up), \\"(doesn't) get defeated or scared by life.\\" I could have used a lot more information about the two boys and Tom's ultimate retribution against the Beckmans, but I think that's just my reaction to the injustice they suffered.My only criticism was the editing choice behind the lack of quotation marks. Maybe I'm just a purist when it comes to that sort of thing, but I believe you need a really good reason for such a break in traditional punctuation standards. Like, maybe if you're writing from the first person point of view and you want all of the prose to merge together, dialog and narration, to indicate that the speaker isn't really distinguishing himself, in his own mind. Here, though, it was a distraction to me, at least at first.I know some writers choose to do things like that just to be different. Charles Frazier, in Cold Mountain, for instance, preceded each sparse line of dialog with a dash, instead of wrapping it in quotes. I struggled with that as well. Then again, Frazier won the National Book Award and Haruf was nominated, so maybe those who judge like the breaks from tradition. Who knows?I just prefer my narration and dialog to be clearly delineated. Plus, when you do something like that, you need to be extra careful with your commas, since that's all that separates the speech from the speaker, and I found three or four comma splices as I was reading along which threw me off track.Regardless of that very minor complaint, the writing was excellent and the characters were the best I've come across since The Shipping News, which is still on the top of my list of personal favorites."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The combination of characters in PLAINSONG are indeed unique. As I started the novel I wondered how they would all mesh. In many ways, this book is a \\"day in the life\\" of Holt, Col. The author manages to look at one relatively short period of time, a little less than a year, and show what happened to the characters and how their lives changed. It's a period of change for all of them espcially Victoria and the two young boys, Bobby and Ike. In fact it is a period of change for all of the characters, Tom, Maggie and the two McPherson brothers.I got the EVENTIDE out of the library. It apparently continues the story. I'm sure that I will read it, but I'm not sure if it had been better to leave the characters were they are at the end of PLAINSONG and let each reader speculate as to what happens to them; how this period of time and the changes they went through effected the rest of thief lives."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The book seems fragmented at first until you start to link the characters. The motherless boys, the pregnant teen, the school teacher, and the two old bachelors take turns being the focus for five or six pages, then it jumps to another one. The situations of each depressed me, but the descriptions of the small town, the people and their conversations gripped me and would not let me quit.I felt much better towards the end as good things happened, mainly through Maggie's efforts. Her character intercedes in several situations but I felt I really knew little about her.I guess I really wanted this book to be more like Ivan Doig's This House of Sky. Try that one if you haven't read it yet."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I loved this book because the author had the grace and the courage to write about plain people who were lovely on the inside. It sounds corny, but it was a love story between different types of people. I thought that this book was going to be very depressing when I first began reading. I left the book and returned to it a couple of months later. It turned out to be a total joy to read. Haruf writes about what is in someone's heart. He understands desolation, loneliness, and need. He also understands dignity, honor, and loyalty to family. His characters are real and beautiful."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I read this book at my wife's insistence since I grew up in a small Colorado town. Kent Haruf's book is simple, yet has an interesting, cast of eight characters in a Colorado prairie town. The town is plain, but like any simple story from a small town life has it's challenges and conflicts.The book's finds its strength in it's characters. And each chapter focuses on one or two of them. Guthrie is the father of two responsible young boys, Ike and Bobby. Ella, his wife, is so depressed she can not get out of bed. I liked the McPheron brothers who are two kind, yet simple farmers from the prairie are a real treat. They aren't the greatest at agriculture, but wise beyond measure and added some wisdom and levity to the story. Maggie Jones is a teacher, like Guthrie, at the high school in Holt who holds relationships together. Maggie Jones provides a real plain, loving and honesty in her being. While this book was in the running for a National Book Award, it has the feel of a third disinterested third party telling the story. While this wasn't the very best book I've read in my lifetime, there was a lot for me to connect with."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Haruf presents a landscape both physical and more importantly psychological of the spare, austere plains of northeast Colorado. The action, scoured clean of any unnecessary ornament, suits the geography. I suppose a passing familiarity with the area aids in making the narrative more accessible to the reader. The characters mostly evoke sympathy, even delight, as do a pair of elderly, bachelor farmers. In Minnesota Garrison Keillor would make them Norwegian. A much put-upon school teacher with a pathetic wife fading into terminal mental illness, a pair of immensely engaging sons (who remind me of my twin grandsons), and a friendly (\\"very friendly,\\" as it turns out) woman teacher fill the important slots in the cast. Regretably, we also learn what abominable things high school boys often are--say I who once was one. The taut, astringent prose entirely suits the novel. Only the mannered omission of quotation marks marred my satisfaction with the book."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"After reading Plainsong, I will read Kent Haruf's other books with the expectation that there is the same gentle message that is pervasive throughout this book. The kindnesses that the characters extend to each other have the greatest immediate and long-term effects on their lives. I was so touched by the brothers who received as much as they gave through sharing their lives with a virtual stranger when her own family had abandoned her. This is a book that will remain in its readers' hearts."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"His prose was perfect. I felt like I was there on the prairie of Colorado. The people touched my heart. Would I recommend it..yes."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"While the hard lyricism of the writing recalls Hemingway and Carver and the elegant plot construction echoes The Great Gatsby, the story itself is Haruf's own. And a good one it is--the dialogue between the two sets of brothers is pitch perfect. This will make an excellent movie with the right cast and director, preferably one who is not afraid of long silences. Todd Field, anyone?"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"There are so many novels out there that seem to shock the reader by the way they describe events that shape the characters lives. In this book I found the cirsumstances real, but not hard to read and not totally depressing. The writing style is plain and very easy to read. A good read on a long plane ride or a de-stress weekend away."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This is a typical &quot;best seller&quot; that I fell into where the characters are simple, predictable in their illogical behaviors, sappy, and boring. The plot is of little relevence to any real life situation and the book was neither educative nor entertaining. I have a hard time knowing why there has been such a favorable response to this work other than it doesn't tax one's thoughts too much. It isn't even on a par with Oprah's books. The cover is well-designed and promising, which goes to confirm that you can't judge a book on its cover."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I'm glad Kent Haruf's Plainsong was the last book I read in the just-ended century. It testifies to the solid state of American literature as we closed things out. Plainsong deals with a small Colorado town where the lives of a few people have gotten a little messy. Some folks use these circumstances to torment; others serve as lifelines. (I don't want to give away too much plot, but the McPheron brothers almost steal the show.) Although gritty in places, Plainsong is mostly tender and hopeful. If your favorite authors include the likes of Ivan Doig, Willa Cather, Raymond Carver, and Larry McMurtry, you're probably on to something here. If you're looking for a pot-boiling bodice-ripper, this ain't it."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"If you were raised or currently reside in a small, rural community you will have no trouble putting faces on the characters in this book. Most scenes that occured in Holt, Colorado (and not in Denver) could have been drawn by Norman Rockwell. It is a timeless book because the story is about ordinary people with ordinary dreams and ordinary problems. Will Ike and Bobby grow up to be the next McPherons?"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I would have given this book 5 stars if it wasn't for one thing.This book was wonderfully written and I would love to see a movie version of it, but that may have already crossed the author's mind. I get the feeling obtaining an R rating instead of PG may have been the reason for this particular chapter. Afterall, an R rating sells more tickets. It is a shame that Mr. Haruf had to be so graphic about Ike and Bobby coming across teens having sex. I felt like a peeping tom also. Any chance if this does become a movie that Mr. Haruf can clean it up just a tad so that young and old can enjoy this beautiful story?The characters were so wonderful. The McPherons were my favorite. I couldn't wait to get to their next chapter.Even though Victoria Roubideau made the same terrible mistake that a lot of young teen girls do nowadays, she didn't compound it by continuing a destructive relationship. Dr. Laura would have been proud!A simply-written and touching story. Very nice ending. My thanks to Mr. Haruf for not tieing all the loose ends up for the readers. Reminds me of how &quot;Gone with The Wind&quot; ended."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Like many other reviewers, I was unimpressed by the run-on sentences and the lack of quotations marks. If you want to tell a story in one sentence with no punctuation marks, write a poem.Some of the language and scenes led me to believe in Haruf's talent for telling a story. Unfortunately, Plainsong reads like an author's detailed notes to himself, or his outline for a novel. None of the stories in the book are complete. We don't know why Guthrie's wife left. Is she depressed? Did she have a nervous breakdown? We don't know how Guthrie feels about her either. But his response is to abandon his children to their own devises, take up drinking excessively at a local bar, and go to bed with not one but two women who work at the same school as he does. The relationship between Victoria and the father of her baby is totally undeveloped. Russell Beckman, the high school athlete, bully, and pain-in-every-teacher's-neck is an overused stereotype. Maggie is a catalyst for moving the story forward but we really know nothing about her, except that she teaches at the high school and lives with her elderly father. Old Mrs. Stearns serves absolutely no purpose in the story. The McPheron brothers are the only characters I cared about at all.The book does paint an authentic picture of small town America. If you grew up in a small rural town, as I did, you know every one of these characters. But the book is much more like a painting than a story. We can see the characters, we see what they're doing, but we have no idea how they feel or what they think.I get the feeling that this book was written under contract, and that Haruf was paying much more attention to the deadlines of the contract than to the telling of the story."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I hated the fact that there were no quotation marks and I found most of the characters to be incredibly boring. Also, we never really learn much about what makes the characters tick. When teenage Victoria's mother finds out Victoria is pregnant she kicks her out of the house. Why is she so bitter? Guthrie's wife first stays in bed all day at home and later abandons her two small boys. Why does she behave this way? We never really have any answers in this book. The ending was particularly disappointing and vague. We know that Russ does something (I won't spoil the story for those who haven't read it), but we never find out if he is prosecuted for it. We know that Victoria has her baby, but we never even find out what the baby's name is. For a more entertaining book on small town life with equally unlikely relationships (strangers taking in teenage mothers, etc.)I would recommend Where The Heart Is by Billie Letz."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Mr. Haruf has written a novel that captures for us a big slice of small town humanity. The language is beautiful. I read alot of books, but rarely review them. The last time I was this touched by a book was A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY. You do not need to be from a small town to enjoy this book, or to understand it. In a time where cynicism and materialism have led us to forget the simple things in life, and the special bonds between individuals, Mr. Haruf has encouraged the herd to have another look. Kudos to Mr. Haruf, who I hope has a National Book Award waiting for him on that cool, autumn horizon."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong is an amazing novel not only for its compelling story, but for its memorable characters and prose as well. Mr. Haruf truly captures the feel of a place and its people with his wonderful writing style. The characters and their stories will stay with you long after the pages are read. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who likes to read, likes a good story, or appreciates the art of the written word. I will read Plainsong again, slowly, just to savor the words and images."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The vulnerability of Ike and Bobby Guthrie and Victoria Roubideaux; the decency of the McPheron brothers and Maggie Jones; and Tom Guthrie, whose life seems to be slipping out of control just as he's challenged to hold it together--these are characters you hope for and hope with. The Plainsong orchestrated by Kent Haruf in this novel is a melody of the connections that draw us together for the right reasons, even when life seems poised against us. This is a novel to share with family and friends. I know I won't forget my visit to Holt, Colorado."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Kent Haruf writes clear, concise, readable prose, and he has a good ear for dialogue. These are laudable attributes for a novelist. Plainsong is not, however, a laudable novel.Plainsong is about a school teacher who's wife has withdrawn into herself and subsequently moves away; the school teacher's two boys, 9 and 10, who apparently dont't actually need parenting, as their father is busy creating subplots to fill out the book; a high-school student who is kicked out of her house by her mother after she becomes (oh the horror!) pregnant; two old fart brothers with hearts of gold doing the bachelor farmer thing 17 miles out of town; and the plucky but irresistable female school teacher (doesn't EVERY novel have one of these) with eyes for the school teacher now this his wife has finally cracked up big-time.Read along as the author steers this wonderful menagarie of offbeat characters toward the novel's exciting conclusion, a shared dinner at the farm.Plot points to question. First of all, the end of the book--these characters are never all in the same place enjoying each other's company, but then, with no plot device to drive it, at the end of the book, they are. Why does the female school teacher even know the two reclusive, odd-ball farmers that live 17 miles out of town and only wear funny hats when they come into town? And why would she decide the giving the pregnant girl to these two old guys to care for would be a good idea? And, as a sidebar, who the hell is taking care of her aging father that she lives with whenever she's away? Her father is clearly suffering from senile dementia.Why does the man with the two boys automatically get invited into bed whenever he shows up at the door of any woman in town?Most of the subplots have nothing to do with the pace, tone, or plot of this novel. They apparently exist so the book will have enough pages to qualify as a novel rather than a short story.A good novel can be like an onion, with layers upon layers waiting to be peeled away to finally reveal the author's intentions. Plainsong is basically a reconstructed onion peel with nothing inside for the reader to discover.To save typesetting costs, all quotation marks have been removed from the dialogue. If the author had just taken it a step further and removed capitalization and punctuation, ee cummings would be rolling over in his grave.This is a well-written, miserably bad little book. I am baffled by its positive reviews here. Come on people, let's get past the author's skill as a wordsmith and recognize Plainsong's considerable shortcomings."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"A very quiet book, but quite moving. It's quite short, but it creates an entire world you are sad to leave at the end. It reminded me a lot of William Maxwell's So Long, See You Tomorrow (midwestern/western small town, small boys, familial upset) but where that ends in sadness, this ends in a sort of redemption. I liked it very much and would recommend it."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This is a sweet and sparely written novel -- Haruf doesn't waste words stating the obvious or on extraneous detail. What is is what is important, not what happened because of it or what caused it. Victoria's flat affect and lack of depth is important because of the effect it has on others and the story it brings together. She herself is neither here nor there. The dialogue between the McPheron brothers is worth the price of admission alone.This is not a book for folks who need to know exactly WHY everything is happening and how the characters are going to fare after the book ends. It is, simply, what it is and what it is is a poignant story about some hapless folks who come together as their lives come together."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I liked the author's relaxed story telling style and describing the characters a lot by their dialog. The lack of quotation marks bothered me for a while but I got used to it. What bothered me more was his frequent use of overlong sentences. For reading aloud this is an endurance test. It was a touching story in many ways--the way the two old bachelor farmers took in and tried so hard to take care of the 17 year old pregnant girl--the 9 and 10 year old boys who were practically motherless. I also liked the short chapters. A sensitive reader might not like some of the harsh (taboo) language and sexually explicit episodes but it seemed to fit the characters involved."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The characters in &quot;Plainsong&quot; are all very believable and real. Kent Haruf does an exceptional job telling us a story through vignettes of small town life. I listened to the book on CD in my car, and I have done what I never had done before; I brought the book inside so I could listen to it more in my home. The only downside about it is that it ended too soon."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This book reads quickly. It would be good for reading on an airplane. The story is extremely believable but there were few surprises and little character depth. Several scenes do stick in my mind: the girl and the two guys, the kidnapping of the two boys, and the autopsy of the horse. However, these were insufficient to make this book a great read. I compare this book to Barbara Kingsolver's or T. Coraghessan Boyle's or Comac McCathy's and it falls short. Those writers are better (at least based upon this one book)."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The only thing greater than my anticipation for reading this book was the disappointment I had after I finished. I had a few people tell me how much they liked the book. I had a hard time finding why they liked it. The characters had very little development. Only one of the characters got my attention - the pregnant teenager. I thought the characters and plots they were in were bland. Call me prude, but the book had way too many references to sex. And many of those references didn't seem important to the characters and flow of the book."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"In this entrancing gem of a novel, Kent Haruf draws the reader into a self-enclosed world of small-town hopes, fears, dreams, and conflicts. Writing in a simple, plainspoken style that is at once spare and highly descriptive, Haruf presents life on the plains by providing a series of vignettes involving a small but compelling cast of characters. These include a high school teacher and his two young sons, a troubled teenaged girl who faces the uncertainties of an accidental pregnancy, and a hardworking pair of elderly bachelor brothers who are more comfortable with their cattle than with other human beings.The stories that unfold in *Plainsong* are uncomplicated, and in the end, the conflicts and problems presented remain largely unresolved. Some readers might find this disappointing, but Haruf's aim here is to to weave a narrative that reflects the ambiguous realities of real life, rathen than to present a didactic morality tale with a &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending.To my mind, the most significant characters in the novel are the McPheron brothers, the aging bachelor ranchers who have spent their entire lives on the same plot of land. The brothers take in the pregnant Virginia Roubideaux, instruct the two young Guthrie boys in the ways of cattle ranching, and in general come to represent all that is good, hardworking, straightforward, and generous within the culture of the rural great plains. In some ways, in fact, their earnest, honest nature render them &quot;too good to be true.&quot;On the other hand, Haruf explores the darker side of small town life by presenting Tom Guthrie's wife as a hopeless depressive and by forcing Guthrie to face every teacher's nightmare, an evil-minded, disruptive student whose parents maintain that their child can do no wrong.The earnestly unadorned style of presentation is an effective vehicle for capturing the book's small town American subject matter. There are, however, aspects of the literary texture created here that are, in fact, unorthodox. The best example is Haruf's presentation of dialogue without any use tarditional quotation punctuation. This is no mere gimmick, as this innovation complements the rhythm and cadence of the writing, rendering the overall presentation more effective.Over three hundred enchanting pages, *Plainsong* succeeds in depicting a narrow, declining, and too-often forgotten slice of Americana. When I finished this book, I was truly sorry to see the story end."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Instead of discussing the novel's emotional and temporal arcs, or the specifics of characterization, I would simply like to take a moment to praise Kent Haruf for giving us a true book. By &quot;true&quot; I only mean to say that it became very clear to me even at the outset of the novel (I found the opening paragraph to be the most beautiful I've read since M. Ondaatje's In The Skin of a Lion), that Mr. Haruf had handed himself over to the place and time of this world, and also to the characters who moved within it. There is a sense in this book that the author did not attempt to marshall the attention of his characters to respond as he wanted them to, or to force them to act in a direction which he may have deemed most effective for the novel's trajectory; rather, Mr. Haruf has allowed himself to be humbled by the stories of his characters, to let them step forth with all of their plain raw vulnerable selves while he lingered only in the descriptions of the land, and did so in a manner as haunting and gentle as the true wind itself. For me, while it is a very self-contained novel, it is indeed of great importance in today's literature. It certainly deserves the National Book Award nomination it received. And while this is a contemporary novel, it distinguishes itself by not claiming any stylistic or contextual extremity that might afford it &quot;literary weight.&quot; In the end, this is a novel that is not won out of philosophical stance or syntactical complexity, nor by any radical point of view or temporal shift, but is rendered with a tremendously consistent quietude that is both peristent and meloncholy, and as necessary to the world it creates as it is to its maker."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in a very long time. It's quite amazing that a story about everyday lives is such a pageturner. I like how all the plot lines do not end neatly. There is closure to the book but, like life, the story goes on and lets the reader decide what happens from the book's official ending. The characters all feel &quot;right.&quot; They make mistakes and are as good as they can be within their own personal limitations. I like the way the author uses symbolism and juxtaposes scenes to comment on another: the birthing of the calves against Victoria's pregnancy. I am looking forward to the next book written by this very humane, decent, and kind author."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I thought this was a very good book. Like I said above there is a bit of a lull one third of the way but in my opinion it only slows down for twenty pages.This book is about the personal relationships between the people who comprise Holt, Colorado. It is about the love and caring and friendship they share with one another (and for some the hatred.) It explores some of the deepest recesses of the human heart and what people endure on an everyday basis.I really love the relationship that forms between Victoria Ribideaux and Harold and Raymond Mcpheron. Two old brothers who are hardened ranchers form a close relationship with a scared (but brave) young pregnant teenager and help see her through her pregnancy.I did like the storyline with Tom, Ike and Bobby Guthrie but I was enchanted even more by the Mcpherons and Victoria. Overall it was quite a good book."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The definition for Plainsong is: Any simple and unadorned melody or air. This definition fits PLAINSONG perfectly. It's about simple folks and their musical small-town lives in Holt, Colorado.PLAINSONG is divided into chapters named after the main characters. Tom Guthrie is an American History teacher with a clinically depressed wife.Ike and Bobby Guthrie are Tom's sons. They have a magical paper route that gives the reader a panorama of Holt and some of the mystical characters who live there. \\"They were nine and ten, with dark brown hair and unmarked faces, and cheeks that were still as pure and dear as a girl's.\\" You'll love these two; they'll so innocent and humble, you'll want to adopt them. They do steal their fathers cigarettes, however, and smoke them out in the country.Victoria Roubideaux is one of Guthrie's students. She's pregnant and her mother kicks her out of the house. One of her teachers, Maggie Jones, arranges for her to stay with the McPheron brothers, two old bachelor ranchers with hearts as big as Colorado. They're the real stars of the book.Guthrie's wife leaves him; he has problems with one of his male students, who takes a swing at him. The parents take the boy's side. There's a fight scene, during which you'll want to jump inside the book and take a few swings yourself.One of the most touching scenes is when the McPheron brothers go with Victoria to buy a crib for the new baby. There's humor, too. Victoria's worried about having hurt the baby. She's done some drinking and smoked some marijuana. To make her feel better, Raymond tells her about a heifer he had that swallowed a length of barbed wire and somehow managed not to hurt the calf. Later, Harold confronts him. \\"Where in the hell did you come up with that? I don't remember any such thing.\\"\\"I made it up.\\"\\"You made it up,\\" Harold said. He regarded his brother, who was staring out into the room. \\"What else you going to make up?\\"\\"Whatever I have to.\\"I skimmed over this book again to try do it justice. It took me four hours. I read over some of the scenes again, bawling like a baby. If this book doesn't make you cry, you haven't got a heart."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This novel was just simply amazing. The past few books that I have read were extremely dissapointing. Plainsong has been on my list of books to read for months, but until now I put other stories in front of it. I should have picked this novel first.The novel is not simply based on one character but a handful. Maggies Jones is a teacher in the small town of Holt, CO. She is close to and the sometimes girlfriend of fellow teacher and single parent Guthrie. Guthrie is raising two boys by himself because his wife leaves him and moves to Denver. Throughout the novel we gain the perspective of Guthrie's kids Bobby &amp; Ike. The last characters that grace the reader is a 17 yr old pregnant girl named Victoria Roubideaux. Her mother leaves her with no where to go, and she turns to Maggie Jones to help her. Maggie asks two elderly farmers to take Victoria in.This is a compelling novel, and I am greatful that I read it. I found myself laughing throughout the book because of the extremely comical situtations. A 17 yr old pregnant girl living with 2 elderly brothers can make for an interesting story.Kent Haruf brings an amazing story to light, and his characters are simply beautiful. They are all well rounded, and don't always make the decisions they should. This story is a true test of how one person can grow up without a close family, and in the end find the family they always needed through other people. The ending of this book brings all the characters together, and the reader will be able to see how their stories are linked. This is a feel good novel that helps the reader to understand that sometimes what we lack in life can be filled through people we least expected. Simply put, every day is a building block to something better. I couldn't put this down because I continually had a smile on my face when reading it. I would read this novel again."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"In the unbelievable space of two weeks, I have read two books to be remembered the rest of my life. First, I found The Earth Is Enough by Harry Middleton, then came Plainsong. Each book, in it's own way, gives life a meaning and shares with us the ties of plain and simple family folk. In a remarkable coincidence, each book tells in simple terms the importance of two old men in the future lives of the people they come to love and protect. The elegant portrayal of these men create pictures to be long remembered."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"As a countrywoman, I have to say Kent Haruf has written a surprising book. He nailed cows, and not many can these days. His stark accounting of the horse's death was sparce, but for those of us who know livestock the picture bleak was plain to see. The boys rode double afterwards, no instant gratification of replacement. The quiet and observing plains people bear study, these still waters truly run deep. Their actions speak volumes. Thank you Mr. Haruf, wisdom stares quietly at us from the pages of Plainsong."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"What struck me most was how &quot;right&quot; Haruf gets the essence of a small town (I grew up on a third-generation family farm just outside a small town of under 100 people, then went to high school in a town of 700 before moving to a megalopolis for college). Whether describing the rigorous monotony, broken by extraordinary events like a calf's breech birth, of farm life or the simple (but not necessarily uncomplicated) decency of Holt, Colorado's denizens, Haruf's prose rings absolutely true for me. Though the book's overriding theme is the search for family and continuity when traditional family structures have a)broken down or b)are non-existent, Haruf manages to sidestep easy sentimentality for something that feels like a very real yearning to connect his characters with one another. The McPheron brothers are wonderful creations - &quot;as good as men can be,&quot; in Maggie Jones' words - and their relationship with pregnant teen Victoria is a model of the book's fundamental decency and of Haruf's gift for spare, unembellished prose (Faulkner's sense of community crossed with American minimalism, minus the archness and irony, maybe). Maybe it's because I hear echoes of people I knew growing up in &quot;Plainsong,&quot; but the characters have stuck around in my head for weeks after finishing it. I read this back-to-back with Larry Brown's &quot;Joe&quot; and couldn't help but marvel at what two very different, very talented writers can do with stories that are similar at their core. A few professional reviewers have noted the book's tendency toward what might be termed 'triumphalism,' but I think it's ultimately beside the point. Haruf's book isn't about mortality or the enveloping darkness of the new Southern writers (Brown, et al); it's about the ties that we allow (and yearn) to bind us together."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Author Haruf works wonders in &quot;Plainsong,&quot; describing little people's lives in a very big way. My favorite characters were the McPheron brothers, two eroding farmers who allow a homeless, pregnant teenager to live with them on their country farm. The girl, Victoria, brings a warmth and happiness to their home they haven't experienced in years. Victoria's treks to civilization with the McPheron's on her heels lead to unruly, utterly compassionate and very funny responses by the brothers to the modern world. The other characters' stories are enticing as well, sparse yet filled with emotion. &quot;Plainsong&quot; is an intriguing, often comedic novel that's a fairly quick read and time well spent."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Haruf does a masterful job of storytelling with a prose which reminds me of Cormac MacCarthy. The dialogue amongst the characters is as powerful as you will find in any novel written in the last decade. This guy is a great writer and has found a way to weave a magical story for readers of all backgrounds and experiences. This is a great book!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"A superficial description might make this novel sound ordinary: a group of disparate people in various stages of their lives reside in a small Colorado town, interact, and undergo subtle, beautiful changes. Truly, that's a disservice. Kent Haruf is the real thing, a writer who sets out to tell some interlaced stories and does so in the most understated, compelling way. He doesn't write with an agenda or moralize. I'm always grateful for the rare occasion when a novel's deck doesn't feel stacked.Whether it's the pair of young brothers, their father (who at the book's beginning is seeing his marriage unravel), a pregnant high school student, or the two elderly brother farmers who live outside of town, Haruf draws them with much compassion and brings each and every one alive on the page. The author has an uncanny ability to enter into his characters' heads, so that although Plainsong is set in a small town, I felt like I'd traveled much farther. As far as contemporary American fiction goes, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This third novel from Haruf further establishes his place among the preeminent writers of western American fiction. I enjoy reading Haruf in much the same way I enjoy Wallace Stegner, for his depth of feeling for the land and the people who inhabit the places of his stories.This very understated but elegant novel, set in a small ranching town in the flatlands of eastern Colorado, is really several related stories intertwined and associated by a common bond of a struggle against the unsettling fates of life and a communal effort to achieve a common grace and compassion.In this story we come to know and quickly care about a string of characters-from a pregnant teenager, to the teacher who is raising his two sons alone after his wife deserts the family, to the two ranching brothers whose lives take on a new and deeper meaning in a most unexpected turn of events.This is a story worth reading and worth learning from. You will find yourself crying and rooting for its protagonists, and thinking about its players and meaning for days after finishing the novel."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"...but it's not the same one I did. Five stars aren't enough. Plainsong is a breathtakingly beautiful, spare, warm, funny, heartbreaking book. \\"Plot\\" seems beside the point. Who cares? The story is about people, their internal lives and the ones they share with the world, voluntarily or not. It's one of my favorite books of all time, one I've read and re-read at least 5 times, and it never disappoints. I recommend it anytime someone asks me for a \\"good book to read\\". Talk about an understatement. This story changes you. At least it did me."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"A warm , meandering story of the lives and emotions of simple people living day to day lives. Easy to connect with the characters as they face and work through their emotional ups and downs, and find the strenght to continue on with life and those they love. A well written, easy and enjoyable story."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This is a lovely tale of people in a small town who help one another get over bad times. The prose is beautiful. The story will give you faith in your fellow man."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong is the best book I have read this year. It is so well written. Kent knows how to write a book! It grabs you from the first page. I did not want to put it down, yet did not want to finish it. The character development is fantastic. I would highly recommend this book to fellow fiction readers!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This is a book that runs counter to our fractured hyperspeed society. It is tender. Full of sentiment without being sentimental. Plainsong is an artful piece of writing that has a pace that some can't wait for. Once it engulfed me, I was made to feel... at home. Thank you Kent Haruf."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong was a recent National Book Award Finalist. The book provides a peek into the world and struggles of a few characters in a rural community. Like Sue Miller in For Love, Kent Haruf narrates at a distance. As readers, we become fly-on-the-wall observers, with little omnicience into the characters' thoughts or motivations. The beauty of Plainsong, however, is that it wears no bright plumage to convey simple truths and touching moments. The book is so bare, that the author omits quotation marks to denote speech. The book uses very basic language structure, uncomplicated plot twists, and thus fails to compromise in its symbolic simplicity. The concept of \\"Plainsong\\" is that it is \\"any simple and unadorned melody or air.\\" Though the title is apt, the themes in this book are delicate, complex, and anything other than bare. It is a story of human beings struggling to come together and to help to heal each other's wounds.I found this book to be sweet, wise, and real. Slowly paced and shocking only in its realism, this book would not appeal to everyone. Would I recommend it? Yes. For whom? For those who seek the pure beauty of raw human interaction, humility, and grace. For those who like complex books with much action, it will probably fall a bit flat. Was it life changing? Well, yes, in a way. Even my reactions to this book are subtle. This books boils everything down to the building blocks of survival and happiness. It reveals Maslov's hierarchy in action by showing and not telling. This book helped to ground me and reminded me of what is truly important in my own life. Like my reaction to For Love by Sue Miller, my change in perception will hopefully change my actions as I stumble through each day."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I was in a reading rut. I had been reading historical fiction, burdened with hundreds of pages of excruciating detail. I was also reading current novels that were beginning to wear me down with unnecessarily complicated sentences (long introductory adverbial clauses) and repetitive words du jour (such as detritus, splayed and chrysalis)that appeared so often as if they were secret codes that readers were meant to divine. Then my wife suggested \\"Plainsong,\\" and I was immeditately captivated by its spare, precise, yet compassionate and compelling prose. Kent Haruf is a modern-day Hemingway, whose disarmingly simple sentences immediately draw the reader into the lives of simple people whose lives are fractured and frail. Haruf writes so purely and convincingly about these people that I could not put down the novel until its conclusion. Haruf achieves what other authors cannot hope to accomplish: That the simple narrative that rings true is always more difficult to write and therefore all the more satisfying to the reader. A must read."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The novel is exactly what it says it is, plain. The style reflects this with short and to-the-point sentences from the third person point of view. The lack of quotation marks keeps true to the style, but it can find the reader lost at times. Despite this, the novel gives the reader a good glimpse into small town life with characters that seem real enough to live next door to you. The problems they face are real too, not overly dramatized. Small town life is not so bad with neighbors like these. From the simple McPheron brothers to the young soon-to-be mother, Victoria, we see a bit of everyday life mixed with extraordinary characters. As far as the plot goes, the shifts in point of view are appreciated because we get into the lives of many different characters. However, there are moments when readers will become fascinated with one character, reading only the chapters that are about that character and leaving many gaps in the mind. The plot (or, rather, several sub-plots) reflects small town life without confusing the reader too much. The way the novel goes off in different directions keeps the reader anxious for the ending. The novel shows that despite the evil in life, good still triumphs, one way or another. You can choose to focus on the bad, but the characters in this novel who are good have the faith and determination to make it through the trials and tribulations that come with life."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"For me, some of the best writers are the ones who live by the &quot;less is more&quot; credo as Kent Haruf would seem to do. His simple, unadorned language is evocative of middle-America sensibilities and breathes life into the many different characters who make up this story, ranging from two abandoned young boys to a pregnant teenaged girl who goes to live with two aging, bachelor farmers, among others. Haruf passes no judgement on his characters and you too will grow to accept them exactly as they are, warts and all. That acceptance, after all, is what makes small town America go 'round and you'll want to visit Holt County again in another Haruf book."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I read this in three hours. The writing was compelling, as was the character development (until the very end). Guthrie, his wife and young sons are self-absorbed, as is Victoria. The brothers McPheron and Mrs. Maggie Jones are the only other-focused characters. I expected things to come together better at the end, instead of feeling like Haruf thought, &quot;ooh, 300 pages, I'd better end this NOW!&quot; It didn't make sense, and the end felt contrived. I didn't understand how they all got together in the final chapter (it would have worked better had it been called Epilogue instead of Holt). I was expecting maybe some kind of tragedy or something that would make the characters rally together and persevere, realize their commonalities, and find they needed each other. But everyone had their own life, and didn't take any initiative to make a difference. The end was a downer, and I'd expected to finish the book feeling good."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong is beautifully written. This book takes hold of the reader and never lets them go. Haruf weaves a story masterfully using a writing style that demonstrates urgency and peace. Through the story we start to feel for the characters, see their desparation, isolation and heartbreak. The development of Victoria and the McPherson brothers is the highlight of the book. It's been a while since I've read the book, but I still can't help thinking about the characters. One of my favorites."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"In this entrancing gem of a novel, Kent Haruf draws the reader into a self-enclosed world of small-town hopes, fears, dreams, and conflicts. Writing in a simple, plainspoken style that is at once spare and highly descriptive, Haruf presents life on the plains by providing a series of vignettes involving a small but compelling cast of characters. These include a high school teacher and his two young sons, a troubled teenaged girl who faces the uncertainties of an accidental pregnancy, and a hardworking pair of elderly bachelor brothers who are more comfortable with their cattle than with other human beings.The stories that unfold in *Plainsong* are uncomplicated, and in the end, the conflicts and problems presented remain largely unresolved. Some readers might find this disappointing, but Haruf's aim here is to to weave a narrative that reflects the ambiguous realities of real life, rathen than to present a didactic morality tale with a &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending.To my mind, the most significant characters in the novel are the McPheron brothers, the aging bachelor ranchers who have spent their entire lives on the same plot of land. The brothers take in the pregnant Virginia Roubideaux, instruct the two young Guthrie boys in the ways of cattle ranching, and in general come to represent all that is good, hardworking, straightforward, and generous within the culture of the rural great plains. In some ways, in fact, their earnest, honest nature render them &quot;too good to be true.&quot;On the other hand, Haruf explores the darker side of small town life by presenting Tom Guthrie's wife as a hopeless depressive and by forcing Guthrie to face every teacher's nightmare, an evil-minded, disruptive student whose parents maintain that their child can do no wrong.The earnestly unadorned style of presentation is an effective vehicle for capturing the book's small town American subject matter. There are, however, aspects of the literary texture created here that are, in fact, unorthodox. The best example is Haruf's presentation of dialogue without any use traditional quotation punctuation. This is no mere gimmick, as this innovation complements the rhythm and cadence of the writing, rendering the overall presentation more effective.Over three hundred enchanting pages, *Plainsong* succeeds in depicting a narrow, declining, and too-often forgotten slice of Americana. When I finished this book, I was truly sorry to see the story end."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"... even though I finished it three months ago.After reading so many average books, spending a few days with Haruf's breakout novel renewed my hope in contemporary literature.Yes, literature; for those who get bored without plot twists and clever, two-faced characters with extraordinary abilities, this book is too good for you.This is nothing more than a beautifully written account of a people you've probably passed on a two-lane highway. Their stories aren't magnificent, but are laden with enough conflict and personality to carry a simple plot line.I have told everyone I know about this book. It is refreshing and artistic.Plainsong is always warm, but never fuzzy."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I read this book after reading The Tie That Binds, and I have to say I was disappointed. Maybe because The Tie That Binds was so good. There are too many loose ends in Plainsong, and some of the story ideas seem that they would be unlikely to occur. There is an incident with Guthrie's two boys staying at the McPherson's farm that is unclear, as well as an incident with the boys and a young man that Guthrie is having trouble with. The relationship between the girl and the Mc Pherson's seems unlikely to occur. It was okay, but not great."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This was a very easy read book. Kent Haruf was able to capture the readers attention with his very descriptive writing. All though it was not exactly a book that you could not put down and stop reading, you felt like you knew each one of the characters personally.It is about the troubled lives of each family, or do you really consider it family since they seem to be falling apart. Each family is missing a family member. Ike and Bobby are abanded by their mother who won't even get out of bed. Victoria is a 17 year old high school student who is pregnant and her mom pretty much disowns her. Maggie Jones is a lonesome lady looking for a man. Guthrie has his boy, but lost his wife to depression. The Mcpheron brothers are bachelors who know everything about the ranch, but not too much about girls.This novel takes place in a small town where everybody knows everything about everybody's business. After reading the book you will feel like you can relate to all of these things."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I read this book and thought that it was a terrific book. It is a direct view into the life of an average person of all ages. Sometimes it made me laugh and some of it made me kind of sad. Coming from a teenager it compares to my life alittle bit. It was very well written and I understood it very well. There is alot of graphic seens in this book and I like that in a novel. I would not suggest this book to anyone younger than the age of sixteen. It expresses nudity and sexual content in this book but it is nothing to go ape over. Darn good book and I would recommend it to all people 16 and up."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I am a 17 year old senior in high school, and I read the book Plainsong for my english class. At first I found the book very confusing and I had a hard time staying interested in it. However, once I got farther into the book I began to really enjoy it. It was confusing at first because there was a variety of different characters that didn't seem to be connected in any way, and in each chapter you were reading about a different character. But once the book gets going you begin to see the connections of the characters, and you start to realize that you or someone you know is or has been in a situation like the one that you are reading about. The characters' stories are very relatable. For instance, there is a pregnant teenage girl, two young boys without a mother, a divorced teacher, and two lonely old men. Amazingly enough the author is able to bring all of these characters together, and draw the reader in to the point where you can feel like you are directly involved. I enjoyed this book, and I would recommend it to anybody, young or old. Just remember that it starts out kind of slow, so if you have to get into a book right away, this one's not for you."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"For such a wonderful, even uplifting story, it seems overly picky to quibble about the author's decision not to use quotation marks. However, so much of this story involves the give and take between characters, I found this peculiar punctuation to be irritating and sometimes confusing. What's the possible reason for this? Frank McCourt does the same thing in 'Tis and 'tis just as frustrating! Maybe it's the English teacher in me for 14 years, but I don't like it. Otherwise, I can say little more about the story than has already been said. It's fascinating and I have been enthusiastically recommending it to my classes and to my reading friends."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Complex novel of quirky, mostly-believable characters, the central trio being 2 quirky old bachelor brothers who take in a 17yo town girl who's been kicked out my her mother when her pregnancy is discovered. Deceptively plain language masks a complex view of the inter-relationships of the characters."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"What was that? The lack of quotation marks alone are enough to get on anyone's last nerve. I thought everyone learned how to use quotation marks back in the fourth grade, but Mr. Haruf obviously did not. The countless number of run-on sentences didn't help much either. I don't understand how it got the excellent reviews that it did. The plot was dull and it left me feeling as though it didn't end. Why did Guthrie's wife act the way she did and leave her little boys? Victoria's mother is introduced only to kick her daughter out of the house. I wanted to like Victoria's character, but she too proved to be just as boring as the rest. This book proved to me that just about anyone can get a book deal these days."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"It's no wonder that Plainsong was a National Book Award finalist! Haruf has written a very heartwarming story set in a small town in the High Prairies east of Denver in which seven members of the community -- spanning four generations -- come together in the face of great difficulties to form an extended family that we all wish we could have if necessary. While the story is a very simple one, Haruf tells it with great humanity, intensity and emotion. Further, his dialogue and narrative skills are so real you think you are right there experiencing first hand life in Holt, Colorado as the story unfolds. Do yourself a favor and put Plainsong at or near the top of your &quot;To Be Read&quot; list."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Haruf's homespun heroes are not mythic. They are salt of the earth characters who act decently and lovingly and with a sense of self too seldom found outside of towns like Holt, Colorado. They sing a plain song which will touch you. Like the story, the style is direct, spare and haunting. Buy it, it's a great way to start the new year."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Wow! This guy can write. And this is one terrific book The characters are simultaneously familiar and unforgettable. Don't waste your time with any more reviews. Go get a copy and start reading."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Haruf managed to capture people just the way they are, just the way they talk, in a way that I am only familiar with from the novels of Mona Simpson. And the descriptive level he achieves is remarkable: from describing the nausea of pregnancy to the feelings of eightyearold boys. This may have been the best book I read this year."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This is a small story which nonetheless had the potential to be deeply moving--except for the remote style in which it is told. The author keeps his characters way beyond arm's length and loses all immediacy and intimacy as a result. The absence of quotation marks strikes me not only an as affectation, but as a diminution of the characters' voices; it's as if they're whispering from a far-off distance. It's a heartwarming tale told cold."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I seldom read a novel more than once. Very seldom. But my dog-eared copy of \\"Plainsong\\" has been read and savored at least four times, and I'm looking forward to picking it up again on this blustery winter evening. Each of Kent Haruf's novels are treasures, and his characters are like gentle, trusted friends."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"After 100 pages I'd no intent on continuing. I've grown tired of the \\"poor rural barbarism\\" that permeates many novels recently.Yet wait. This review is a rave.I came back to the novel with a little hope and was rewarded. Where the first half focuses on people's cruelty, the second half rebounds with simple humanity and a true insight to how people can better the world ... not on a grand scale but for a few neighboring souls.This almost non-read becomes a great novel. It's a testament to Haruf's skill and trust in us to keep the faith."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Holt, Colorado, the town Plainsong is set in, may seem on the surface to be a quiet, peaceful little town, but of course some issues are simmering below the surface. High school teacher Tom Guthrie is a solid, reliable man, raising his two young sons, Ike and Bobby, but these days he must do it without the assistance of his wife. In her depression, she has retreated to the guest room to spend her days in darkness. Soon she will move out of town, leaving behind her two confused young sons.Then there is 17 year old student Victoria Roubideaux, who finds herself pregnant, deserted by the child's father and locked out of her house by her mother. Desperate, with no place to go, she turns for help to teacher Maggie Jones, who while herself dealing with an aged father who suffers from dementia, is a calm, strong force in our story. Maggie makes what at seems a very strange suggestion for the girl. She arranged for Victoria to move in with two elderly rancher brothers, Harold and Raymond McPheron. Orphaned quite young, they have spent their entire lived working the family cattle ranch, a good distance from town, never marrying. At first we may think it is an odd choice, but it seems Maggie understand somehow that providing a home for the girl will fulfill some void in the brother's lives as well. I must say that the McPheron 'boys' were simply delightful characters, so rough on the exterior and yet so sincere, so funny and ultimately oddly insightful.And finally we have Maggie. She cares for her father without complaint, is a teacher at the school and living a quiet life, yet it seems she has had her own unfulfilled dreams that may still come true. Her role in the book is not that big, but in a way she is the linchpin in the lives of all these folks.This is a rather slow, deliberate book, all these going-ons presented in a very straightforward and even at times, stark way, each characters presenting their own point of view in separate chapters. As all these lives begin to intersect, it never seems forced but rather just inevitable and very right. These are all people whose natural families have in ways been destroyed and yet come to form their own, new connections. This is a story about the day to day struggle of ordinary people to live their lives, to make a living and raise their families while trying to do what is right and deal with the trials life has given them with dignity.Plainsong is described in the opening of the book as \\"the unisonous vocal music used in the Christian church from the earliest time; any simple and unadorned melody or air.\\" Yes, simple and unadorned, all the various notes coming together to form a harmonious song, describes this book as well. Haruf's clean, direct and often very funny style is a pleasure to read. To a reader who has tired of one too many overblown, over elaborate books, the restrained writing is so refreshing to read. Plainsong is a moving, quiet and, at times, quite amusing book, with some memorable characters, a refreshing style and a story that will sneak up on you."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The landscape of Kent Haruf's Plainsong is flat, sandy, full of wheat and corn, and out in the open country, between the small towns, stands of trees surround lonely farmhouses. This is the same country that was so well portrayed in Willa Cather's novels and masterfully mapped by William Least Heat-Moon in PrairyErth. It is a dry land where the wind pushes what little Winter snow there is from farm to farm and where corn dries up in the Summer sun. It is here that they live, the people of the wonderful novel Plainsong.Victoria Roubideaux is in high school, pregnant but single, Tom Guthrie and his depressed wife are leaving each other, Maggie Jones steps in to rescue Victoria and gets involved with the searching high-school colleague Tom, while Guthrie's two boys get themselves into all kinds of boyish trouble and adventures, and the old McPheron brothers with their cattle and small farm end up taking center stage in the story about Holt, Colorado.Everything in Plainsong is moving at its own pace. People seem to go about their lives in a fashion crafted to play along with the landscape, rather than employing tactics to change the course of a force greater than themselves, and this is summed up well by Maggie Jones as she brings Victoria down to earth to accept what lies ahead of her: \\"Listen to me. You're here now. This is where you are\\".But where Cather or Erdrich or McCarthy would have emphasized unbearable struggles, human wickedness, or even pure evil, Kent Haruf seems to believe that people can find whatever kindness is within them and bring that out when society, unborn babies, frail old ladies, and everyone else need it. Now, that may sound rosy, even bordering on romance, and to be honest, Plainsong is far from romantic and very far from rosy. Holt is a community in social recession, and there is a somber tone to many a scene in the book which I can best describe by comparing it to how it feels standing in a brisk Kansas wind on a cloudy day on an absolutely flat expanse. Like Haruf says in another book, the photo essay \\"West of Last Chance\\": \\"It isn't pretty, but it's beautiful\\".Being a beautiful novel, Plainsong is also at times very funny. I mean, really ha ha funny. But since what makes us laugh depends on personal tastes I'll just quote a passage which I thoroughly enjoyed. It is from a scene where the two old, eccentric McPheron brothers want to cheer up the girl staying at their place, and so decide to buy her a crib for her unborn baby. But they come to a dead end when to question, Where to buy a crib?, arises. And so one of them calls their friend Maggie Jones:\\"When Maggie picked up the phone Harold said to her, If you was to buy a crib, where would you think to get it?Maggie paused, then she said, This must be one of the McPheron brothers.That's right. The good-looking smart one.Well, Raymond, she said. It's nice of you to call.That's not as comical a you think, Harold said.Isn't it?No, it ain't. Anyhow, what's your answer? Where would you buy a crib if you was to need one?I'm to understand that you don't mean a corn crib. You wouldn't have to ask me about that.That's right.I believe I'd drive over to Phillips. To the department store. They'd have a baby section.Whereabouts is it?On the square across from the courthouse.On the norh side?Yes.Okay, Harold said. How you doing, Maggie? You doing all right?She laughed. I'm doing fine.Thanks for the information, he said. Happy New Year's to you, and hung up.\\" (P. 176-177)While things in Plainsong seem to just happen they do not happen without drama. But drama happens unceremoniously in Plainsong. Fights, flights, deaths, births, love, hate. All extremes of the emotional continuum come into play in the novel, but they're played out so subtly that you easily fall into their slow moving rhythm which seems to acknowledge itself as itself. It is as if the language of the novel accepts fate and never accelerates to keep up with the drama. It seems to know that it is enough to describe the depths of human lives.Actually, the book reminds me of David Lynch's The Straight Story, where the peak of the drama occurs when the brakes on old Alvin Straight's lawnmower fail on a downhill drive, and Alvin is suspended somewhere between life and death for a few seconds. The Straight Story moves at about Plainsong pace throughout the movie, but Alvin's quest and his struggles to mend the relationship to his older brother still managed to get me deeply engaged in his life, just like I did with the lives of people in Plainsong."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Seldom was a book so well titled. Plains-song, the song of the high plains east of the Rockies. Plain-song, a simple story told exquisitely simply, using ordinary Anglo-Saxon words and quite devoid of purple passages. And plainsong, as in the worship of the early church, for Kent Haruf's portrait of the small-town life of rural America, though containing its share of stupidity and wrong, is in the end an act of worship.The core cast is relatively small: a pregnant teenager, two middle-aged bachelors living on an isolated farm, a high-school teacher trying to bring up two sons more or less on his own, and one of his female colleagues. These few characters drive the plot. Nothing happens that is really earth-shattering, but it is special because it happens to THEM. They are the ones who make mistakes and must try to rectify them; they are the ones who reach out in unexpected ways to others, linking this collection of rounded but disparate individuals into a caring community.Yet this is a book of contrasts. It can bring a lump to the throat with moments of warmth and kindness, but just when it risks getting sappy it takes a darker turn. The teacher who had seemed a pillar of strength is shown to have feet of clay; the teenager makes an almost disastrous choice on impulse; the young boys become victims of an act of wanton malice. The novel's theme and simple style should recommend it as a book for young adults, but the picture is by no means sanitized: the doctor offers the young woman the option of aborting her baby, and there are scenes involving drugs or promiscuity. Haruf's belief in the fundamental goodness of human nature is rooted in realism, and is the stronger for it.One measure of the strength of this book is the degree to which it made me aware of its literary pedigree. There is an obvious debt to Thornton Wilder's play,OUR TOWN. And, moving westward, toWINESBURG, OHIOby Sherwood Anderson,GILEADby Marilynne Robinson, orTHE RED PONYby John Steinbeck. For me, these books stand as a personal touchstone for one of the richest and most humane strands of American writing. I am thrilled to be able to add Kent Haruf to such a list."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I've read this book four or five times and its spare, delicate voice moves me every time. I feel myself connect with the characters, care about them all over again, through the space Haruf creates with language -- as stripped and sometimes desolate as the Colorado plains themselves. Haruf's ability to juxtapose life's harshness (divorce, violent or natural death, getting bullied into growing up) with incredible tenderness, as with the Victoria-McGuthrie subplot, is remarkable. I adore this book, just adore it."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"i absolutely loved this book. after i finished it, i bought the follow-up, eventide, and i loved it as well."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK. It captured me. The writing is poetic and the characters are realistic. The story is one you can picture and feel part of. I enjoyed how Haruf made parallels between unlikely characters in this small town. There is a sequel to this book, called Eventide. Also, there is a movie of this book that you can rent and watch after reading it. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I read this book for my bookclub. Wonderful story, deep and moving with a real life element. I really love the characters."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I got this book from my school library and started it as I waited for my friend to finish football practice. By the end of the hour or so practice, I had read one hundred pages into it and just could not put it down.The first thing that probably captivated me was how quickly the story dove into something extremely serious, like a teenager finding out she was pregnant. I enjoyed how it switched from dramatic and depressing story to another of that likeness. I have read novels like that before, where it switched from character to character and then all the stories connected in the end, and I never liked them. But this novel was exceptional.One aspect which I really enjoyed was the quality of descriptive writing. This was the first novel I had ever read that had such excellent writing.The thing about this novel that most people probably do not enjoy is that the characters don't have much depth to them. Personally, I thought it was very effective and it kind of kept you as an outsider looking in, which seemed to be the point. Also, some people think there is no plot. There is a plot, but it seems that the authors intention was just to give the reader a quick glimpse into these people's lives. Keeping them as alien as possible and the story is vague as possible, in my mind, had a very good effect.The reason I did not rate is as a five star novel is because it did not leave any impressions on me. I am very picky with my five star ratings, and this story did not stick with me or exactly keep me thinking.I finished this book (very pleased that the ending was a lot happier than the rest of the dreary story had been) and immediately went out and bought it to add to my collection of favorite books. I've lent it to a lot of my friends already and very much enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. Overall, I enjoyed it and am impressed with the writing. I think it's amazing that an author can keep your interest when so little \\"action\\" occurs. This is a story about human relationships. On the downside--with the exception of the McPheron brothers, there is little to no character development. There is very little physical description of the characters as well and so it's hard to picture them. In short, although I enjoyed the book, I don't know the characters any better at the end of the book than I did at the beginning."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"For any child who has felt lost or absent in the context of their own family life, Kent Haruf's Plainsong is a breath of fresh air. While many facets of Haruf's novel are touching and reveal his knack for psychological insight, it is the plotline following the two Guthrie brothers, Ike and Bobby, that appears to overflow with authorial empathy and understanding.Ike and Bobby, two brothers aged nine and ten, maintain a quiet exterior that to some seems overly adult and calm, especially in the face of death. It is only when faced with a great unknown, like sexual deviance, that the boys become anxious or fearful. If Plainsong feels emotionally insightful, why does Haruf's characterization of Ike and Bobby appear prematurely mature?Any child of a \\"broken\\" home - a group less culturally adapted to the role of the modern ideal family - could answer this immediately. Haruf's characterization of Ike and Bobby are certifiable spot-on excellence because children forced to live like \\"little adults\\" often maintain a mature composure even in the face of horrendous awakenings. Their childlike adoration and acceptance of their estranged mother seems incongruous with the courage they display while watching an autopsy of a horse, and yet it is here that the reader can see Haruf's subtle characterization at work. Ike and Bobby are simultaneously adult enough to work (by way of a paper route) and young enough to make choices that reflect naivete and innocence (buying brown eggs to match brown sugar).These subtleties in characterization bring Plainsong to life. The novel is structured in a precise way for the reader to sympathize and love nearly every character that is featured. Characterization is a major strength for Haruf, and his novel reflects his attention to character psychology and emotion.This novel was a joy to read, breathtaking in imagery and heart-wrenching in plot. I would highly suggest it to anyone with a spare couple of hours to be amused, frightened, upset, and content."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Like others I have to agree with the punctuation. He may have been in a hurry. I felt a little lost in the beginning when the mother was still living at the house. The next thing I read she was living on her own. I must have missed the move. I had to go back and read the chapters over to make sure I did not miss anything. Even with the confusion, I still enjoyed the book very much and have passed it along to family and friends to read. I would still recommend it to anyone to read. Anyone but a Grammar teacher. They would tear it a part!!!!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"In many ways, this book reminded me of &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;. &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; was somehow a richer reading experience than &quot;Plainsong&quot;. (The only problem with &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; was that it's end was too rapid). &quot;Plainsong's&quot; characters were interesting, yet not solidly developed. The ending left me with the feeling of. . .&quot;okay, so what was the point?&quot; This book was, by far, not the best that I have ever read, but it did manage to hold my interest to the very end. I just wish I could have found the same inspiration that others have reported:)"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Like a plaintive wail, this book resonates with a simple and honest beauty that strikes the soul of the sensitive reader. The beauty is in the stark simplicity and the ease it is to visualize the characters so frankly revealed. This is a work of genius, a work where less is more, and the relationship of land to man offers extraordinarily significant reflections.Those that are portrayed are etched firmly in the reader's mind. Each are struggling with hardships and begin to intersect and connect so that the plot takes on an immensely hopefull tone, one that is not stretched beyond one's endurance, but so sweet and lovely that the joy of the story is indeed your reward."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It starts slowly with disconnected stories. As it builds character development and speed, the stories become intertwined. I like stories like this anyway, but this is better than most.

A good read."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This is the best book I've read in several months (in 2000). So warm and tender. One of the rare books I hated to see come to an end.

Because it is unmediated, even unto the absence of quotation marks, this song reaches our senses like direct experience and lingers, to nourish our spirits."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I enjoyed Kent Haruf's &quot;novel,&quot; but I tend to agree with some of the other readers here that I was more impressed with Haruf's spare imagery and spot-on dialog than the rather pedestrian plot. Haruf is a good storyteller, problem is, the story doesn't really go anywhere. The characters are well-drawn, however, and I found myself wanting to learn what happens (or doesn't happen) to them.I was confused by one section of the book involving the boys and an elderly neighbor on their paper route. I may have been making too much of an effort to tie everything together.I would recommend the book, but you may want to keep your expectations low. It was a pleasant book, plain and simple."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The only problem with this one is deciding whether to plough on through this potential page turner or to savor every word. This is the kind of book you miss when you've finished it. The characters are drawn in such a compelling way that they linger; you may catch yourself wondering how they're doing today, like old friends, weeks after you finish your too brief time with them."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This had the same quality as &quot;Snow Falling on Cedars&quot;--the atmosphere was so much a part of the story. Having lived in a rural area of the country for 13 years, I felt as if I knew each of the characters. It's a love story like nothing I've read before."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I enjoyed this book more than expected.

Read this."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I finished this book last night and proceeded to have a good cry. Now, whether this was due to joy or sadness, I'm not sure. In a way, I was sad the book had come to an end. It was wonderful how the human spirit prevailed and lost souls found one another. In a way, this book reminded me of the movie &quot;As Good as it Gets&quot; in the way that everyone needs that connection. You will root for these characters and wish them the best......I only hope that he writes a sequel!"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I was enchanted by this book. The writing and story development may very well be described as plain. No fancy words, no complex psycological character development; just powerful, straight story telling. Wonderfull"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Written in simple, clear and generous prose, &quot;Plainsong&quot; shares with us the story of three seasons, early fall to late spring, of the eastern Colorado plain and the good and bad people of Holt. I will remember for quite some time the stories of Victoria Roubideaux, 17, pregnant and abandoned by her bitter mother, but taken in by the schoolteacher, Maggie Jones, and then the square, puzzled, but overwhelmingly generous and compassionate McPheron brothers, bachelors in their 60s; the 9- and 10-year olds, brothers Bobby and Ike Guthrie, learning about the truth of life and death, life's challenges, confusion and, occasional ugliness. Then there is Tom Guthrie, father of Ike and Bobby, and the quietly strong, caring, but ultimately understanding husband of Ella. She exists in her own largely silent and withdrawn world. She moves out, eventually into the big city. He moves on with his life. This is a wonderful story of truth, understanding, compassion, love and the countryside. Well-worth reading."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I started reading Plainsong last evening and read until sleepy. A barking dog woke me up at 12:30 and I decided to read a few more pages before falling back asleep. The next thing I knew I was turning the last page and it was 3:45 in the morning. Haruf's affection for his characters, especially the McFerond brothers, won me over completely. I agree with Richard Russo's statement on the back cover that it was the best book he's read this year. A wonderful, memorable reading experience."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Like the pace of small towns themselves, this book slowly draws the reader in until one cares so deeply about the characters that you do not want to let them go.The authenticity of the action and the townspeople was such that I , living in a similar community, felt like I was evesdropping on neighbors."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The lack of quotation marks rather threw me when I began reading this book, but since I have a tendency to read too fast, I slowed down and now feel I got more out of this book by concentrating. I too wish the author had delved a little more deeply into the characters' motivations, but nevertheless I loved this book and jumped right into \\"Eventide\\" which I had purchased at the same time. I now have Mr. Haruf's other two books and will quite now and start reading them."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"An enjoyable read, \\"Plainsong\\" compassionately looks at the verities of life - the good and the bad. Haruf writes with a directness that is also graceful, displaying a kind understanding of \\"everyday\\" life's sometimes harsh realities.This book has been adapted into a movie. I just saw a commercial: \\"Plainsong\\" airs Sunday, April 25th on CBS. This book isn't treacly/sentimental and I hope that will be true of the \\"Hallmark Hall of Fame\\" special on CBS. The casting of Aidan Quinn and Rachel Griffiths is promising."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"here's a story of the country, a story where people birth cattle, use tree trimmers to perform an autospy on a horse, and live lives as plain yet parodoxically complex as the wind. it's a fine story, character driven; the plot does no spectacular turns; it's soft, gentle.the one problem i found is that the character guthrie could also be one of the mcpheron brothers. they're not quite as distinct as i like characters to be.it's a quick read, and worth the time; you'll feel like you've just taken a drive in a convertable through the western plains."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"this book was one of the best i've read in years; the character development was excellent with a poignancy seldom written today."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Through different tragedies the characters in Plainsong come together to form non-traditional families. In Kent Haruf's book there are four characters that the story revolves around. They are Ike, Bobby, and the McPheron brothers.You can see the non-traditional family with the McPherons. They take in a young girl that is pregnant. These brothers know nothing about young girls and they do not understand all of the things she does, so they have to ask Maggie Jones if the things she is doing are normal for girls to do. The reason the McPherons know nothing about young girls is when they were young their parents died so the brothers just started working on their ranch and never did anything else. They are very caring people and they try to help others in any way they can.The other two characters the story goes around are Ike and Bobby. They are two young boys that are brothers. Their mother has a lot of problems so she has moved out of the house. Their dad is Guthrie, a teacher at school. These boys are very responsible. They have a paper route and, they also have horses they ride and take care of. Their town is a small one so they are able to ride their bikes all over town; they are always together. In the story they become friends with an old lady, who they deliver the paper to. They go to the old lady's' house and make cookies with her. They share the things that are going on in their life with her.Plainsong is an easy reading book, with an interesting way of dividing chapters. Instead of numbers the chapters have the characters names. The book doesn't use very many adverbs leaving the reader to imagine how the characters are reacting to the situations. When you read plainsong it is easy to relate to the story because, Kent Haruf has captured that small town feeling."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The novel Plainsong is written by Kent Haruf. Kent Haruf is a college teacher and also has written two other novels titled, The Tie That Binds, and Where You Once Belonged.The novel Plainsong is set in a small town named Holt Colorado. The novel talks about a whole bunch of different characters that you would normally find in a small town. The main characters are two young boys named Ike and Bobby, and their father is Tom Guthrie. Ike and Bobby are about nine and ten years of age. Tom Guthrie is a schoolteacher at the local high school. Their mother has left the home to live by herself so she can figure out what she wants to do with her life. The other main character is a young teenage girl named Victoria Roubideaux that has become pregnant and is kicked out by her mother and has to go to the aid of local friends for help. Maggie Jones keeps her for a while and then takes her to the McPheron brothers. These two men are old and live together and have never married.I think the theme of this story is that Non-Traditional families are sometimes better then traditional families. In this story there is only one traditional family and that's the Beckman's. The non-traditional families come together and kind of have one traditional family. They don't have the tie of blood to keep them together but they come together and learn to love one another and care for each other.A very good book that anyone can enjoy, there are usual circumstance's that take place and are very real and true. Haruf goes into great detail and you feel like you are actually in the town and experiencing it for yourself."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Plainsong is a story about a community of people who are in untraditional families, and pull together during the rough times to become a family.

It's a simple story about a number of people whose lives seem somewhat interwoven with one another, yet the intensity and the beauty of Haruf's prose is what makes this book a fantastic read. Haruf portrays each character deeply and intricately; it is almost impossible not to feel Victoria's confusion with the idea of having a baby just as it's impossible not to feel a giant wave of sympathy for Maggie and the McPheron brothers. Ike and Bobby make you feel like you would want to adopt them and you end up pitying lost teenagers like Dwayne. Excellent book."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This book, although kind of slow on the uptake, was one that really makes you think. You are reading about the position of various characters in a small town in Colorado, usually the situation the are in is not a fun one. A pregnant teenager, old farming spinster brothers, a lonely school teacher who has recently split with his wife, and his two sons, throughout the book, these characters experience a number of unpleasant things, and at the conclusion of the book, you are forced to feel for them as you think, &quot;What if that happened to me?&quot;"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"For those who have never lived in a small town, especially a farming one, this story could seem unreal. People living apart but then coming together does not happen in many communities where neighbors disappear when the garage door closes. But for those who have seen acts of kindness arise from people and places you might not expect, Plainsong rings quite true. Yes, there are middle-aged men who would take in a pregnant girl without thoughts of lust. There are boys who would look forward to time spent with an odd old lady. There are still people in this world willing to join hands with those who might have nothing to offer but a hand in return. This book was wonderful--though a few of the farm animal scenes were too graphic for me--and I would recommend it to anyone with a belief in human fraility and redemption."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Looks like mine is the 178th review of Plainsong; if that fact alone doesn't convince someone to purchase this warm novel, I don't know what will! My wife purchased this book and I couldn't help but get hooked on it very quickly. Why? Very simple; the characters. Haruf's writing had me caring immediately about all the book's characters and what happens to them. What I think he does well though is how he gently ties all the characters to each other. When this happens, you are given enough time though to understand and appreciate each one. Very good book; I will look for others by this author."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I loved this book. I stayed up all night reading it because I cared so much about the people, I could not put it down. I haven't done that since I was a child. After a lifetime of reading, I'm aware how rare this kind of experience is. And the reason? Kent Haruf's honesty, skill, and compassion as a writer. Bless him."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Although &quot;Plainsong&quot; is set in eastern Colorado, it could be West Texas or small town Iowa. The characters are true to the feel of life in the backwaters of the United States. I started by listening to the audio tape &amp; finished by reading. The voices of the McPherron brothers were especially distinctive on the audio version, but the reader does a fine job of bringing all the characters to life. The heartbreak of not knowing why your family is breaking up or the fear of moving in with strangers is totally real. I laughed out loud at the harsh portrait of the Beckman family in the principal's office--so true, so true in a society that tolerates anything from athletes. In the hands of a writer like Stephen King, this story could have been over the top--all secrets revealed with a sensational ending scene with the Beckmans. But Haruf has done something far more remarkable. He has dared to offer the hope of healing for damaged souls."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"The simplicity of the prose is perfect for both the setting and the story.

The McPherson brothers, Victoria, the pregnant teen who comes to live with them on their farm, Guthrie and his sons, and all of the other characters are as sharp and true as a snow storm on the high plains. Thank you, Mr. Haruf, for an unforgettable reading experience."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"This is one of the strongest and most winning stories I have ever read. From its first page it takes the reader into a world that is lost but not forgotten. An elegy to how people should treat each other, a fictional self-help book for the new millenium, and an exquisite piece of literary craft, this is one of the most assured and astonishing fictions of our time."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I first read Plainsong several years ago, and reading it again now reminds me of how much good book is like meeting an old, cherished friend. Much is the same, but there are always new things to discover. Set in Holt, Colorado, outside Denver, this character-driven novel plays out in cold weather, an oppressive cold that seeps into the reader as well as the characters.It is told by four sets of characters, third person: Guthrie, a high-school teacher, his two sons, Ike and Bobby (9,10), Victoria Robichaux, a pregnant teenager and the two McPheron brothers, ranchers in their fifties who have known little but cows and each other. When they take in the pregnant teen-age girl, whose mother has thrown her out of the house, their clumsy but warm-hearted attempts to make her feel at home are most touching.The author's prose is flawless, smooth and seamless. He eschews quotation marks, but his dialogue blends so easily with the rest of the narrative that they hardly seem necessary.There is a warmth and generosity in this book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Kent Haruf's third book is disappointing in its lack of characterization and distracting episodic presentation. It suggests at best lazy authorship and at worst a writer whose primary motive is profit driven.Neil Simon, the New York playwright, tells the story on himself that Walter Kerr in a New York Times review in December 1966 wrote of Simon's play &quot;The Star-Spangled Girl&quot;, &quot;Neil Simon didn't have an idea for a play this year, but he wrote it anyway.&quot; This assessment wouldn't be far from the mark with regard to Haruf's &quot;Plainsong&quot;.The characterizations of all the individuals, major as well as minor are remarkably shallow. Haruf seems to have little interest or ability in describing the forces motivating the people occupying his pages. Tom Guthrie a school master who is the father of two small boys whose mother seems unable to cope with the marriage - the interplay of husband and wife which leads to the domestic breakdown isn't dealt with. Similarly the motivations and preoccupations of the 17 year old pregnant Victoria or the two elderly brothers prevailed upon to take her in don't seem to occupy Haruf's interest. It's as though you are watching inanimate puppets being manipulated by a somewhat disinterested puppet master. It is no different for every other character in the book.So for example compare Kazuo Ishiguro's housekeeper Miss Kenton and the butler Stevens in the &quot;Remains of the Day&quot; and the fullness of their portrayals, their motivations and their fears with Haruf's Guthrie, Maggie Jones or Victoria Roubideaux. Why choose Ishiguro's people for illustration, because they are an exquisite example of the portrayal of &quot;ordinary people&quot; with remarkable appeal that demands the readers attention and involvement.Where Haruf transcends mediocrity is in his description of the farm scenes, handling the cattle when they require inoculation, or coming to grips with an ailing horse.Some novels are clearly written with the view of a screenplay in mind, this one seems to have a television soap opera in its sights."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I know this book won awards and I have read the review of others who really liked it but I have to say that I found it lacking. It seemed very slow to get into anything (I guess kind of like the characters themselves). I had to fight to continue to read this novel until more than half way through. At that point the characters began to peak my interest and I guess there was a certain curiousity as to how things would turn out. Perhaps because I don't have any experience of a small town in the west I couldn't quite deal with the pace of the storyline. Most times when I finish a book I hate to leave the characters, I want to remain in their lives and continue to see where life takes them. I didn't really care about these folks and I'm not quite sure why. The story just didn't grab me."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"What a shame! This book could have been so much more if the author wasn't so impressed with his own writing style. It was filled with two dimensional characters and overused ideas. The oddities the characters had were much too contrived. This guy can obviously write a book but praising him this early will only do his career more harm than good. Let's save the praise for when he really deserves it. Hopefully this won't be his best book. Looking forward to a maturing writer."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I thought this was a very poorly written book. First of all, we've developed grammar and punctuation in our language so that writing is easier to understand. How is Haruf a university professor when he doesn't even know how to use commas or quotation marks? I found it tiring and annoying to read his grammatically incorrect drivel. Second, I didn't like that there was really no plot to this &quot;story.&quot; I followed along, constantly hoping that the interesting bits would turn into a story (such as *why* Mrs. Guthrie was depressed, what was Maggie Jones' story, *what* problems did Victoria Rubideaux's mother have, etc.), but they never did. Third, I believe if a person is going to write a novel, she or he should spend some time developing the characters. Haruf presents us with two sets of brothers that are indistinguishable from one another: Ike and Bobby, and Harold and ... I can't even think of the other old guy's name. Ike and Bobby are exactly alike and even look like twins. Harold and the other old guy also seem to think and act the same and don't have any individual characteristics. What a bore! And finally, fourth, I just didn't like the &quot;effect&quot; the author used of describing everything from a distance. I never had a sense that I knew or understood or even really empathized with the characters. I just kind of watched them from afar, and like this whole book, didn't find them to be all that interesting."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I picked up a copy of Plainsong because it was described as \\"uplifting\\" on the cover. I forced myself to finish it, waiting to soar, but in the end only appalled by how pointless it was.I would hesitate to call this a character study, since two lead characters (Victoria Roubideaux and Maggie Jones) seem to completely lack any personality whatsoever. Victoria wanders through the novel like a stunned ox. I wondered what era she was supposedly from, lacking any knowledge of what is a reality for far too many teenagers today-- teen pregnancy. I learned more about that subject in Madonna's three minute pop song \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" than in this entire novel.Haruf displays an apparent knowledge of ranching, in lengthy and gruesome detail. Not only was this not uplifting, it made me wonder just what sort of reader would actually read every word of a grotesque description of an autopsy on a horse.If he knows ranching, Haruf apperently only has a Reader's Digest understanding of the teaching profession. When a male high school student misbehaves, the teacher, Tom Guthrie, takes him out into the hall and slams him up against the lockers. Please. This may have been the norm when Haruf went to high school, but is wild fantasy in today's litigious American classroom atmosphere.Add to all this a gratuitous and improbable sex scene, and you have an aimless, pointless novel with about as much intelligence as the McPherson brothers, who were apparently so named because their IQ's are the same as the McPherson struts on your car."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I'm sure there are people who really enjoy this novel, particularly if you want to make parallel connections between characters that eventually end up together like at the end of a TV movie.

It takes place in Colorado's High Plains Country, east of Denver. Mr. Haruf does an excellent job describing day to day life in a small high plains town. This is a rough edged little town. Holt, Colorado is a small country town surrounded by ranches.This is a story partly of family alienations. There are seven main characters.Young brothers, Ike,ten, and Bobby, nine, are two young brothers. Their mother is suffering from depression, stays in bed all day, has no interest in life. She moves to Denver to stay with her sister to get away from her family. The boys take a trip to Denver to visit their mother. The visit does not go well and is cut short. They return home earlier than planned. Then an elderly lady who is a customer on their newspaper route and who Ike and Bobby consider a friend is found dead in her apartment.Tom Guthrie is a high school American History teacher, a good man who is having too many problems. He must be mother and father to his two young sons plus care for his sick wife. He also has to deal with high school students with their arrogance, bad attitudes, aggressive behavior, raging hormones plus these kids irate parents who feel this man is mistreating their babies. These young people are threating to harm Tom's boys.Victoria Roubideaux is part white, part Indian. Her father has deserted, her mother constantly berates her, comments on her Indian father. Then Victoria becomes pregnant, goes home one day and finds herself locked out. Her mother doesn't want her home ever again. She is just a trashy Indian just like her father. She has to put up with her classmates taunting her about her pregnancy.Maggie Jones is another Holt High School teacher who admires Tom Guthrie for the good man he is. Victoria runs to her house. Maggie takes her in but she can't stay because the teacher is caring for her elderly father who has Alzheimers. The old man becomes frightened by a stranger so Victoria must go.So Maggie takes her to stay with the two elderly McPheronbrothers, Raymond and Harold. These two own a ranch out in the country, work very hard and go into town rarely. Both are good hearted and take the young girl into her home and come to consider the young girl as a grandaughter and look forward to the coming baby. The Guthrie boys and their father go to the ranch to help. The McPheron brothers pay Ike and Bobby. Their father thinks they have been overpaid. This is between us and the boys the McPherons tell the father.The book ends with these people coming together for a Memorial Day Picnic. Plus these seven there are two more, Maggie Jones elderly father plus Victoria's babygirl. This is a bunch of people who care for each other. Lovely ending"},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I was enchanted by this book at the outset. I loved the prose. I initially loved the characters. I thought the scene where the little boys observe teenagers sharing a single women stunning. That one chapter could have been a short story, and maybe he should have stopped there. That chapter said so much about youth, character, abuse, self-loathing, that it was complete. After reading it, I was even more thrilled at the prospect of diving into the book. Unfortunately, the further along Haruf went, the less focused he seemed to be. The characters all became less interesting as the story progressed, maybe, even, a little bit, the young boys, who were by far the best characters. I found the high school boy, who was the bully, to be stereotypical, and I just didn't buy how Guthrie and the town dealt with him. I also resented the fact that this drama just drifted out of the story, unresolved. This was symptomatic of the problems with the book. Characters lightly sketched, whose motivations were unclear, and who really weren't too interesting. I would put Tom Guthrie, a main character, right up there in the boring category. Really, there were two types of characters: morally upright and sleazy, all two-dimensional, and the morally upright were almost buried by their goodness. I give it three stars because I loved the setting, the chapters with the little boys were almost all great and worth reading, and at least for the first half, I like the prose style."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"I wonder if he'll do as I did (and as several other reviewers did also) and stop reading after about 100 pages?The missing quotation marks didn't bother me, neither did the run-on sentences. And -- in the beginning -- I was entranced by the prose.I began to sour on the book when it seemed that another author had taken over the writing of the second half: the prose became cloying, the plot twists were predictable, and I imagined it becoming a template for a schmaltzy made-for-TV movie.Soon after, I put it down, half-finished, and eventually put it into the stack of books headed for the library's sale.A big disappointment."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"For a regular, old novel, it's pretty good.

No, this book was more about the cruelty of life, but the characters seem to run and hide from their problems instead of confront and conquer them.I know, I know I &quot;get&quot; the &quot;plainsong&quot; idea.

Unfortunately unlike truly great writers, he is unable to convey the depths of character without subjecting readers to the forms of writing usually reserved for cheap romance novels. The graphic sex scenes are gratuitous and one must wonder about Mr. Haruf's voyeuristic tendancies. I read this because it is required reading for my sophomore son. It is certainly not appropriate reading material for a 15 year old, or for anyone really. If it had been a great story I could have tried to overlook the tawdry nature of the writing, but no such luck. Do yourself a favor. Skip this one."},{"Title":"Plainsong","review":"Hmmpphhh...

We have a dad separated from his mentally-ill wife. We have high school tuffs experimenting with sex in abandoned houses. We have young boys witnessing the sex act while peeking in a broken window.Moreover, Haruf's writing style is straight-forward and rivetting. Using no quotation marks, he blends thoughts with conversations, describes scenes with exactness and builds emotional drama and trauma until the very end.While not a thriller, this novel propels readers forward through a morass of sticky social situations while capturing our hearts.Definitely a \\"can't put it down\\" story.Larry Rochelle, author of GULF GHOST, BLUE ICE, GHOSTLY EMBERS and SIREN SORCERY"},{"Title":"The End Of August","review":"\\"The End of August\\" is a very moving historical novel that details Midwestern farm life in the early part of the 20th century. Told from the perspective of the author's grandmother, the book follows the reminiscences and dreams of 96-year-old Anna as she contemplates various events in her life. These rich, descriptive accounts transport the reader back to the horse-and-buggy era, vividly depicting numerous aspects of farm and small-town living: births, deaths, joys, hardships, hard work, celebrations and day-to-day activities. Charles Lindbergh himself even makes an appearance in the book. The author possesses the rare ability to evoke emotional, half-forgotten memories in the reader; don't be surprised if you find yourself thinking of your own grandparents and relatives. \\"The End of August\\" is a well-written, nostalgic look back at the hardships, sacrifices and triumphs of previous generations.

Tom Brewer's book was a wonderful read. It brought back many memories, and I was pleasantly surprised by how well it was written. There is no stumbling through this book; you're quickly drawn into Tom's life and his experiences. And though all of us have unique experiences in life, Tom's memories are often similar to mine. I felt myself agreeing with Tom's expressions of patriotism in the 50s, the desire to &quot;serve our country&quot; for what it had given us, the need to &quot;make up&quot; for a relative who hadn't served in World War II, and the desire to help others and follow a code of behavior which was admired. I, too, was an officer in the US Army, stationed in the Mekong Delta, in a combat branch, though fortunately not in face to face combat. Tom helped me to feel what he felt and I strongly recommend the book to anyone wishing to participate in the Vietnam war and times through his first hand experience.Though I respect Tom's experiences and commend him for his service, I can't say I agree with his conclusions about the War. However, that is what made the Vietnam era so very interesting and challenging. Every soldier's experience in Vietnam was somewhat different and each person's war was different, too. Some soldiers came home saying as Tom did, we could have won &quot;if only&quot;, and others came home saying this war wasn't ours to win or lose, it was the South Vietnamese's. The same issues argued about in the United States were often spoken by the soldiers who served there. But the overall feelings of this war were well expressed by Tom.We have every right to be proud of our service for most of us went to Vietnam because our country asked us to do so. We wanted to serve our country and we did it proudly! Thank you Tom for sharing your life with the rest of us."},{"Title":"Searching for the Good : A Young Man's Journey to War and Back","review":"This book eloquently captures the struggles and realities of Brewer's Vietnam War experience and his return after being wounded. This is hardly a &quot;poor me&quot; study but instead a thought provoking narrative about a time in US history that far too many of us don't understand.Written in a very readable style it should be recommended reading for every high school/college student studying the Vietnam War and a must read for any teacher attempting to cover the topic."},{"Title":"Searching for the Good : A Young Man's Journey to War and Back","review":"In Searching For The Good: A Young Man's Journey To War And Back is the intense personal story of Thomas Brewer's personal sojourn from the unreflective patriotism 1950s, post-World War II childhood, to the font lines of the Cold War in Germany, to lethal and political ambiguous, controversial combat in Vietnam, to his post war struggle to build a life in a society that just wanted to forget it all. Highly recommended for military buffs, political science and social science students, as well as the non-specialist general reader with an interest in late 20th Century American history, Searching For The Good is part military memoir, part social/political analysis, and offers a unique, comprehensive, compelling perspective on the times and the events that shaped a generation of young men just like Tom Brewer."},{"Title":"Searching for the Good : A Young Man's Journey to War and Back","review":"I am giving this book to all my friends who were in Vietnam as a thank you.

Tom Brewer tells his story with such ease yet it is packed with poignancy. We didn't appreciate then how lucky we were to have such heroes. Worse yet we didn't recognize them for all their sacrifices on their return. There is no changing the past but I'll make a point of thanking all those that I know and making sure that my children read this book so they never forget a generation of men who are often forgotten."},{"Title":"Searching for the Good : A Young Man's Journey to War and Back","review":"&quot;Searching for the Good&quot; provides a man's self-reflection on his personal experiences during the Vietnam War.

Each chapter left the reader with the desire to go on to the next one. The author starts out in Viet Nam with the events that led up to when he was seriously injured and was evacuated out. He then goes back in time to when he was eight years old and came to Michigan and lived near the old bomber plant at Willow Run. The timeline continues from there. He talks about how he went from playing childhood games of war using rotten tomatoes as hand grenades to actually going to war and being injured by a real one. He talks about his time there, as a combat infantry officer, and the aftermath. You will laugh, you will cry and you will be angry. The writing style is superb, filled with wonderful images and similies. For example, while on patrol in the jungle, &quot;a hand suddenly shot up out of the ground like Jack and the Beanstalk.&quot; Written like fine literature, it is nevertheless a true story and should be read by anyone who has ever sent a loved one off to fight in a war.

It is quite obvious to me that Mr. McNaughton has reviewed the wrong book. This book, The Ark of Millions of Years, Volume TWO, which I own, is all about the 2012 Mayan End Time date. Because the authors are the first to \\"crack\\" the 2012 Mayan calendar code meaning in a very unique way, I rate this book highly.Now, I believe that Mr. McNaughton is referring to the Volume One of The Ark of Millions of Years. He mentions several books that are not even in the authors reference list. Regardless, the questions that he raises were indeed answered in that book, in fact every one of them.The authors bring to the table a new version of the creation as told through many ancient reliable texts, including the Bible, that answers the questions about the flood of Noah, origin of the Jews, whether man was created or evolved, the true age of the earth, the role of the fallen angels, and much more in a new light from ancient Jewish texts recently translated.The authors make the claim that it is the most comprehensive book on the creation; and they did it admirably, in a most remarkable way. They also claim the book restores a key piece of knowledge that was lost about 6,000 years ago pertaining to the understanding of the creation; this loss caused the chasm between creationists and evolutionists. Additionally, the book actually fulfills an ancient Jewish prophecy found in the Zohar and its publishing was heralded by a Grand Sextile (Star of David) alignment of heavenly bodies announcing the return of the lost \\"key.\\" I love this book, have read it twice, and highly recommend it to others."},{"Title":"The Ark of Millions of Years Volume Two: 2012 and the Harvest of the End Times","review":"The recent publication of The Ark of Millions of Years Volume Two sounded interesting, since the subtitle is 2012 and the Harvest of the End Times. The 331-page book has very poor quality graphics, many of which are blurred and pixelated images downloaded from the net with no acknowledgement to their origin. There is an acknowledgement of the author's cat, however - the book is dedicated to it! The authors, E.J. Clark and B. Alexander Agnew, Ph.D seem to see themselves as archaeologist-explorers in the vein of Indiana Jones, but their book shows that they have simply read a few New Age authors such as Arguelles, Yaxkin-Joy and/or Hunbatz Men, (or more likely, got the information second hand, off the internet), have misunderstood them, not done any proper research or checking and have mixed in the Nephilim of Sitchin and a large dose of biblical material. They even attribute the Tzolkin to Abraham or Shem (p.142). In fact it seems that the whole book is an attempt to prove and justify the bible (p.147-148). Their list of errors is huge. Here are a few:1. Talking of Dreamspell's \\"galactic tones\\" and other concepts as if they are genuine artefacts of the Maya calendars (p.117-131)2. Announce that Arguelles is deceased (p.120)3. Show 2 Dreamspell Tzolkin grids and say one is the original design, while the other is modern (just because the former includes Maya numerals) p.121\`-122.4. Wrongly state that the Maya used wheels to measure time, since many people use interlocking wheels to help explain Maya calendars. (p.129-131).5. They call the 52-year Calendar Round and 104-year Venus Round the \\"short count\\". The Short Count is actually a 13-katun cycle of just under 260 solar years (260 tuns). (p.132)6. They state that the Maya had a 28-day lunar cycle. (p.132). The cycle was in fact alternately 29 and 30 days, with extra interpolated 30-day months.7. They state that \\"The Tzolk'in (pronounced Zol Keen) is the divine or religious long count calendar of the Maya used to measure the cycles of the Pleiades, a cycle being 26,000 years.\\" (p.132 and also p.141). The Tzolkin is NOT the Long Count, and the rest is an over-simplification - the movement of the Pleiades was used to check the precessional movement towards the alignment in 2012, (by the Maya of Chichen Itza), which only happens every 26,000 years.8. Another misunderstanding: \\"The Tzolk'in calendar ends on December 21, 2012, at precisely 11.11.am GMT\\". (p.143). No, it is the 13-baktun cycle of the Long Count calendar that ends on 21 December 2012, but not at 11.11. That is when the Winter Solstice occurs. It is debateable amongst Mayanists as to when the date rolls over - either dusk, dawn, or midnight.8. They state that the Haab is the Calendar Round. (p.135)9. Mixed start and end-dates: start date: Aug 13 3114 BC (p.136) end-date: 23 December 2012 (p.139), buit also talks of Galactic Alignment, (p.136), which is applicable only if the other correlation is used - start date 11 August 3114 BC; end-date 21 December 2012. On p.153, both dates are given, \\"December 21-23\\") showing the authors' confusion.10. \\"The Aztecs used a sacred calendar called the Tonalpohualli, a long count calendar borrowed from the Mayan Tzolk'in system with some modifications added.\\" The Tzolkin (and Tonalpohualli) ARE NOT the same as the Long Count!11. The central panel of the Aztec Sunstone is presented as the entire Sunstone. The reason is that it was copied from the internet, and only the central panel of the colour rendition by Roberto Sieck Flandes can be found online. If you want to see the whole painting, see Beyond 2012 colour plates.12. Galactic Alignment is stated to be \\"the winding down of precession\\". Galactic Alignment is a 36-year time window in the 26,000-year cycle of precession - not the end of it.There are many more errors, but I'm sure you get the gist of this. This book is actually an insult to the intelligence!"},{"Title":"The Ark of Millions of Years Volume Two: 2012 and the Harvest of the End Times","review":"*** SPOILER *** This book is based upon the simple idea that our current Earth is a combination of a \\"temporal\\" earth that has been here for quite a long time and a \\"spiritual\\" earth that was created in a different universe and moved here during an event described in the Bible as the flood (of Noah). Evidence for this idea is nothing more than the words of various writings, including the Bible (including the Apocrypha), the Talmud, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Book of Mormon, and lots of other books both ancient and modern. Whether quoting from the Bible, from Joseph Smith, or from Ragni and Rado, all writings are taken as equally authoritative. Since many of these writings have been interpreted, reinterpreted, and misinterpreted over and over, I found the lack of any real evidence very disappointing.At the end, Mr. Clark relates, \\"My daughter Eve asked, 'Can you prove that such an event actually occurred?' I replied, ' Does it answer all your questions?' She slowly said, 'yes.' 'Then it must have happened' was my reply.With apologies to Eve, this book fails to answer any of my questions. How can there be people and civilizations without spirit? How can there be people and civilizations in a spiritual world without bodies? What kind of a God creates non-spiritual beings and subjects them to catastrophic cataclysms? What kind of God creates spiritual beings, most of whom become incredibly evil, then destroys the evil ones and banishes those who have remained good and pure?I'm glad I was able to borrow a copy of this book to read.

Where I drew the line was when the so called \\"romantic\\" hero rapes the heroine on their honeymoon and slaps her so hard as to leave a mark. Apparently, this seemed to \\"knock\\" some sense into her to realize she was in love with him. Give me a break. This isn't a romance novel, it's more of a \\"how to book\\" on how to become a battered wife."},{"Title":"Savage Surrender","review":"Wikipedia describes Charlotte Lamb's writing career in the following manner:She was a true revolutionary in the field of romance writing. One of the first writers to explore the boundaries of sexual desire, her novels often reflected the forefront of the \\"sexual revolution\\" of the 1970s. Her books touched on then-taboo subjects such as child abuse and rape, and she created sexually confident -even dominant- heroines. She was also one of the first to create a modern romantic heroine: independent, imperfect, and perfectly capable of initiating a sexual or romantic relationship.In every single way described above, Savage Surrender written in 1980 was a BIG FAIL. It was Shocking! Disturbing! Horrifying! This book made me physically ill. There is no romance to be found in this story. As the previous reviewer commented, this book is a \\"How To\\" on becoming a battered wife! The heroine has literally been emotionally and physically battered by both men in her life. In the end, apart from pitying the heroine in her abusive gilded cage, there is no respect, liking or empathy to be had for any of the characters!Did Lamb really think the reader would walk away believing this to be a happy ever after story for anyone but the abuser?Did Harlequin truly need the extra financial profits to be had from publishing this dreck in the Presents line?What were they thinking?"},{"Title":"Savage Surrender","review":"From the back of the book:Her secret saved her from Alex's charmsSophie loved Crete.

The books appeared in the stores a month apart and this prolific author seemed to really be on a roll.The first, Twisted Branch, which I review here, immediately embraces you with the setting, the history, and the tastes and smells of late 70's Cape May and the very haunted and very creepy Abbadon Inn, an entity itself. The publishers of this series even saw fit to include an illustration of some \\"artifacts\\" from the history of the Abbadon Inn in the frontispiece of the books. This creates an instant, authentic \\"backstory\\" and sets the chains to rattling even before the first chapter is encountered. A very nice touch, and unusual for a paperback.There are no spoilers here, and I won't get into a blow-by-blow accounting of why this book, and indeed the series thus far, makes an excellent addition to your shelves, but I'll just try to communicate a bit of the ambience of this wonderful book.The author's weaves a subtle, ever-building web of tension, and apprehension, building into some very literal spine tinglers punctuated by some genuine shocks as we're ushered into the Abbadon Inn along with the main character Sam, whose motivations, background and intelligence make him a very sympathetic and appropriate hero for this book. It's my opinion that the realism of his character development is enhanced by the brief, sensual encounter with his girlfriend, Dani, and that it adds to his eventual heartache and loneliness. It helps us empathize more deeply with Sam and the scene is handled expertly.Not only are the local sounds, aromas and sights of Cape May made very palpable by the author but those emanating from within the Abbadon Inn have very precise and specific origins as the careful reader will discover. The author uses all five senses (even including the sixth sense) to tell this tale and to frighten us. Why this first book was so good...I found out soon after.Addendum:In the fall of 2005, I was alerted by a friend in New Jersey that there was to be a special Halloween presentation in Cape May at the Queen's Hotel for the Abbadon Inn series. The third book of the series was to be available hot off the presses. Making the pilgrimage to the scene of this scary series on this particular weekend was a rare treat, and upon meeting \\"Chris Blaine\\" at this intimate book signing and presentation, I was delighted to discover that \\"Chris\\" was actually five people. Ginjer Buchanan of Berkley Books was the creator of the concept and three authors, Elizabeth Massie, Craig Shaw Gardner and Matthew Costello wrote these first three books. A fifth \\"Chris\\" was Cortney Skinner, the person who designed the physical layout of the Abbadon Inn in order to create consistent setting for the three writers. He also created the frontispiece for the books. The attendees were treated to period Victorian refreshments and readings by the authors as well as a museum-like display of \\"actual artifacts from this fictional haunted inn\\" as a poster announced.\\"Twisted Branch\\" was authored by none other than two-time Bram Stoker award winner Elizabeth Massie. No wonder this book had such richness...I immediately went to her website to search out her other works..I highly recommend that you do to."},{"Title":"Twisted Branch: A Novel of the Abbadon Inn","review":"Twisted Branch was scary, well-written, and engaging from beginning to end.

The dialogue is pretty realistic and there is plenty of action.. The main 'theme' of the book, slavery and the underground railway, is one you wouldn't expect in a horror book, unless....However there are some obvious flaws.. First, when trying to add that gratuitous sex part that every book needs, the author writes \\"Heat moved through Sam's groin as Dani moved her thumbs up and down his shaft through the thick denim jeans. His thoughts began to soften\\".. Get it.. Please....Then there are all of the sounds and smells coming from all over the house, most of which are never really explained, except that the ghosts are trying to tell Sam something......There is the part where Sam look's at the house and sees all of these ghosts in all of the windows... I guess the writer figured that they would be adressed in later books, because she only alludes to 3 or 4 of them in this book. The ending, which has a slight twist to it, is not too obvious, but if you thik real hard you can pretty much realize where the book is heading...So while this book wasn't a complete waste of time, it definately won't make you lose any sleep..."},{"Title":"Great Sex: A Man's Guide to the Secret Principles of Total-Body Sex","review":"I am a healthy, happily married and successful 47 year old civil engineer whose SEX LIFE JUST GOT ALOT BETTER!!!

As with some of the text, the cover takes a backward step in the way women are viewed by men - and how women feel about the way they are viewed. Frankly, it's a bit counterproductive - but I don't find it exactly offensive.So read it and see that it is male perspective, a lot of 'duh' moments, but the brevity is often too much and the advice all boils down to communication. The website is a good preview. Frankly some of it just is not good, some is stupid, but some excellent. While there seems to be a very loose idea that porn is bad for sex, there is also a message that it's ok and not a big deal. Take it with a grain of salt rather than as a directive. It's all an opinion - Communication is highly suggested on all counts. As a woman I find a lot of it condescending and flatly misguided, so that alone is a rather redundant impression.

This book redefined what total pleasure means. Men often put too much pressure on themselves and blame themsleves when they are not getting the results they want. Many men who thin they are doing it right would be shocked to learn the women they are with are not so impressed by the sex as they are b the man's confidence.

Great Sex is definitely one of the very best. This book is more comprehensible because it uses down to earth language and explains everything in plain English. It covers more territory, particularly in areas that other authors barely touch upon, like penile size. Other books tell you that there is nothing you can do about a small penis, but this book tells you that is wrong. There is expensive and risky surgery, say $6,000 to $12,000, and the results are nothing to write home about. But there are a number of things you can do to make your penis appear longer. Forget the pumps, the hanging weights and the herbal supplements and read the book for more. And it's not just about anatomy and the male - the author has excellent advice about the female, both anatomy and critical differences between men and women when thinking about and engaging in sex.

I particularly like and appreciate the fact that the author shares his own experiences with many of these issues - his compassion and empathy really shines through. And I especially like the fact that he offers several different possible treatment options for each issue, including alternative methods as well. This is definitely not a rigid, cookie-cutter approach to resolving sexual issues.And I also recommend this book *everywhere* :-) In fact, I think so much of it, I even bought a copy for my friend's teenage son. This is the kind of sex women (and men) long for, and unfortunately so rarely achieve. But with this book, sensual, hot, intensely erotic sex is not only possible, but inevitable.Finally, although it's geared more toward guys, it's definitely not just for them. It's a great resource for women to learn about their partners and even about themselves.

Great.Dont look for life/sex to get easier folks - just try harder !Pornography is a relatively recent vice that market forces driven by our modern insatiable thirst for 'infotainment' has developed, but sex itself is as old as breathing.Most young men dont get a proper education on how to deal with the bewildering variety of sexual approaches women expect us to be able to deal with, and without at least some idea gleamed from these B gade efforts they may well fail altogether!If anything, pornography has helped the last few generations to relax about enjoying orgyistic sex, and unfortuantely the modern conservatives are trying again to put the hedonistic genie back in the 'dirty' bottle.

Most men learn about sex either from pornography which is completely misleading or from experience which may or may not have taught him what he needs to know.

Wait - you say that's not you? Read GREAT SEX, by Michael Castleman, and it will be.Michael Castleman makes it clear that he's not a doctor, or a sex therapist. He does have thirty years of experience dealing with men's sexual issues, however, as an educator and a journalist. This experience shows in every chapter of GREAT SEX. The first part focuses on \\"The Principles of Great Sex for Men\\". This is where the author's main theme for the book comes in: stop trying to perform like a porn star, and start using your entire body to pleasure yourself and your partner. Each one of the senses should be involved in lovemaking, and Michael Castleman gives great examples of how to make that happen. The second part focuses on women's sexuality and well being, but keeping in mind that the book is targeted at men, this is more of a learning lesson than an owner's manual. Still, the advice and knowledge offered here is invaluable. In the third part, the author focuses on blending the best of both male and female sexual issues. Birth control, oral pleasure, aphrodisiacs - you name it, you'll find it here.Somehow managing to avoid sounding clinical and detached, and yet also maintaining a friendly, conversational tone throughout the book, Michael Castleman offers a remarkably comprehensive tome between the covers of this hardbound book.

From lackluster sex to male performance anxiety to the dearth of knowledge surrounding the female sexual response, Castleman tackles virtually every sexual issue affecting couples today.According to Castleman, Great Sex is something a couple creates together, not something innate or imitated.One of Castleman's most salient points comes in his discussion of media messages (primarily those conveyed through pornography) and how they wreak havoc on our personal sexual relations. He encourages us to understand that real life luxurious sex is far better than media inspired sex -- where there seems to be a rush to the genitals and then to intercourse.Men who read this work will find a wealth of information and advice regarding penis size, ejaculatory control, masturbation, female pleasure, and the changes that come with age and that can occur through diet and exercise. I do believe men will breathe a sigh of relief when reading this book, for it lets them know they are not alone in their sexual struggles. As a woman, I was surprised to find that the majority of men experience sexual problems, too, and delighted to learn that my husband's problems were not problems at all, but common aspects of male sexuality.There is another equally important way men will benefit from this book, and that is in the way it normalizes women as well. That is, Castleman has finally provided men and women with a book that doesn't approach female pleasure as if it were an anamoly, a mystery never to be solved. I've read many books for men about female pleasure, and most of them talk condescendingly about women's sexual response or they convey the notion that it is something that can never be understand because each woman is so different in terms of how she responds to sexual stimuli.Castleman, however, approaches this subject outside the cloak of mystery and makes women's slower and more individualized sexual response easy to understand, completely normal, and full of potential. He stresses the normalcy of the vast majority of women who cannot orgasm through intercourse alone (a fact so important that Castleman, thankfully, repeats it on a number of occasions), and in doing so, Castleman encourages men and women to discard the age old belief that women, like men, should orgasm through intercourse and asks us to explore all the other avenues that can lead to orgasmic pleasure for both men and women.This request alone erases the idea of foreplay (previously understood as a prelude to the real thing - intercourse) and makes all we do (kissing, touching, stroking, rubbing, licking, loving) the feature show. Moreover, it slows the pace of sex for both men and women and increases their potential ten fold for the kind of sex that will leave them completely sated and eager for the next encounter.This is a must read for anyone who would like to experience - for a lifetime -- GREAT SEX.leejogger"},{"Title":"Great Sex: A Man's Guide to the Secret Principles of Total-Body Sex","review":"He does repeat some of the same things over again, as one annoyed reader said, but I found that to be important because people forget. If it's an important thought, bring it back up in various chapters in different ways. I read something on page 50, and didn't \\"really\\" grasp it until page 150. Once was not enough to achieve the ahhh-haa experience of grasping a new idea/concept/view.Now granted, I knew a lot of the things in here about the psychology of sex/behind sex, or the changes in the body that affect sexual habits and thoughts, however, I feel it was highly worth reading every word in the book to find out the rest. If someone asked me for advice on an issue, I feel I would be able to give him or her enough info to help them, or guide them in toward the right direction.If you're looking for a \\"how to book\\" with pictures, this isn't for you.

I thought I knew all about women's sexuality (being one). But I was amazed at how much this \\"man's\\" book taught this woman.

It contains a life time of mature and caring information. I have given copies of this book to each of my children and I recommend it to all of the couples I see in marriage and family counseling.

It is as useful for women as it is to men."},{"Title":"Great Sex: A Man's Guide to the Secret Principles of Total-Body Sex","review":"As a sex researcher and educator, men always ask me what makes a good lover. I still try to answer their questions but now I can also recommend a book that will explain to them what a good lover is AND teach them how to become one. I encourage all my students to get this book, especially the men. Most complaints I hear from women are covered in Dr. Castleman's insightful and informative text. But these techniques can be used in more than just heterosexual relationships.

I had two problems: premature ejaculation, and a desire difference in my relationship--I wanted to have sex more often than my girlfriend. I thought my premature ejaculation made her turn off to sex. Well, the chapter on lasting longer fixed me up in like a month. It was amazing. Simple suggestions. And all of a sudden I had really good control, could last pretty much as long as I wanted. Amazing. If this was all I got from the book, it would be well worth the price. But lasting longer didn't fix our desire difference. I still wanted it more than her--much more because now premature ejaculation wasn't a problem anymore. So I flipped to the chapter on desire differences. Very interesting. We both read it and talked about it. It helped. We took some of the suggestions. We started scheduling our sex, making an evening of it. I still want sex more than she does. But our difference is less of a problem than it was. Great book. Thank you, Michael Castleman. Thank you very much!"},{"Title":"Great Sex: A Man's Guide to the Secret Principles of Total-Body Sex","review":"Not everybody has had the advantage of being taught the fundamentals of sexual relations, method and protocol. No birds-and-the-bees lecture, no sex education in high school, no useful advice from &quot;more experienced&quot; friends. No wonder there's a plethora of frigidity and premature ejaculation, the unspoken secret among couples. And why Americans are so cranky these days.GREAT SEX by Michael Castleman is a refreshing guidebook to sexuality for novices, veterans, and students. It takes The Joy of Sex to its ultimate (excuse the pun) climax. Mr. Castleman speaks to men and women of all ages and gender preferences in a friendly, informative voice. He is less clinical than Everything You Wanted To Know About Sex and more comprehensive than Our Bodies, Ourselves.You may think that you know EVERYTHING having to do with sexual performance, sexual health, sexual faux-pas, and/or how to enhance your peak experience. I can assure you without meeting you, you are incorrect. This book is comprehensive in these topics and then some, and I would safely predict it will become a classic reference in a very short period of time.Mr. Castleman deals with topics that men are loathe to even discuss with their personal physicians, such as premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunction. He not only explains the physiology of each condition, but also offers advice on how partners can give support and make remedial exercises fun and part of sexual relations. Mr. Castleman offers a particularly sensitive chapter on how readers can rebuild their sexual relationship with their partners who have suffered a sexual assault.And for readers who yearn for adventure and imagination, there is an entire chapter on aphrodisiacs. Not your grandpa's Spanish Fly, I can assure you. And you don't have to enroll in a yoga course to enjoy the positions offered to enhance stimulation.And there's more -- MUCH MORE.Mr. Castleman transforms two people engaging in sexual relations to Lovers. Lovers who can use sex as ONE of many ways to express the feeling-without-words. Sex becomes a new second language that only your partner can understand and appreciate. Sex is no longer an experience that leaves you more alone than before you started it.In summary, I could not put down this book. I was amazed at how much I did not know about human sexuality and how I could turn my bedroom into a French boudoir with just a few of Mr. Castleman's suggestions. He has done his homework, his prose is very readable, and to recapitulate, I predict this book will be a reference for many years and will be found on middle-class bookshelves instead of between mattresses and boxsprings, which is where one would find my library in the 70's."},{"Title":"Great Sex: A Man's Guide to the Secret Principles of Total-Body Sex","review":"Author repeats same thought several times.

You can sit down and read the whole thing in an afternoon - highly recommended just for the entertainment value - and then you can spend a few years working your way through the exercises. If you work with the exercises - the only way you'll really understand this, even if you've practiced other forms of magick or meditation before - you will continue to astound yourself with your own ability to grow and change and expand your consciousness. Phil Farber's concept of ritual as the art of set and setting makes this material useful in so many situations that, well, it's just incredibly useful!! This book should be part of every magick library, on the shelves along with Crowley, Regardie, and Carroll."},{"Title":"FutureRitual","review":"I loved this book. It is a fine introduction to the field of ritual magick. I've read the pentagram rituals elsewhere - I've learned they are the basis of the entire Golden Dawn body of occultism - but the explanation in here made the most sense. And beyond that, I now have a real sense of how rituals are created and what you can do with them."},{"Title":"FutureRitual","review":"I came into this book at the recommendation of a friend at a Neuro-linguistic Programming seminar. Coming from a rather straightforward psychological background, I was rather dismayed that she had recommended a book on &quot;magick.&quot; FutureRitual, however, is a particularly unique look at an ancient tradition, using the language and models of modern psychology and NLP. It's a hell of a lot of fun, and the metaphoric stories offer more unconscious information than most readers will notice right at first... Give it some time to seep in... and do the exercises..."},{"Title":"FutureRitual","review":"It's contemporary, powerful, and one of the FIRST books I recommend to those wanting the best magick stuff available. If you enjoy the works of Alister Crowley, Max Freedom Long, Stuart Wilde, and Peter J. Carroll, then you will want to reach the next level by buying Philip H. Farber's FUTURERITUAL. I'm only allowed 1,000 words for this review, so there is not enough space to share with you ALL the benefits I've attained from this book. But suffice it to say that one direct benefit is that my intuition abilities have improved to such a degree, that sometimes people are left speechless that I know so much about them. (Works great when picking up chicks!) Not to mention that the narrow concept of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; exeriences will never be the same to you EVER again, once you've completely applied what this book presents. However, this book is not for everyone. Only those people who can step outside of what they are used to, and step into something truly fulfilling, will benefit from this book. And it takes not just the willingness to apply this book, it takes a FOCUS. If you can focus on what is being said in this book, and you can focus on doing what this books asks of you, then you'll know something not too many people have the ability to attain. You see, people &quot;try&quot; new things all the time. But until they LET GO of the &quot;map&quot; they have been following all this time, you'll never full attain the true magic to be had in this book. You'll just make excuses, and point your finger, and do everything else BUT admit you're not letting yourself leave this &quot;map&quot; you've been on, and experiencing what lay beyond it. If you want to find out just what can be possible, BUY THIS BOOK. You'll thank yourself within the first 10 pages. That's My Opinion But You're Welcome To It!"},{"Title":"FutureRitual","review":"A fair look at some basic &quot;magick&quot; techniques. It's really a mix of Tim Leary psychology with post-Crowley meditation and thought techniques. While many of the ideas are valid for breaking the old patterns in your mind, none of it is new or really addresses any major ideas of dealing with technology issues. While it offers little new insight, it is presented in a fun and informal way. Filled with personal experiences and fun stories, it is more accessible than the sources Faber draws from. Good for beginners just starting to explore these ideas, or for old hands who want some new ways to look at the old techniques."},{"Title":"FutureRitual","review":"I opened FutureRitual expecting another rehash of basic magick pulled from all the same books I already own but I was surprised right from the first page.

While Bloom, as a Russian Orthodox Archbishop, writes solidly from the Christian Tradition of theism and theurgy, his advice, however, on how to quiet the mind and &quot;charge&quot; and &quot;consecrate&quot; space for meditation and inner working is some of the most practical and commonsense advice I've yet encountered.

Once a child startsreading (with Frog and Toad Are Friends), the second, third and fourth books are welcome friends themselves.This book, published in 1971, is the second of four. Toad is a bit negative and nervous, and worries about rules, while Frog is often cheerful and dedicated to alleviating Toad's fears and doubts.&quot;A List&quot; is a funny story remembered long after reading it - Toad has a list of things to do, and anything not on the list can't be done. He loves to do something, then cross it off. But what happens when your list blows away, and &quot;run after the list&quot; wasn't even on the list. Worse, you can't remember what else was on the list. Frog is such a good friend, he just sits quietly with Toad as he struggles to figure out what to do.In &quot;The Garden,&quot; Toad would like to have a garden like Frog has, and with Frog's encouragement, he starts one. He tries directing the garden to grow, until Frog (hearing all that shouting) gives him some advise on how to nurture a garden.&quot;Cookies&quot; is probably one of the best stories. Frog and Toad make cookies, and they are so good that they can't stop eating them. They determine its about will power, and in the end they end up with no cookies &quot;but we have lots and lots of will power.&quot; Frog says.&quot;Dragons and Giants&quot; is about Frog and Toads fears and how they deal with them. &quot;We are not afraid!&quot; Frog and Toad screamed at the same time. A funny story that children will like.The last story &quot;The Dream&quot; is a bit deep - Toad is asleep and has a dream about starring in a play, while Frog sits in the audience and shrinks almost to non-existence.The stories are short, sweet and about friendship, but in a simple manner. Drawings of Frog and Toad are on almost every page, and are detailed enough to warrant a lengthy view and some comments from young readers. The words are understandable and readable enough for very young readers, yet they manage to hold a story with an amusing message. riendship, but in a simple manner.

Yes, Arnold Lobel's Frog and Toad books are a different creature altogether -- awash in the Grumpy Old Man color palette, from Cigar to Pool Table -- and filled with odd little stories that cannot be read aloud without summoning the spirit of Walter Matthau.So why have these unlikely characters have become regulars in my son's bedtime reading rotation? Maybe it's the grown-up, wise quality of the stories: though written simply, and always possessing great morality and sweetness, there is a worldly little undercurrent, like a secret joke that young readers can't quite figure out, but want to understand. This opaque quality is like catnip to a toddler: the mystery of adulthood right there on the page, so tantalizingly close, but still, so confounding!Frog is the upbeat one; Toad the darker, pondering one. While other reviewers have attempted to link them to everything from Buddhism to Catholicism -- I'll stick with the Odd Couple reference, if I may.These two are not friends DESPITE their differences, but BECAUSE of them (a nice lesson for kids to absorb, though it's never presented as a Lesson, of course) spending every waking minute together, exploring the woods and discussing the meaning of life (and cookies). Behind the scenes, you just KNOW they smoke pipes, drink Darjeeling, wear tweed and watch plenty of PBS (especially the British Comedies).You'll find yourself taken aback at the level of sophistication Lobel manages to convey while never actually going over the child's head: \\"The List,\\" for example, hilariously mocks our grown-up obsession with Getting Things Done, while \\"Cookies\\" discusses the pitfalls and difficulties of relying on willpower, something both you and your child will be able to nod in agreement with. \\"Dragons and Giants\\" addresses real fears in a reassuring and funny way, as the pair runs for their lives from predators while insisting they are \\"very brave!\\" \\"The Dream\\" is the most philosophical of all -- Toad dreams he is a singing, dancing superstar while his friend, Frog, shrinks down to nothingness.Five stories in total are presented here, something I would normally shy away from (what with my 2-year old audience) but Lobel manages to make it work. Even more astounding, this book can hold said 2-year old's interest while coming from the old school of \\"more text than pictures.\\" Maybe there is just so much to ponder in these comforting pages that a slow, relaxed read is just the ticket."},{"Title":"Frog and toad together / by Arnold Lobel (An I can read book)","review":"This is the first book and tape for me and my five year old son. On a whim, I finally decided to get one from the library this past weekend. I vaguely remembered reading Frog & Toad as a child, but couldn't remember any of the specific stories.We are having SO much fun listening to these stories! The stories are so delightful, and my son is really enjoying it too. I think we were both pleasantly surprised to hear it and to experience listening to an audiotape for a change instead of our usual \\"mommy read a book\\" routine. Of course, the occasional music (which is oh so perfect in how it depicts what's going on in the story....particularly for moments depicting light moments, and also those depicting danger) and the author's tone of the voice are what add to already great adventures in the book.The first day we listened to it, we had so much fun that we played it about 3 more times in a row. My son asks for us to listen/read the story every night.I agree with one other reviewer who said the author's narration (voice, tone, etc) is perfect for the story.My son loves all the stories, although for The Dream story, he looks a little perplexed, so I told him it's a story about a dream and most dreams don't make sense.In \\"A List\\", he loves the part where Toad says \\"Blah\\". And he also loves when earlier in that story, you can hear the sound of a door opening as Toad leaves his house on his way to see Frog. My son just turns to me and grins from ear to ear.For the \\"Cookies\\" story, he loves to hear the crunch of the cookie as Toad take that first bite at his own house before he goes to Frog's. He also enjoys hearing Toad tell Frog all the different ways that they can get into the box.His very favorite line in the book though is in \\"Dragons and Giants\\", when the snake comes out the cave and says, \\"Hello Lunch\\". We both crack up over time....and sometimes rewind it a few times :-)Like all the other reviewers mentioned, this is definitely a wonderful book about friendship. It was also interesting to read many reviewers note how there are so many real-life learning examples in it for adults. So true.Of all the books we've read, this is by far the one that has engaged my son the most, which is saying a lot since he has about 15 Thomas books and is usually preoccupied with those.This is I definitely have to get the other books from the collection. Definitely a classic.Happy reading everyone :-)"},{"Title":"Frog and toad together / by Arnold Lobel (An I can read book)","review":"The Frog and Toad books were favorites of my daughters when they were young.

Great books for kids, good for grown-ups too."},{"Title":"Frog and toad together / by Arnold Lobel (An I can read book)","review":"This 1972 book is still a delight to read to your child and have your child read to you. Frog and Toad are together in five featured stories including A List, The Garden, Cookies, Dragons and Giants, and The Dream.The stories are simple, but even in this world of computer games, Pixar and pop-up books, they catch a child's attention. A List features Toad doing his first To Do list. It is a nice way to talk to a child about being organized, but being flexible if things go wrong (Toad's list blew away, but he couldn't run after it because chasing his list wasn't on his list). The Garden is good about illustrating patience while watching seeds grow. Cookies is a funny story about will power. Dragons and Giants illustrates friendship and bravery. And the last story, The Dream is another story about friendship.Whether you use the stories as springboards for teaching tools or just to enjoy, they are wonderfully and simply illustrated and the story flows gently."},{"Title":"Frog and toad together / by Arnold Lobel (An I can read book)","review":"Classic book to have in your child's library!Great short stories that have wit and humor for all ages to enjoy!I loved all Frog and Toad stories growing up and now my sons seem to love them just as much!A Must Have and it won't be a regret!"},{"Title":"Frog and toad together / by Arnold Lobel (An I can read book)","review":"The Frog and Toad series teaches kids simple lessons with easy stories and cute graphics.

These are great virtues to instill in young minds. If the books were made in cardboard stock, Teah would be even more happy with them - as it is she frequently grabs one of them when it's time for her bedtime story - and great bedtime stories they are.

It's when Frog is dreaming and Toad is in the audience and Frog was putting on a show. The only thing that was bugging Frog was that Toad wasn't even paying attention to him.

If you love Frog and Toad, you need to know Arnold Lobel's daughter collaborated to create a Broadway musical based on these books, and the CD with the songs from the musical (\\"A Year With Frog and Toad\\") is a MUST have for every child. We have given so many copies as gifts I've lost count, and everyone (adult and child alike) LOVES the CD. It has all the charm and humor of the books, and it brings the characters to life in a lovely and loveable way.

This book contains two of our family's favorite stories: \\"A List\\" and \\"Cookies.\\" \\"A List\\" is the first story. One morning, while still in bed, Toad makes a list of all the things he must do that day. As you read this one, you'll recognize people you know (or have known). \\"The Garden\\" is the second story and is quite precious. Toad plants flower seeds and is impatient to see them grow. As usual, he puts himself through much in order to accomplish the inevitable. \\"The Cookies\\" is a great story for those of us who are cookie monsters. The two friends try to figure out how NOT to eat the delicious cookies Toad has just baked. Priceless. \\"Dragons and Giants\\" is next. This story is about being brave...a real challenge for these two fellows. Last, but not least, is \\"The Dream.\\" This story is about ego and has an important lesson for all of us about what's important in life.Again, the accompanying audio tape for Frog and Toad Together with Arnold Lobel as storyteller is a must. Lobel's dry, monotonic delivery is exactly what is needed to depict the characters, the scene and the humor in these totally delightful tales.Carolyn Rowe Hill"},{"Title":"Frog and toad together / by Arnold Lobel (An I can read book)","review":"Written before we even coined the word &quot;Yuppy&quot;, &quot;Frog and Toad Together&quot; provide insight into the world of management in a form that children can take with them into their professional careers.

Frog is the wiser one with Toad being the one with more silly ideas. As usual we have five stories which are not related to each other. In the first Toad decides to write a list of everything he will do that day and he does not deviate from it until he looses the list, which creates quite the problem. Next Frog gives Toad some seeds to plant his own garden and Toad is very impatient for them to grow. He talks to them, yells at them, sings to them, reads them stories, plays music etc. all to no avail. The third story has Frog and Toad with a freshly baked bowlful of cookies which they can't stop eating and they try to come up with a way to make the cookies inaccessible so they can no longer eat anymore and make themselves sick. The fourth story has Frog and Toad wanting to be brave like the heroes in fairy tales so they take a walk up a dangerous mountain and encounter various dangers along the way running quickly back home and feeling quite brave. Finally Toad has a dream where he can do all sorts of performing arts in a theatre where Frog is watching him. But after each act Frog gets smaller and smaller, until Toad looses his friend altogether.

Why? Because all the others from her glory days are gone. Many is the time I have studied her features - looking for a clue as to what I have seen underwater on another ship from the same period but now wrecked on some distant shore.I have extracted my copy of this book (a second edition from 1929) from my own bookshelf in order to produce a review because this ship is now in grave danger of being lost forever. In early 2007 the Cutty Sark caught fire in Greenwich docks where she was undergoing repairs. Fortunately (if such is the right word!), her own figurehead, masts, spars, rigging and deck fittings had been removed and are safe. Nevertheless, the repair bill is still estimated at 17 million British pounds. The Cutty Sark Trust of London are raising funds from every corner imaginable, but it is a difficult task.The Cutty Sark was launched in 1869 - the very year the Suez Canal was opened, ironically an event which signalled the beginning of the end of the Clipper Ship. As a ship she was the perfect design and it is that design which will always remain of special importance to all those who have an interest in the transition of ship building from wood to steel structures.Basil Lubbock was an expert when it came to ships, shipping and ship design. In this book he has placed that expertise at the disposal of the reader. He actually spoke to many who had sailed on board the Cutty Sark in addition to many who sailed on her rival ships. Obtaining her logs (and even the logs from those rival vessels) and photographs - still not seen published elsewhere, this book has remained the standard reference work for the Cutty Sark for a great many years.As others with an interest in this ship have considered writing something new about the Cutty Sark, most have recognised how the definitive work on this great vessel has already been written by someone called Basil Lubbock.That story is here, the detail is here, the photographs are here. You will not be disappointed. And, if you can support the Cutty Sark Trust at this time, you will be doing the ship itself a great service.NM"},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Born in 1879 England, E.M. Forster attended King's College at Cambridge; thereafter his family fortune enabled him to live as please. He traveled extensively; dabbled in the celebrated Bloomsbury Group, which included the celebrated Virginia Woolf; and strove to conceal his homosexuality from the general public until his death in 1970. Although he was widely read during his lifetime, a series of films based on his novels prompted a major re-evaluation of his work during the 1980s and 1990s, and he is now considered among the finest English prose stylists of the early 20th Century.Written in 1910, HOWARDS END is the fifth of six novels Forster wrote, and like most of his work it focuses on issues of social class. In this instance, the action of the novel centers on the house Howards End and the three families who swirl through it. The house itself is owned by Ruth Wilcox, the wife and mother of a highly conventional, conservative family. Upon her death, she wills the house not to her family, which she feels will not appreciate it, but to friend Margaret Schlegel. Ruth's husband destroys her will and conceals the legacy from Margaret--but in an ironic turn of events falls in love with and marries her.The story itself revolves around Margaret Schlegel and her sister Helen. Half-German, well educated, and more independent in thought and manner than most Englishwomen of their era, the sisters also become friendly with bank clerk Leonard Bast. In their efforts to assist him, however, they become leading figures in a scandal that threatens the Wilcox family as a whole. Throughout the novel ownership of the house, and the lies and hypocrisy used to retain it, becomes a symbol of class struggle as those who have power and status (the Wilcoxes) seek to retain it and those who do not (the Basts) seek to obtain it.Forster is indeed a great stylist, and although the novel is indeed famous for its themes and symbolism he never places them above story or characterization. He possesses both the gift of straight-forward narrative and delicate touch, and the result is a perfect balance, a pure pleasure to read from start to finish. Although HOWARDS END is not as widely read as A PASSAGE TO INDIA, it certainly deserves to be. Strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon ReviewerStill laughing at the negative voter"},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"\\"Howards End\\" commences with that famous, cryptic epigraph - \\"Only connect.\\" Although this masterpiece delves into a multitude of themes, including class struggle and suffragism, the idea of \\"connecting\\" runs throughout brilliantly. Indeed, the characters in this novel display various levels of success in \\"connecting,\\" both interpersonally and intrapersonally.The novel primarily concerns the Schlegel sisters - sociable Helen and the more practical Margaret. The sisters live in comfort in London (circa 1900) along with their passive brother, Tibby. As members of the leisure class (they inherited money from their parents), the Schlegels spend much of their time mulling over \\"big issues.\\" Margaret and Helen, for example, belong to a women's social club which discuss how to help the poor and other humanitarians themes. In other words, they're forward-thinkers but not much on action.Their world views are challenged when they become entangled with two quite divergent families - the impoverished Basts and the nouveau riche Wilcoxes. The Schlegels initially are attracted to Leonard Bast, an imaginative clerk who seems worthy of far greater things than his lowly job hints. They debate about how best to help Leonard, but their assistance turns into meddling of the worst sort. In contrast, the sisters are rather repulsed by Henry Wilcox, the head of the family and a distant businessman who seemingly has no internal life. The sisters find their beliefs and loyalties to each other tested severely when they become involved with these families.\\"Howards End\\" is among Forster's best work, along with \\"A Passage to India\\" and ahead of \\"A Room with a View\\" and \\"Where Angels Fear to Tread.\\" The characters are largely what make this book such a treat, although \\"Howards End\\" is buoyed by an astonishingly intricate plot as well. The main mystery concerns who will ultimately inherit Howards End, the Wilcox's somewhat stodgy country home; however, the house is a thinly veiled substitute for Imperial England herself. Indeed, Forster seems to be imploring, \\"Who will inherit England?\\" Forster's denouement answers this question most subtly. As is likely to be true for many readers of this book, I viewed the extraordinary movie version of \\"Howards End\\" many years and numerous times before picking up this novel. The novel is, not surprisingly, even deeper and more thought-provoking than the movie. \\"Howards End\\" is first-rate, exhilarating literature."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Although I had a rough and slow go for the first 10 pages or so, I gained interest once I could understand who was who among the characters speaking and being mentioned. The further I read the more I enjoyed this book that opened a window onto the unnerving and harsh social protocol and class-conflict prevalent in Edwardian England. Brace yourself; the end delivers a powerful wallop.Readers relate to this story in different ways. To me, \\"connect\\" was the essence of Forester's message. When I got to the end I realized the profound significance of two words spoken by Margaret Schlegel: \\"only connect\\". People need to take a good look at themselves and account for their behavior. They need to grasp their surroundings and get a good grip on the world they live in. In other words they need to connect their lives with the realities of the world and with society at large.The case in point is the Wilcox males. The father Henry and his son Charles live in a cloistered world full of nothing but old cronies like themselves who are each one wealthy, arrogant, ruthless, uncaring, and completely disconnected from the rest (the dregs) of society. Their world was limited to the confines of their own pampered surroundings. These men remained protected within an impregnable fortress built to uphold their lifestyle and prevent them from ever connecting with the greater of society. Snug and cozy, coddled in their fortresses, they are oblivious to the plight of others. They are aloof and convinced that their wealthy social status gives them a green light to do anything as they please, regardless of moral issues and negative consequences to others. As upper-class gentlemen with God-granted rights to abuse and bully anyone else lower than them, they considered their elevated social positions to be even above the reach of the law of the land.Opposite of the Wilcox's are the Schlegel sisters who are genuinely good-hearted and good-natured but also rich and pampered, and thus disconnected with the rigors of the poor who are trying to eke out a living. Although the sisters realize that they should do something to help the poor, they aren't exactly sure what to do and aren't fully aware of the strict protocol and taboos placed on both the rich and the poor in accomplishing their objective. The two sisters, social reformers ahead of their time, happen to make the acquaintance of a poor, lower-class young gentlemen name Leonard at a concert. While their intentions were good, they take it upon themselves to make Leonard their pet charity case. But in trying to help him advance, it never occurred to them that others, even those on the receiving end, aren't as open to or appreciative of their concerted efforts. The ensuing story is a classic example of the types of social conflicts existing in Edwardian England between the upper and lower classes in terms of not only their disdain toward each other but also their reactions to charitable efforts by social reformers such as Margaret and Helen Schlegel.As enlightening as the story is in terms of British customs and social norms, the storyline frustrates you because of the activities, behavior and attitudes displayed by the super wealthy who are downright condescending to all persons and things \\"below\\" them. As readers, we are helpless to do anything to support those wronged by arrogant, aloof, and money-hungry aristocrats symbolized by the Henry Wilcox's of the world.Ahead of its time, this novel broaches several social issues, from women's rights, charity to the poor, to the ills of the wealthy. Finally, this book not only contains an enormous bite to chew and swallow in terms of the social conflicts it brings to the table but also it ends up tasting so good in its imaginative and flowing prose that I think you will like this book by E. M. Forester."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"The country home called Howards End IS England...and Forster, through this novel, sets out to determine who shall inherit it. To answer this question, the author examines the merits of the prevailing forces of his time characterized by the doomed, brooding proletariat (Bast), the pensive, soul-searching intellectuals (the Schlegel sisters) and the obtuse but prosperous business tycoons (the Wilcoxes). Infused throughout the entire drama is the phantom of Mrs. Wilcox who, like Ben Kenobi of Star Wars, perishes early in the tale yet maintains an even more powerful presence from beyond the grave.A judicious arbitrator, Forster provides a multidimensional vision of all of his main characters, with their virtues and flaws enjoying equal time in the spotlight. But Forster also takes us one step further, demonstrating through the relationship of Henry Wilcox and Margaret Schlegel that love can bring wholeness and healing to the liberal intellectual and the coarse businessman alike. Though one might presuppose the writer's sympathies to lie with the idealist Margaret, he uses her perspective to appreciate the virtues of Henry the capitalist. &quot;He never bothered over the mysterious or the private. The Thames might run inland from the sea, the chauffeur might conceal all passion...they knew their business and he knew his....Some 20 years her senior, he preserved a gift that she supposed herself to have already lost-not youth's creative power, but its self-confidence and optimism.&quot;Although Forster allows Margaret to humanize the Wilcoxes, he refuses to romanticize them. Margaret alone provides the heart and soul of the relationship, picking up the pieces when Henry's material world comes crashing down upon him. The tentative but enduring relationship between Margaret and Henry is encouraging for a politically polarized 21st century America-a timeless reminder that a commitment to love, patience and understanding can still conquer idealogical alienation. And although the proletariat fares tragically, his offspring is perhaps the most triumphant of all. It is through love that all of the diverse inhabitants of Howards End inherit their domain in the end."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"A friend recommended that I read Howard's End and A Room With a View. I have yet to read the latter, but Howard's End was incredible. E.M. Forster has a true talent for characterization. He gives an in-depth portrait of Henry Wilcox, one not to be compared with any other I have ever read. Forster also has an eye for detail. He seems to know that people get too caught up in the plot of a story, and they forget to appreciate the little things. He never fails to mention how beautiful England looks in the spring, or the pleasant state of the weather, etc. Perhaps it does take a while for the plot to develop, but I found that to be most appropriate. I had expected to find a novel similar in nature to that of Jane Austen's classic works (which I adore), but instead I found something richer and more scandalous. Any fan of great English literature should add Howard's End to his collection. I look forward to A Room With a View."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Speaking as one who wasn't there, I know, but...it seems to me that Howard's End captures perhaps more than any other book the spirit of the early 20th century. It deals with the morality, the intellectual revival and awakening of women and the community, the development of feminism, social mobility, the changing world and neo-imperialism. All these issues are approached through following 3 families over a period of years and life-changing events: the Schlegels, the Wilcoxes and the Basts. The theme for the novel, and one of its protagonist's motto is \\"only connect\\", and indeed by the end of the novel the three famiies have made an enduring connection. The lives of the characters, the time spirit and the detail make it an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Who will inherit England? While Forster's Howard End does not exactly answer this question, it sets out the possibilities. This superbly crafted novel is quite relevant today: how do the actions of the individual citizens of the world's greatest superpower influence the destiny of that nation? For the turn of the century England of Howards End, it is about Empire and money and its corrosive influence on tradition and personal morality; and Forester sets up the house, Howards End, as the curious symbol of England in a transition from an uneasy present to an uncertain future. Characters from different social and economic strata subtly, cunningly, even sub-consciously, compete for ownership of the house. For Forester, Howards End, with its elm tree with pig teeth embedded in the trunk (used by peasants in a former age as a balm for tooth aches) becomes a new type of mythology for England. For a nation radically transformed, and set for yet more change, the house becomes a fixed point, a vestige of an agrarian past which may be set for a rebirth"},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Howards End is one of my favorite books, and every couple of years I pull it down off the shelf to reacquaint myself with it. It's one of those books that has become an old friend over the years.The story revolves around the Schlegels, Wilcoxes and Basts, three families whose lives interconnect over the course of several years and not necessarily always for the better, and at the center of the story is always the country home, Howards End. The book is an amazing study of class distinctions; passion versus intellect; constraint versus action; wealth versus poverty.The Schlegel sisters, Margaret and Helen, are passionate for life; they want to experience as much as they can from it. The Wilcoxes come from a more conservative stock, more it tune with their wealth and possessions than anything else. After a hastily announced (as just as hastily broken) engagement between the youngest Wilcox son, Paul, and Helen, the families find themselves at odds, until an unlikely friendship forms between Mrs. Wilcox and Margaret Schlegel. Upon Mrs. Wilcox's death, she leaves Howards End to Margaret, but the Wilcoxes as a whole do not feel that Mrs. Wilcox was in her right frame of mind and never let Margaret know of Mrs. Wilcox's bequest. In amidst these settings we are also introduced to Leonard Bast, who lives on the brink of poverty and feels that through education and enlightenment he might better his life and that of his fianc&eacute;e, Jacky.There are so many subtle nuances to this story, I have a hard time getting it all down. Forster has created an amazing story that is poignant in its telling and staggering in it depth. No matter how many times I read Howards End, I am always amazed at the intricacies of the story and feel that I take something new away with each reading."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"I'm only 100 pages into it but so far this book is amazing. I have fallen in love with the art of language. E.M. Forster has created a stunning, and though provoking tale. A classic to study and enjoy again and again."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Howards End is a wonderfully written book. I enjoyed it thoroughly. It is a very compelling novel that deals with the conflicts between the wealthy upper class and the less affluent working class of England. The novel is set in the close of the Edwardian Era of England, a time in which these conflicts were flourishing. The Schlegel sisters represent the cultured and sophisticated side of the upper class of England, while the Wilcox family represents the more materialistic and stuffy side of England's upper class. The conflict between these families, which governs most of the book, arises from the dilemma of which family will obtain ownership of Howards End, the estate, after Mrs. Wilcox passes away. The two families are joined by the marriage of Margaret Schlegel and Henry Wilcox. The ownership of Howards End is awarded to the same person for whom it was destined in the beginning of the novel. E.M. Forster crafted a masterpiece in Howards End, and it is a classic that will last throughout time."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"More than a piece of England, Howards End -- the place-- can be seen as a metaphor of the world, and all the people who somehow are related to it, are examples of real human beings. Even though the novel was written almost a hundred years ago, it is still very suitable for this XXI Century. It seems to me that the story is all about the different moral and background that every class of the society had by that time, and the consequences of it during their lives.The main characters are the two Schlegel Sisters, Margaret and Helen, who are keen on arts, books, philosophy, feminism and other things that have a relation with the soul and the thought. After a misfortunated love affair between Helen and the Paul Wilcox, whose parents they met in a trip to German, their lives change forever. Magaret becomes a close friend to Mrs Wilcox, and her sister starts to despise the family. When Ruth Wilcox dies, she leaves Howads End to her friend, but the Wilcoxes feel betrayed and don't follow up the lady's last will. Years later, Mr Wilcox marries Margaret, and in the very end of the book, after a serie of extremely unpleasant events he tells her that Howards End belongs to her.This brief summary I've just done misses a lot in details and the feeling that anyone only gets reading the novel. There are so many brilliant and subtle nuances in Forster's work. His works bounces from comedy to tragedy in a turn of page. I burst out laughing the first time Helen meets Mrs Bast -- a.k.a.Mrs Lanoline. Sometimes, many things are just left between the lines. For instance, I doubt whether Henry Wilcox feels anything for Margaret but guilt for not telling her about his wife's last will. Personaly speaking, I think he likes and respects her but does not love her until when Charles is arrested, that is when he falls apart, and she is there helping him.As I was saying, I see the whole story as clash between the different cultures that each character have . The Schlegels may feel very confortable in the XX Century. They are very open minded, enjoy discussing, and were not afraid of showing what they think or fell. On the other hand, the Wilcoxes are very worried about social position and not used to letting women express themselves. And to represent the lowest classes are the Bast : Leonard and Jackie. He likes arts and books, but his older wife prefers the joys of the world - and Mr Wilcox used to know it years ago.The prose is so alive that sometimes I felt extremely agry with some characters, mainly Charles- the oldes Wilcox boy. He is so snobbish, self-centred and xenophibic. For instance, he doesn't face up the fact to that he's killed Mr Bast and after telling the event to his father , they both go and have coffe, as if nothing had happened. Mr Wilcox is the character who goes though the most drastic transformantion, and in the end he is a vey different man, in many senses.Finally, I love the film version of this book. I only regret I hadn't read the book before watching the movie. I think I would have had much more surprises. But, anyway, both book and film are worth reading or/and watching."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"The characters are rich and compelling, leading the reader to have real compassion for even the more uncompassionate sorts. It is an excellent way to spend rainy afternoons with a cat on one's lap and a cup of English tea by one's side.The primary action focusses upon families ' first the Schlegels, genteel without being titled or particularly monied, but far from poor; second, the Wilcoxes, successful financial class, largely without too much background, and a few additional characters such as Leonard Bast and his wife, struggling working-class characters who, through a misappropriated umbrella, become entangled in and damaged by the affairs of the Schlegels and Wilcoxes.The action throughout much of the novel consists of a study of manners and morals. The elder Schlegel daughter becomes friendly with the dying Mrs. Wilcox, and they become friends of a sort. After the death of Mrs. Wilcox, Margaret remains in contact with the Wilcoxes, eventually being courted by the widower Wilcox. The younger Schlegel daughter, Helen, is much more of a rebel, rejecting the implicit superiority of convention while perfectly happy to revel in the benefits of her station in life. Her sister Margaret lives a bit precariously through Helen (and, indeed, Mrs. Wilcox lives precariously through Margaret). Only the male Wilcoxes seem to be living for themselves, but they are far from attractive characters, more concerned with a subtle greed and propriety that is always ready to assume the worst in anyone beneath their station.Here enters the unfortunate Mr. Bast, a stable if lowly clerk in a bank in the City of London, with dreams of more, but tied to a job and a wife, both of whom will never lead to greater things. Through a minor accident he encounters Helen, and this eventually leads to an affair, which leads to a potential scandal. Bast, unfortunately, has a run-in with the Wilcox son who assumes a gallantry quite out of place, and suffers the consequences thereof.This text explores the dominance of inflexible social structures and moral expectations in the post-Victorian England of the early twentieth century. Friendship, vocation and career, love and marriage, attitudes toward money and property ' all are keenly examined and each, in turn, are found wanting of humanity, until finally the elder Schlegel daughter takes a small but meaningful stand.For those who don't know, Howards End is actually the name of a cottage that features in the book, not prominently, but meaningfully. The text was converted into a film that is quite exquisite, being a well-appointed Merchant/Ivory production a la 'Room with a View' and 'A Passage to India', both also by the same author). Forster is perhaps the quintessential novelist of the English experience in the early part of the last century. His juxtaposition of characters from different social classes and backgrounds, his feeling for his characters (even as they appear to have no feelings themselves, or very repressed feelings by American standards), and his plots that are meandering and uneventful yet interesting and attention-holding make for a style that is very much in keeping with the subject matter."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Howards End is one of my favourite novels. I find myself applying it's quiet little lessons to my life rather often and have gotten to know it's wonderfully winding structure of a story quite intimately. What amazes me is that I am even more fond of the novel since having heard it read by Emma Thompson on a rather long road trip.There were several others sharing a car, some of whom freely admit that they might never have picked up the book or seen the film had it not been for the book-to-tape adaption of this novel. We actually listened to it twice and all agreed the the wonderful story was made even more wonderful and lively by Emma Thompson's wonderful way of reading and her witty of portrayal each character.If you've grown tired of this story, Forster or literature in general, I highly recommend a road trip with these tapes!"},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"An exquisite book. Forster combines a fast, lyrical read with the intensity of a murder mystery. In tight, consistent prose Forster's restraint delivers a scathing commentary on Edwardian England which retains all of its considerable power for contemporary life.The only real question is which to do first, read the book or watch the movie. The rich dialogue of Howard's End, lends it well to movie adaptation and the 1991 James Ivory production is excellent. The casting is so strong that it suffers only from the series of later films in which these actors are juxtaposed to reproduce their magic. I was fortunate to have an eight year lapse after the film so the twists of plot struck with new glee and I could modify, if not supplant, the faces from the film.I can only recommend that both book and movie are both outstandng and neither should be missed."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Beautiful story..

But the missing words were my only reason for not giving this book five stars."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Sisters Margaret and Helen Schlegel are leading fairly conventional lives in London until a couple of events begins to change things in ways none of them can imagine. It starts with Helen's short visit to the very proper, upper-class family named Wilcox, and the recovery of an umbrella belonging to a clerk named Leonard Bast. How these three families' lives intertwine over a period of time is at the heart of this intriguing story.Howards End is the third E.M. Forster I've read, and the best book so far. It's been interesting to read his novels in the order they were written, as Forster's development as a writer clearly shows. Each book creates a more intriguing, multi-layered story. Character development is better, as is the author's finesse with narrative. Those who've read my earlier reviews of Forster's work know I wasn't impressed. I still don't like Forster's style of stopping the story to tell us something about the social condition, or the subtext of relationships, so I skimmed through those parts. I have two more Forster novels on my to-be-read pile.

The perspectives were interesting but the plot draws yawns."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Considered one of EM Forster's finest novels, HOWARD'S END proves less about the condition of a family estate in the country, than the Condition-of-Edwardian England itself. Characters struggle to emerge from Victorian mores and constraints as classes shift or writhe uncomfortably--either to change and improve or to cling tenaciously to their society status. Underlying the theme of class struggle is one of visual, geographic impact; London and city life in general sprawl like an encroaching octopus, gobbling up the once rural landscape. Not content to remain the distant but omniscient narrator, EMF calmly interjects his own views on morality and progress as the story unfolds. Despite its uneven pacing we are drawn into the inevitable collision of the artistic, cultured Schlegels and the practical, wealthy, businesslike Wilcoxes. Can two such opposite families join forces amicably and socially--to their mutual benefit?The Misses Schlegels, Margaret and younger Helen, are suddenly drawn into awkward dealings with two classes unlike their own, Anglicized German status. They become involved with men in the Wilcox family and later with a pathetic couple struggling to make ends meet. Eager to demonstrate social charity and obligation the sisters obtain career advice from Mr. Wilcox (later to become Meg's husband), which ultimately ruins the modest Basts. Who is morally responsible for this debacle? How to rectify it or minimize the damage? Also, should a man's youthful indiscretion be permitted to haunt him and jeopardize his marriage? Why does Helen estrange herself from her beloved sister by preferring to live abroad? How does a mistaken umbrella precipitate a series of catastrophic social events which will ruin one family and threaten the foundation of another?Shunned by various Wilcoxes over the years Howard's End falls into some disrepair, although it is appreciated by watchful old Miss Avery, who loves it as much as the first Mrs. Wilcox. Yet cultured Margaret recognizes its sentimental and beneficial value--only she can cherish it as an unexpected, long-delayed legacy from the previous mistress. But what trials and delays must Meg endure before she can settle there permanently? EMF presents the role of geography (landscape and gentry houses) upon the goals and personalities of his tortured characters. Torn between loyalty to Henry and devotion to Helen, how often must a woman forgive and accept from her husband, in order to maintain marital peace? An insightful, introspective novel about human relationships, striving to improve one's lot and moral obligations for charitable reform. How much should civilization sacrifice in the name of Progress--to achieve these noble Ends?"},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"This is the first book by Forster I've ever read and I enjoyed it a great deal.Forster takes the time to present a world to us while being explicit about what he is leaving out (the \\"very poor\\"). In this book, the lives of the rich, the middle class, and the lower middle class collide. In the first part of the book, the collision is one of ideas and conversation. By the end of the book, it is quite physical and literal. This is the part of the book I enjoyed less, as it felt a bit too much like manufactured drama given the pages that preceded it.The themes of how we should approach the good fortune we inherit (and how we should treat others who have inherited differently) and how we can genuinely connect with other people are more applicable today than ever."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"A true classic!

Coming soon"},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Howards End is a literary masterpiece of the \\"chick-book\\" genre. The plot moves very slowly, especially in the first half, and is largely subservient to the subtle shifts in relationships between the characters, whose thoughts and feelings are often examined in depth. Without spoiling any surprises, Margaret and Helen Schlegel are two independent young women in pre-war Britain whose lives are thrown into turmoil by a series of seemingly random interactions with the very wealthy and very conservative Wilcox family. After a very brief tryst with one of the Wilcox brothers (during which Mrs. Munt provides some welcome comic relief) the sisters are stunned to find the Wilcoxes moving into their neighborhood. A friendship develops between Margaret and Mrs. Wilcox, which though short, has long-lasting consequences. In the second half of the book, Margaret is faced with the task of reconciling her flighty liberal-minded sister Helen with the very practical down-to-earth conservatism of Henry Wilcox.It's only fair to point out that many men will find this novel melancholy and occasionally downright insipid. The relationship between Margaret and her prospective husband is utterly lacking in warmth or even in humanity, and his decision about the disposition of the house around the middle of the book is so contemptible that one just wants him to go away. Indeed none of the male characters are the least bit admirable, and only the hapless Leonard Bast is even sympathetic. The obsession with a sense of place that is at this novel's core is neither sufficiently enchanting nor adequately believable. And the final resolution has been roundly criticized by feminists who see the once-proud sisters settling into exactly the sort of lives that they hadn't wanted for themselves. It's true that Margaret is able to convince her husband of the importance of the \\"inner life\\", but only at the price of his virtual destruction, leaving her, like Helen, caring for a helpless infant. As to Forster's famous aphorism \\"only connect\\", the only characters who really unite on a spiritual level are Margaret and a woman who dies fairly early on in the story.But for most women, this is one of the finest books in the literary canon. Forster's language is superb, and his insight into the female mind is impressive, but what really sets this novel apart is its excursions into the philosophical concerns of modern society. What responsibilities do the rich have to the poor, and how should these responsibilities best be discharged? How do personal relationships fit into the context of a social order that needs leaders, builders, and entrepreneurs? Is the unexamined life really not worth living, or does self-analysis too often result in dilettantism and paralysis? Forster not only raises these questions, but debates them at some length, making this book a perfect choice for an English class or a book discussion group. Guys, feel free to skip this one, although you can always give it to your mother. She'll love it."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"I found the characters to be mostly caricatures; there's no sense that any of them are actual human beings. As a result, there's no change -they're static, and whatever changes they supposedly go through feel completely unbelievable. And while much of the book focuses on how different classes don't truly see each other, Forster commits that same sin himself by ignoring the poorest family in the book, the Basts. Instead of making them seem real, he reduces them to mere plot devices.In addition, Forster, a product of his time, is given to making sweeping pronouncements about the human race. Again, if he intended some irony here (as, for example, Jane Austen, who was so good at shading her prose with those kinds of hints), I'd think better of this book.Novels typically rely on either a solid plot (i.e., the stuff that's happening) or on solid characters (i.e., the stuff that happens in people's inner lives) or both to carry the reader through. I found neither here. At the very least I would like to feel the author's genuine love of language; I can forgive a bad book if it's exceptionally written. I didn't find that kind of prose here. You can skip a good third of the pages and lose nothing."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Simply put, EMF is no Wilde, not even close. His characters are, in a sense, the stock sort of British characters one is well familiar with from PBS productions like Masterpiece Theater, or the Merchant Ivory films of the 1990s. In fact, this book was adapted into a well regarded film by that company back then. Yet, I could not shake free the notion that this solid book would have been infinitely better in the hands of a master like Wilde. There is none of the witty repartee, and none of the ferocious characterization. Yes, Wilde's plays were comedies, while this book is not really a comedy, but I kept thinking, it should be a comedy.Howard's End is the name of a wealthy estate that entails the lives of two clans- the wealthy Wilcoxes and the plebeian Schlegels. There are all of the typical episodes of class envy and snobbery, a possible budding romance between a wealthy scion and a poor girl, and the like, but the meat of the tale kicks off when Margaret Schlegel and the matrician Mrs. Wilcox become buddies, with the old lady hobnobbing with young Margaret's pseudo-intellectual bohemian pals. The two women then holiday at Howard's End, the Wilcox estate, and bond more closely. Mrs. Wilcox then dies, but not before willing Margaret Howard's End after finding out Margaret's clan are about to lose their home....it's the look into Wildean heaven that most undoes EMF. Let me give you just a few samples of the difference. Here is a quote that seems to be quite Wildean:\`It is the vice of a vulgar mind to be thrilled by bigness, to think that a thousand square miles are a thousand times more wonderful than one square mile, and that a million square miles are almost the same as heaven. That is not imagination. No, it kills it.'Note that there is no real hyperbole, the speaker is rather dour. There is a ruing, without a wink. Perhaps a better quote is this:\`What is the good of your stars and trees, your sunrise and the wind, if they do not enter into our daily lives?...Haven't we all to struggle against life's daily greyness, against pettiness, against mechanical cheerfulness, against suspicion? I struggle by remembering my friends; others I have known by remembering some place--some beloved place or tree--we thought you were one of these.'Again, note the dourness and resignation. Wilde, were he expressing either of these sentiments, would have done so with more flair, uplift, and bite. These are not examples of bad prose, mind you. They are good- even very good, and that's the difference- Wilde and his characters are utterly brilliant!A final quote:\`Love and Truth-- their warfare seems eternal. Perhaps the whole visible world rests on it, and if they were one, life itself, like the spirits when Prospero was reconciled to his brother, might vanish into air, into thin air.'I do believe Prospero, in Wilde's hands, would be far from reconciled. But, again, that may just be my lack of weaning from the Master. In short, the tale told is by no means unique, and its preachments rather bald, but it is solidly told, and in comparison to the dreck of recent years one may regard Howard's End as a classic. It's just in light of its contemporaries it shines less brightly.In a sense, this sort of tale, when stripped down for a film or PBS production, works better, because it is shorn of its soap operatic worst elements of unimportant sub-stories, yet, damn it, without the Wildean wit, I ask, why bother to lather up?"},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Perhaps that is too harsh, for Howard's End truly is a beautiful book. It is sharp and cunning and written with craft and texture in unearthing the suppressed emotions of its characters. Gorgeously written, simmering throughout with a subtle and witty prose, sometimes briefly alit with the whoosh of a roaring epiphiny. The grace of the character study is a worthwhile experience . . .But the story . . . So have ya heard this one before? Some guy wants to get married but he's already married or he's engaged to another he's fallen out of love with. The details just don't matter and the constant refrain of the character's endless longing is quiet acceptence complicated by questioning questioning guestioning. The interactions are trivial and often uninteresting, propelled by the unspoken commentary, subdued by the spoken words amounting mostly to rejections. This premise is at times intriguing, coaxed into narrative by the awareness of each of the speakers, but then dims out as they try to change the subject, leaving forever buried that one shimmering moment of light.This is the refrain of this novel, for better or for worse--"},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"I love reading. There is nothing like the printed page. I also love a good movie. In this case, I must definitely say I'll take the movie over the book any day. I will say that I was exposed to the movie first but I don't believe that prejudiced me. I was wanting to view the movie again after not having seen it in a while (it had not been a long while, mind you, because it is one of my favorites) but decided, since I had the book in my library, I would read it first before viewing the movie again so as to discover any subleties that may enhance my enjoyment of the movie further. I had done that with A Room With a View (also by Forster) and it worked fine. I loved the book every bit as much as the movie. Alas, it was not to be the same with Howards End. I have been struggling for the last few weeks (I don't get much time for reading these days) to get through the book. Usually I don't want a book to end but in this case... well, the title of this review says it all. For details on why I feel that way, I refer you to any of the other 2 and 3 star reviews, as they express my sentiments exactly and make me feel better to know it wasn't just me (although I am fully aware that everyone has their own opinion). Suffice to say I will no longer torture myself with trying to get through the book. Instead I will kick back and enjoy, guilt-free, another viewing of a very fine movie.

The plot in Howard's End doesn't progress much outside of an early death and later marraige. You have to have some interest in the characters, but they just weren't very believeable. None of characters convinced me that they could be people from the real world. I kept waiting for someone to say anything that might border on being interesting, but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance. The story is clearly dated and doesn't hold up well so many years later. Living in today's world, it's hard to understand what attracted Margaret to Henry. There definately is an audience for this book. I'm just not a part of it."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"The epigraph to the novel states &quot;Only connect...&quot; and the story is about how folks from different strata of society seem unable to connect &amp; seem especially unable to make the connection between the morality of their class &amp; that of other classes.That said, it is an excrutiating read. The characters are universally unlikeable, the story drags along and the lesson--about folks not obeying the morality they insist on for others--is obvious &amp; not terribly important.GRADE: D"},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"EM Forester was a gay, upper middle class Oxbridge graduate that lived in the Edwardian era. That is blatantly obvious in every word of his writing. This book, its story, and the characters make no emotional connection to the reader. I was thoroughly bored the entire time I was reading this.

It shows an appeal about love and betrayal. The book has the appeal about everyday struggles that people face each and everyday. This book is for an audience that loves drama. The story is about a woman who stops at nothing to find her true love. She doesn't only remains unable to connect in her life, but she also has no power to inspire others to connect. I think that is story is suitable for dramatic plays because it'll touch the audience hearts. The books has a love appeal to it.This story really explains what true love really is. Henry had a problem with his wife's cheating,but he loved her so much, he just dealt with it. He feels that her reasons for entering a marriage relationship with henry was her goal to change him into someone more like herself. Magaret was never satisfied with her love for Henry Wilcox.From the start of her romance relationship,Henry had to deal with the affairs as a business transaction. I consider this book a classic. It really shows an example of trials and tribulations that couples face. I would recommend this book people that loves romance."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"In this 1910 story of Edwardian England, Forster illustrates the conflicts between the superior attitudes of the aristocracy and a developing feeling of obligation toward the \\"lower\\" classes which World War I will soon bring into sharp relief. Margaret and Helen Schlegel are intellectual and sensitive to the arts, with compassionate hearts for those less fortunate. When Margaret, at age twenty-nine, is affianced to Henry Wilcox, the much older, widowed husband of a friend, this conflict of attitudes is brought to the fore. Henry, insensitive and believing himself actually entitled to his family's privileges, is cold and reserved, though Margaret believes that \\"Henry must be forgiven and made better by love.\\"Helen, her sister, a 21-year-old with an enthusiasm for the life of the imagination, has no sympathy for Henry's staid pronouncements and failure to pay attention to the people \\"below him\\" who are dependent upon his whims. When Henry asserts that Porphyria Fire Insurance Co. is on the verge of collapse, Helen and Margaret persuade Leonard Bast, a young clerk they have befriended, to resign his position there, only to have him later \\"downsized\\" out of his subsequent bank job. Henry refuses to accept any responsibility whatsoever and refuses his wife's entreaties to give the destitute Leonard a job.Immensely sympathetic to the economic position of the poor and women, Forster illustrates their financial dependence on those over whom they have little control. Margaret, who secures the reader's total sympathy, must try to educate a close-minded dolt like Henry to be kinder and more empathetic towards the people he considers below him, but she achieves only limited success. When Helen returns from Germany, where she has been living, and Henry and his family discover she is pregnant, Henry's belief that her condition reflects negatively upon himself and his family inspires a disaster with far-reaching consequences.Filled with incisive observations and great wit, the novel follows the narrative pattern of a melodrama, but Forster's sensitivity to both sides--the practical and conservative values of Henry vs. the emotional and idealistic sides of Margaret and Helen--elevates the novel above the tawdry. Henry is a product of his time and his class, but though times are changing, he is too dense to realize it. With the action centered around the Wilcox home at Howard's End, the reader realizes that the estate is a microcosm of the country and that its conflicts are those of the nation. Thoughtful and entertaining, Howard's End still draws in readers after almost a hundred years. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"My review is only for this free Kindle version.

Forster attended King's College at Cambridge; thereafter his family fortune enabled him to live as please. He traveled extensively; dabbled in the celebrated Bloomsbury Group, which included the celebrated Virginia Woolf; and strove to conceal his homosexuality from the general public until his death in 1970. Although he was widely read during his lifetime, a series of films based on his novels prompted a major re-evaluation of his work during the 1980s and 1990s, and he is now considered among the finest English prose stylists of the early 20th Century.Written in 1910, HOWARDS END is the fifth of six novels Forster wrote, and like most of his work it focuses on issues of social class. In this instance, the action of the novel centers on the house Howards End and the three families who swirl through it. The house itself is owned by Ruth Wilcox, the wife and mother of a highly conventional, conservative family. Upon her death, she wills the house not to her family, which she feels will not appreciate it, but to friend Margaret Schlegel. Ruth's husband destroys her will and conceals the legacy from Margaret--but in an ironic turn of events falls in love with and marries her.The story itself revolves around Margaret Schlegel and her sister Helen. Half-German, well educated, and more independent in thought and manner than most Englishwomen of their era, the sisters also become friendly with bank clerk Leonard Bast. In their efforts to assist him, however, they become leading figures in a scandal that threatens the Wilcox family as a whole. Throughout the novel ownership of the house, and the lies and hypocrisy used to retain it, becomes a symbol of class struggle as those who have power and status (the Wilcoxes) seek to retain it and those who do not (the Basts) seek to obtain it.Forster is indeed a great stylist, and although the novel is indeed famous for its themes and symbolism he never places them above story or characterization. He possesses both the gift of straight-forward narrative and delicate touch, and the result is a perfect balance, a pure pleasure to read from start to finish. Although HOWARDS END is not as widely read as A PASSAGE TO INDIA, it certainly deserves to be. Strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon ReviewerStill laughing at the negative voter"},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"None of the characters is perfect, but you can't dislike any of them. I have read this book many times - I studied it at school, which has coloured all subsequet readings. Every time I gasp at what I missed all those years ago. Our teacher skated right over the philosophy and feminism and fashionable ideas about economics and so on that are the backbone of the book. However we studied closely the book's texture and atmosphere: the English countryside, London's railway stations, Christmas crowds in Oxford street on a winter's afternoon. We even (convent school girls as we were) understood more about the difficult \\"facts of life\\" portrayed than the references to Nietzsche.I used to see it as a black and white morality. The Schlegels were spiritual, artistic and nature-loving. The Wilcoxes were obtuse, money-grubbing and morally dishonest - and upheld the British empire, something else our teacher never mentioned. Somewhere around the 25th reading I realised that the Schlegels weren't particularly clever (apart perhaps from Tibby, but his learning and intelligence are presented as sterile), and none of them is creative. Their discussions about politics with their arty friends are quite ineffective. No wonder, perhaps, that confronted by Leonard they see an opportunity to actually DO something at last.Eventually, though, Margaret finds she has a job - as Henry's wife. She succeeds not by her attempts to change him, or her direct and clumsy attempts to get him to see the consequences of his actions, but by her warmth, gentleness, sympathy and affection: qualities the first Mrs Wilcox also had in spades.Henry may represent Colonialism and Patriarchy, but he's also a human being and we can see why she is attracted to him.The end of the story is left rather in confusion: after minutely detailing where everybody spent the night and how they got there, after the inquest this is left blank. Did Margaret and Helen stay on at Howards End (presumably required to stay in England as witnesses in Charles's trial)? Did Henry eventually join them there?Like the best books, you want to know what happened to the characters next. Edward Petherbridge's audio version is wonderful, but he brings out the poetry rather than the comedy. As a completist I may have to listen to Emma Thompson's...If you liked this book, try J B Priestley's Angel Pavement. For background (and the lowdown on Nietzsche) read John Carey's The Intellectuals and the Masses."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"As fond as I am of this novel I cannot recommend this particular paperback Vintage edition. In a work so meticulous and richly crafted as _Howards End_, it's more than a little jarring to stumble across typos and spelling errors in the text. A handsome and attractive volume, such as we've all come to expect from Vintage, but those typos are really unforgivable. By all means read the book, but opt for a different edition."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"I expected Jane Austen and got a very pleasant surprise. Forster uses his characters and their relationships and a launching pad for more philosophical and sociological ruminations. And not in a contrived way, but in the almost intuitive way our own interactions with the people we meet stimulate us, provoke us, and stretch us.And as far as I know, this book is one of a kind in that it treats people with no imagination with dignity and respect. Most of us are aware there is some kind of division in the world between artists and businessmen, and the division has shown up often enough in literature sure enough. But as all producers of fiction are by necessity on the artist side of the division, businessmen are usually the villains, evil at worst and stupid at best, and artists, are, quite naturally, the heroes. Forster is uniquely wise enough to peer into the enemy camp and see beauty and value.My feel is that Forster's characterization at times surpasses his writing ability. This is more praise than criticism; his vivid imagination is able to conjure and follow characters that his pen finds difficult to put on the page. They move and live and act in ways he is unable to fully explain or account for. And when was the last time you were able to truly capture all the complexities, intricacies and contradictions of a real person with the rudimentary elements of pen paper and alphabet? That Forster's characters defy characterization may be a contradiction, but in my book it is high praise.And the way Forster often philosophizes might annoy others, but I do enjoy it. There is a passage early in the book about Beethoven's Fifth Symphony that is thinly costumed to make it fit within the frames of the book, I love it for what it is -- a brilliant exposition on a distinct piece of music. --...Some quotes I enjoyed:\\"It is the vice of a vulgar mind to be thrilled by bigness, to think that a thousand square miles are a thousand times more wonderful than one square mile, and that a million square miles are almost the same as heaven. That is not imagination. No, it kills it.\\" (23)\\"What is the good of your stars and trees, your sunrise and the wind, if they do not enter into our daily lives?...Haven't we all to struggle against life's daily greyness, against pettiness, against mechanical cheerfulness, against suspicion? I struggle by remembering my friends; others I have known by remembering some place--some beloved place or tree--we thought you were one of these.\\" (112)\\"England was alive, throbbing through all her estuaries, crying for joy through the mouths of all her gulls, and the north wind, with contrary motion, blew stronger against her rising seas. What did it mean? For what end are her fair complexities, her changes of soil, her sinuous coast? Does she belong to those who have molded her and made her feared by other lands, or to those who added nothing to her power, but have somehow seen her, seen the whole island at once, lying as a jewel in a silver sea, sailing as a ship of souls, with all the brave world's fleet accompanying her towards eternity?\\" (138)\\"The business man who assumes that this life is everything, and the mystic who asserts that it is nothing, fail, on this side and on that, to hit the truth. \\"Yes, I see, dear; it's about halfway between,\\" Aunt Juley hazarded in earlier years. No; truth, being alive, was not halfway between anything. It was only to be found by continuous excursion into either realm, and though proportion is the final secret, to espouse it at the outset is to insure sterility.\\" (153)\\"Love and Truth-- their warfare seems eternal. Perhaps the whole visible world rests on it, and if they were one, life itself, like the spirits when Prospero was reconciled to his brother, might vanish into air, into thin air.\\" (181)\\"But man is an odd, sad creature as yet, intent on pilfering the earth, and heedless of the growths within himself. He cannot be bored about psychology. He leaves it to the specialist, which is as if he should leave his dinner to be eaten by a steam-engine. He cannot be bothered to digest his own soul.\\" (219)\\"She could not assess her trespass by any moral code; it was everything or nothing. Morality can tell us that murder is worse than stealing, and group most sins in an order all must approve, but it cannot group Helen. The surer its pronouncements on this point, the surer may we be that morality is not speaking. Christ was evasive when they questioned Him. It is those that cannot connect who hasten to cast the first stone.\\" (246)"},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"A man's thesis on women's suffrage against a Dickens-like turn-of-the-century poverty backdrop, and curling the ending into the tragic death of one young impoverished man which culminates with the criminal conviction of a wealthy young man, makes one think Russian novel - makes one think that this was an extremely brave and ambitious project for a British author in 1910.The theme is basic: three children of wealth are led my the matronly eldest sister (Meg or Margaret) who monitors her younger-by-two years man-crazy sister (Helen), and their brother (Tibby) who is their junior by many more years.Over the period of about 6 years, she befriends Helen's beau's mother after the tryst is called off by his father. After the untimely death of the boyfriend's mother, Meg attracts his father (Henry), weds his father, holds house for her brother, Tibby, through his Oxford years, and tries to comprehend the wild antics of Helen. The marriage to the elder husband involves great politicking - all in Edwardian civil obedience - with Henry's two daughters and two sons.The adept ability of the Edwardian Meg to manipulate her senior and aristocratic husband displays how this \\"feeble\\" creature is in control in a seemingly \\"man's world.\\" She is the thoroughly modern Brit who discusses issues like suffrage rights and sexual equality - two topics deplored by her husband and his cronies. But, this independance is what attracts him to her.The civility breaks in the end when her character chides her husband - very legitimately - about how her husband's infidelity is not treated the same as her sister's adultery: \\" You have had a mistress - I forgave you. My sister has a lover - you drive her from the house. Do you see the connection? Stupid, hypocritical, cruel - oh, contemptible.\\" Wow! A woman's place was not to stand behind her man in 1910! And, sure enough, her sister stays and her husband acknowledges her harsh statements, as difficult as they are to hear, to ring true and to deserve acceptance. In good gesture to his character, he swallows this very bitter pill.The last 200 pages move much better than the first 150 pages. This novel improves as the character's personalities become more reflected in the rich and powerful dialogue presented by Forster - a master of dialogue.This book has much more depth than \\"Room With a View\\" and discusses issues still pertinent in this day - not something \\"Room\\" can claim. I would recommend either book, but urge new readers to pick up and read this novel if one must choose between the two."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"\\"Howards End\\" commences with that famous, cryptic epigraph - \\"Only connect.\\" Although this masterpiece delves into a multitude of themes, including class struggle and suffragism, the idea of \\"connecting\\" runs throughout brilliantly. Indeed, the characters in this novel display various levels of success in \\"connecting,\\" both interpersonally and intrapersonally.The novel primarily concerns the Schlegel sisters - sociable Helen and the more practical Margaret. The sisters live in comfort in London (circa 1900) along with their passive brother, Tibby. As members of the leisure class (they inherited money from their parents), the Schlegels spend much of their time mulling over \\"big issues.\\" Margaret and Helen, for example, belong to a women's social club which discuss how to help the poor and other humanitarians themes. In other words, they're forward-thinkers but not much on action.Their world views are challenged when they become entangled with two quite divergent families - the impoverished Basts and the nouveau riche Wilcoxes. The Schlegels initially are attracted to Leonard Bast, an imaginative clerk who seems worthy of far greater things than his lowly job hints. They debate about how best to help Leonard, but their assistance turns into meddling of the worst sort. In contrast, the sisters are rather repulsed by Henry Wilcox, the head of the family and a distant businessman who seemingly has no internal life. The sisters find their beliefs and loyalties to each other tested severely when they become involved with these families.\\"Howards End\\" is among Forster's best work, along with \\"A Passage to India\\" and ahead of \\"A Room with a View\\" and \\"Where Angels Fear to Tread.\\" The characters are largely what make this book such a treat, although \\"Howards End\\" is buoyed by an astonishingly intricate plot as well. The main mystery concerns who will ultimately inherit Howards End, the Wilcox's somewhat stodgy country home; however, the house is a thinly veiled substitute for Imperial England herself. Indeed, Forster seems to be imploring, \\"Who will inherit England?\\" Forster's denouement answers this question most subtly. As is likely to be true for many readers of this book, I viewed the extraordinary movie version of \\"Howards End\\" many years and numerous times before picking up this novel. The novel is, not surprisingly, even deeper and more thought-provoking than the movie. \\"Howards End\\" is first-rate, exhilarating literature."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"The country home called Howards End IS England...and Forster, through this novel, sets out to determine who shall inherit it. To answer this question, the author examines the merits of the prevailing forces of his time characterized by the doomed, brooding proletariat (Bast), the pensive, soul-searching intellectuals (the Schlegel sisters) and the obtuse but prosperous business tycoons (the Wilcoxes). Infused throughout the entire drama is the phantom of Mrs. Wilcox who, like Ben Kenobi of Star Wars, perishes early in the tale yet maintains an even more powerful presence from beyond the grave.A judicious arbitrator, Forster provides a multidimensional vision of all of his main characters, with their virtues and flaws enjoying equal time in the spotlight. But Forster also takes us one step further, demonstrating through the relationship of Henry Wilcox and Margaret Schlegel that love can bring wholeness and healing to the liberal intellectual and the coarse businessman alike. Though one might presuppose the writer's sympathies to lie with the idealist Margaret, he uses her perspective to appreciate the virtues of Henry the capitalist. &quot;He never bothered over the mysterious or the private. The Thames might run inland from the sea, the chauffeur might conceal all passion...they knew their business and he knew his....Some 20 years her senior, he preserved a gift that she supposed herself to have already lost-not youth's creative power, but its self-confidence and optimism.&quot;Although Forster allows Margaret to humanize the Wilcoxes, he refuses to romanticize them. Margaret alone provides the heart and soul of the relationship, picking up the pieces when Henry's material world comes crashing down upon him. The tentative but enduring relationship between Margaret and Henry is encouraging for a politically polarized 21st century America-a timeless reminder that a commitment to love, patience and understanding can still conquer idealogical alienation. And although the proletariat fares tragically, his offspring is perhaps the most triumphant of all. It is through love that all of the diverse inhabitants of Howards End inherit their domain in the end."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"A friend recommended that I read Howard's End and A Room With a View. I have yet to read the latter, but Howard's End was incredible. E.M. Forster has a true talent for characterization. He gives an in-depth portrait of Henry Wilcox, one not to be compared with any other I have ever read. Forster also has an eye for detail. He seems to know that people get too caught up in the plot of a story, and they forget to appreciate the little things. He never fails to mention how beautiful England looks in the spring, or the pleasant state of the weather, etc. Perhaps it does take a while for the plot to develop, but I found that to be most appropriate. I had expected to find a novel similar in nature to that of Jane Austen's classic works (which I adore), but instead I found something richer and more scandalous. Any fan of great English literature should add Howard's End to his collection. I look forward to A Room With a View."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"This is simply one of the most gorgeous novels to come out of the Victorian Era. Though it is not unflawed--and at times, indeed, seems very archaic and even downright offensive--it is a beautiful book.Forster has a creeping wit that sneaks up on the reader, offering subversive little nips at the heels of the social constructs. Obviously, times were different when this novel was written, and some of the gender constructs seem downright simplistic or completely off--but one can almost not tell whether Forster is mocking this very construct, or if he is merely keeping pace with the views of his contemporaries. From that perspective, parts of this novel can be hard to read through the modern eye. (Of course, she gave up her opinions because, being a woman, she doubted that she could possibly be right. . . )However, the overall tone of the book is enchanting; there is a deep satisfaction with finding Home in a house, with little rebellions against complexity (even as the heroines are naturally endowed with the complexities that wealth gives) and a drive toward the simpler life.Filled with plenty of commentary on class and wealth and social responsibility--enough to keep a liberally-minded person sated in spades--the novel also focuses on human connection with fellow man, art, logic, etc. . . Indeed, its most famous line--the one that is so oft quoted--is \\"only connect\\". That pervasive sentiment gives the novel most of its gutting beauty--because how can you not take pleasure in connecting with something that is only begging you to do so? :)"},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"I greatly enjoyed A Passage to India and A Room With a View. Howard's End shares many of their assets - character development, period description, adventure, surprises, cultural and political awareness. However, many of the events seemed disconnected or irrelevant. None of the characters were especially lovable or heroic. The author highlights the difficulties of finding meaning (or a place) in life for a wide variety of individuals. Perhaps the disruption of the historical comforts of a settled social structure is the main message of this 1910 work. Like the other two novels, this work focuses on the frustrations of making meaningful connections with others during a time of change."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"The stories of the two vastly differenct families that represent the disparities in the rapidly modernizing English society--Intellect vs. materialism, idealism vs. pragmatism, art/literature vs. buiness/wealth, and the issues about genders, relationships/marriages, death, fate, and social/economic classes. Yet the inquiries, raised by the Schlegels sisters, particularly by the more pensive one of the two, margaret, and the manner and eloquence in which she asks these questions deeply moved me both intellectually and emotionally as well. I think that she asks all the fundamental questions that are still relevant to all the thinking persons in our time, and her desire of \\"connecting\\" resonates throughout the book. The writing is beautiful, funny, and poignant. This is absolutely a lovely, lovely book."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"For me the wonder of this novel was not in the story or plot as much as in the nuggets of wisdom our author left throughout the piece. Margret shares her views and thoughts on the world and herself with such intuitiveness and insight that it often made me stop to contemplate my own life. Even more, this is a beautifully written novel; I absolutely love the language used by Forster."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"I chose this book because it was on the Best 100 Books List, and it was very enjoyable.

The sisters--who are highly educated, pensive, and artistic--become entangled with the Wilcox family--practical, unilateral capitalists--and the Basts--working class and unassuming. However, the initially subtle differences between the sisters (and how they approach love, misfortune, and personal relations) become more obvious as the novel progresses, climaxing in a scandalous ending that was unexpected from a high-brow English novel. (I think some of the 1 and 2 start reviewers never actually read the novel to its dramatic end) Human nature notwithstanding, the novel's refinement, gorgeous writing, and riveting story-telling prevail to the end. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"On reading the book reviews already on-line, I just had to reply. I have recently read Howard's End for the second time and I have watched the film numerously. It is absolutely fabulous! I have read other novels by E.M. Forster but for me Howard's End is simply the best. Forster's characterization is second to none, describing the Schlegels, Wilcoxes and the Basts with such heart-breaking realism and affinity with human nature. The British countryside is described lovingly yet realistically by highlighting the creeping industrialization. I do not think it is 'dull and cold' or that the characters are 'unlikeable and irritating.'In my opinion they are realistic and likeable if you accept them to be human beings, having both their good and bad points, but I would hope that the good points shine through. Yes, Charles Wilcox is incredibly arrogant and irritating, but these characters all combine to make an excellent plot and a heart -renchingly sad but not a 'happy' ending. Ofcourse we all have our favourites and Margaret Schlegel is mine. Rather predictibly so, but I admire her strength, ability to compromise, tenderness, spiritual connectedness, clear sightedness and individuality. Over-all I think Howard's End is a wonderful read every time!"},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"\`Howards End' is not E.M. Forster's best work and it should not be used as compulsory reading in schools. It is not a vibrant portrait of Edwardian English society. The characters are not wonderful. The novel is rather a boring confrontation of types (not characters), like the cold, cheating plutocrat, the independent suffragette, the bowing servant, the unemployed downtrodden or the germanophile.\`Having a mistress' or \`unwelcome' engagements do not stir scandalous remarks today. They are cheered in popular newspapers with big headlines.Technically, the novel is far from flawless. One example: the introduction, the interventions and the final act of the poor family (the Basts) are clumsy, artificial and improbable, and that all the more in a novel about \`property', where Leonard Bast is an insurance clerk.The overall atmosphere is too sentimental with many overreactions and a lot of superficial dialogues.This is not a good introduction to E.

Incredible how Forster foresaw today - the book is so current. Our society is too full of movement and change; we need \\"only to connect\\" - to connect to the earth, to each other, and perhaps, most importantly, to ourselves.

I love the clarity of Forster's prose in all of his novels. The themes and ideas are wonderfully layered - the depth is such that I've read it at least four times of my own volition and (cliche, I know) found some new facet to appreciate each time."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"E.M. Forster's English characters as never before, exploring the underlying class warfare involving three distinct groups--a wealthy family bound by the rules of tradition and property, two independent, cultured sisters, and a young man living on the edge of poverty. The source of their conflict--Howards End, a house in the countryside which ultimately becomes a symbol of conflict within British society. The seemingly absured fight to gain Howards end, ends with a death, a leaving, and a bastard child."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Howard's End is a book of supreme beauty. Forster has matered the subtelty of the English language and conveys his understanding of aural appeal in every sentence. Howard's End goes much further than merely examining the class strucutre of England. Forster probes into the nature of human existence and human love. He ventures intrepidly into the realm of the unseen, and the spiritual. And, produces a book of the utmost lyrical continuity and depth."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"After about five minutes, you will forget that the only voice you are hearing is Emma. The characters comes alive as the story begins. You can feel the tension as the aunt argues with Margaret. And the relief when Margaret decides to stay home with her sick brother. The Brits know how to do this stuff."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"I really liked this book, and I'm not surprised. I think there is something about the author, E.M Forster that I like. I think it is the way he expresses his thoughts, very clear and once you have read them and understood they are so obvious. &quot;How come I never thought of that&quot; entered my mind a few hundred times while I was reading this book. A lot about England and the English men and women is written in &quot;Howards End&quot; and the beautiful landscape is closely described.It is easy to get to know the characters and once you have done that it does not take long before you either love them or dislike them. The family that this book is about, has different opinions than the rest of the English people during these times. People consider them strange, but they are really just ahead of their time"},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Howards End is a look at the philosophical and socioeconomic state of England prior to World War I. It is essentially told from three points of view: 1). The Schlegel family, wealthy and progressive with socialist ideals, 2). The Wilcox family , wealthy, \\"old school\\" traditionalists, and 3). Leonard Bast, a lower middle class young man seeking to better himself both culturally and socially. Slowly their stories (both past and present) become intertwined and their varying opinions are thrown into stark relief... sometimes in surprising ways. All the while, periodic philosophical discussions take place about wealth, society, gender equality, death. Meh.While it makes for an interesting study of the society and ideals of the time, the essential lack of plot in Howards End left me yawning my way through much it. There wasn't even enough witty dialogue to make up for the lack of action. On Beauty at least had some killer dialogue. As was the case with On Beauty, there is a huge cast of characters, some of whom are well-developed and many of whom barely exist beyond their names and basic relationship to the others. Margaret and Helen, whom the story tends center around, are the only fully developed characters. The others came off as flat and one dimensional. While Howards End made for an interesting period study, its limited characterization and even more limited plot still made it an essentially unsatisfying read.The Bottom Line: I know it's a classic, but Howards End did very little for me. Mildly interesting at best.This discussion originally appeared on my blog. See my profile for details."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Is it my obsession with Jane Austen or do the sisters in Howards End really have many things in common with those in Sense and Sensibility? We have the eldest, governing in the family and also carrying the burden of her unshared knowledge -derived from a mixture of wisdom, fairness and compassion-; and we have the youngest, whose actions are ruled by impulse and who therefore is wrong although she means well. There is also symbolism, so dear to the modernist fiction, which doesn\`t prevent the author from building round, absolute characters that sound like real life. I was very amused by E.M.Foster's worry with globalization -which he calls &quot;cosmopolitanism&quot;- as a tendency opposed to those who want to keep England as close to its origins as possible -i.e. the author himself; actually, the whole novel and its symbolism revolve around this worry.In short, the two sisters sound very much like those in Sense and Sensibility, but E.M.Foster's intention is more intellectual, less social or ethical than that of Jane Austen's"},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Forster's earliest fictional writings were short stories, many of them fantasies about men and women who wanted to escape, from the stuffy social milieu that hemmed them in - from a dry colourless world into an infinitely expanding one. In later works, Forster had them desperately seeking the freedom to respond to a higher call. This higher call was not religious in the conventional sense. E.M.Forster did not belong to any religion, and it is clear that his philosophy of life was man-centred, not God-centred. But personal development was important to him and he passionately believed that human beings need not stay stuck in groove but should be free to develop.Thus, what begins as a collection of seemingly unrelated events in Howards End gradually knits into a tightly woven story of tragic misunderstandings, impulsive actions, and irreparable consequences - and, eventually, &quot;connection&quot;, though Forster leaves the reader free to interpret &quot;connection&quot; as he or she will. &quot;Only connect!&quot; beseeches Margaret Schlegel as she contemplates the state of her soul (and others'). Maybe it is best that we decide for ourselves what form this 'connection' should take.There are happy marriages in Forster's novels, but they do not come as the culmination of passionate love affairs. Forster himself was homosexual and, in view of the repressive climate of the time, decided to confine his less inhibited descriptions of sexual encounters to those between men in his novel Maurice and the later short stories which were not published till after his death. The first sexual incident in Howards End is a fumbled chaste kiss in a rose garden and the only other carnal exchange takes place offstage, its fruit coming as a bit of a surprise to the reader!The proposed marriage between Margaret and Henry is not so much the consummation of physical love but rather a device for bringing together the conflicting ideals of two families, the Schlegels and the Wilcoxes. Weaving its way through the story is the theme of balance, the need to integrate two essential qualities which tend to go to extremes. Margaret Schlegel, the central character, strives to integrate the opposing tendencies.As so often in Forster's work, it is not a question of one or the other, reason or emotion, prose or passion, the outer life or the inner life, but of finding a middle way between the two. The two families are forever contrasted, but the novelist's aim was to bring them together, to bridge the gulf. The Wilcoxes - all except Mrs Wilcox - are for the outer life of business and getting things done, the life, as Helen puts it, 'of telegrams and anger', while the Schlegels are for the inner life of refinement, through culture and personal relations.At the two extremes are Helen Schlegel on the one hand, and Henry Wilcox on the other. For Helen, the emotions and personal relations are everything. Speaking of them, she often echoes Keats famous phrase, 'the holiness of the heart's affections'. In complete contrast, Henry Wilcox says of himself: ''I am not a fellow who bothers about my own inside'. Outwardly he was cheerful and brave: but within all had reverted to chaos'. The whole drama of the novel turns on the conflict between these opposites.Margaret's function is to strive to reconcile them, to bring about what seems an impossible union. She is the one to make the vital connection. 'Only connect...' is the famous epigraph of the novel. She has to 'build the rainbow bridge' as Forster puts it, between the prose and the passion, the prose of the Wilcoxes with the poetry of the Schlegels..It's never easy reading a novel that was written almost 100 years ago. Sentence structures change. Word usage alters - sometimes imperceptibly other times more overtly. Yet Howards End, Forster's 1910 novel, has a timelessness that makes it good for another 100 years yet. And just like Fortser's other works (especially Passage to India), Howards End looks at class, nationality, economic status, and how each of these affects personal relationships.Read it with a sense of relief that, just maybe, things have not changed as much as we might imagine !"},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"The author gets into people's heads.

It is an artistic masterpiece. For those who loveto enter into a consciousness of earlier times and inhabit worlds thatpreceded our own, this book is a revelation, and a gift."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"\\"Howard's End\\" is a typical \\"English\\" novel that takes the tried and true form established by such authors as the Brontes and Austen, and subverts it in subtle and intrinsically 20th Century ways. There is romance, heartache, a house in the country, a clash of the classes, and large quirky families with characters both loveable and deplorable. Yet while Forster includes all the standard elements in \\"Howard's End\\" (named after the aforementioned house in the country- a typical English author move), the themes and tone of this story takes the tradition in a new and thought-provoking direction.The title refers to a house in the country owned by the wealthy and, in many ways, out of touch Wilcoxes. Early in the novel, the Wilcoxes cross paths with a pair of intellectual, forward thinking sisters, and despite having nothing in common with each other, the sisters and Wilcoxes begin a series of encounters that lead to the eventual collision of their personal lives. On the fringes of the action, yet existing at the very core of the novel and its themes, lurk the Basts, a lower working class couple who's very lives and livelihoods are essentially dependent on the actions of both the Wilcoxes (the rich aristocracy) and the sisters (the compassionate liberals looking out for the poor). These three sets of typically English characters collide and interact in a series of coincidences that never seem forced (thanks to the brilliance of Forster), and move the plot in what, when all is said and done, turns out to be an inevitability.Completed in 1910, \\"Howard's End\\" is very much a book of the 20th century. Themes of socialism and class struggle, while never explicit, underlie the actions and dilemmas of the characters. Forster's writing is brilliant, and the conversations between the \\"bleeding heart liberal\\" sisters and the cold hearted business oriented Wilcoxes capture the \\"english novel\\" vibe so dead-on that at times Forster can almost be accussed of mocking them both. In a lesser author's hands, this novel could have been nothing more than farce, but Forster walks that fine line between satire and homage and produces a masterpiece that in many ways signals the end of the \\"English aristocracy\\" and its stranglehold on English fiction.This is a complex, worthwhile read!"},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"In this 1910 story of Edwardian England, Forster illustrates the conflicts between the superior attitudes of the aristocracy and a developing feeling of obligation toward the \\"lower\\" classes which World War I will soon bring into sharp relief. Margaret and Helen Schlegel are intellectual and sensitive to the arts, with compassionate hearts for those less fortunate. When Margaret, at age twenty-nine, is affianced to Henry Wilcox, the much older, widowed husband of a friend, this conflict of attitudes is brought to the fore. Henry, insensitive and believing himself actually entitled to his family's privileges, is cold and reserved, though Margaret believes that \\"Henry must be forgiven and made better by love.\\"Helen, her sister, a 21-year-old with an enthusiasm for the life of the imagination, has no sympathy for Henry's staid pronouncements and failure to pay attention to the people \\"below him\\" who are dependent upon his whims. When Henry asserts that Porphyria Fire Insurance Co. is on the verge of collapse, Helen and Margaret persuade Leonard Bast, a young clerk they have befriended, to resign his position there, only to have him later \\"downsized\\" out of his subsequent bank job. Henry refuses to accept any responsibility whatsoever and refuses his wife's entreaties to give the destitute Leonard a job.Immensely sympathetic to the economic position of the poor and women, Forster illustrates their financial dependence on those over whom they have little control. Margaret, who secures the reader's total sympathy, must try to educate a close-minded dolt like Henry to be kinder and more empathetic towards the people he considers below him, but she achieves only limited success. When Helen returns from Germany, where she has been living, and Henry and his family discover she is pregnant, Henry's belief that her condition reflects negatively upon himself and his family inspires a disaster with far-reaching consequences.Filled with incisive observations and great wit, the novel follows the narrative pattern of a melodrama, but Forster's sensitivity to both sides--the practical and conservative values of Henry vs. the emotional and idealistic sides of Margaret and Helen--elevates the novel above the tawdry. Henry is a product of his time and his class, but though times are changing, he is too dense to realize it. With the action centered around the Wilcox home at Howard's End, the reader realizes that the estate is a microcosm of the country and that its conflicts are those of the nation. Thoughtful and entertaining, Howard's End still draws in readers after almost a hundred years. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Howards End is set in the tradition of the great British novel. Although Forster tackles less politically and morally charged themes here than he does with A Passage to India, Howards End certainly has more heart--naturally, since it tackles the soul.There is also a secondary theme of the approaching women's lib movement, always in the background, but always threatening the men in the novel, especially Henry Wilcox and his brood. Margaret Schlegel is the sort of woman who would be at the forefront on the movement today, but she doesn't know it. Her intelligence and passion for people and creation are inhibited by an early resignation to Old Maidhood--that is, until she falls in love with Mr. Wilcox, the husband of Margaret's late, unlikely mate.Practical and dispassionate, Wilcox is \\"the sort of man who made Britain\\" what it is (one of Forster's pet phrases), yet an emotionally insipid and incompetent patriarch. He is exactly the sort of man women are fighting even today--he doesn't understand women; he doesn't even understand men, except in business.Stalking these very different sides of the British upper middle-class throughout the story is Leonard Bast, a poor clerk with a spark of the greatness the Schlegels value, who hides his authentic humanity behind affectations of culture. Helen's, Margaret's sister's, attempts at patronage are a rather overt stab at wealthy liberal condescension toward the underclass, applicable to limousine libs today.Receding into the past but never forgotten, is the will from Mrs. Wilcox bequeathing Howards End to Margaret--a mystical and unfulfilled last will and testament that haunts the Wilcoxes for failure to comply with the lady's wishestill the end."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"A surprisingly entertaining book. It is simply and elegantly written, and easy to understand and appreciate. There are also more issues than I can begin to discuss simmering beneath the surface. However, one way to read it is a chronicle of the changing culture of England in the early 20th century. It's much more interesting than you heard. I generally don't like recommending books to everyone, but if you are considering this book of your own free will (I assume so since you are reading this review), you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Howards End is a realistic picture of Edwardian England, blemishes and all. Forster successfully depicted the environment of his society few authors could. Forster raises moral questions about what the upper class' social and economic responsibilities are to the lower classes. The method of showing opposing viewpoints (help the less fortunate vs. leave them be) between the Schlegel and the Wilcox families works well. He also questions the double standard at that time in England for infidelity. The upper class males were faultless in affairs, while the lower class females were scarred negatively for life. For the males, the affair was the satisfaction of desires and meant parting of some money. For females, the affairs were a way of life, nothing more, and they couldn't even improve their station in society. They were marked as prostitutes, while Mr. Wilcox actually suffered no real personal damage, other than a deservedly begrudging wife for the short term.I can't help but ask how much has society really changed? The book is still relevant today, not only that, it's a good read. The dialogue is even realistic and touching. Forster's prose flows smoothly, and the reader immediately starts to appreciate it after a few pages. Human nature, snobbery, the struggle of the classes, and family affairs really haven't changed that much since 1910. Forster clearly didn't know what to do about these problems anymore than we do today. Asking his country to face their problems, rather than ignore them, which was what was being done, was a start."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Howard's End begins with a muddle and ends with a muddle - in between, characters from three distinct classes collide and all involved are forever changed. The independent, free thinking Schlegel sisters encounter Leonard Bast, a young man desperately trying to keep from falling into the abyss of poverty. They are determined to help him and pass on advice which they think is sound, but is actually a thoughtless comment, from a wealthy businessman, Henry Wilcox. When Leonard acts upon this information his situation is worsened greatly and the younger Schlegel determines to make things right. Henry's wife, Ruth, scribbles a death bed message bequeathing her family country house, Howard's End, to the elder Schlegel - someone she barely knew, but with whom she made a special connection. Ruth's message is dismissed by her family as a dying woman's delerious last words. This is the set up and it only gets better from here! Forster is a master at weaving complicated stories filled with emotion and irony where even small details can result in major consequences. His ability to create such fully formed characters makes the reader feel strongly about what happens to them. This is a fascinating and bittersweet story which rings true ninety years after it was written. I saw the brilliant Merchant/Ivory film before reading the book, so I was able to envision the characters and settings vividly - I often wonder how I would have felt if I had read the book first. I love this book and look forward to reading it a many more times in my life."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"People don't care so much about manners any more (or perhaps don't have any) so novels of manners are quite unfashionable. Still, this book has a lot of insight into the social conflicts and changing mores of Eduardian England, carried by an interesting plot weaving together the lives of three socially very different families: two generations of the colonial capitalist Wilcoxes, three intellectual Schelegel siblings, and the lower class Basts. A young modern editor probably would be tempted to take out quite a few words but it is very readable for us older folks who are more comfortable with classic literarystyles."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"I have read Howard's End two or three times and listened to it once on tape and it remains one of my favorite novels. Many people were introduced to it by the film, which, good though it was, does not begin to capture the subtle wisdom Forster put into this book. Howard's End can be seen as a quaint period piece about British culture in the early Twentieth Century. On another level, however, it's a brilliant exploration of the human soul. In the Schlegels and the Wilcoxes, Forster has created the perfect embodiment of the eternal conflict between reason and passion. These two families, destined to be united by the marriage of Margaret Schlegel to Henry Wilcox, represent two seemingly irreconcilable aspects of humanity. The Schlegels are artistic, intellectual and impractical; the Wilcoxes materialistic and unapologetically bourgeois. Margaret and Henry have their differences, but it is their relatives who display the more extreme family traits. Margaret's sister Helen is a classic bohemian; Henry's son Charles is a humorless and intolerant banker. As the novel unfolds, the two families are forced to confront each other and decide whether to ultimately part company or compromise. What is most impressive to me about the novel is the naturalness and grace with which the story unfolds. When an author uses characters to embody universal qualities, it is quite a challenge to make the people and story real and not merely symbols. Howard's End succeeds brilliantly as both a thoroughly engaging novel and a rather profound metaphysical inquiry."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"I first read Howards End during the final year of my Undergraduate degree, and it quickly became my favourite book (displacing Wuthering Heights). There is something within it that really speaks to some people --- I say 'some,' because I have recommended it to many friends, and their responses have run the gamut from a fascination similar to my own, to outright boredom and frustration with the book. Personally, I felt I connected with Forster's lament regarding the loss of a sense of place and permanence in the modern world.I must disagree with some of the reviewers here, when they say that the issues Forster tackles have little relevance today. I think what attracted me to this book was Forster's examination of those very issues --- most specifically, the quandry that still plagues us today: how can we live an examined, meaningful life in the entropic modern world? I would argue that Howards End is still very relevant.Forster depicts a society in change, but also a society that is a direct relative of our own. He shows the conflicts of modern VS rural, city VS nature, business/sport VS intellect/art, and smug patriarchy VS proto-feminism. If you identified with the second choice in those four sets, then it is likely that you will very much appreciate the social commentary woven into Howards End, and you will find its sermon of \\"Only Connect!\\" something of a mission statement --- I certainly did.Really, Howards End almost reads like an allegory. The different families (Schlegel, Wilcox, and Bast) each represent aspects of a society in transition, each one lacking some vital component to make it viable. The Schlegels are intellectual but ineffectual (declining \\"old money\\") and are generally feminine, while the aggressive Wilcoxes live in a shallow world of \\"telegrams and anger\\" (ascendent business class) and are generally masculine. The Basts are impoverished, kept from achieving their desires for both wealth and intellectual stimulation by their social and economic situation. Finally, there is Ruth Wilcox, who represents a lost patriarchal rural idyll, which Forster seems to both mourn and criticize at the same time.A large portion of the charm and interest I found in Howards End came in watching these three 'sets' of characters bounce off each other, just as the larger groups theya re meant to represent interact within a society. Whether their intentions are good or bad, they usually end up doing each other harm. The results of these complex interactions are certainly interesting to read. By the end of the book, Forster has cleverly found a way \\"end\\" the conflict and graft what he sees as worthy about each family into one unit, offering an improbable, almost dream-like solution to the problems presented by the novel.Finally, there is this: when it comes to the actual technical aspects of writing, Forster is a master. Whether or not you agree with his social agenda or his philosophies regarding the examined life, you will have no troubles reading Howards End. The prose is clean, clear, and flowing --- just like a mountain stream."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"The Schlegel sisters are interested in the arts and in the more idealistic liberal social movements of their early 20th century world. The Wilcoxes are practical and materialistic. There seems to be little in common between the two families, but not even a highly embarrassing early amorous encounter can keep them apart. Poor Leonard Bast is as idealistic as the Schlegels, but encumbered by an unloved wife with a shady past, he has not their financial means to avoid dealing with the practicalities of life. Caught between the two factions, he eventually is crushed. Only Margaret Schlegel is finally strong enough to bridge the gap between the practical and the ideal by exerting her benevolent humanity, her passionate and yet controlled determination that people must &quot;connect.&quot;HOWARDS END is a minor masterpiece, capturing perfectly the conflict between rigid Victorian values and the more free and open changes in the turbulent years before World War I. Forster handles his characters with great sensitivity and sympathy, yet with a subtle and skillful irony. The novel is not intended for rapid reading, but there is a felicity of expression that is an ample reward for careful perusal. Less fastidious than Henry James, not quite the equal of Trollope in characterization, a more subtle stylist than William Dean Howells, Forster combines some of the best elements of all three of these social chroniclers in an important work that is both highly personal and universal in scope."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"In this 1910 story of Edwardian England, Forster illustrates the conflicts between the superior attitudes of the aristocracy and a developing feeling of obligation toward the \\"lower\\" classes which World War I will soon bring into sharp relief.

The movie is beautifully photographed, faithfully captures the dialogue, and it even gets the comic moments right. But it can't do more than hint at the pleasures of &quot;the real thing.&quot;Every page of the book offers, not just lush landscapes, but ideas worth arguing about. It reminds us that people's actions are bubbles on the surface, the outward and visible signs of events that take place deep within their interior worlds. What's astonishing about this story is how thoroughly it plumbs those worlds. Like Faulkner and Virginia Woolf, Forster has the power to take us way down into the lives of his main characters. We witness what they are becoming, moment by moment. And brooding over the whole story is the wordless, intuitive influence of Ruth Wilcox (the Vanessa Redgrave character) and the power of her love for family and home.A hugely enjoyable book that demands to be read again and again."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"In this 1910 story of Edwardian England, Forster illustrates the conflicts between the superior attitudes of the aristocracy and a developing feeling of obligation toward the \\"lower\\" classes which World War I will soon bring into sharp relief.

Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Class consciousness, a common topic in British literature, is emphasized clearly in \\"Howards End,\\" which draws the class distinctions along very bold social, economic, and political lines. Forster is frank in his observations that such a class system has made Britain the imperial force that it is, but it also paves the way for the worst sort of elitism, which inevitably leads to hypocrisy and the creation of double standards.In the novel, the upper class, the symbol of British imperialism, is represented by the Wilcox family, who own a rubber company that operates out of Nigeria; the novel's title is the name of their country manor, one of their several residences. The father, Henry, is a trickle-down theorist who believes the great disparity of wealth between the upper and lower classes is necessary to maintain the strong economy, a sentiment that is echoed by his callous older son Charles.The Wilcoxes have befriended two sisters, Margaret and Helen Schlegel, who, living modestly off their father's inheritance and not having to work, may be considered middle class. They both are highly educated and idealistic with regard to social reform and equalizing the classes; Margaret the older and more serious, Helen the more frivolous.A conflict arises when Ruth Wilcox, Henry's wife, having spent some pleasant hours and developed a special friendship with Margaret in London, informally bequeaths to her Howards End, which results in a subtle moral paradox: This wish is not legally binding, but isn't Henry dishonoring his wife's memory by dismissing it? The point becomes moot when Henry and Margaret, overcoming their differences of opinion, genuinely fall in love with each other and marry.The lower class is represented by a young office clerk named Leonard Bast who attempts to transcend his social status by earnestly reading Ruskin and attending cultural events -- his fateful first encounter with the Schlegel sisters is at a Beethoven concert. Although his intellectual posturing falls flat with the Schegels, they see him as a model of social change and make him their pet project. However, it is his slatternly wife Jacky who establishes the real significance of his presence in the novel, which is to expose a blatant double standard of which Henry Wilcox freely avails himself.Forster is an excellent empathic writer, able to convey with unusual sensitivity his characters' thoughts, feelings, and motives, rivaling Edith Wharton in this skill. He demonstrated this attribute to great effect in \\"A Room with a View,\\" but I feel \\"Howards End\\" is a triumphant improvement over its predecessor. By using the social aspects of \\"A Room with a View\\" but eliminating the levity and the feeble attempts at comedy, he managed to construct what very well may be considered the definitive Edwardian novel."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"The world of HOWARD'S END is a study of polar opposites: reason versus passion, idealism versus pragmatism, and sentiment versus sense. In E. M. Forster's other novels, he expands on them as well, but in them he does so in a light and bantering tone such as in A ROOM WITH A VIEW or in culturally clashing context as in A PASSAGE TO INDIA. But in the English country-house world of HOWARD'S END, Forster takes a middle view. His focus is on a close up examination of the contrasting and clashing universes of two families: the Wilcox family of reason, practicality, money, and general conservatism; and the Schlegel family of idealism intellectualism, sentimentality, and general liberalism. In such a clash of cultural outlooks, Forster implies that any reconciliation between them can be achieved only at the cost of human tragedy.The Schlegel sisters Margaret and Helen are vacationing in Germany where they meet the Wilcoxes. Rather inexplicably, Helen is invited to visit them in London. Helen accepts, and falls in love with Paul Wilcox, a match of which the Wilcoxes much disapprove due to class differences. Sadly, both Paul and Helen agree not to see each other. Forster here depicts how status can be used as a club to crush human love. Later, the Wilcoxes rent a house that is coincidentally near the Schlegel home. Ruth Wilcox, the matriarch, meets and develops a sincere liking for Margaret and they become fast friends. When Ruth dies, her family discover a letter in her effects that her final wish was to pass her ancestral home, Howard's End, to Margaret. The Wilcoxes disregard the letter and do not tell Margaret of its contents. Ruth's husband meets Margaret, and despite the differences in their ages, status, backgrounds, and political convictions, they fall in love and marry, much to the disgust of his family. Meanwhile Helen falls in love with a disreputable young man named Leonard Bast, who is married to a much older harridan who tricked him into marriage. This woman, again coincidentally, was once the mistress of Mr. Wilcox. Helen gets pregnant by Leonard. Mr. Wilcox writes a will that leaves Howard's End to Margaret just as Ruth would have wished.There is very little of the levity that one finds in A ROOM WITH A VIEW. HOWARD'S END is a dead serious look at a society that prides itself on clean class distinctions, an abiding concern of Forster's, but here his focus is on presenting then unveiling the sources and consequences of those artificially erected barriers that Forster implies are built in to an entrenched and ossified caste system that has little chance to change. The conservative Wilcox family, though tarred with a broad brush of authorial disapproval are not seen as totally in the wrong, nor are the liberal Schlegels depicted as purely driven saints from heaven. Forster is careful to show families in contrast and clash but also families that intersect at critical points of common humanity. As both families emerge either cleansed or sullied, Forster seems to say that both are like everyone else, and that if even clashing cultures can find that point of intersection, then the tragic end of HOWARD'S END need not be replicated in those clashing cultures."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"This is not a review of the book (which is a personal favorite), but of some of the Kindle editions, because all reviews of Howards End are lumped together, and the descriptions under the Kindle editions can be misleading.1) Random House Digital: Kindle version of the excellent 1999 Modern Library Classics edition.

Arrgghh.So, for an enjoyable Kindle read of this endearing book, I recommend one of the above. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Most of Forster's oeuvre examines the confrontation between \\"old England\\" and \\"new England,\\" but none does the job so well as \\"Howards End.\\" Tradition and modernity, wealth and poverty, honor and honesty, the rule of men and the rights of women--the Edwardian age brought these conflicts to the fore, and here Forster portrays the battle through the prism of class warfare.The members of the nouveau riche Wilcox family have borrowed their ideals of privilege and duty from the aristocratic class to which they aspire--but those adopted principles are sorely tested by the bookish liberalism of the comfortably middle-class Schlegel sisters, Margaret and Helen, daughters of a German immigrant. The \\"stiff upper lip\\" of Henry Wilcox has long been immune to the virtuousness of his ailing wife and the insufferable dim-wittedness of his pampered children, but his world is torn asunder by the twin assault of Margaret's reasonable worldliness (\\"a practical little woman\\") and Helen's romantic idealism.A third household--the impoverished, unmarried Leonard and Jacky Bast--represents an underclass dispensable to the likes of the Wilcoxes, who regard them as little more than erstwhile labor (or, we discover, as far worse). For the Schlegel sisters, the hapless couple serves as the beneficiary of their \\"schemes of Social Reform.\\" Although the presence of Leonard Bast at first seems peripheral to the story, his position as \\"protege\\" to Helen's charitable impulses brings the conflict between the two wealthier families to a head when Helen blames Henry Wilcox and her own inference for Leonard's misfortune--and expects them both to make good. \\"How wide the gulf between Henry as he was and Henry as Helen thought he ought to be!\\" That gulf becomes a chasm that threatens to swallow all three families whole.The battle, in Lionel Trilling's phrase, is over \\"who shall inherit England,\\" and Forster's startling ending and even more unexpected epilogue serve as both warning and prediction. Yet Forster's memorable witticisms and gripping intrigues keep the social message from ever becoming heavy-handed (although, granted, the finale depends on a melodramatic, if horrific, twist of fate). For those who have never read Forster, this novel is the place to start."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Three different families with different values due to their place in early twentieth century life are depicted in this novel. The Schlegels are wealthy, cultured and devoted to the arts while the more pragmatic Wilcoxes lead a life devoted to making money and improving their lifestyle. The Basts represent the poorest segment of society striving to keep jobs and live above the debt they accumulate.It's a time of change for all of them. The flighty Helen Schlegel believes she is in love with a young Schlegel she met only briefly but quickly realizes her mistake. Her sister, Margaret, is more practical and analyzes human interactions carefully. The sisters adore each other and are very close but association with the Wilcoxes changes their relationship. Henry proposes to Margaret who accepts. Helen dislikes Henry and vanishes. As this tale unfolds one becomes involved how societal change affects people on different levels with different views of life."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"The book was in fine condition and arrived in a timely manner. I feel perfectly alright about this book.

Great character development revealing the spiritual dimensions of people, especially for Margaret and Helen. Lyrical treatment of place and countryside."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"I wanted to get on here and write a review of this book, since it is one of my favorites. Of course, the movie is a masterpiece as well, but the book is top notch. I was assigned a reading list in college, and this was on it. Since then, I've read the book again. The novel is so well conveyed, in terms of character, plot, and mood, it is difficult to find an equal. I highly recommend this masterpiece without it being 'assigned' (via school). I can't even remember my professor's name now, but this book I'll never forget. Thank you teacher!"},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"It took some work for me to get involved in the book. It is set in early 1900s in and around London. With those times and customs not being familiar to me, I had to concentrate on my reading, particluarly through the first half of the book, to get my grip on the story and characters, but it was worth the effort. So much happens in the characters' lives in the second half of the book, and I certainly couldn't predict the ending. It was worth the effort of my initial struggle. If you find yourself in a similar circumstance, try to wade on along, and you will be rewarded. Although there are summaries and analysis out there to assist, I recommend going along on your own because those aids give away so much of the story line."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"I am writing this review weeks after finishing the book. So please excuse the generalization. Although I found the prose to be beautiful, the story line was slow moving. I understand this was written during a different era, so perhaps this would have been considered a page turner nearly a century ago. However, it was interesting to compare society's perceptions of infidelity and having a baby out of wedlock during Forster's time to those of today. Really, things are really not that different!"},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Howards End is a powerful allegory demonstrating how people of different social classes had developed varying world views and philosophies of living in pre- WWI England. The Wilcox family are pragmatic , business oriented and purposefully active in material affairs. The Schlegels are old money, leisured , and drawn to the arts and cultural activities. Finally the Basts are a working class couple fallen on hard times.As the story progresses these three seemingly disparate families with their very unique perspectives are drawn together by circumstances. Their lives intertwine in a very complex web much of which wraps around the Wilcox' s country property Howards End.Forster in my view seems to bring a more sympathetic view to the Schlegels and portrays the Wilcox family , particularly the father, as so concentrated on material concerns as to be out of touch with those around him. The Basts are focused on survival and drawn into this by the most insignificant coincidence, yet they are in some respects the catalyst for much of the conflict in the novel. The lives of these families are synthesized in the end in ways that are quite surprising and would never have been foreseen by the reader at the start of the novel.Using the Schlegel and Wilcox families to represent the societal conflict between materialism and the inner life , EM Forster created an allegorical story of great depth and insight. For those who enjoy the classics this shouldn't be missed."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"This is my favorite Forster book. I enjoyed it even more than \\"Passage to India.\\" He not only answers earlier English novels here, he creates a world and characters in a family that stick with a reader long after the final page. My suggestion after finishing this is to read Zadie Smith's \\"On Beauty\\" to see how she answers Forster."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"How is it that Forester can deliver a layer-cake cross-section of English society, politely critique his countrymen, throw in a smattering of culture and a discussion of its merits, blend in an atypical \\"love\\" story, some sensational gossip, an unplanned pregnancy, and several off-stage deaths, yet deliver an engrossing novel that is as literary as it is soap-operatic? Does anyone write at this caliber today? Forster interweaves 3 families of different classes to discuss the question of who shall inherit England. Shall it be the old-money German imports, the Schlegels, who care more for culture and nuance since they don't have to earn a living, or the industrious but artless Wilcoxes, who care only for money and property, or the working class Basts who have neither money nor position and must rely upon those above them for support? This novel seems especially poignant today as the financial crises has separated the classes; money, in Forster's world as in ours, segregates the survivors from the chaff; the poor do not fare well. Margaret, the heroine of the story, is able to strike a compromise between the disparate worlds, staying married to one of the newly rich who has fallen from grace, keeping her unwed and pregnant sister despite the contempt of society, and creating her own universe at Howard's End far from the reach of London's social snobbery to live out her mature years. Still further from the epicenter is Paul Wilcox, who leaves for India to find his own fortune, and young Tibby Schlegel, Margaret's brother, who can easily be viewed as the author; these two perpetual and self-determining bachelors are as removed from the fray as possible and ignorant of society's foibles. Perhaps the future of England lies with gay ex-pats?"},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Having been enthralled by A Room With a View, I expected a similar experience with Howards End, especially since it is hailed by many as Forster's masterpiece. By the time I reached the climax, I discovered that the piece did have quite the impact on me. Forster's critique of the social tenets of turn-of-the-century life in early 1900s Britain is certainly progressive. It is positively eye-opening, if one is willing to imagine the stir it would certainly have make upon readers in Forster's age. While not even coming close to being as good from start to finish as A Room With a View was to me, Howards End seems to be the most important of the two novels.Because of the lack of immediate page-turning storyline, patience is certainly the most important virtue a reader requires when approaching this novel. However, Forster's writing style is extremely easy to follow, which helps to delve into the story. This is helpful because the story seems to drag for a majority of the novel, leaving the reader wondering where in the world Forster is planning on taking them.One of Forster's core beliefs concerning the novel was that plot was of minimal importance. Plot is simply to serve as a means-to-an-end--it is a device simply utilized to suggest a broad social critique. When the novel is concluded, it becomes clear this is the case with Howards End. Characters such as Leonard, an insurance clerk of the lower echelon of Britain's socioeconomic ladder are presented as incredibly complex, but developed briefly and not touched upon for large chunks of the novel. Leonard lacks intelligence concerning fine art, but not or lack of trying. After encountering Forster's two protagonists who are of a high-art, liberal (and borderline feminist) persuasion, Leonard desires to increase his knowledge of art and fiction, and begins to resent his simplistic wife, who represents everything he loathes within himself.Leonard's complexity comes to us in the span of two short chapters and is not touched upon for most of the novel. I had a sense of him being key to the conclusion of the story (and was correct!), though I had no idea how. Because of his disappearance from the plot, much of the novel, especially the middle bits, seem to needlessly drag. I almost began to hate reading the novel, but the last one hundred pages turned brought me back around and caused me to love the story, and the points Forster made.The core of the story deals with political struggles. The liberal Schlegal sisters alternate between being disgusted by the aristocratic and conservative Wilcox family and admiring them. The Schlegals are introduced to the Wilcoxes before the story even begins. They start to constantly intersect the Wilcox's affairs both intimately and casually. The first chapter describes to us how the youngest sister (Helen) hastily becomes engaged to one of the youngest of the family. The engagement quickly turns to be a sham. Besides, with their alternating world-views, would it have worked out anyway? After this, the Wilcox family becomes a constant physical, emotional, and even spiritual presence in the sisters' lives, fueling the banter of ideas between the two clans. The Schlegal sisters (mainly the older one, Margaret) come under their influence and begin to question their own ideals, such as the belief that women should someday be allowed employment the same as men.The banter between the two families serves as much of the entertainment of the novel, but because of the length of the book, it becomes exhausting. Luckily, Forster saves his reader from utter boredom with the final third of the novel. This concluding section tackles taboo (for the early 1900s) subjects such as pregnancy out-of-wedlock, and how societal reactions negatively impact the pregnant woman in question. Many pieces written circa the same period (the book was published in 1910) would be undoubtedly condemn this type of woman as a harlot who is not fit for Christian society. Forster remains hopeful on the subject, treating it with compassion and acceptance. He urges his society to do the same, which for the time was quite a bold statement.Like all Forster novels, Howards End is tame when compared to what is being written today. However, if this novel is read for the time piece that it is, it should be an all-together inspiring experience. It is comforting to know that people such as Forster existed in a time of intolerance. His works were anything but groundbreaking."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Howard's End can be read again and again and again - and the reader comes away with something fresh each time. Like all of Forster's tales, it's concerned with the deep and petty differences in the various classes of English society, as well as economics and education, and how these issues come to affect personal relationships. Set in the early 20th century, Howard's End follows the two Schlegel sisters. Margaret, the elder, rather suddenly finds herself engaged, then married to Mr. Wilcox, a much older widower, a rather superficial and bombastic English gentleman. Meanwhile, her sister, Helen, becomes involved in politics, good works, and the attempted salvation of Leonard Bast, an impoverished clerk and intellectual. The ownership of Howard's End, the country estate of the late Mrs. Wilcox, becomes central to the story; the wrangling this bequest causes is a metaphor for the class struggles that weave like tangled braids throughout the whole of the book. The tragedy chronicled in the book is seen to have resulted from chance encounters, foolish pride, and petty misunderstandings.A deeply sad and beautiful book."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"I love Forster. This was the second book I read by him, and although it wasn't my favorite, with Forster it's difficult to pick a favorite. This critical edition contains supplementary information, including diary entries from Forster, reviews of Forster etc. Get more book for your money."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"just started on the book but am enjoying it immensely. i found out about it through a film review class i was taking last semester. so far, a great read."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Forster's famous novel made the century's top 100. This is the story of the Schlegel family which consists of three young adults: Margaret, Helen and their effeminate brother Tibby. They are passionate for the arts and care about the poor.The Schlegel's befriend the Wilcox's. They are the opposite from the Schlegel's: they are extremely wealthy and scorn the poor. Through the course of the story Margaret becomes engaged to the widower Mr. Wilcox. They eventually marry, but Margaret realizes that Mr. Wilcox is not what he is all cracked up to be. He was an adulterer in his previous marriage and Margaret finds herself comprising her values and interests to please Mr. Wilcox and keep face.Tragedy accompanies the story when Helen and Margaret befriend Leonard Bast: a poor worker caught in a forced marriage. The Schlegel's try to help Leonard, but each time they do it ultimately makes matters worse for him. In addition, Mr. Wilcox is somewhat responsible for Leonard's problems (although Wilcox would never admit to it).Forster writes a story about the social classes and the problems between the rich and the poor. In addition, Forster mentions woman's rights. I did enjoy the book for the most part. Although, I was thrown off by the many disjointed events that took place. They do come together at the end of the book, though. Also, I had a bit of a hard time reading parts of it -- as the story tended to drift and lose focus. The book is worth reading, especially if you like British literature. Forster's descriptions of the English countryside also are well done and the characters are engaging."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"You can't get more English than this! Although Forster's novel can be painfully honest in its depiction of the pathetic intricacies of the British class system, it is nevertheless a hugely enjoyable read. I found it a lovely yet immensely cultured and learned book. Forster has amazing descriptive powers. I actually enjoyed this novel more than 'A Passage to India' which I understand is usually considered his masterpiece, but I would recommend both as brilliant evocations of early 20th century British lives. Oh, and 'Howard's End' makes a great film too."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"With my new iPad, I was very interested in downloading some \\"freebies.\\" One thing I am very interested in is whether I should be downloading books with Kindle (the app) or iBooks (in iTunes).Well, both versions have pros and cons. For this book, I went iBooks.Both versions have identical text (I believe the text is from Gutenberg) but the formatting on both DRIVES ME CRAZY! My biggest complaint with the Kindle is the wide amount of space between paragraphs. Every paragraph is followed by TWO BLANK LINES. Even reducing the font doesn't make a difference...The iBooks version, however, doesn't use \\"smart\\" quotes and the dashes are merely two hyphens rather than the unbroken longer dash. (the 'm\\"dash). The paragraph indent space also varies, which drives me crazy too. It also seems like apostrophes are missing ..."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"Merchant/Ivory made a good film out of a mediocre novel. As usual with Forster, there are no characters I can really identify with or like too well. At least in &quot;A Passage to India&quot; the portrayal of the vagueries of life in India was masterful. Here it's just a competent comment on class. And has anyone noticed?: The final sentence is lousy."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"If you are only going to read one novel by Forster, this is not the one. Instead of a cohesive plot, \\"Howards End\\" consists of a series of aphorisms loosely strung together by a rambling plot. The characters themselves are not particularly interesting, and the issues that Forster chose to focus on (Socialism v. Capitalism, Women's Suffrage, etc.) are dated and of little interest today.The aphorisms themselves are interesting and perceptive, but reading them has a jarring effect on one's enjoyment of the novel, since they literally appear on every page, often several times.A far better novel is \\"A Passage to India,\\" which deals with timeless themes (although within a contemporary context), and offers a more structured plot and more interesting characters. This seems to be the generally accepted view, although the Vintage paperback edition of \\"Howards End\\" does quote Lionel Trilling (the leading expert on Forster) as being of the opinion that \\"'Howard's End' is undoubtedly Forster's masterpiece.\\" One suspects that this quote was taken out of context.For pure enjoyment, I liked \\"A Room With a View\\" best. It reads smoothly, and for anyone who has visited Florence, will bring back happy memories."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"I got this book out of the library when &quot;A Room With a View&quot; was not to be found, and I thought it was fine.

Then I read &quot;A Room With a View,&quot; and I have to say that comparing the two books makes &quot;Howards End&quot; seem dull and cold and drawn out and the characters unlikeable and irritating. If you want to read a great E.M. Forster book, Read &quot;A Room With a View,&quot; which is truly a beautiful novel."},{"Title":"Howards End","review":"I read \\"Howard End\\" about a month ago. I chose this book because of its attactive and classic cover which is out standing. I quite like it because the author had shown the real representation of British society that classified to upper, middle and lower class society. It has specific manner and life style which is absolutely different in each of the classes. The viewpoint of this book is to sympathize the poor, keep a promise, good deed procreate good returns and bad deed also procreate bad returns, which I have learnt so much from this book."},{"Title":"Programming AutoCAD in ObjectARX (Autodesk's Programmer)","review":"While I agree with the previous words, I must add the following to their reviews: If you are not comfortable with C++, don't even look at this book. The first thing you will see is that rather than:Private Sub Command1_Click() MsgBox &quot;Hello World!&quot; End Subyou have instead two(!) pages of code to even register the Hello World application in the proper ObjectARX (class-based) method. Add to that the fact the the ObjectARX model uses a mind-boggling array of macros, includes, etc, and you will quickly feel out of your depth.There are VERY good reasons to do ObjectARX programming, most of which have to do with the ability to add your own custom classes to the AutoCAD object model, and creating your own entity types from scratch. If you don't need to do that yet, go get a beginning VC++/MFC book and study that. Meantime, VBA is extremely fast for all but the most demanding applications, and is worth very careful study.I would also add: AutoCAD has some of the BEST documentation in the world. If you have already downloaded the ObjectARX SDK (which I assume since you are perusing a book about it), don't overlook the excellent documentation in PDF format. Not many people know about it, but it is there if you look."},{"Title":"Programming AutoCAD in ObjectARX (Autodesk's Programmer)","review":"This book is a must for anybody who wants to learn ObjectARX.

The author does warn of that in the beginning, and this reviewer believes it is worthwhile to stress again. The reader should be at least an intermediate programmer in C++. It is further recommended that the reader have a good understanding of Microsoft MFC as well. The author assumes the reader has these minimum competancies as he does not waste space trying to teach them.Having said that, this reviewer started writing ObjectARX applications within the first 2-3 weeks of reading the book. The author provides sound basics and good examples. It covers many topics within the ObjectARX environment but does not go into great detail on any particular one. The book assumes that the reader will use the on-line reference to find out the nitty-gritty on a particular item. Admittedly, this reviewer found himself after the first month of programming relying primarily on the on-line reference provided with ObjectARX, rather than the book. Still, the book gets you pointed in the right direction. The biggest complaint this reviewer had, if he had to name one, is the index.

There's a variety of recipes for jams, jellies, soups, sauces, salsas, chutneys, etc. And to top things off, there's an excellent chart at the back of the book that covers every type of food you can imagine along with its USDA recommendations.

We see them in full, pioneers, bigots, fathers and husbands.The way that they have survived the changes in their lives says far more about their character than any penny-ante poem or polemic. Kahn lived and worked with these men for two years, and his achievement is that he makes us feel that we knew them as well as he did."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"\\"The Boys of Summer\\" is actually two books. The first book is sweet, lyrical, and compelling. It's mainly about Roger Kahn's two years traveling with the talented but hapless Brooklyn Dodgers, a team that's memorable because it starred Jackie Robinson, the first professional black player ruthlessly taunted by the other players for being so. But Roger Kahn also discusses his fascinating childhood growing up in a devoutly literary Jewish household where he was forced to recite poems and read books, and where Shakespeare and Dickens were more familiar names than any of the great baseball players of the age. He also discusses his days as a cub reporter, and the silly misadventures only a cub reporter can get into with senior editors in a large, bustling metropolitan newsroom. Roger Kahn's poetic writing in this first book illustrates the profound influence growing up in a literary household can have on the thinking and writing of an individual.The second book is far more problematic, and towards the end of the book Roger Kahn disingenuously explains how he came to write this book. He had a family to support, and monthly alimony checks to write, and the Saturday Evening Post -- the magazine that treated him so generously -- had just closed down. So Roger Kahn basically spent every last dollar he had convincing a publisher to take him seriously as he traveled around America, tracking down the members of the Brooklyn Dodgers, and telling their stories thrown their own words. The theme that was supposed to tie everything together was Jackie Robinson, and how everyone coped with having him on the team and what it meant to each individual. But it seemed that all the others (even Jackie Robinson) were too obsessed over their own fortunes or misfortunes to care that much about the past, and in the end each chapter comes across more like a radio interview rather than structured and polished prose.The main issue with this book is that you have to care a lot about baseball, and especially about the Brooklyn Dodgers to enjoy it. And even if you were to care about baseball you probably care more about current players than players whose statistics and records have long been eclipsed. Thus is the great danger of writing a sports book -- you're always writing about Gods that will be eclipsed by greater Gods soon enough."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"From 1941\`1956 The Brooklyn Dodgers were the best team in the National league. The 1952 season is the main season which is good since the 1952 seris was the best. The history part is interesting the way things change between Roger Khans first trip to Ebbets feild and the last game there. Roger Khan is a good story teller his retelling of games and the part where he goes to see the players years later is the best ive read it says a lot about us all."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"The &quot;Boys of Summer&quot; is a fascinating book. Roger Kahn vividly descibes his days with the likes of Robinson, Reese, Durocher, Labine, Erskine, Cox,Black, Campenella."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"This book is about more than just baseball, it is about life. The effects of this great sport are felt in everyday life by real people. The Boys of Summer makes this connection and any person that thinks they are a true baseball fan must read this book"},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"I first read this book when it came out in the early 70's. I just reread it. Both times were very enjoyable.The book is widely acclaimed as one of the best baseball books ever. I agree. Kahn combines a lot of info probably of interest just to baseball jukies, but he combines it with a lot of other stuff that would appeal to most anyone. He builds a lot of the book around Jackie Robinson and all that Robinson's coming into the National League involved. I think the book is especially ejoyable to \\"readers of a certain\\" age who remember when the Dodgers played in Brooklyn. Very recommemded."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"This is the very best baseball book I have ever read. It is well-written, funny, sad, pathetic.the only part I sort of skimmed over was the many pages it too Kahn to describe how newspapers found their way through the process of writing, typesetting, editing, printing, folding, binding and delivery. That part could have easily been left out. But when he starts to travel around the country to visit retired members of the Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950s, that's when it got rich. I highly recommend this book"},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"I am not a Dodger fan, but I really enjoyed reading this book about men who played the game for the love of the game. Very well written, especially for a sports book."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"The person i bought this book for liked it very much.However, i was very unhappy with the shipping. Even though i was told it would take longer to receive, my past experience has been that it arrives much sooner. It took 16 days to arrive. i paid $4.99 for shipping and there is no excuse for it to take that long."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"While it's tempting to say simply that is the best baseball book ever written (I happen to think that it is), such a statement would do a disservice to the book. It's a great book -- period.Kahn's memoir of his life in Brooklyn and in the world beyond is really three books in one. First, it's an evocative story of growing up in the '30s and '40s in an intellectually challenging household that somehow (much to his mother's disgust) centered around the exasperating study of the Brooklyn Dodgers.Second, it's the tale of a young writer who at an astonishingly young age found himself covering the team he loved during two bittersweet seasons ('52 and '53) that ended in agonizing seven-game World Series losses to (who else?) the New York Yankees.Third, it's the story of how this no-longer-young writer went back to find the Boys of Summer long after their careers had ended. This is the most poignant section of the book: Kahn's finely etched portraits of the heroes of his youth, now ordinary men leading ordinary (but compelling) lives.What sets this book apart from the vast majority of books written about baseball (sports in general, really) is Kahn's respect for his subjects. Jackie Robinson, Pee Wee Reese, Carl Erskine, Duke Snider, Roy Campanella, et al., emerge as three-dimensional characters capable of heroism and strong-willed determination as well as bitterness.To recount the individual stories contained in this book even briefly would not do justice to the book or to its subjects. It's a book best savored slowly, allowing its resonance to work its magic. The story of a vanished world and a vanished team, &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot; recreates both so vividly that between its pages, neither will ever die."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"My mother brought this book years ago in a three books for a dollar deal. The other two are long gone, unread and forgotten. Between my brother and myself we read The Boys of Summer so thoroughly the copy we had split down the middle and eventually fell apart. One of the first things i did when i visited the US a while back was buy another copy of this wonderful book. At the very core of it lay two themes,courage and frustration. It covers Jackie Robinsons team of the early 50's. They were good but never quite good enough. Like the modern day Atlanta Braves the Brooklyn Dodgers kept running into a juggernaut called the New York Yankees. They say that for every winner there is a loser. Thats not true. For every winner there are thousands of losers. Only one team/person can hold up the trophy at the end of the season. The Brooklyn Dodgers of the early 1950's represent the rest of us, the also rans. Roger Kahn brilliantly brings those days back to life and by then covering the men after their glory days are long behind them the book transcends sports and becomes a study of humanity in all its fraility. The fact that the Dodgers moved away not long after finally breaking through in the World Series only intensifies the tragedy of it all. It says something that a white boy growing up on the other side of the world can come to admire someone like Jackie Robinson, the first black man to play Major League Baseball, whos deeds and presence are discussed at some length in the pages of this book. He is my only hero. The Boys of Summer is a classic. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"This is one of the books that I had considered reading since I was a young man in love with baseball for the first time. In a sense, I'm glad I waited all these years to finally read it. I think that I would not have enjoyed it at 14 the way I did at 28. The book is beautiful elegy and mediation on a time long gone and the men who made up it's glory. They bear littler resemblance to the stars of today. I grew up with stories of the '52 World Series and the Dodgers. This book gave me the gift of being able to exprience a bit of what my grandfather and father shared on that October day in 1952 as Joe Black took the mound against the Yankees. I've always held the Dodgers in awe (the BRooklyn version at least) and this book allows me to see the men who made up those times as real people. Pee Wee Reese emerges as Kahn's hero in the baseball parts. I would argue that his father, Gordon, was almost as heroic to him. It is beautiful book about boys, their fathers, and the ties that bind us to what is still, even in this day and age, the single greatest game ever invented. This is a classic that should be read by every fan. Thank you, Mr. Kahn."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"This is easily one of the best 5 books I've ever read. Although the book is obstensibly about the 1955 Brooklyn Dodger World Champions it is really about what happens to people (not just ballplayers) after they've reached their peak. The names are well known to anybody who follows baseball and one --Jackie Robinson-- to anybody who is familiar with American culture. Those names and their exploits are the hook, but what happens to the team members after their glorious victories are funny, sad, inspiring, depressing, poignant and always moving. Roger Kahn beautifully captures the sunsets of the lives of the people who were the '55 Dodgers. I'm a bit biased because I'm a lifelong Dodger fan (born in the year the Dodgers moved to L.A.) and I, of course, love baseball, but whenever I put down this book I felt I wasn't reading a &quot;sports&quot; book (a genre unfairly looked down upon). I was reading about Life. I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"Roger Kahn was the beat writer who covered the Brooklyn Dodgers of the early 1950s. This book tells the story of how Roger got the position he did and his experiences with the players. A really great depiction of basball in its hey day. Kahn really captures the essence of a simpler time in sports. The second part of the book is a great look into the life of a ball player after he has retired. Kahn tells of his visits with such Dodger greats as Pee Wee Reese, Jackie Robinson, and Gil Hodges after the end of their playing careers. And amazing book highly recomended to not only Dodger fans, but baseball fans. This book is easily one of the best wirtten works on Americas most notable past time."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"To use a bit of a cliche, saying that is just a book about baseball is like saying Moby Dick is just a book about a whale. The Boys of Summer deals with one man's different perceptions of baseball players over time, as they change from demigods to mere mortals.The book starts with Kahn's recollections of childhood, when the Brooklyn Dodgers were heroes. As he reaches adulthood, he is lucky enough to get an opportunity to report on his favorite team, and he learns that these players are more flawed than they seem at a distance. In the second half of the book, it is years later, and Kahn sees what retirement has done to the players.There was a time that baseball was the dominant sport in the U.S., and there is something sad in seeing these idols - worshipped by kids and adults alike - forced into mundane existences by age. There is more: a lot of insights into racism and various players reactions to integration in baseball.This is a great book about the Boys of Summer, those Brooklyn Dodgers who played great ball from 1947 to 1957. For fans of baseball, this book is a must-read."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"As a former sportswriter who once covered the Dodgers, I can vouch for the authenticity of Roger Kahn's excellent book about the fabulous Brooklyn days and the tenacious loyalty of Dodger fans. While I did not cover the Dodgers until they reached their next and current home of Los Angeles, I had heard and read much about the great Brooklyn heritage and was delighted to read a book by a talented sportswriter who covered the Dodgers during that glorious period when New York City had three exceptional major league teams, the indomitable Yankees, likened to General Motors for efficiency, and who were situated in the Bronx, the Giants located a short trip from Yankee Stadium over the East River bridge in the Coogan's Bluff area of Manhattan, where they called the Polo Grounds home, and the Dodgers, who played to packed throngs of 35,000 roaring fans at Ebbets Field on Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn.One of the most informative portions of this book was Kahn's revelations about the man who changed professional sports, Jackie Robinson, who broke the color line by becoming the first African-American to play in the major leagues. A fiercely proud man who fought hard for civil rights, through Robinson's lobbying Southern parks where the Dodgers played exhibition games abandoned Jim Crow policies of forcing African Americans to sit in separate sections. Robinson is described in one instance reprimanding thankful African Americans who thanked ushers for allowing them to sit with the general populace. &quot;Don't thank them,&quot; Robinson called out from the field. &quot;It's your right.&quot;Kahn describes the tensions of tough pennant drives in the dog days of summer. On one occasion he is concerned that the combative Eddie Stanky, who has taken exception to what Kahn has written, will attack him physically. In another instance he does his best to calm an angry Duke Snider from attacking a writer with whom he has become upset. Kahn expresses concern that the strong, athletic Snider might seriously injure the writer and get himself in a great deal of trouble.The fifties period described by Kahn was one where three great centerfielders in one city would all be honored with induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Snider was a fixture in centerfield for the Dodgers, while Willie Mays played the position for the Giants, with Mickey Mantle assuming it for the Yankees. All possessed great power with the bat and the exceptional fleet footedness of players playing a position where covering a great deal of ground defensively is a must.Kahn knowledgeably addresses the qualitative factor with the Dodgers and the Yankees. During the fifties the Yankees and Dodgers met in the World Series in 1952, 1953, 1955 and 1956. During the forties the teams had met in the post-season classic in 1941, 1947 and 1949. The Bronx Bombers won every series save one, the 1955 showdown when 22-year-old rookie lefthander Johnny Podres blanked the vaunted Yankees 2-0 in game seven, which marked the first and only World Series victory for the Dodgers during their Brooklyn existence. Kahn breaks down the two teams, concluding that the Dodgers rated a close edge among the regulars but that the Yankee advantage stemmed from superiority in the pitching department.If you love great baseball writing, this is one book you do not want to miss. Kahn sets down his interesting facts with a thoroughly readable lucidity."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"Never really a dedicated sports fan, but a voracious and eclectic reader familiar with its reputation, I approached THE BOYS OF SUMMER fully expecting an excellent book about the Brooklyn Dodgers, but unprepared for what I found.Less a team history than a memoir of the best of times and the worst of times, author Roger Kahn, a former sportswriter for the late NEW YORK HERALD TRIBUNE, has accomplished the nearly impossible task of preserving an era in amber.At the outset, we are introduced to Kahn's endearingly pretentious and unusual family: The father, Gordon, called \\"Gore-DON\\" by his wife, Olga, both teachers; the maternal grandfather, Dr. Rockow, a refugee of the Russian Revolution who obtained his Doctorate of Dentistry in Bern, Switzerland; the deceased grandmother, who, before her death at forty, had acheived a European M.D. Degree in an era when most women in her world were barely literate, much less successfully professional; the younger sister, Emily, stricken with polio; and Roger himself, a well-educated young man whose passion was Dodger baseball.[A previous reviewer is critical of the \\"Marxism\\" of the book, but obviously, s/he did not read past page thirty; in painting us a living portrait of his family, Kahn tells us that they read, among many others, \\"Karl Marx and Freud,\\" and refers affectionately to his Russian-Jewish immigrant grandfather as an \\"old Marxist toothpuller.\\" Kahn's family was somewhat unusual for its time in being stolidly and successfully middle-class and firmly dedicated to Middle European humanist intellectualism in Depression-era, overwhelmingly blue-collar Jewish Brooklyn; but to call this book \\"Marxist\\" or equate it with DAS KAPITAL is to say that THE CAT IN THE HAT is equivalent to GRAY'S ANATOMY because it was written by a Dr. Seuss.]Living within view of Ebbet's Field, baseball was central to Roger's summer universe. This centrality was reinforced by his erudite father, who, when not discussing Joyce and Flaubert at the dinner table, was playing endless games of catch with his son and regularly taking him to games. With no appreciation of sports, Olga, \\"who had pretentions toward atheism\\" pleaded with God to intervene: \\"Please let him read one book; just ONE book.\\" God's choice for Roger was FUNDAMENTALS OF PITCHING, which he carried around with him for weeks.Whether Olga appreciated it or not, Roger was developing a Love For The Game, and he became the HERALD TRIBUNE's point man at Ebbet's Field just as the Dodgers emerged from a decades-long obscurity to become not only one of the preeminent franchises in baseball history, but also an historic team.The Brooklyn Dodgers had always been iconoclastic. The only Major League team representing only a portion of it's home city (granted, Brooklyn had been an independent city until 1898), the team members lived locally and were well-known in their various Brooklyn neighborhoods.From 1921 to 1938, the Dodgers were barely competitive. A chronically bankrupt franchise locally beloved but belittled as \\"dem bums,\\" the fog began to lift in the War Years. The Dodgers captured a pennant in 1941. From 1941 to 1945 they played hard, but wartime manpower needs kept the team from truly excelling. It was not until 1947 that the Dodgers blossomed.And as they blossomed, they made history as well, being the first modern Major League team to sign a black player, Jackie Robinson. Despite being vilified by certain elements, Robinson was MVP and led them to stellar heights. And despite a plethora of personal opinions about Robinson, the team as a whole responded positively to Robinson's amazing energy, and played magnificently for the next decade. Though not every Dodger was dedicated to Civil Rights, only one, aptly named Dixie Walker, asked to be traded, and was. The rest eventually accepted Number 42 as a teammate, and either liked him or loathed him for himself.Perennial Pennant winners, they nonetheless could never overcome the dominance of their crosstown American League rivals, the Yankees, even in 1953, when they statistically outplayed the famed Murderers' Row team of 1927. The Dodger lament was always \\"Wait 'Til Next Year.\\" It was not until 1955 that they could proudly claim, \\"This IS Next Year!\\"But by then, the team had aged, Robinson was gone, and Kahn, too, had moved on. The last trolleys ran in Brooklyn in October of 1956, and with no more trolleys to dodge, the Dodgers vanished from Brooklyn in 1957 and took up residence in Los Angeles. Kahn ends the first half of his book by recounting the death of his father, but it is only one ending among many in that time.Part Two of THE BOYS OF SUMMER brings us The Boys of Summer\\" in their autumn. Written in 1971, the book provides a series of encapsulated snapshots of each of the former team members in their fifties, some fat, some thin, some embittered, some wistful, some successful and some lost in time. The Boys in their age largely returned to their roots, most of them to little towns in the South and Midwest where they ran lumberyards, coached Little League, and were Presidents of their local Rotaries. Each has a story to tell, and so much of what made the Dodgers a truly great team is revealed in these pages.Jackie Robinson stands out. It is hard, sixty years later, to realize how daring owner Branch Rickey was to sign Robinson at that time, and how difficult Robinson's journey was. \\"Brown v. Board of Education\\" was still seven years in the future, Jim Crow was rampant, Dr. King's Montgomery Bus Boycott was a decade away, and still Robinson overcame all obstacles, mostly because of his iron determination off the field and his spectacular talent on the field, attributes which his teammates, and then his opponents, came to respect.The team's sudden, unexpected departure from Brooklyn is still lamented, and then-owner Walter O'Malley is still hated for it: \\"If a Brooklynite with a gun has only two bullets and Hitler, Mussolini and O'Malley are his targets, who does he shoot? O'Malley---twice.\\"Although some reviewers accuse Kahn of revisionism in his treatment of O'Malley, a close reading of the last chapters reveals something different. While most Brooklynites' long-standing hatred of O'Malley is real, it is the hatred of the townsman for the corporation that closes the mill, throwing the factory town into crisis---personal, and yet remote.The bitterness remains. The Los Angeles Dodgers are still often referred to as the Los Angeles Traitors. In this reviewer's family, Dodger defeats, particularly to the Mets at Shea or to the Yankees, are greeted with, \\"Take that! That's what you get for leaving!\\" And it's been fifty years since they've gone. Of course, the Dodgers were in Brooklyn for seventy years beforehand.Kahn's hatred of O'Malley is more immediate and visceral than the average fan's. He so clearly utterly despises O'Malley, who comes across as a self-proclaimed Manhattanite, a rude, self-righteous, pompous, wealthy and greedy snob, a businessman with no interest in baseball, a seeker only of the greenback who cared not at all for fan affections, and who dismissed Brooklyn as the Provinces; in short a man who deserved, and perhaps even wanted, to be hated.The Irish Catholic O'Malley proclaimed himself a \\"Tory.\\" He fined staffers a dollar each time they mentioned Branch Rickey by name. Robinson was a showboater in his estimation, and it was New York's fault the Dodgers left---if Brooklyn had wanted the team Brooklyn should have met his demands for a new stadium and other concessions.With no Love of The Game, O'Malley's decision to move the team was based, solely and selfishly, on his desire to line his own pockets (he was always notoriously cheap with fans, players, and staffers), and to create his own power dynasty far from the interference of the New York Elites, to whom he was an also-ran.Many people have written that the Dodgers left because \\"Brooklyn was changing\\" as \\"white flight\\" drove the middle classes to the suburbs. This ignores the fact that many areas did not change demographically, and that the process was neither sudden nor total. It also discounts the fact that minorities are not immune to an appreciation of the National Pastime. It ignores the fact that the Dodger departure was not so much an effect as a cause of these changes. Local historians mark 1957 as the end of an era in Brooklyn history.Lastly, although the Borough was changing, it was also remaining the same, as the home of newly-arrived immigrant minorities. Brooklyn could (and should) have remained the home of this beloved team. It was thriving and would have continued to thrive. As Kahn says: \\"In a perfect world, Brooklyn would have the Dodgers and the Mets would be in Los Angeles.\\"Would that it were."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"This book is so good that as soon as I finished it, I started reading it again. No wonder it's considered a classic! Time after time, Kahn blew me away with prose that on occasion rises almost to poetry and that is never less than first-rate, whether he's writing about his own life and what brought him to his enduring love of baseball, or the Dodgers team that so won his heart (and mine!) in the early 1950s.Few books have moved me as this one did, both by its content and the sheer excellence of its writing. Kahn is no mere sports writer--he's an artist. And he's writing about so much more than just a couple of baseball seasons. His broader subjects are human mortality, the passage of time, the relentless process of ageing, the slow or swift destruction of dreams, the outrages of bigotry, the painfully slow progress of racial integration, and the open-ended Socratic enterprise of knowing oneself.Although Kahn doesn't have a lot of advanced education, the book makes clear that he comes from an intellectual family and it reflects his wide-ranging but never intrusive erudition. Even the title, taken from a poem by Dylan Thomas, is so perfect for the subject that it has entered ordinary speech as a synonym for baseball players in their fleeting prime. But it helps to know the whole line (\\"I see the boys of summer in their ruin,\\" to feel the full impact of Kahn's work. This is a beautiful but profoundly sad book, worlds removed from the peppy cliches of conventional sports writing.The pace of the book is as leisurely as that of a baseball game. We hear a lot about Kahn himself at the beginning, before he's launched in his career as a young sports writer, covering the team he's always idolized: the Brooklyn Dodgers. We follow him, and the team, through the 1952 and 1953 seasons, with their triumphs and heart-breaks. Then Kahn fast-forwards his readers a decade or so, into the turbulent mid-1960s and relates his personal odyssey of tracking down members of that 1952-53 Dodger team.The resulting interviews, with a chapter per player, form the last section of the book and are quietly but devastatingly poignant. At the time of Kahn's reunions with them, none of the former players were old by any standard other than the unforgiving one of professional sports--they were in their 40s and early 50s. But by then most had lost their athletic physiques and few had achieved much in the way of post-baseball success; all (except the perennially newsworthy Jackie Robinson and Mets manager Gil Hodges) were living in relative obscurity and a couple were existing barely above the poverty level. Several had experienced personal tragedies: we witness Carl Erskine devoting himself to raising his fourth child, a boy with Down Syndrome, and Clem Labine in painful estrangement from his only son, who had a leg blown off in Vietnam. Most difficult to bear is the image of cheerful, roly-poly Roy Campanella as a mangled quadriplegic, confined to a wheelchair after a car accident.Fifty years have passed since those beautiful boys of summer--Robinson, Reese, Hodges, Furillo, Snider, Campanella, Erskine, Roe and Labine are the ones I remember most vividly--lit up my childhood with their marvelous baseball playing. Kahn's book provided an opportunity to relive some of the best moments of my own youth. For readers who saw those players in the flesh, as well as for younger fans who never saw them play, but heard about them, this book is an absolute MUST HAVE. Buy a hardback edition if you can find one--it will become a family heirloom."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"How often do you read a book that you don't want to end? \\"The Boys of Summer\\" is one of them.How often do you read a book at exactly the right time in your life, at a time when you are the most in tune with what the book is really about? For me, \\"The Boys of Summer\\" and I have met at just the right time.It's not like I've been unaware of this book. Being a baseball fan, it's presence is just about as constant as it could ever be. As a lifelong New York Yankees fan, \\"The Boys of Summer\\" has always been \\"that old book about the Brooklyn Dodgers, who the heck cares?\\" Well, score that a two base error.Waking up to the realities and disappointments of middle age is not all that much fun, nor is it frequently reckoned on it's own terms with necessary insight. It's usually a lot easier to go to sleep, get up, go to work, and watch those ballgames nearly every day. Now that's something to hold onto. The daily cacophony of two children is a great distraction, particularly if one is happy to be distracted.But what of the inevitable changes wrought by the inexorable march of time? How long should one dwell on realizing that not only are you as old as the ballplayers you watch on TV, but that it was twenty-five years since you realized it? When in the world did our favorite players become coaches and hall of fame candidates, to be seen only at old timers days? Am I an old timer now? What...???\\"The Boys of Summer\\" does us a great and timely favor. It's a powerful reminder. It's a gentle and insistent reflection of ourselves and what our lives have done to us, and where we find ourselves now. What have we lost along the way? What have we gained?The game of baseball has long endured. It is both unchanging and ever changing. It can be a great distraction. Author Roger Kahn shows how it can teach as well.Baseball is youth. Enthusiastic, ebullient, exciting, entrancing. Baseball will always retain it's youth. as that is it's nature. But not us. Youth passes and passes away, as it must. Life goes on. We must make do, and my oh my, isn't that a bit sad?I wasn't around for the Golden Age of Baseball, the 1950's in New York with the Yankees, Dodgers and Giants fighting for supremacy in New York, although the team from the Bronx seemed to mostly come out on top. \\"The Boys of Summer\\" is wonderfully evocative of that era, and I really appreciate the human dimension that Kahn so ably weaves into the book. The old ballplayers really come alive in full color, and of course black and white. Who cares about the Brooklyn Dodgers? Well, bless my soul, now I do!I look forward to when my two young children are old enough to watch baseball with me. I miss talking baseball with my now dead father.Holy cow."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"This is the best baseball book ever written -- in part because it is about more than baseball. Baseball is important to us because the drama of the game, the season, and the career all mirror the larger dramas of life. The great Dodger teams of the 1950s tell us a lot about how to master one's craft and how to overcome differences of race and socioeconomic background to work together as a team. Of course, we know this from all the conventional histories of the period, but Kahn's book is better because he captures the often contradictory personalities in all their complexity.For instance, Robinson has been portrayed alternativey as a \\"Tom\\" and as an iconic tower of strength akin to Martin Luther King. Neither portrayal is correct. He's a cocky, sometimes irritating guy. As Pee Wee Reese tells him: \\"some people throw at you because you're black and that's terrible; but some people throw at you because they plain don't like you.\\" On the other hand, his manager Dressen says that Robinson is the smartest baseball player he ever saw. Robinson is uncompromising in his insistence on racial justice, but he's also able to play by the rules of the game and to lead the team. Reese is portrayed as critical in leading the team to accept Robinson and then to encourage Robinson to be the team leader. Both age with such dignity after their baseball lives that when the book is done, the reader will view them as the greatest of the game's heroes.By following up on each of the Dodger greats 20 years after the fact, Kahn is able to put the men and the game in their proper contexts. Some age gracefully -- Labine, Black, Erskine, Robinson, Reese. Others become embittered by the disappointments of life after their career, which stokes disappointment about their own careers -- Cox and Furillo, for instance. But again the portraits are fair and complex. One can't simply dismiss Furillo as hippy-hating hard hat of the late 1960s. Furillo stood up for the rights of ballplayers at great personal cost; and some of his bitterness is born of a sensitive nature that felt excluded from the various cliques among the team. Cox too is a likeable guy, despite some of the racial bitterness of the crowd he hangs out with 20 years later.As for the baseball part of the book, Kahn shows the team to be an offensive powerhouse that combined first rate defense in the form of Campanella at catcher, Reese-Robinson-Cox in the infield, and the grace of Snyder and Furillo in the outfield. The weakness is front line pitching. At times, Newcombe, Black, and Erskine achieve brilliance. But the Yankees had steadier and better pitching. Of course, a lot of it has to do with luck. As Kahn points out, the 1955 team was not the strongest of the World Series teams. He believes the team peaked in 1953. But they got hot at the right time in 1955 -- much like the Royals team of 1985 did 30 years later, several years after it reached its own peak.Regarding the injection of Kahn's own personal history into the book, it is hardly gratuitous. The rabid attachment of Kahn and his father to the team is a compelling portrait of the fan's perspective on the team, and Kahn's loss of his father in 1953 and the complications of his life thereafter mirror the life struggles of the players. And Kahn's portrayal of the newspaper business in the 1950s is excellent and is important for understanding how we perceive baseball through the prism of the media.So this memoir tells the tale of the great Dodger teams from the perspective of the players themselves, both at the time and then looking back over 20 years; from the perspective of the media; and from the perspective of the fans. A great baseball book and a great memoir."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"My husband thoroughly enjoyed this book. It arrived earlier and was in perfect condition. The price could not be beat either. Thank you very much."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"When you hear people gripe and complain about the amount of money players earn in today's sports world, and wish for the days when \\"players played for the love of the game\\", refer them to this book. Yes, times were different 60 years ago. And, yes, players were paid salaries that were similar to the average working person's salary. But, they were not always happy times for the players.This book, which is a biography not just about the players, but about the author and his life, shows the reality of the lives of both the players of that era, and New Yorkers. It is must reading for any baseball fan. Mr. Kahn's book is, rightfully, considered one of the masterpieces of baseball reading."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"I have to admit that about fifty pages into this book I was sure it would be a book I would have to labor through. I thought the pace was slow and it was a little on the wordy side. Boy was I wrong. The book progresses from a boy telling stories about growing up near Ebbets, to taking you by his side while he followed his favorite team, and finally it allows you to realize that these players, heroes, were real people. The way Roger Kahn wrote this book was amazing. It feels as though you are in the room with him and staring into the eyes of legendary players. \\"Boys\\" will keep you glued to the pages all the while envoking every kind of emotion you have. Anger, sadness, happiness, disgust, love, and pain all rolled into 40 pages of a book about life with baseball serving as a backdrop."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"I never saw a game at Ebbets, and have only known them as the Los Angeles Dodgers, but I feel like I'm traveling with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952 while reading this book. It's a classic, and a must-read for anyone interested in Brooklyn, the Dodgers, or baseball generally. I can't put it down."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"The genius of Roger Kahn's THE BOYS OF SUMMER is that it ultimately isn't about baseball. It is about the character of a group of men who magically matched the character of a place. The greatness of these Dodgers, the greatness of Brooklin was their perseverance in the face of defeat. And that, according to Kahn, is what makes them enduringly great.A must read. Deserves its reputation as a classic."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"Baseball is integrated into the national consciousness unlike any sport. Football may be our most popular sport now, but baseball is intrinsically linked to our past and our future. The Boys of Summer is a semi-biographical tale of Mr. Kahn as a young reporter embedded with the Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950's. Written in a whimsical style befitting America's Past Time, Kahn weaves a complex tale of Jackie Robinson's Dodgers, experiencing everything from blind racism in the South, racial tension among players, the broken hearts after Bobby Thompson's \\"Shot Heard Round The World\\", elation of winning the pennant, and the heartbreaking losses to the hated cross-town rivals, the Yankees. It is a well-crafted glimpse into baseball history. It humanizes baseball legends such as Duke Snider, Pee Wee Reese, Roy Campanella, and Robinson himself as they lived their lives both during and after baseball.The strength of this novel is Kahn's uncanny ability to strip away the legend, showing the humanizing flaws of the players, while maintaining their place as some of the most colorful and historically significant players in baseball history. The writing style has clear journalistic influences, it flows well, doesn't bog you down with needless metaphors, and delivers the facts quickly. Another unique aspect of this novel is how strongly Kahn's love of the game shows through. You make an emotional connection with these players in much the same way he himself developed that connection. Though he was reporter, his love of the Dodgers was always foremost in his mind.If you are a baseball fan this book must be on your list of must-reads. Though we live decades after these famous Brooklyn Dodgers, we mustn't forget the tremendous feats these players achieved (particularly Robinson), and their incredible contributions to baseball history. One of the best baseball books ever written, and a must read for any fan."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"As an avid sports fan, I lack any real objectivity, but this is a beautiful tribute to the institution of baseball, focusing on one of the true glory teams from the glory days. Kahn's journalism exposes both the good and the bad, but his obivious admiration for the Brooklyn Dodgers explains why baseball has long been called America's Pastime. The exploits of Jackie Robinson, Duke Snider, Gil Hodges and company jump from the page and bring to life an amazing team when players actually cared who they played for and the loyalty to the team made a huge difference. We will never see days like these again in professional baseball; thankfully we can still experience them through remarkable books like this one."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"One of the first baseball books I read was Boys of Summer by Roger Kahn. I recently reread the book and it hasn't lost any of it's original impact. This isn't a book strictly about baseball, it is a book about life.Having reread the book I was struck by how much I enjoyed the first part of the book which functions as an autobiography of the authors youth. The parts about his father and mother were very poignant. The reveleation about the importance of a simple game in people's relationships hit close to home.The second part of the book deals with the players and their stories. Sadly so many of these men have now passed away Robinson, Hodges, Reese, and Campanella. Their stories are powerful but what was even more fascinating to me were the stories of the lesser known players. Billy Cox working in a bar, Carl Furillo working as a labourer, and especially the story of Carl Erskine and his mentally disabled son Jimmy.I would recommend this book to anybody interested in baseball but I would also urge anybody to read it because it's the story about life, the good and the bad, and the past and the present."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"I read this book many years ago but every summer come baseball season I find myself thinking about it. That's the impression that it left with me. Perhaps not only the best baseball book I ever read but the best book. We relive Roger Kahn's passion of the Brooklyn Dodgers and the names are legendary Robinson, Reese, Erskine, Snider, Campanella, Furillo, Hodges, Branca, Podres, Preacher Roe and of course, Ebbets Field. It covers the 1952 & 1953 seasons of the Brooklyn Dodgers, 5 years before the infamous move to Los Angeles when a city not only lost a baseball team but as Roger Kahn describes to us, a piece of it's soul. Baseball is game designed to break our hearts, ask any Cub fan or red Sox fan or Phillies fan(I still get upset when I think of Mitch Williams vs Joe Carter in the '93 World Series). The Brooklyn Dodgers had 2 seasons for the ages in 1952 & 1953 before succumbing to the hated Yankees in the World Series. A book for the ages."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"This is the classic tale for baseball junkies like myself. Kahn did such a great job chroincalling the Dodgers of 1956 and their great season and challenges within the clubhouse and on the field.I especially liked how he wrote the second half by tracking down these players years later and hearing their stories. What a cast, from Duke Synder to Jackie Robinson and Roy Campenella.It is a fun book telling about a fun time."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"It seems strange, looking back over the decades, to think that America seemed so close to perfect. The war was won, everyone had a job, family values ruled, and the Dodgers were in Brooklyn.What more could you want? Off-hand I can think of any number of things, beginning with an end to racial segregation, but at least in that respect the Dodgers showed the way.It must have been some lucky fate that guided Roger Kahn over the Brooklyn bridge all those years ago. He could have written a series of articles and forgotten all about the time he spent with the Dodgers. But he didn't. He revelled in the team, got to know the players, manager, staff and owner. The way the dynamics worked, the internal politics, the inside information.And then he recalled those golden days for us, along with the players, years and years later, in what has got to be the best baseball book ever written. We look back through his eyes, and the eyes of those boys of summer, at a magic moment in America's history.Were they just doing their jobs, those golden boys? Just throwing and hitting a ball around? Or were they conscious of their role in history? Do we read things into this book that weren't there? Do we see that season through misty watercolour memories of the way we were?Up to the reader, I guess, but for me, I go back time and again to Brooklyn and that great team, so superbly described by Roger Kahn.If you love baseball (and who doesn't?) then you must read this book. To understand what once was, and will ever be so long as summer comes and young men gather to throw a baseball around a diamond."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"I first read Roger Kahn's The Boys of Summer 26 years ago in college. It transported me back to my childhood and the great summers of playing baseball all day and listening to my favorite team (the Pittsburgh Pirates) on a little transistor radio."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"This is a good baseball book. Unfortunately, most of the good baseball writing comes in the first half of the book, where Kahn recounts tales of his travels as a sportswriter assigned to the Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950s -- the \\"Jackie Robinson Dodgers.\\" He does a creditable job of portraying the gang of characters that made up the Dodgers of that era and, in so doing, also gives us evocative descriptions of those times. He particularly hits hard the subject of race, as exemplified by the travails faced by Robinson and other blacks as they made their entry into the lily-white ranks of major league baseball. If you were a kid growing up in the '50s and happened to be a baseball fan, you will simply love the richness of Kahn's prose and baseball lore. However, in the latter part of the book, Kahn goes and visits many of the team members 20 years after they were the boys of summer. Those vignettes of once golden athletes now mostly gone to seed are necessarily much less interesting than accounts of their (mostly) baseball brilliance. How many times can you read about this guy or that guy who used to be somebody but two decades later is mostly washed-up and full of regrets and frailities. If you're like me, you'll love the first part and will yawn your way through most of the second. Which is to take nothing away from the fact that this is an important book not only of baseball but of a transition period in American history. I just wish he'd have ended it earlier."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"This book is quite enjoyable. There is a bit too much on personal information about the Brooklyn Dodgers. The historical parts are better."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"Roger Kahn has shamelessly used the attraction of the great Brooklyn Dodgers to lure people into reading what turns out to be his autobiography/confession/pyscho-therapy session. Instead of concentrating his entire effort on the great Dodger players of the 50's he exposes the reader to his own childhood of overbearing parents, sex-crazed housekeepers and personal issues of inadequacies. The half of the book that concentrated on the players was excellent, but with so much time wasted on his personal life that we as baseball fans have no interest in, it has been turned into a mediocre volume and definitely not for younger readers. If one can sort through the muck of his life story it may have value as a reference book, but otherwise it has very little to offer in the way of entertaining reading."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"I recently re-read Boys of Summer. When I first read it almost 30 years ago, I was puzzled why people thought so highly of it. Reading it again has not changed a thing, if anything, the book's flaws are even more apparent.Are the Dodgers a worthy subject of so much prose? Yes and no. They were a very good team over a number of years with a number of personalities on the field and in the front office. They had their greatest success just before the franchise moved. And they were the team of Jackie Robinson, himself the subject of many books, myths and legends.With all that great material, Kahn writes an extraordinarily dull book. The autobiographical parts of father and son being Dodger fans are hackneyed and pervaded by every clich&eacute; in the book. And for a person who covered the team as a beat writer for all of one full season, Kahn seems awfully smug about his knowledge of the Dodgers and dismissive of other writers who spent much more time with the team.The book also lacks even a trace of humor. As anyone who follows baseball on any level can vouch, baseball players can be very funny individuals. The Dodgers that are portrayed here are completely serious and boring. Perhaps that reflects the nature of the author.By the way, I was born and bred in Brooklyn and still spit when the name Walter O'Malley is mentioned. These Dodgers do not deserve the treatment given by Kahn."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"I wanted to love Rogers Kahn's \\"The Boys of Summer\\". I wanted to get lost in the nostalgia of baseball, like rolling with the rhythm of a major league ball game on a hot summer's day. I wanted to revel in the writing, the insight, the exploration of the human condition through the tried and true sports metaphor vehicle of America's favourite pastime.Despite moments of insight and interest, I found Kahn's book to be plodding, self indulgent and mostly, lacking in soul. I have read many great books which use sports as the vehicle to ponder the universal truths, but, unfortunately, this was not one of them.To sum up in two words: boring and disappointing"},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"If you are expecting an insightful potrait of baseball in 1950's Brooklyn look elsewhere. What this book delivers instead is a re-heated version of &quot;Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.&quot; The author is so self-absorbed that any baseball lore one may find in the book must be washed down with a large dose of his syrupy personal saga. Along the way Kahn manages to drain all the vitality out of baseball and replace it with warm tapioca pudding."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"Although I enjoyed the book, I'm sorry now that I spent the money on Mr. Kahn. Given Mr. Kahn's anti-American spew to the people in Cooperstown (a holy place!) on 4/9/03, I will refrain from buying his books for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"The Boys of Summer is an excellent combination of sports journalism, autobiography and insight into what makes baseball great. A diverse group of men mesh into one of the most beloved teams in history. From the trials and tribulations of Jackie Robinson, to the anger of Carl Furillo this book does justice to an amazing time in American history and to the aftermath of a life in pro sports. The triumphs and tragedies of these men are portrayed here with grace and not a little poetry. A wonderful book."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"Kahn's bittersweet remembrance of the 1952-53 Brooklyn Dodgers and his late father is more than a baseball book, yet it's one of the best baseball books ever written. Kahn puts the reader squarely in Ebbets Field in pre-urban decline Brooklyn. I was just as moved by the updated (circa 1971) look at the ex-players, an omission in too many other books. Kahn's 1998 effort &quot;Memories of Summer&quot; adds illumination. Anybody who liked the movie &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; should read this book. &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot; is a classic about baseball, and about life."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"Certainly, this book does not need another adoring review from a nostalgic fan who never saw the 1952 Brooklyn Dodgers play. It is universally regarded as a classic in its field. I am an avid baseball fan who devours baseball books yet, amazingly, I never read it. I always thought that this was little more than a fan's love letter to his favorite team, a perennial also-ran who couldn't get past the mighty Yankees. It is not. This book is so much more than that: it is a document of an era and a reflection upon that era and the ways that our society changed during the 15 or so subsequent years.In ways perhaps unique in baseball literature, Roger Kahn manages to bring alive the feeling of the era. In a poignant poetic style, Kahn describes growing up as a Dodger fan, and the trials and tribulations of the 1952-53 Dodgers, as viewed from the perspective of a fan and a young news writer. Much of it is cast in a rosy glow; yet all the attendant ugliness of the era is neither ignored nor dismissed. It seems somewhat diminished however, as bad things typically happened to other people. The most touching moments are Kahn's personal moments, be they with his family or his team.The second part of the book, in which years later, Kahn seeks out the members of his team, takes the narrative to a much higher plane. Not merely asking the aging idols to nostalgically remember \\"the good old days\\", he instead prods greater reflection from the men. As aging athletes, they all had to come to terms with their mortality in ways that the rest of us do not, and at an age that the rest of us do not. Most of us do not start really feeling our age until our children are grown, and our careers are winding down, and we are facing retirement. Athletes reach that point in life far earlier than the rest of us. While a man (or woman) working, say in the insurance industry, will continue to grow and become more capable throughout their working career, an athlete must change careers, if he is lucky, in his late 30's.This particular group of athletes was remarkable for another reason. They played alongside Jackie Robinson, and thus desegregated major league baseball, and thereby, personified a great deal of hope for a great many men and women. Hope that not only could Black Americans achieve the same success as white Americans, but that they could get along with each other in the process. By being on the same team, the same side, men who otherwise might have been stunted by their own preconceptions and limitations and bigotries learned to admire and even like other men very different from them.They also aged during a very tumultuous period in America's cultural development. The Vietnam War was at its peak while Kahn wrote this book, black-white relations in America were perhaps at their most volatile ever. Two players saw their sons fight in Vietnam and return changed - one mentally, the other physically and mentally. Another had a special needs child, at a time when there still were not many services for such children. Other players had come from backgrounds where blacks were not welcome, and returned to such places, no longer sharing that feeling. You get the sense in this book that they are no longer at one with their hometown because of their experiences playing alongside black men.Plus, the Dodgers left Brooklyn. Their team no longer even existed. The LA Dodgers were not the Brooklyn Dodgers. Truly, an era had ended. Not an era of innocence, nor one that could really be considered \\"the good old days\\", although we are often wont to refer to the 1950's as both. But an era of growth, of optimism, of shared experiences for these athletes, and perhaps, vicariously, for their fans."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"I picked up this book after seeing it listed on the \\"Greatest Sports Books\\" list put out by Sports Illustrated. Not knowing much about the Brooklyn Dodgers of the 50's, but knowing that this is a much-praised era of baseball history, I thought it would make for an interesting read.To be honest, it was tough to get into the early chapters. Not having that knowledge of Brooklyn, the Dodgers, or newspaper writing, it was hard to keep everything straight as the author recounted his youth and how he was assigned to cover the favorite team of his boyhood, the beloved Dodgers. I can imagine how I would have felt being given an assignment to write about the Dallas Cowboys straight out of college. Excited, nervous, tentative...how do you write honestly about a team you are a fan of?The structure of the book is simple: Part 1 covers Mr. Kahn's years reporting on the Dodgers. Part 2 covers his subsequent efforts to contact the key members of those teams many years later.The characters are fascinating, and many of the stories are moving and encouraging.Some observations:-People in sports tend to look back on these years with a great sense of nostalgia and \\"good old days\\" syndrome. This book peels back the layers of some of those \\"good old days\\" to reveal (surprise!) that players and reporters back then used a lot of profanity, got drunk a lot, cheated on their spouses, encountered and expressed overt racism, and played dirty when they could get away with it.-Today's pro athletes certainly could benefit from reading some of these stories. While many of these men were well paid for the time, they were not the grossly overpaid, spoiled, entitled athletes of today's pros.-Jackie Robinson is well deserving of having his number retired league-wide. The amount of abuse he took from fans, other teams, and even teammates for being the first African American in the Major Leagues was appalling. Athletes of all colors need to know this story (and the stories of those like Pee Wee Reese who risked ridicule for readily accepting Robinson as a teammate and friend).-The author gets great joy out of playing catch in his middle age with an aging former pro. I'd probably get a similar boyish thrill if I had the chance to play catch with Roger Staubach. I don't think athletes should have such an elevated status, but those players you loved as a boy still ring in the mind and heart in some ways (I was excited to meet one of my childhood baseball favorites just this summer).-Many of these former players lived simple, quiet lives after their careers. They didn't seek out the spotlight, strive to hang on to fame, or simply long for the playing days. Many invested heavily in the communities they grew up in and continued to live there.While this may be a \\"sports book\\", it really goes well beyond that. Will a non-sports fan enjoy it? Hard to say. It is a fascinating look at the sociology around a ball team, race, teamwork, leadership, endurance, family, and change.\\"You may glory in a team triumphant, but you fall in love with a team in defeat.\\""},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"All I will say is that this is the book that made my wife a baseball fan and that everyone I know who has read it - including people who care nothing for sports - has enjoyed it. If you are a sports fan, from Brooklyn, and/or have a feeling for a different era when the players were living next door to the fans, it's even better. Once you've finished this, read Good Enough to Dream, by the same author."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"The reason I gave this book five stars is because I'm not allowed to give it six. This is simply the best baseball book I've ever read, and that's a fairly long list. I can't say enough positive things about this book.It should be noted that I was a sports writer for 8 years and was early in my career when I read this book. I was enthralled by the first part of the book, which not only provided insight into two prototypical Brooklyn Dodgers seasons (great team, fell short of winning a championship), but it also took me into the fascinating world of journalism in the 1950s. It was exciting and eye-opening.The second part of the book includes stories of Kahn visiting players from those teams many years later. You can't believe how interesting this is. The story of Billy Cox is touching. The story of Duke Snider offers great insight into the superstar outfielder. Roy Campanella's story is tragic. I've read three or four books by Kahn and all are good, but this is at an entirely different level. Someday I will read this book again when it's been long enough so that it can feel like I'm reading it for the first time."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"This is a superb baseball book, but it's also a moving treatise on family, life and loss. Author Roger Kahn grew up with the Brooklyn Dodgers, and covered that legendary team in the early 1950's as a young reporter for the old New York Herald Tribune. Kahn lets us get to know the team's outstanding figures, from gruff skipper Charlie Dressen, to baseball legend Jackie Robinson, to stars like Duke Snider, Pee Wee Reese, Roy Campanella, Gil Hodges, Carl Erskine, etc. Readers should enjoy the author's sentimental look at Brooklyn prior to urban decline and the Dodger's inexcusable desertion to Los Angeles. Kahn also grants a strong role in the narrative to his baseball-loving father. Readers will learn (or be reminded of) baseball in a drug-free era of modest player salaries and loveable ballparks like Ebbets Field. In the books second half the author interviews the former Dodger players twenty years later. Hardship and tragedy followed several players into their middle age, yet most retained their gentle humanity long after they'd been returned them to the ranks of ordinary men.THE BOYS OF SUMMER was published in 1972, yet remains one of the best baseball books ever written. Readers should also enjoy its later companion, MEMORIES OF SUMMER."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"Roger Kahn's &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot; may very well be the best book written about baseball. It certainly lies in the Top Ten of any self-respecting baseball fan's own personal list. It is beautifully written, often poetic. It is elegiac yet alive and vibrant.The book is neatly split into two parts. The first is a reporter's account of his own love of baseball, specifically the Brooklyn Dodgers, while growing up there. The era comes alive with descriptions of his neighborhood, of the city, of what baseball meant to kids at that time.Of how baseball bonded fathers to sons, children to adults, neighbors.In that scenario, imagine the fortune of this young reporter who gets the dream job to end all dream jobs: follow the Dodgers.You get to watch baseball, played by your favorite team and then write about it. And get paid!It's a lovely evocation of the time...things aren't like the way they used to be. The earth doesn't stop rotating when the Dodgers come back in the bottom of the ninth.It used to.You get a sense of how important and vital the Dodgers were to that community. Daily conversations were incomplete without a mention of last night's game. Stickball was everything. A glove was gold.The parts about being a member of the press in Manhattan for a big newspaper are terrific. I swear I could hear the chattering typewriters, the traffic outside the window, the tinkling of ice in a bar glass...you are there. As the golden era of baseball was ending, so was an era of newspapers. Soon TV would supersede the papers as the way to get your news. The influence of the newspapers on public opinion (and vice versa) would never again reach the heights they did here.As history, there is no better concise snapshot of that hallowed Jackie Robinson era than this book.The second half of the book has Mr. Kahn travelling around the country decades after the Brooklyn team has ceased to exist. He finds the players...Gil Hodges, Jackie, Pee Wee, Duke, Clem, Erskine, Billy Cox...and gives us a separate little chapter on each player. We find out what has happened after baseball for them, Campanella's injury, Robinson's and Erskine's family problems, if they stayed with baseball (Hodges) or got completely away from it (Cox)......it finishes the story of that Brooklyn Dodger team. It also gives Mr. Kahn a chance to return to that era and write about it from the perspective that age and time will frequently offer.If you love baseball, and you love to read, there is no better book. Sure, an argument could be made for a Halberstam book, or someone's well written autobiography, but they would be coin flips.&quot;The Boys of Summer&quot; may arguably be equalled, but I doubt if it will ever be bettered."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"I cannot believe it took me this long to finally getting around to reading this book, but well worth the wait. Roger Kahn is a remarkable writer, weaving his poetic imagery between the games he covered for the defunct New York Herald Tribune. While the book is about the Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950's, the book subsequently becomes about what happens to athletes when their bodies begin to break down and they are forced to begin the next phase of their life.The pages are tinged with nostalgia and sadness, and this sense of loss begins early in the book when the author describes the loss of his grandfather: \\"The world is never again as it was before anyone you love has ever died; never so innocent, never so fixed, never so gentle, never so pliant to your will.\\" This sentence resonates throughout the book as the author loses his father, then his Dodgers to LA, and his son late in the book.What carries this book over the top is the bond that a beat writer was able to forge with such an iconic team. While Jackie Robinson got most of the press, the final chapter of the book is a wonderful salute to Kahn's friendship with the captain, Pee Wee Reese. It's unheard of in this day and age for a beat writer to have those close relationships with the ballplayers they covered, a casualty of a bygone era.While the sense of loss that pervades the book could be overwhelming, ultimately it is the strength of the friendships and memories that the author kept with these ballplayers that create a lasting image. It's hard to imagine a more in-depth and personal look at a team through the eyes of a beat writer. Roger Kahn's book is still a stunning achievement almost 40 years after it was published. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"Roger Kahn's magnificent portrayal of how the glory and anguish of a very talented, yet flawed baseball team---the Brooklyn Dodgers of the early '50s---became an aging group of men who experienced an inordinate amount of personal travail; and in the process, the reader is made acutely aware of how fleeting fame can be, and above all else, how transitory one's athletic prowess can be. Indeed, we all grow older, but in some cases, the aging process can bring about much pain over the course of just a few years; especially when contrasted to the seemingly endless years of youth and vitality, while playing ball for one of baseball's most storied franchises.Kahn's compelling look at this wonderful group of ballplayers, whose lives after their playing days ended became something less than a fairy tale for most; in fact, it was filled with an inordinate amount of pain & anguish; almost a metaphor for their seemingly endless degree of post-season futility at the hands of the mighty New York Yankees; it wasn't until 1955, when Dem Bums finally broke that curse, although some of the star players from just a few years earlier had already faded off into the sunset.Although few teams in baseball history advanced to post season play with such regularity as the Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1950s; yet the results were often a harsh reminder of the frailties of human athletic endeavors. The Dodgers seemed to epitomize the frustration of never seeming to be quite as good as many of their fans hoped they would.In the final analysis, the harsh realities of retirement brought even a higher degree of personal frustration; even tragedy. Somehow, we are left to appreciate the Boys of Summer for what they represented to America in the 1950s---a uniquely superior group of athletes who always seemed to have the cards stacked against them, even in their post-baseball endeavors.Kahn's work is timeless; his words are poignant. Whether you're a fan of the game or not, this is a remarkable piece of writing; a true classic, to be appreciated for generations to come."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"I had heard about this book for years, and finally got around to reading it recently. I was immediately turned off when Kahn was describing the influences in his household in New York--most notably Karl Marx. What is it with these people and their love for Marxism? Marxist governments have been responsible for over 100 million deaths worldwide, and yet to this day there are those who gush about how wonderful it is. These people are more than idealists, they are dangerous morons. Since I am not a political neophyte, the mention of Marx disgusted me and detracted from an otherwise good book. Isn't it ironic that if Kahn was living in his Utopian Marxist society, he wouldn't have made the fortune on this book that he made under capitalism?"},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"Another baseball classic written by a middle aged reporter about the life and times spent when he was young and there were Dodgers in Brooklyn.\\"Dem Bums\\" resided in mid century Flatbush where the resident fans always cried \\"wait until next year!\\" and Roger Kahn provides 442 pages of sheer baseball delight.Kahn's prose gives a sense of community and family in New York's most populated borough. You can sense that in visioning a walk on a mid summer's night in Brooklyn, in which you can follow the evening's game on residents radios on your stroll to wherever.Kahn relates the many varied personalities that formed this eclectic group. The frustrations of winning pennants but losing World Series'. The madness of losing a pennant on the last day of the season. And the ultimate embarrassment of losing to them \\"Gints\\" in the so called \\"Miracle on Coogan's Bluff\\".All told, an exciting story lived out in real time in Brooklyn in mid century urban America. Oh those memories! Kahn tells the good and the bad. The triumphs and the heartaches. The book gives a true reflection of baseball emulating the ups and downs of life.In the end, Mr. Kahn follows up on the post baseball careers of these fine men. Some are bitter and others are reflective and grateful. This is a classic book telling a story which all baseball fans would appreciate."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"..because Kahn wrote it right after Jackie Robinson died, so there's a lot toward the end about him. Things which--in later editions, aren't there, and in earlier edition aren't there because they hadn't happened yet.Called by \\"Sports Illutrated\\" \\"the greatest sports book of all time,\\" it follows the life of the author, Roger Kahn (briefly and intermitantly), and then becomes intensely involved with the Brooklyn Dodgers, 1952-53 (when Kahn covered them for a newspaper). The portraits of the players are so vivid, and he apparently had a way of getting them to open up to him, because you will read explanations of things you will read nowhere else. He listens in on threir conversatioons on Pullman trains, in dugouts, on the field. Preacher Roe says: \\" I have three pitches: my change, my change off my change, and my change off my change off my change.\\" Roe tells a story about--I think it was Johnny Mize--to whom he threw 'three of the wettest spitters he ever saw,\\" and Mize, passing him on the way back to the dugout, after striking out, said pleasantly \\"Your curve ball gets better every day.\\"After Kahn had been taken off of the Dodgers (no reporter was allowed to spend more than two years with the Dodgers---their reporting became warped after that), and then, after they moved to L.A.--he missed them. So there's a second part to the book: retired Dodgers at home, and what they were like. They talk about the old days, and the less old days. He is especially good with Robinson and Reese--but he's good with all of them.The first time the Dodgers played the Atlanta Crackers (an excellent minor league team), in 1949, in Atlanta, the Dodgers and Robinson personally got threatening letters from the KKK--death threats. As Robinson was warming up, Reese saw that he was a little tense. \\"Don't stand so close to me today, Jackie,\\" he said. \\"Move away a little bit.\\" Jackie smiled."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"I still have my original paperback copy of this. A superb book. What I wouldn't have given to be able to watch played at Ebbets Field. Jack Roosevelt Robinson was the most courageous ballplayer that ever was.The abuse that he took was tolerated, for the most part.The fact that he silently took it,and never retaliated.Being sold to the Giants at the end of 1956,was probably initiated by Alston,whom he never really got along with,anyway.For all of the revelations that ballplayers then drank,cheated on their wives,dirty-played---that hasn't changed.They were paid badly,are badly overpaid today,the wiping out of the Reserve Clause has caused a downward spiral of dilution of talent,the overall greediness of both players and owners-one could not pay me to sit through a game today.People today tend to forget that it wasn't cheap to go to a game in 1963.The average workingman could afford maybe a game or two, during the season.So,to spend well over $100.00 just to attend one night game?? Nope...The strike in 1994 did me in,for good."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"As a young reporter, Roger Kahn got to cover the Brooklyn Dodgers for two seasons. In this book, he tells us about those two years, then goes back to visit the players several years later, describing their lives and hardships after baseball. The sad part of the book is that the players seemed to have more than their share of bad luck after leaving the game.It's an interesting look at the Dodgers in the early 1950's and an even more interesting look at the indiviual players as people after they retired from the game. It also tells us a great deal about how the team was dealing with integration a few years after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"this is NOT a book about baseball. i guess that's a bit misleading, because it does have a lot to do WITH baseball, but no, that's not what this book is ultimately about. this book is about courage, love, hate, determination, gratitude, loss, rebirth, frustration, jubilation, segregation, acceptance, family. i could go on. at it's core, it's a book about life. and if you pass this one by, you are missing a real treat."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"The most insightful and well-written sports book I have ever picked up. Its a must-read for any fan of baseball or sports in general. Kahn delivers a story about baseball yet somehow makes it about so much more. From human success and sacrifice to struggle and tragedy, Kahn outlines the way baseball can be about so much more than just a game."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"A great read, a great story about a game that is America itself. It is a book for those who love the game. In additon, it gives one insight into what those ball players went through while playing the game and after their playing the game was over. Truly, a book for the casual and for the devoted fan.Andrew"},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"This is a very touching book because the author loved the baseball team he had the privilege to travel with and to write about, and he loved his father who fostered this love for the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1940s and early 1950s. Roger Kahn writes with heart, with enthusiasm and with the utmost respect.It is a long time now since the Dodgers were in Brooklyn but each time I read about that era I get a lump in my throat. I loved Doris Kearns Goodwin's book Wait Till Next year about the same years, the same Dodgers, and what could have been (but wasn't, of course) the same father. I don't know if fathers still pass down the love of a sport to their children because sports are so different now, but it sure made a difference to these two Dodger lovers back in the day.This is touted as the best sports book ever, and it is certainly one of the very best that I have ever read, but as other reviewers have said here, the book is about more than baseball, it is about a disparate group of men, and boys, coming together to play a game and to learn about themselves and life and love and loss and the social changes in the aftermath of World War 2. It is delightful and fun to read, and it rings of truth and packs a punch."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"Roger Kahn's \\"The Boys of Summer\\" stands as one of the finest works I have ever read. It might not be the greatest baseball book ever written, but Mr. Kahn does a masterful job of interweaving the lives of his beloved Brooklyn Dodgers with his own, creating a marvelous story that combines several classic themes: the coming of age of a young man, tragedy and triumph, the ephemeral nature of youth, and the universal struggle against age and death.This book is all of those, wrapped tightly in twine and covered in horsehide. I met a few new heroes the first time I read it, and I bring them back every few years for a fresh read and a reacquaintance."},{"Title":"Boys of Summer","review":"I have always been an avid baseball fan. As a youth, baseball was a medium through which my father and I could genuinely enjoy each others company. I first read The Boys of Summer when I was relatively young, but I recently reread it and it certainly has more resonance nowadays as I can better relate to the aging Boys of Summer. I read avidly in the sports literature genre and reference is often made to The Boys of Summer, occasionally I wonder if it can indeed be that good. It is indeed classic sports literature. Well done Mr. Kahn."},{"Title":"Business Spanish Dictionary","review":"I bought this after reading a good review in a translator's journal and it's very good. I translate for corporations in my area - and this covers translations of tens of thousands of the business words I need. There are lots of basic general terms, but it's also comprehensive with specialist words and expressions. It's got definitions and translations so would probably be okay for college business students too."},{"Title":"Business Spanish Dictionary","review":"lacks coverage of even the most basic terms. plus, the name is not so challenging"},{"Title":"The Sages","review":"This book is difficult to read if you don't follow Urbach's line of reasoning on a number of issues, but the its scope makes it a valuable tool for virtually anyone in the field of Jewish studies. The book has two indexes (one by topic, one by texts mentioned) which help the reader make use of the many obscurer texts that Urbach quotes, some of them virtually impossible to find in translation anywhere. Urbach himself is deeply steeped in a humanistic concept of the evolution of religions, that is, that Monotheism is something that an originally polytheistic Jewish people 'made up' at some point in history, and they have been refining this invention throughout the ages. This can render the book problematic to Orthodox Jews and Fundamentalist Christians, but the sheer wealth of material has made the book a valuable reference to me, even though I hold to the opinion that the biblical religion is revealed, rather than made up. The book is well organized by 'doctrine' or belief, and Urbach does an excellent job of quoting the texts that he uses to come to his conclusions about what the Rabbis believed, when and where they believed it, and how the belief changed over time. He is guilty of an over reliance on various (fallible) opinions about the dating and authorship of a number of these texts, some of them so nebulous as the Dead Sea Scrolls.Over all, Urbach has the same over confidence betrayed by humanist scholars who sometimes forget to check the limits of their knowledge about this ancient people, but the book he has written is so thorough and massive that it cannot be anything other than valuable to any budding Judaist.Chapter headings include: Belief in one God, The Shekhina, Omnipresence and Heaven, Power of God, Magic and Miracle, Power of the Divine Name, The Celestial Retinue, Man, Providence, Written and Oral Law, and other fascinating subjects. Sticky subjects such as the two messianic concepts in Judiasm are handled in depth. Ancient Rabbinical sources (Talmud and older Midrash, Halacha, and Aggada) are preferred, and the Judaism that is explained here is that of the 2nd Temple period and early Christian era, closing with the completion of the generation of the Amoraim, as opposed to the Medieval Judaism of Maimonides and the like.I highly recommend this book, despite Urbach's occasional blunder, to anyone seriously interested in Judiasm and the ancient Jewish literary corpus."},{"Title":"The Sages","review":"I just want to thank Amazon for delivering my book in a timely manner.

This beautiful book gripped me,delighted me and enchanted me. 7 years later, I'm writing my dissertation on musical theatre, with my first chapter (and my favorite) on the Gershwins. Deena Rosenburg's book is a model of what musical theatre biographies can be--history on the authors, the shows and the times. I won't wreck the ending for you, but it is one of the only non-fiction books I could say that about. I spent a week as spellbound as I was when reading The Lord of the Ring, and I will always hold this up as a fabulous book to introduce anyone to musical theatre and a joy. Bravo!

This guy has an incredible talent for teaching a class, and it directly transforms to his writing. Students love to critcize his work, which he takes well. That must be one of the reasons why his writing is so great. At first if you read some of the essays, you might think he is insane, but if you understand them, you will have a great idea of what these essay are talking about. C.P.

The small size and soft durable cover makes it easy to carry with you. The font is easy on the eyes and quite readable considering how many definitions are packed into one page. It has, however, let me down quite a few times. I generally need a dictionary to help with difficult or uncommon words and this dictionary tends to leave a lot of those out. I don't really need to carry around the definitions of cat, dog, table, coffee cup, bowling alley, etc. I need definitions to words like affiance and velleity, the last two of the long list of words I looked up that were not in this dictionary. If you have a pretty good grasp of Basic English and are looking for a pocket dictionary of difficult words, this isn't it."},{"Title":"Webster's New World Pocket Dictionary, Fourth Edition","review":"I often use my dictionary and wanted a small one to take along when I travel. This one sounded about right. However, on my last trip I found that the definitions are limited and not necessarily what I'm looking for. For the size and the price, it is satisfactory, but it doesn't compare with a full-sized dictionary."},{"Title":"Webster's New World Pocket Dictionary, Fourth Edition","review":"According to:\\"Collins Cobuild English Dictionary\\" (1998 reprint,ISBN 978-0003750294), page xii:\\"The Bank of English is a collection, or corpus, of over 200 million words of written or spoken English...\\" Since most of the English words have multiple different meanings, a rough conservative estimation results in three quarters of a billion definitions of entries and sub-entries. One literally needs a train for schlepping these tomes, let alone purchase and transportation expenses.Hence it seems unrealistic of some previous reviewers to expect of a 5-ounce and 35K entries dictionary, to present all the rare words of the English language. Metaphorically speaking: as if one expects to win the Monte-Carlo car races with his modest family car.In spite of above facts, this 4th edition dictionary (ISBN 978-076456147) is surprisingly rich for its size. Just opening the book at random on pages 262-3, are listed uncommon words for the casual English reader as: \\"pusillanimous\\"; \\"purview\\"; \\"quadriplegia\\"; \\"purulent\\". The entries definitions are clear and accurate, consisting of one to few words, including the most common manifold meanings. There are entries of slang, some idioms and words as \\"schlepping\\" adopted from foreign languages.This 5-ounce dictionary is a \\"lifesaver\\" for deciphering unfamiliar words found in any book or articles, when the unabridged dictionary isn't handy, as while traveling back and forth to work. Due to its lightweight and compactness, this pocket dictionary is always handy, nesting in my bag or pocket; one just can in minutes of leisure browse and gain a more sophisticated vocabulary. On top of that it rarely failed me in finding and clarifying the misunderstood word;probably it has to do with the clever choice of headwords in this featherweight dictionary."},{"Title":"Webster's New World Pocket Dictionary, Fourth Edition","review":"I was expecting it to be a lot bigger.

Anyone, amateur or professional, interested in the still mysterious collapse of many Eastern Mediterranean civilizations in the 12th century BCE should read this book. It has the widest range of up-to-date papers by the best experts gathered in one place that I am aware of. The volume includes 17 papers, with titles like \\"Biblical Traditions: The Philistines and Israelite History\\", \\"The Aegean and the Origin of the Sea Peoples\\", and \\"The Sea Peoples and the Egyptian Sources\\". Authors include Egyptologist Ronald D. Redford contributing \\"Egypt and Western Asia in the Late New Kingdom: An Overview\\"; and the man who might be described as the dean of Israeli Archeology, Dr. Israel Finkelstein, contributing \\"The Philistine Settlements: When, Where and How Many?\\". The book is well edited, the figures excellent, the writing superb, and the paper the book is printed on is of the highest quality. In other words, what you would expect from a fine university academic publication.Unfortunately - or possibly fortunately for those of us fascinated by the whole Sea Peoples story - while this volume provides much interesting information, it settles few outstanding questions. Some of the conclusions in the papers contradict others. To quote from the introduction, \\"...modern scholarship is still largely challenged by the very basic questions of just who the Sea Peoples were and whence they came, as well as those focusing on the process of their migration and settlement, acculturation, and subsequent assimilation\\".My favorite paper was \\"The Sea Peoples and the Egyptian Sources\\", by David O'Connor, an art historian, who provides a detailed description and interpretation of the Egyptian Medinet Habu temple which memorializes Ramesses III's military victories, including two over the \\"Sea Peoples\\", one on land and one on sea. The Medinet Habu temple panels devoted to the Sea Peoples are analyzed from both artistic and historical points of view. This examination extends from showing how both battle scenes represent the victory of \\"[Egyptian] order over chaos\\", down to identifying particular individuals, out of what appear at first glance to be undifferentiated hundreds, as probable Sea People's leaders due to their unique depictions and positioning in individual displays.My second favorite paper was \\"Down to the Seas of the Philistines\\", by Shelley Wachsmann , a nautical archeologist at Texas A&M;, who argues convincingly - to me - that the \\"standard\\" Sea Peoples' ship shown in the Medinet Habu sea battle scene is a sea-going Mycenaean galley. The Mycenaeans appear to have had a remarkably \\"modern\\" sea-going ships, and along with Cyprus carried out long distance trade at this time with the Central Mediterranean as far as Sardinia The same paper also argues - not so convincingly to me - that, based on the depictions of waterfowl devices on the both the bow and sterns, this one \\"standard\\" ship was probably manned by members of the Urnfield Culture of Central Europe!My third favorite paper was \\"New Evidence on the End of the Hittite Empire\\", by Itamar Singer, Tel Aviv University, who discussed textual evidence for 12th century BCE warfare along the southern Anatolian coast fatally weakening both the Hittites and the Hittite clients state of Ugarit.The very tentative consensus of the various authors who address the question, is that the Sea Peoples came from the Aegean, quite possibly Greece itself, probably by way of Southern Anatolia, where, as mentioned in the proceeded paragraph, they caused all kinds of problems for the last Hittite kings and the Ugarits. And picked up and dropped off peoples like the Philistines along the path to Egypt - or on the way back.One paper, by Lucia Vagnetti of the Insituto per gli Studi Micenei ed Egeo-Anatolici, argues against a Western Mediterranean origin of the Sea Peoples. I found this refreshing, since I already found it hard to accept the widely held belief that some of the Sea Peoples came all the way from Sardinia and Sicily. In another paper, by Phillip Betancourt, of Temple University, climate change that disrupted Greek agriculture is suggested as the reason for the movement of the Sea Peoples. This climate change and the associated agricultural collapse may have almost depopulated mainland Greece. (This is the best explanation I have read for the \\"Dark Ages\\" of Greece, between the 11th and 8th centuries BC.)Finally, I should note for the serious archeologists that there are a number of papers devoted almost entirely to archeological subjects, such as excavations of individual sites in Palestine, and the study of pottery in Palestine and Cyprus. So there are plenty of photographs and drawings of excavation sites, contemporary building layouts, Late Bronze Age weapons, and unearthed terracotta figures. I tended to skip lightly over those papers, concentrating more on papers addressing the \\"big picture\\"."},{"Title":"The Sea Peoples and Their World : A Reassessment (University Museum Monograph, 108)","review":"The 5 stars are for the book itself, which is an important contribution to its topic.I wish I could give \\"minus\\" stars for the booksellers currently offering the book. They are not \\"selling\\" this book. They are holding it for ransom.I am astonished to see this otherwise excellent book for sale at such prices. If this book were actually worth $1500 (SHAME on Glover's Bookery in Lexington Ky-$1500???) then every copy in every library that holds it would be stolen and resold for few hundred apiece on eBay. But alas, library copies seem safe and freely accessible in open stacks around the country. In no market will someone pay $1000-$1500 for this book.As a scholar who works in late bronze age and early iron age history in the ancient Near East, I have read this excellent volume. The essays are vital to the study of the topic. But how the prices asked for this book could be expected is simply rapacious exploitation by boutique booksellers. Those who care about this topic will not have this kind of money to spend, and those who have the money probably will purchase a more obvious collector volume than a nondescript university press cloth-bound set of arcane essays about the social history of the ancient Philistines.This book is well worth $75-100. But the prices being asked by these dealers is simply proof that boutique book dealers care nothing about the books actually being read and used by people who care about the topics. There was a time when small used book dealers were lovers of great books and promoters of deep reading in a world of complex topics.Now they clearly just want to exploit scholars and students who need such volumes. They will complain about online booksellers and complain that people should buy local-but when (my!) local bookseller puts this kind of price on the book, they insure that seekers will definitely look for booksellers who price books realistically."},{"Title":"Days Gone By in Contra Costa County, Vol. 1","review":"Captivating!

Clark suffers only from the irresistible urge to tell the truth; some cultures are more exquisite and developed than others, and the artistic record gives evidence to that fact. Beautifully filmed, artfully argued, timeless."},{"Title":"Civilization","review":"This is the companion book to Sir Kenneth's famous TV series of the same name. Actually, it IS the TV series. The text of each chapter is a literal transcription of Clark's words from each episode. If I were reviewing the TV series I would give it 5 stars, but as the book pales visually in comparison, I have downgraded my rating slightly. That's not the only reason, however. As much as I like Sir Kenneth's presentation and enjoyed the show, I find his depressing conclusion to the series somewhat baffling. Just try reading the final chapter (in fact the final paragraphs of the final chapter) and see if you can figure out what the hell he is saying. Writing at the beginning of the 1970's, is Clark saying that civilization is going down the toilet? Is he saying that there will be no more good art? Was he afraid that nuclear holocaust was just around the corner? I don't know. I can't figure it out.That being said, I've read both volumes of Sir Kenneth's autobiography and I KNOW how intensely he felt art. It paralyzed him. Some paintings could move him to tears. Whether his view of civilization is really just his views on art, this is indeed a personal take.By the way, it is interesting to compare Clark on the Ecstasy of St. Theresa with Simon Schama's ludicrous rambling on the same subject."},{"Title":"Civilization","review":"This book is one man's random observations on some aspects of European art mostly from 15th to 19h century.The title is indeed misleading. The book does not cover the history of civilization, western civilization or even history of western art. Many of these random observations are downright silly and mass-pleasing in my opinion. It is quite gossipy as it gets into private lives of artists and tries to make conclusions about their art based on assumptions about their inner lives. The truth is that we cannot fairly judge people and their art based on simple biographical facts known from their lives. Freud's incorrect views of the human mind influenced many people's ways of thinking including Kenneth Clark's.

I was bitterly disappointed that the book was not at all about its title. It's a brilliant review of the art of Western civilization and what it tells us about the ethos of that civilization through the course of time. Although I am not much interested in the history of western art, I nevertheless found the book rather interesting.

The only quibble I have is that there is so much meat in the menus (5 out of six nights) which can get expensive. But cooking these menus is a lot better than take-out and less expensive."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I've been doing the \\"Saving Dinner\\" thing for about 3 months now, and it has made a huge difference in how I shop and cook. What can I say that doesn't sound ridiculously over-exaggerated? The simple truth is, it has changed my life. The recipes are easy and absolutely delicious (and I'm picky about flavor!), I no longer stress over my weekly menu and shopping list, no longer have that \\"it's 5:00 and I'm staring into the freezer, hoping against hope that there's something decent I can make for dinner\\" anxiety that used to be so common in my life. I love that she knows how to make a dish taste authentic, and I also love that she assumes I already know how to steam broccoli, so she doesn't waste room in redundant explanations of basic cooking techniques. I've given away most of my other cookbooks, because I can't imagine quitting this wonderful program. The food is nutritious, and unlike many \\"quick and easy\\" cookbooks, she doesn't rely on manufactured foods, so there is a freshness and lack of chemicals that is showing up in how much more energy I have now. The only \\"problem\\" (that really isn't one) is how much less I enjoy restaurant food, since I'm usually thinking how much better-tasting and fresher Leanne's renditions are! She has a genius for distilling a recipe down to the essential ingredients that make a dish taste like what it's supposed to. I can honestly say meal planning and preparation have never been easier, and I've never eaten this well in my life."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"This is more than just a cookbook. It's a time saver because the planning is done for you and a money saver because you take advantage of seasonal produce and have less wasted food. Leanne makes it so simple with the whole week planned and the shopping lists made. I've also learned how to plan and make my own shopping lists just from using it. My picky kids love most of the recipes and have eaten things I thought they wouldn't and I found out my toddler loves squash! My 10 year old daughter says we're eating at a new restuarant called home."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I found that my kids, who had begun not liking what I was fixing and leaving too much left over, loved most of these recipes. I have picky teenagers not youngsters and they will eat a lot one night and not at all another. Almost every recipe that I have fixed from \\"Saving Dinner\\" has gone over well. In fact I ordered her other book \\"Saving Dinner the Low Carb Way\\" since my husband was diagnosed with diabetes. I can incorporate these recipes in my Weight Watchers program with ease and wondering what's for dinner is no longer an ordeal. If you LIKE spending tons of time looking through cookbooks and figuring out what you want and making up your shopping list then you don't need these books. They are for those of us who have trouble figuring out what our family wants or just need a new outlook on feeding our families healthy, nutritious and delicious meals. I have at least 40 cookbooks and the only use I have for them now is looking for the occasional fancy recipe for some get together. These are the ones I use regularly."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I love this cookbook, it is by far my favourite and I highly, highly recommend it!!!The recipes are easy to follow and the shopping lists for each recipe make it a breeze to stock up. The book is seperated into recipes for each season which allows you to buy things that are in season so you save money as well as eat well."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I am my 85 year old parents' live-in caregiver and to come up with tasty, nutritious, varied meals every day is a challenge, especially since they often turn up their nose to anything new. I have had repeated success with Saving Dinner and have several pages they consider to be \\"better than restaurant quality\\". It's not that I am such a good cook ~ I'm not......I can't cook at all without a recipe in front of me ~ it's that the recipe in front of me from Saving Dinner is tasty and interesting and healthy, and they always appreciate it when I pull out Saving Dinner to cook from. I am born organized, so it is not that I couldn't do this for myself; it's that it is a GREAT timesaver for me to have someone do it for me! When you are taking one or both of them to the doctor or to run an errand, doing all the cleaning and cooking and shopping and laundry for them, in addition to working 30 hours a week outside the home, there's very little time to do menu planning for the week. So I appreciate the helping hand. I highly recommend this book, and applaud the author for the time it must have taken to put this book together for the benefit of those of us lucky enough to find it."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"This is a boon for those of us who lack the organizational skills to hunker down with cookbooks and shopping circulars to make a week's worth of menus. If it's simple for you, fine, but for some of us making a week's worth of menus is like tightrope walking over a fire."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Getting dinner on the table day after day has always been a chore. I love to cook, and have all the cookbooks, so that isn't the problem. But neither Joy of Cooking nor Julia ever told me how to plan my week! So I was delighted to find this book, and after 6 months will tell anyone who listens to get it too. It has trained me to plan that week! Since there are only two of us, I make the full recipes and freeze half, and this makes planning even easier. Since I've been cooking for so long, I sometimes substitute one of my favorites, but not as often as you'd guess. Saving Dinner is the one book I could not do without. And the suggestions for side dishes are very good, also."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I recently ordered this book from Amazon.com and I have not been disappointed. From the Flylady website I knew that Leanne Ely has some of the most delicious recipes. My family has raved over most of the recipes that I received from Leanne through Flylady. The same holds true for the recipes that are in SAVING DINNER. The food I have prepared using this cookbook has been popular with my family. I love having the menus and shopping lists prepared for me. It saves me about thirty to forty minutes each week in meal planning preparation. I should add that these recipes take thirty minutes or less to prepare."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Wow, what a book. I can't say enough good things about it. Eveything I have cooked has turned out well and gasp!, been eaten by my family. I love the fact that I don't have to agonize over what to cook for dinner -- we usually ate out is what happened.The book is organized into seasons so you can take advantage of fresh veggies and fruits. I like the fact I can print the shopping lists off the internet.After a couple of weeks of doing this, I had most of the staples on hand, so my shopping list is even smaller than before. An added plus is that I can now go to the grocery store and know EXACTLY what I need to get. No more &quot;I might use this&quot; only to have it languish in the depths of the pantry never to see the light of day again.Leanne has gotten me back in the kitchen and LOVING it. I actually have told my husband, &quot;No, I'd rather cook than eat out&quot; (I can't believe I've actually said that), but that's how good these recipes are. I've tried things that I never thought would pass through my lips.A real plus is that Ms. Ely is available by email to answer questions. She is sooooo nice.I'd recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I got myself this book as an early Christmas present. I can't believe the difference it has made in my life. We have gone from eating out and scrounging for dinner at least half the time to having a home cooked meal every night.The menus are great and the shopping lists make it all so easy. I can take it and buy everything I need for the week.My sons, the best of the picky eaters, are eating things I never dreamed they would eat. I am actually able to get the eat fish (something they never did before). When they discovered that I was using cod, they got all excited and said they were eating Captain Hook. I realized soon enough that it was their own little joke about codfish. So now, they look forward to their weekly serving of Capt'n Hook, LOL.I can not say enough good things about this book. It is a must for any kitchen. Even if you don't use the menus and only use it for the recipes it is worth it(though I wouldn't pass up such a great time saver if I were you). The food is so good and it is easy to follow the directions.I have already decided to buy one for my sister and my best friend. Everyone needs this cookbook."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"If you're as busy as I am, you don't have time to read a long review, so I'll keep this one short and focus on the reasons why you really need to have this one on hand:1. The menus are family friendly, healthy and economical. There is a balance between vegetarian and maat-based recipes, reducing dependence on meat and reducing the costs for food. From Turkey Meat Loaf (the FIRST turkey meat loaf I ever liked) to Pea Soup, the recipes are tasty, kid friendly and yet sophisticated enough for adult palates.2. There is a shopping list for EACH week, making trips to the grocery store quick and easy. Fresh ingredients are used and there are no recipes using foods with artificial preservatives, chemicals or artifical dyes.3. The menus are arranged by season, which means you aren't going to waste money on a lot of items that are out of season or costly.4. The author has helpful tips on nearly every page and even though I've been cooking for our family for years, I learned plenty of new info. That, in itself, made the book valuable to me since I now prepare even more nutritious meals for my family and I shop more wisely as well.5. All the recipes are easy to prepare and fit into busy schedules. That's a definite plus!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I really enjoy this book. I have to admit I was VERY skeptical about all the &quot;hooplah&quot; on FlyLady.net. I thought to myself, I bet her recipee's isn't as good as Grandma's [Southern country girl, EVERYTHING from scratch!]. So I checked it out at the library [try it before you buy it - kinda thing], and Wow, did I put my foot in my mouth! I love how organized it is into seasons, the shopping lists are neatly organized by sections of the grocery store: Meat, Cheese, Produce, Dairy, etc. With these lists I have become so familiar w/all types of food. Not to mention the meals! Oh, they are wonderful! My 2 1/2 yr old daughter has become a very picky eater and since I've been cooking from this book, she now eats everything on her plate and always says, &quot;It's GOOOOD Mommie! and &quot;Thank You!&quot; That is a Wow in our house! My husband who isn't a big fan of veggies, only like a select few [the basics: corn, green beans, carrots, broccoli, collard greens] let alone taste anything he has not heard of, is now loving EVERYTHING! He takes the leftovers to work and his coworkers comes to him everyday to see what's for lunch [half the time they think it's leftovers from a resturant, LOL] and he humbly tells them, &quot;Oh some'n my wife fixed&quot; - It's great!I really love it! I got so envolved in this book that I forgot that it was the library's! Before this book I would go grocery shopping and would make a general menu of what I &quot;could&quot; make w/the sale ads, and also buy things at random [whatever looked good at the time] but by the middle of the week we would be out of food or have plenty of things that didn't make a meal and you guessed it, no Dinner! With Leanne's book, I print the shopping list 2 weeks ahead, then I check the sale ads to see which of my items are on sale and I purchased those. That way everything that I buy is on SALE and I always have my pantry stocked for two weeks! Now my shopping list has a purpose - Six nights of dinner for two weeks! I'm saving money, my family is eating healthy and we are having good family bonding time at the Dinner Table - not in front of the TV! It truly has blessed us!Thanks again Leanne!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"My grocery bills have dropped dramatically, my fussy four year old is eating salmon, and my husband asked for seconds of brussel sprouts!! This cookbook has replaced the rows of dusty cookbooks I never used. It is easy to use, the shopping lists save me hours of time. I recommend this book to every busy mother out there. At first I was leery of some of the recipes but decided to just go with it and see what happened, my family and I have been amazed at the things we love! Dropping a dress size without trying was another added bonus. Plus the recipes don't require a mass of pots and pans which makes clean up much simpler. Thank you so much Leanne Ely."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I have been looking for a cookbook like this for many years....healthy recipes and menu ideas organized by seasons along with nutrition information per serving. The shopping lists to go along with the recipes and menu plans are an added bonus I had not considered for this \\"ideal cookbook\\". I have used the first week of Winter menus and my husband loved having all the variety of vegetables included. I had gotten into a rut of serving the same basic vegetables my mother had served. I use a lot more pots and pans to prepare the meals and they have more steps than I'm used to, but I'm not saying that is a bad thing. I am enjoying the creative process. However, I'm not sure these are the ideal recipes for busy mothers who have to work outside the home. I do like it that there is a fish meal weekly, a meatless meal weekly and a crock-pot meal weekly plus the meat and poultry menus.I do have some problems with the book. For example, she suggests some food items that I have never heard of before. Not only had I not heard of fusilli before, my grocery store did not have it. I assumed it was some kind of pasta and substituted. Some description of unfamiliar foods and possible substitutions would have been helpful.Tarragon is a spice I had never tried before. Speaking of spices, people need to be warned that the first few times one goes shopping using this plan, the shopping bill will be higher than usual until all of the spices and condiments are on hand. I was not put-off by these considerations. It is kind of an adventure to try new foods, spices and condiments. Adventures usually cost a little extra. I understand that when all of these things are on hand, the weekly shopping costs will probably even be less than what you are currently spending on groceries.However, I was put off by something else. The only meats suggested for the first week of winter menus are chicken breasts and cube steaks. I did not buy chicken breasts because my husband had already complained about me using those in an earlier attempt of mine to cook healthier. Neither one of us cares for chicken breasts, so I substituted chicken thighs for the chicken recipes. That worked fine for one of them, but not so well for the other because of the shape of the breasts. We also did not like the cube steak because it was too tough. Well, when I checked the shopping lists for other weeks, lo and behold, she had those two items on almost every week's list! So, if you buy this book and don't particularly care for chicken breasts or cube steaks, be aware that you will have to come up with alternative ideas for many of her recipes. She has no recipes for pork, although she does say at the beginning that she has been told that some of the chicken recipes do well with pork.I also had a problem with some of her serving suggestions. There are usually three suggestions to serve with the meat dish. Usually two of them are starchy and I even noticed one serving suggestion that had three starches. I understand that the author has lower carbohydrate menus on her website, so those interested in fewer carbohydrates may want to check that out. By the way, she doesn't give rcipes for the vegetables to go with the main course. Some of these vegetables are unfamiliar and you may have to check one of your other basic cookbooks to find out how to cook these foods. I had to look up kale, for example. Again, this was part of the adventure for me, but would be just an extra hassle for the working mother with young children.I did not use one of her suggested menus for the first winter week. The other five menus for the week have protein counts of 23-58 grams per serving. The corn chowder only has five grams of protein. The recipe sounds good, but I don't think that is enough protein for an entire meal. One would probably want to serve something else with this to increase the protein.Oh, yes, and if you're like me and have been cooking for forty years and don't have a garlic press, you had better get one if you want to enjoy these recipes as intended. Also, she gives menu ideas for only six days a week assuming, I guess, that you will eat out once a week. If you don't, you can plan one of your family's favorites for that other meal. Just remember to add the ingredients for it to your shopping list.All in all, I think this book is a good investment, especially if you are tired of the \\"same ole', same ole\\" , like the creative side of cooking and are looking for healthier alternatives for your family. Maybe I should have given it a four instead of a three because I personally don't buy books that have three ratings and I would buy this book again."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I am so excited about this book. I have tried several of Leanne's menus/recipes from the FlyLady.net website and have liked everything I've tried. I love that the book is divided into seasons and that the shopping lists to go with the menus can be downloaded from the internet (so you don't have to copy things out of the book.) The ideas for making some of the more sophisticated items more kid-friendly are great. I love that there is a real variety each week - not all casseroles or all slow cooker recipes - some soup (which is great for us since at least once a week we have a busy night out and a quicker meal is necessary). The tips included in the boxes beside the menus/recipes are great too. I also like that the side dishes, etc. are suggested. So many good nutritional facts included too. I will use this book over and over and I'm sure I'll include many notes in the margins to make the book even more useful next time around. Thanks, Leanne for a great idea done well!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I'll be the first to admit that I am a cookbook junkie. I buy a lot of them and, most are great for me and my husband but never succeed at tempting my kid's (age 2 and 3.5) palates. This one was different. So far I have cooked with it for two full weeks of menus. Out of 12 dishes, my kids have eaten 10 of them, the only two being the fish dishes which they don't quite have a taste for yet. That's a pretty good ratio in my house where they usually turn their noses up at anything new. To see them eating what is made the first time is rewarding both financially, due to not wasting money on food and heath wise, as the meals are really well balanced.Another reason I like this book is that it is so easy to incorporate the dishes into the Weight Watchers lifestyle. The dinners mostly fall in the 4-8 points per serving category with a few in the 10-12 (but never more than one of the higher point meals a week). The servings are extremely generous, enough so that our small family of four can get two full meals out of one dish by the time sides are added in. It really helps me track my points each day since I already know the point values of what's for dinner.There is also a lot of variety in this book, both in proteins and cooking methods. Chicken, fish, steak, ground beef and beans are all included (for each week as far as I can tell) and each week you have a range of soup, baked, grilled, and crock-pot cooking methods.I also really appreciate that the menus are divided by season. Each section has different recipes utilizing what is available fresh. I am not saying that all the ingredients are fresh as how to develop a well-stocked pantry is included."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"This is not only a nice cookbook but a great concept...that there are shopping lists is VERY nice!I found the recipes to be very easy and very flavorful with minimal ingredients. Frequently with cookbooks there are many ingredients...way more than I want to drag out on a busy night but many of these recipes have just a few ingredients.I find alot of cookbooks where you are cutting out time or fat or something...make up for what your cutting out by increasing the number of ingredients to boost flavor. I agree that sometimes that is necessary but Leanne has found a happy medium... just a few well thought out items makes for an easy and delicious dinner.Many of the foods I would have never tried without having gotten this book and I found I liked them. Things like kale for instance...I never thought to try it and with urging from this book I did try and found I liked it.I see the recipes as a springboard and I so alter them. If my family doesnt like one kind of meat or fish (or the called for item is expensive), I will use something else. If I dont want the set of spices I can use several different ones (perhaps change the mexican spices for herbs de provance)...Its a great book for busy people and you do not need a lot of cooking experience. The recipes are quite easy"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I found out about Saving Dinner from the Flylady.net website and the Flylady email testimonials. Intrigued, I bought the book in July of 2004. It's a great book and I can see why women and their families rave about this cookbook. It is not an ordinary cookbook. It has weekly menus for each season of the year with a shopping list. The meals are not only tasty but healthy. What I find impressive about Leanne's book is her philosophy that families can rejoin at the dinner table and eat wholesome food cooked from \\"scratch.\\" This cookbook helps women to organize their cooking to minimize preparation and maximize time spent with their families. I have a vegetable cookbook my mother gave me which was published during WWII. It talks about utilizing the produce from \\"Victory Gardens.\\" This cookbook means a lot to me because my father served in the Army Airforce in WWII and my mother, who went back to live with her parents during this time, had a Victory Garden. I don't intend to give my daughter my Saving Dinner book. I do plan to buy a copy for her and my three daughters-in-law. That is how much I value this book!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I was skeptical when I first purchased Leanne's book. I love to cook and didn't think there would be enough variety in it for me, but it has freed me up in the kitchen in ways I hadn't dreamed of. First off, shopping is much easier with all the lists already planned out. Second, the recipes are basic and easy -- my daughter has even started spending more time in the kitchen helping me cook. And they're easy to modify with your own extras if you want. Third, everything we've had so far has been absolutely yummy with big raves from my husband and daughter! And leftovers don't last very long -- someone is always sneaking bits to snack on, and they tend to disappear out of the fridge behind my back.If the best chefs can cook from set menus, I guess I can, too.

I especially liked the Butternut Ravioli Stew. My husband liked it too, although I didn't put enough ravioli in it. (Forgot to buy extra!) Granted, some of the recipes weren't for my 3 1/2 year olds palate, but on the whole, it has gotten us to eat much healthier.

Unlike many cookbooks, the recipes contained in Saving Dinner use COMMON ingredients and are simply wholesome dishes that won't scare off most kids.

Additionally, part of the reason I bought this book is to help with menu planning and shopping but I find that some recipes require just a little bit of certain herbs or ingredients and none of the subsequent weeks' recipes use the remainder, leaving me with random herbs or other ingredients that may spoil before I use them again if I stick strictly to the book."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"We already plan our menus but this book ha great tips and would be a great asset for someone wanting to get started with menu planning.

I have been a fan of Leanne Ely since I saw her on QVC and ordered her Healthy Foods book that contained meals for the whole family. I also have the Frantic Family Cookbook and it use it almost every week. Her new book seemed to have a lot of the same recipes with the ingredients shuffled around or the name changed. For example, Hoppin' John Soup is in her new book and in Frantic Family. With the week meal plans, on many weeknights she just has a soup for dinner-like Crock Pea Soup or Smashing Pumpkin Soup-and that's it. My kids wouldn't eat those soups and my husband would complain that's not \\"a real dinner.\\" I didn't feel the new recipes were as family friendly as her previous book, especially for a book whose goal is to get families around the table. There was a week that had recipes for Butternut Ravioli stew, Crock bean Soup with Kale-and another with Moroccan Fish Tangine, Apple chicken and Crock Pea Soup. My family definitely won't run to the table with those as the choices! Although I love Leanne's writing and her weekly menu service, and have always been a fan of her recipes, this cookbook is not one that I can put high on my list."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Ok I realized I only like cookbooks with pictures of the food.

After reading tons of RAVE reviews I went ahead and ordered it a couple of months ago. Well, I hate to say it but I am dissappointed. While I loved having my meals planned out every week and did feel less stress each day knowing so. I became sad each time my family came to the table for the ultimate &quot;taste test&quot; and heard &quot;yuck&quot; or &quot;it's okay&quot;. Dh and I were both dissappointed. I really wanted this to work so I kept on hoping better meals would come. After about two weeks my four kids (six and under) wanted to know when I was going to stop making &quot;new&quot; meals. DH complained that grocerey shopping (his job,a great bargain hunter)was difficult looking for hard-to-find as well as more expensive ingredients . It seems like the same herbs were used often and most of them,which we had to purchase new, ended up not being our taste. I started picking and choosing meals that &quot;looked&quot; good and combined with my tried and true, this worked better but eventually I fell back into the old trap of &quot;what's for dinner&quot;? So far I have about three or so good recipes that I have used over and am hopeful to find more. I do think this is the best cook book idea and that the weekly format works well relieving the stress of meal planning. Unfortunately for my family this doesn't mean much if the meals don't taste good and we end up throwing out leftovers."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I was disappointed with this book.

I looked over it briefly until I get more time but I bought it so I could save time on making dinners It looks like a very good book"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I have been using this cookbook for about four months. It has provided us with a variety of recipes and menus that we would have not tried otherwise. We liked that. We have had to make changes to the recipes because of our personal preference for foods that are not spicey and we do not like chicken breasts. She uses a LOT of recipes using chicken breasts. But, overall, I had been using this cookbook more than any other I have ever had.However, I have a new problem with it. I recently joined Weight Watchers so am carefully looking at the nutrition information after the recipes. I have found some that just don't make sense. For example, her Cincinnati Chili recipe shows 711 calories and 36 grams of fat per serving and it doesn't even contain any meat! Where are all the calories and fat grams coming from? (If those numbers are correct, I certainly could not use that recipe in my diet.) In contrast, a chili-pasta skillet dish from a Better Homes and Garden cookbook has only 311 calories and 24 grams of protein and it contains ground beef. The difference doesn't make sense to me. I prefer to believe Better Homes and Garden nutrition information since they have been tried and tested over the years.I also don't understand her how she determines which dishes are for the different seasons. I would have thought the chili dish would be a winter dish. I don't know why it would be considered a summer dish. The concept of having different menus for different seasons sounds good in theory but I don't think the cookbook author has made it work practically."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"My husband is in food service, we both work full-time and have two busy kids. We love to cook, but don't want to spend all our evenings in the kitchen. We use this great cookbook (or, if you prefer, dinner organization book) as a two-week plan. With several evening committments, it's great to be able to have all ingredients on hand and prepare a healthy, tasty meal in a short period of time. Love coming home to crock pot meals. Appreciate the variety and trying a few new things.As with every cookbook, the following ideas come in handy:* My husband doesn't eat fish - chicken works (or I cook it the night he works late).* Tuesday night is our night of chaos - that becomes our crockpot night. Mix up the order of the menu to please your situation.* We like lots of herbs and spices and use fresh if possible (nowhere does Leanne say you cannot substitute); use your family's preferences and tastes.* For a family of 4, each week's worth is perfect over two weeks for us, including a few lunches.* Personally, I feel free to use a recipe for a side I want to try from another source. And, sometimes, the main meal is all we can eat - flexibility is a good thing!* Leanne advocates lots of produce - and a salad with a meal is just about the easiest possible (for my kids, that equates to fruit).All in all, \\"Saving Dinner\\" is not just a terrific idea, it is a blessing in action. Thank you.PS - Don't like it; don't use it. But, clearly, Leanne has hit a nerve and blessed the vast majority of those who have had the good fortune to be exposed to her and her writings."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"As a busy mom of three, I was looking for a resource that would help me figure out how to get dinner on the table Monday through Friday in a cost and time effective manner. This book caught my attention because of the rave reviews and because of the author's relationship with the Fly Lady, whose advice has helped me immensely with running my household.I couldn't have been more wrong!In a nutshell, this book is a cookbook, with recipes laid out in weekly order, along with shopping lists for each week. So you get six recipes per week, with all ingredients for those recipes listed under each recipe and then relisted in that week's grocery list.For example, week one has recipes for Apple Chicken, Roast Beef Picante, Beany Burritos, Moroccan Fish Tangine, Italian Turkey Meatloaf and Crock Pea Soup.Now, anyone with young children can take one look at that list and know that surely their families will STARVE in week one because there is no way on earth that a three year old (let alone her father) is going to eat more than two out of the six. And it doesn't get much better.You might think, like I did, that you can just substitute some \\"tried and true\\" recipes for the recipes you know your family will turn their noses up at. This presents a PROBLEM however, because if you remove even one recipe from the week's roster, your grocery list is off. So you're going to have to go through and remove the recipe, line item by line item, from your included weekly shopping list. Take two or three recipes out, and you might as well just start from scratch and write your own list. Which actually leaves you with MORE work instead of less.This book has very few helpful tips with regard to getting dinner on the table, though you might enjoy the twenty six pages of fan mail at the back of the book. That's right, nearly ten percent of the book is fan mail! There are five or so pages of introduction lamenting the sad state of dinner in American homes these days. And then there are the recipes themselves, which make up the bulk of the book.If I wanted a cookbook, I would have bought one. I wanted help with SAVING DINNER, which this resource sadly does not do, at least not for my family."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"\\"Spring offers the promise that the cold is over, the bareness of winter is gone, and everything is new. Nowhere is that more prevalent than at a roadside produce stand. The colors from the vegetables themselves almost seem to call your name.\\" ~Spring, pg. 127Leanne Ely is on a mission to save dinner and considers her book a guide to understanding nutrition and feeding your family well. The recipes are divided into seasons and each section reveals eight weeks of menus with suggestions and an itemized grocery list. The grocery lists are organized according to the areas you will find all the items, which makes shopping much easier.The chapters begin with a menu for the week. Week One in the Spring includes Chicken Pasta with Artichokes, Asian Burritos with Ginger Salsa, Succotash Soup, Mediterranean Fish, Turkey Wraps and Orange Thyme Crock-Pot Chicken. The shopping list that follows is perfect and you can cross off things you already have and then head to the store to find everything you need for the week. You may already have the olive oil, soy sauce and Dijon mustard and just need to focus on the meats, produce and canned goods. There are also lists of spices, dry goods, frozen foods and things you can quickly pick up in the bakery. Flour tortillas or a can of tomatoes might already be in your pantry. So, the shopping lists make it easy to not only check for ingredients at home, they make it very easy to shop. Definitely the highlight of this book when compared to other cookbooks if you enjoy following weekly menus. If you don't have time to sit down and write out a shopping list, this is perfect and will make you feel like someone else is taking care of all the details. You could also make a game of finding out what you do have in the kitchen. This would be a great way to get children involved in the meal planning.Delicious Recipes to Look Forward to:Apple ChickenItalian Turkey Meat LoafGarlic Lime ChickenSkillet Chicken with SpinachButternut Ravioli StewLayered Enchilada CasseroleTuscan Bean and Sausage SoupMexican LasagnaGreek SaladHey, where are the desserts. That is funny. She has absolutely no desserts in this book. You get to the \\"Just Desserts\\" chapter and it is empty. But truth be told, most of us will find those on our own when at the grocery store. Who needs to put chocolate cake on their shopping list?With recipes for every taste and occasion, this book is much more than just a book about saving dinner. Leanne Ely provides delicious information tidbits, gets you motivated to shop for healthy food and reading this book is enjoyable and enlightening. You can season many of the recipes to taste and most of the recipes have delicious herbs and spices which are what make recipes really good!~The Rebecca ReviewAuthor of Seasoned with Love: A collection ofbest-loved recipes inspired by over 40 cultures"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Not only have I found some great recipes in this book, but my family (with four children) has finally expanded their tastes beyond chicken nuggets and macaroni and cheese.

The recipes are simple and the ingredients are easy to find. I faithfully stick to her grocery list and try each recipe even when I am sure no one will like it. Once in a while we have a meal that is less than spectacular but I am amazed how we have all aquired a taste for things we thought we didn't like.

We both like to cook well enough, but we had no originality left! After a night on Amazon looking at tons of cookbooks, I bought this one. It has been terrific. We save money since I know exactly what I am buying at the grocery store. At dinnertime I go straight to the refrigerator knowing what I am fixing for dinner without having to stare blankly at the food for 10 minutes first. My children, ages 10 and 5 have tried all sorts of new things to eat. My older child loves vegetables, but now my little one is less picky as well. Best of all, my husband and I don't squabble about who is making dinner. Both of us are willing since everything is already thought out. The recipes are VERY tasty, all meals serve at least 6 so there are always leftovers for someone's lunch, and they do not take a lot of steps to prepare. I also appreciate the realistic grocery shopping lists. No ingredients that are too exotic and hard to find and no stupid quantities. For example, some cookbooks with shopping lists will tell you that you need to buy a 1/4 cup mustard--this one says you need a jar. I also like the nutritional information given. I LOVE this cookbook and would recommended it to anyone!!!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Leanne - you and your recipes rock.

While I am thankful that my husband does cook, we had the same dishes over and over. Enough! I decided to take back the kitchen. But where to start? Enter Saving Dinner. Hoorah! My very skeptical husband raves about the dishes. I tried other have-dinner-on-the-table methods and they flopped big time. Having your recipes and shopping list make it so much easier to have a hot, tasty, nutritious meal on the table -even after I get home from work.

I tried making my own menus but that fell through when I would forget an essential ingredient orforget to thaw something out.My old tactic was to phone hubby at 4:30 with the plea \\"What do you feel like for dinner?\\" and then run around the grocery store trying to get everything rush home and become exhausted by the time the meal was over.

Hooray for someone who is not just pushing meat and potatoes, but is trying to save us all from a rut (and from our unhealthy eating habits). I have a 13 year old son who is not a picky eater, and it is thanks in part to Leanne's approach: why not try something different before turning your nose up at something. My son BEGS me to make soup with Leanne's recipes (because it is so good -- and, better for Mom, so easy). Moreover (as long as it is accompanied by bread and salad and a nice dessert) soup IS a sufficient dinner.

I've tried and enjoyed a couple of the recipes (Garlic Lime Chicken, Blackberry Balsamic Chicken Breasts). There weren't many others that interested me.Like most reviewers, I applaud the author's purpose - to bring families back to the dinner table. For those who've been relying on takeout food, this cookbook can help jumpstart the process of planning, shopping and preparing dinner. There are many reviewers who are passionate about this book - so it must be helping people! The recipes are quick and easy to prepare, and nutritious.For experienced cooks, there's little in the cookbook that's new. People like me, who've been cooking for years, already have family favorite recipes for meatloaf, baked ziti, roast chicken, jambalaya, chinese dishes, etc. The recipes in the book aren't superior versions, or \\"the best\\" for those. You may find some new ideas for quick dinners, though.A frustration with the book is that real beginners won't learn very much about cooking techniques and food from the book. There are some quick hints that I found interesting, but to learn how to cook and enjoy the process, you need a more complete cookbook (Joy of Cooking, The Best Recipe, How to Cook Everything, etc.) Whole categories of food/cooking are missing from this one (pork, fresh fruit, baked goods, desserts).I disagree with the author's reliance on FROZEN chicken breasts (which are injected with water and other ingredients). Buy fresh ones from the meat counter - they taste better and you'll be getting chicken rather than additives.Serious cooks probably will want to pass on this book (or check it out from the library).

But who does that every single night? Not me. I have a 40+ hr/wk job, plus a second job and several hobbies. My shelves are lined with nice cookbooks. I use them 6-10 times per year, but I don't have the time nor patience to get super elaborate on a daily basis.What's so great about this book is that while none of the recipes are \\"AMAZING\\" or Nouvelle Cuisine, they are simple, well organized, nutritious, and tastey. We're just 2 at home, but I always make the recipes for 6 and we have great leftovers for lunch &/or dinner. I usually serve with salad and skip some of the other potatoe/bread based sides, too much food for 2. I've made some of these menus for casual get-togethers with friends and they loved the meals, so never fear it's very presentable stuff. In fact, I even used one of the menus as the base (with many modifications) for a holiday feast, EVERYONE asked for the recipe.If you're looking for good, home cooking, that's simple, low stress, convenient and brings your family back to the dinner table, then this is the cookbook for you.If you're looking for the latest and greatest in cooking trends, go spend $$$ on some fancy book for that once a month affair, AND buy this book anyway for the other 350 days of the year."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"This is an awesome book.

I don't think it is an understatement to say this book could change lives, because it makes it possible for even casual cooks and extremely busy women (and who isn't??) to bring the family back to the table, as the subtitle says.I love to cook and love reading cookbooks, but this is a cookbook you won't want to just read, you'll buy it and it will become one of your \\"go to\\" cookbooks.I do not follow the system the author has devised for weeks of meals, or seasons. But you can, if you want to. I mix and match, cooking what appeals to me. But the mere fact that she has arranged the weeks' meals, with shopping list, should sell millions of this book for consumers that want that extra help.The recipes are terrific, I've made too many to even count from this book, and there is not a single \\"dud\\" among them. (I have to admit I never tried the pumpkin soup another reviewer here disliked -- but I would not expect to like pumpkin soup, so would probably never be drawn to that recipe. I have, however, loved the Asian Honey Chicken, the chicken with garlic and lime, the roasted lemon chicken IN THE CROCKPOT...and so much more.)Along with my Betty Crocker Cookbook, this is the other book on my shelf that I turn to when I'm planning my weekly menus to bring my OWN family \\"back to the table.\\" No, these are not company dinners - but you have your fancy recipes and expensive ingredients you will use on those special occasions, right? This book is full of day in, day out, healthy and easy to make food for your family.Note: The way I'm raving you might think I am a friend of the author's or something.

It's beauty is it's simplicy. My husband liked it so much that he became the \\"dinner manager\\" at our house, doing the main shopping and cooking. (Who am I to complain!) We all take turns helping out with the cooking and cleaning. The recipes are so easy to follow that even our teenagers can pepare the meals, which they do weekly.We now eat more greens, eat much less red meat, have eliminated fast food, and have much more vitamin A in our diet. Our grocery bill has been lowered even though we have gourmet meals every night.We have gone through some withdrawals, though. We used to be the fast food junkies sloshing through the high-fat superhighway. Our arteries are thanking us, but our bellies and sweet tooth sometimes rebel, telling us that nirvana is just around the corner in a crisp uniform and a drive through window.After two months, we are getting more used to the transition and one of the main benefts besides \\"saving dinner\\" is \\"saving family\\" by cooking together, eating together, and doing the dishes together (the teenagers can't see the beauty in that part yet)."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I bought this when I discovered it at the book section of a department store. It was just what I needed. It had all the menus planned out, the shopping list ( you can even print these out off her website) and tidbits on cooking (how to cook Butternut squash, which oils are better, etc).In the back are awesome recipes for making Ranch dressing, cornmuffins, easy cole slaw, etc. I have bought this book for 2 other friends of mine.Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"this book was recommended to me by a friend. My family isn't so crazy about beans so there was a number of recipes we couldn't try because of the beans, but the ones we've tried so far was okay.

Most recipes are healthy, yummy, easy to prepare, and fast. If you cook by the book, your family will sample new foods (my kids were gobbling up KALE!) and dinner will become a pleasure! Just a suggestion: I'm keeping notes in my book about which recipes were favorites and the like. Eventually, I'll be able to compile a rotating schedule of meals that I know everyone likes."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Ms Ely has brought more peace into my hectic life than any book I've ever read -bar none.This is an lovely book for new brides and new mothers, because it completely takes performance anxiety out of the kitchen. I'm so proud to serve a hot meal to my children and husband each night. They have liked Everything from the cookbook, even things I thought would make them turn up their noses (chicken with apples). Vegetables that I have never prepared (butternut squash) are met with curiosity rather than open comtempt...now that's progress."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"The last thing I need is more clutter - and cook books can be clutter. But I made an exception and bought Leanne Ely's book as soon as I saw it. Like thousands of people, I was first introduced to Leanne by &quot;flylady,&quot; and I often found myself scribbling down recipes Leanne sent in her on-line &quot;Food For Thought&quot; column. It always seemed like my family liked whatever creative, healthy recipe she devised.Leanne doesn't disappoint with this collection of fast, easy, family-pleasing recipes. My children, who normally groan at the idea of &quot;boring old&quot; soup for dinner, raved over her corn chowder and cornmeal muffins the very first night I brought the cook book home.I like the way she organized the book by seasons, since I never fix chicken and dumplings in July or BLTs and lemonaid in January. I enjoy her breezy writing style, which makes her sound like she's a friend sitting in the kitchen with me. Her mini-article, &quot;A Case for Oil&quot; is recommended reading in itself, and a good example of her writing style. In it, she defends a bottle of olive oil in Food Court, and in the process, explains &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; fats in a way anyone could grasp.I also like Leanne's whole premise that the family dinner, with everyone sharing their day around the dinner table, should not be obsolete. With help from Leanne, there's no reason to run through a fast food window three times a week."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I bought this cookbook and was very excited about it, as I am a flybaby. I used it the first week and the meals seemed pretty good. But as the 2nd week and the 3rd week past, the meals seemed very bland and very repetitive. My husband said my cooking without the book is much better! I don't normally use recipes, but I thought this would be a good way to help organize meals. It unfortunalty was not. You are better off using a free meal based w/ grocery list web site than spending your money on this or check it out from the library and see for yourself."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I applaud the effort Leanne took to put this cookbook together. It always amazes me how many families I know who 1) don't sit down to eat dinner together, and/or 2) rarely eat a balanced meal. This would be a great book for them, as \\"Saving Dinner\\" does all of the work including providing shopping lists.I've really enjoyed this cookbook, although I have to say that I do not use it as designed. I like more flexibility in my weekly menus and have many recipes of my own that I incorporate. I try to sit down each Saturday and create a menu and shopping list for the coming week so that I can do my shopping on Sunday. I often incorporate recipes from \\"Saving Dinner,\\" but I do not rely solely on them. I also have to agree with some reviewers who said that the side dishes can seem repetitive plus I would like to see some pork recipes even though the author doesn't care for pork herself. But I do like that the ingredients tend to be things I usually have in my pantry or that are easily found in the grocery store. (I have other cookbooks that have far too many unusual ingredients, and I can't stand paying $5 for a new spice to make a recipe I don't know if we'll like.)Our favorite recipes in \\"Saving Dinner\\" include Garlic Lime Chicken, Chicken Balsamic, and my husband (the fish hater) will even eat a bit of the Asian Orange Salmon. Plus my two year old can't get enough of the Crock Navy Bean Soup!I'm glad to have this cookbook and there are a bunch of great recipes in it, but I've only given it three stars because isn't useful to me as a one-stop solution for my weekly menu. That being said, I still recommend it for anyone looking to help in the kitchen!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I have waited a long time to buy this book. I didn't want another cookbook sitting on the shelf that I rarely used. This has been remarkable. My family loves the dishes even when I was hesitant, they literally raved. The recipes are beyond simple. We are foodies and I wasn't sure they would take to easier fare. I am so pleased to be able to bring a complete meal together without hours in the kitchen and without breaking the bank. I have saved money, time, and my sanity. It is a pleasure to sit at the table with my 15 year old daughter and share a meal with conversation! This book makes dinner simple and so tasty. The weekly grocery list actually works. I could kick myself for waiting so long to buy this book."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"This book has some interesting recipes in it.

Our family of 3 has been using this cookbook for over 2 weeks now. I do not like the idea of some of the things that were listed. However; the recipes make the food taste great!! Great ideas and great recipes! Thank you!! P.S. The only thing that I would say is that some of the recipes are not kid friendly. However; we figure that if a child is not going to eat much of her meal the child must not be hungry. Otherwise, our child has tried some of the different meals. I think that it is great for the child to at least try out something different and me to! :)"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Another mom told me about this book and it really has been helpful to have the grocery lists already made for the week, and some yummy meals on the menu!We substitute for meals that we're not crazy about - and tend to shop for only 4-5 meals a week since we always have leftovers. It's a great guide for the busy family!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I'm on the fourth week of the winter menus and am truly enjoying the recipes.

The planning aspect of this book is pretty good, but the recipes are pretty bland. I have made 6 recipes so far, and all of them seem to be missing something. I can play with them and tweek them, but I am not very happy about a recipe book that every recipe needs working on. If you like full flavor foods and simple food with gormet leanings, I would recommend a Rachel Ray book instead. She gives lots of menu planning/grocery shopping help as well and her recipes are always fabulous."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I prefer this book to the menumailer service which mails a week's worth of menus and the grocery list to your inbox as I like to adapt the week's menu to what's on sale. That said, we are expecting our sixth child in a few months and my older kids and husband can easily cope with buying the groceries and making the meals without me having to think of a thing! Alright!Michelle Geffkenwww.Homeschoolblogger.com/YesYouCanPublications/"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I have to say that this book really is a great starting place for people like me who have never been able to figure out how to get the \\"what's for dinner?\\" question answered in any consistant stress free way. I have to admit that the recipes although good, do most often need a little imagination brought to them as far as seasoning goes. This really isn't a problem though, even for the inexperienced cook, just think in terms of reaching for the salt and pepper shakers and you are on your way. One great thing about this book is the shopping lists. Going to the grocery store used to be such a floundering time consuming chore. Now I just breeze through with my list. Who knew that having a list would get me in and out so fast! Okay for some people I'm sure they are thinking \\"duh\\", well maybe they don't need this book. For me this book makes me feel like I've been given a whole chunk of my life back that I've been previously wasting by being stressed about what I couldn't get a handle on by myself. It's all done for me now. The recipes are also simple enough that I know they will be done well under an hour, unless of course it is a slow cooker recipe in which case is still a relief because I'm free to do other things while dinner cooks itself.Believe me, when my family used to ask me, \\"What's for dinner?\\", my usual response was along the lines of, \\"I don't know, what are you making?\\" Imagine their surprise the last several weeks of coming home every night to something good and different and not once has anyone been asked to go pick up take out. Without this book I am a decent cook but my problem has always been the planning part. Working and taking care of so many other things at once has always put the meal planning at the bottom of my priority list. Since getting this book I really feel like I'm doing something great for my family and the amount of stress that has been relieved from me in the evening has actually made me feel like the evenings really are time to relax and unwind with my family. Much better."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Evernight since I've started using this book religiously (about 4 months now), my husband reaches over the dinner table, takes my hand, looks deep into my eyes and says, \\"Honey, this is SOOOO GOOD\\".I can't believe that a fabulous home cooked meal is an everyday event for my busy family. I've bought lots of cookbooks and never really used any of them. This one not only has really delicious recipes, but the shopping lists make it so easy to actually get dinner done. I can admit that I'm finally learning what all those weird things in the produce aisle are used for. I think if I keep using this book for a couple of years I'll actually become someone who can say they cook. Unitl then I'll give all the credit to this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I have never been a cook. The very idea of cooking was enough to send me into a panic. This book is heaven sent. I am now in week 3 of the summer section and every single thing I have made has been successful. Healthy, easy and fast. I can not say enough good things about it. It may have saved my marriage."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I loved this book! I found quite a few recipes inside that quickly became family favorites (I have 4 young kids). This has got to be the MOST user-friendly cookbook on the market. I especially love the shopping lists, downloadable on the website! Not only that, but I learned many things, such as how to choose a squash or how and when to add spices to recipes, that I had never learned before. I'm stocking up on this title to take to bridal showers for the rest of my life!!!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I love this cookbook. I use it every week. I love the way she breaks out the recipes by season, so you are always using ingredients that are in season and easy to find. I also love that these recipes use 'normal' ingredients unlike other cookbooks I own. Most of the time I have all of the ingredients I need right in the house. These recipes are easy to make, delicious to eat, and they are healthy! It's not easy finding all of that in 1 cookbook. Thank you Leanne!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"This book is such a lifesaver. I use it every week to plan our meals, shop and cook each night. The recipes have been for the most part very good, and easy to make. The variety is wonderful. The best part is having something delicious to reheat the next day for lunch. I would highly recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I bought this book along with Saving Dinner the Low Carb Way and Saving Dinner for the Holidays last year.I LOVE the concept of having the weekly menu planned out as well as the grocery list put together and ready for shopping. We went through the entire book and I have to say, it really broadened our food horizons as we had been stuck in a rut for a long time with our regular foods. Also, the books really did eliminate a lot of stress by allowing me to know in advance \\"What's for dinner\\" and be ready to prepare it.The only cons I can think of would be that the food is not exactly kid friendly, and you will need to be an open minded eater. If you have a lot of people with finicky preferences in your household, this may not be the book for you. Also, our grocery bill for two went up from about $75 a week to $125 because of the veggies and meats. Good, healthy quality food ingredients, but unfortunately, painful to the wallet. For kid oriented and somewhat less expensive menu options, I would recommend Brook Noel's \\"The Rush Hour Cook's Weekly Wonders: 19 Weekly Dinner Menus Complete with Grocery Lists for Today's Busy Family\\", also for sale on Amazon.com. I tried that book before this one and it really turned me on to the grocery list/recipe book phenomena that lead me to Leanne's Saving Dinner books.Overall, I would recommend Leanne's Saving Dinner books. For the open minded foodie. Or for those weeks that you just want to not worry about dinner and the grocery list. These books are great to have and do offer a good variety of recipes to broaden horizons while removing some stress."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"This is a great cook book that helps you get on your way to sucsessfull, healthy, in-season meal planning. Your shopping list is made for you as are recipes for dinners for the entire year. You won't eat the same meal twice for a whole year! It's great for beginners and seasoned cooks can spruce up the recipes to their liking. This cook book is a wonderful weding/bridal shower/college student gift."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I love the recepies in this book because I know I can trust Leanne to provide a healthy meal (with healthy side dish options) that my family will love, but not weird ingredients that my kids won't eat or I won't be able to find in the store. I also recommend her Low-Carb book for the same reason."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"This book has made me love cooking again! I was so bogged down with meal planning and grocery list making. Those days are no more! Leanne has done all the legwork and I just to enjoy making new foods and and knowing my family is eating healthy, delicious food. Every once in a while there's something on the menu that wont go over well with my kids (like fish) but Leanne has you cover. Make a family favorite that night or you can substitute the fish for chicken. I love this book!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"This is a wonderful organizational book for family dinner time. Author provides an excellent variety of health-conscious meals for a week, complete with side menu suggestions, and a shopping list as well! An added bonus is that the shopping lists may also be downloaded from her Web site. Following the author's suggestions, it is fairly easy to shop wisely, save time and money, and actually know in advance what you'll have on the table each night for dinner. I am working on having each of my 3 kids (ages 18, 15 and 13) help with meals for the week. One of them chooses the week of meals they want to try, I take him or her grocery shopping with me (along with the list of course), and I help them put the meals together in the kitchen. They get a real sense of pride and accomplishment, at the same time they are learning good consumer and cooking skills. If planning out meals a week at a time doesn't work for you, you can always pick and choose recipes you want to try. I've tried several different weeks, as well as individual recipes, and have yet to be disappointed."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I borrowed this book from the library, then put it on my Amazon wish list - got it for Christmas. Slowly but surely I've been incorporating recipes and shopping lists into my cooking. I choose a week with about 3 recipes I want to try. I first checked the pantry and freezer for supplies and then modified the shopping list to fit what I needed and supplement for the other 3 nights (one night is order in) It was easy to do and great to get us out of the rut of spagetti, shake and bake, and frozen pizza. So far there is only one recipe we didn't like - but rule is atleast have to try it - but we love garlic lime chicken. We even made up extra garlic lime chicken spice mix for easy shake-on seasoning.I don't use this book as my only means of cooking and recipes and I don't think it should be. But it is a great supplement and great to kick start into good habits. Since there aren't any pork recipes it's easy to find those and add it in for a day - but the saving dinner menu mailer (www.savingdinner.com)does include pork as well as other meal options (veggie, low carb, kosher)For the price and recipes it is a great value!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I purchased this cookbook (and also the menu mailer on line) from Leanne, based on the recipes she provided on Flylady's site. This has been such a wonderful time-saving purchase for me and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone. Do I love all the recipes--no, not all of them. Did I hate any of them--nope, not a one! Have I tried other recipes from other books and loved all of them--definitely not! The time factor is such a major help, and most of the recipes are really delicious. Our family is eating, at home at a decent time, every night. This book is the reason!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"This book is a great addition to my collection of cookbooks. In conjunction with my copy of &quot;Meals for the Month&quot; I don't have to think at all now of what I am going to cook. Best of all I don't have to make a shopping list. I appreciate the extra little information blurbs along the sides of the pages. After 28 1/2 years of planning meals I am grateful for a boost in the arm! Thanks."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I actually don't mind cooking, but coming up with ideas week after week is the hard part for me. I've owned cook books that have sat on the shelves collecting dust. I don't even think of this book AS a cook book! It's an instruction manual of sorts - very different from any other 'cook book' I have seen. Leanne groups the meal ideas by seasons, which is very inspiring to me. With each recipe, she adds a footnote of SIMPLE side dish ideas that would go well with the meal - the key word here is SIMPLE! And I can't forget to comment about how she has organized a shopping list for each week of recipes! I also like the breakdown of nutrient value, fat grams, etc. This book has made my life much easier and has taken away the &quot;frozen pizza again&quot; guilt! I also subscribe to menu mailers from your savingdinner.com website. It's great to be able to print out a weeks worth of recipes, take them to the store with me and be done with thinking about dinner for another week!

This method of planning helps me to know what is going to be on the table every night, reducing my need for convenience foods, unhealthy alternatives to good meals, and take-out. &quot;Saving Dinner&quot; is filled with nutritionally sound menus that are planned out weekly and organized by season. Every week has a shopping list to make even the most budget-conscious chef happy. The meals in this book are healthy, flavorful, simple, and relatively quick to make. As a homeschooling mother of three small children, I enjoy the time the author has put into &quot;Saving Dinner.&quot;I have found all the nutritional information in this book to be sound."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I have always loved cooking but have never cooked so healthfully until using this book.

I enjoy this cookbook so much that I loaned it to a friend to try while we were on vacation. I may have to buy another because I don't have the heart to take it back! It is VERY WELL ORGANIZED, EASY TO USE and the food doesn't taste smothered or overseasoned. I actually use what I buy and don't have to throw food out because it \\"hid\\" in the back of the fridge.

However, I found that he food had a lot of prep involved, took way too long to prepare for a mother of a toddler and an infant and just did not taste good! I didn't like many of the recipes and I tried over and over again to make it work because I loved the grocery list, no thought required part. I have since found the best cookbook! The Six O'Clock Scramble by Aviva Goldfarb. Same concept, MUCH better food and quicker prep times. And she does not use any processed foods, lots of veggies. The amazing part is, I love the food, my picky toddler eats the food and my husband, who himself cooks some truly gourmet meals loves it too.

It saves time as there's no more searching for what to have an hour before dinner.The recipes are basic enough for any cook and those with extra culinary skills will find it easy to add their own style to the dinners.For me it's one less thing I have to think about during the school week.

After having three kids and trying to run my home and raise my own children...I was too exhausted to do much in the kitchen for dinner. My family had developed the bad habit of eating take-out and fast-food nearly every night. With this cookbook of simple recipes and organized lists, the work was practically done for me! I just had to shop (mindlessly for once) and cook a meal that blessed my family's health. We haven't sat in front of the t.v. for over 6 months during dinner. Each evening, my super-picky kids hang around the kitchen trying to guess what smells so good for dinner. We eat and laugh together.

Thank you FlyLady for leading me to this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I always hate to question \\"What's for Dinner?\\". I read the reviews and decided to give this book a shot (from the library) My husband was so happy to have dinner on the table every night at 6:00 pm (since we both get off at 5:00) All the recipes were easy and my husband raved about the food. I saw the book at a thift store the next week for $4 and had to have it. I only do this book 2 weeks out of the month since getting all the fresh vegetables and meat tends to be expensive. This book is great for anybody who doesn't want to or have time to plan out a weeks menu or doesn't have that much time to cook dinner!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I'm a homeschooling mom with 2 kids, picky eaters both. But not as picky as I am! I'm not an adventurous eater, by a long shot. I'd never bought cabbage before using this cookbook. After reading raves for the recipes on several forums, I decided to buy the book and just make the recipes, even if I though I wouldn't eat it. I've used the book for 2 years (there are enough recipes for me to pick and choose), and have only found 2 recipes that won't work for my family. (The potato crusted fish just burns in the pan for me, and the chicken recipe early in the spring section that uses frozen concentrated orange juice was just plain gross. Both of these could be user error, though.) That's pretty good considering how picky the 3 of us are. (My husband will eat anything I put in front of him, including that OJ chicken.) There are recipes that will stretch how you eat, but the cooking is pretty straightforward. I own the first edition, and there are a couple of typos but the corrections are on the website. I believe they've been corrected in later printings.If you are going out of your mind trying to plan dinners, buy this book. I need another one, because mine is in tatters."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"For me, this is a wonderful book. I love the simplicity it can bring to dinner time. If, however, your family is like mine (even my husband refuses to eat his vegetables), you will be in trouble.One meal a week seems to be vegetarian. Adventerous recipes I would love makes my family cringe. They won't even try it! Unfortunately, I haven't gotten to use this book as it is intended to be used:(The shopping list makes everything extremely easy, though. Take the book to the store, buy what you need (you'll save a fortune this way!), make a home cooked dinner with easy recipes...the layout is fantastic.I am jealous of those of you who can use this book, because everything is SO wonderful. If only I could get my family to agree."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I am definitely menu/meal-challenged! I heard of this book through [...], and this is such a help in meal planning and preparation."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"This book is so much more than a cookbook! I have 2 somewhat picky eaters in my house, and finding things that they will eat is difficult. I have been using this book for about 4 weeks now, and they both LOVE dinner every night. It has also made shopping for dinner VERY EASY, and the recipes are not hard and don't take that much time. This book has been a god send in my house! Thank you Leanne, and keep them coming!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Leanne's new book makes dinner a no-brainer! Her emphasis on whole foods that are nutritious, recipes that are healthy and tasty, and balanced meal plans have made my life so much easier. No more fretting from week to week about what to fix. No more buying a jar of this &quot;to use sometime&quot; and then never using it. As was mentioned earlier, I am tossing most of my other cookbooks and just following the menus!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"The premise of this book is FANTASTIC!!!! And great for many families that I have found haven't learned how to cook, how to plan a balanced weekly menu, or how to make proper grocery lists (I have seen many friends and acquaintances that have to run to the market daily because of a lack of planning....and it's because they haven't been trained to do it!). I firmly believe that the breakdown of the family unit in the 70s and 80s is rooting itself in family kitchens now with moms and dads that don't know how to do much more than pop a frozen meal into the microwave or call for takeout. This is where Leanne Ely steps in. She has done a great job making a basic plan to get dinner made fast, tasty, with healthful ingredients. I agree that there isn't a lot of variety in her menu plans, but I do like that she uses a lot of seasonal ingredients and cooking methods. Yes, if you follow all of Leanne's serving suggestions, you will probably turn orange from the amount of baby carrots, or have really good digestion from the amount of salads, BUT it is really easy to steam some fresh green beans, or roast broccoli or asparagus, or prepare a baked sweet potato. You don't have to follow her side dish recommendations....I don't! I have written next to each recipe that I have used all of the different side dishes that our family likes with that particular recipe. Also, if I find that a recipe needs more spice (which isn't usually the case....but I do have children, and they don't like overly spicy foods, but they do appreciate well seasoned things), I also make note of that in the book also.I agree with one other review that I read about the amount of editorial mistakes in this book. Unfortunatly, I have found this with all of Leanne's books. The test kitchens and editors aren't working very well together on her books, and unfortunately, it does show up in the end result of her books.Leanne has gotten my children to expand their culinary horizons by eating more fish and different genres of cuisine (such as greek). The great thing about her book and recipes is that my 12 year old can step in and make dinner for me if I am busy with other things....the recipes are well written and don't use any complicated cooking or preparation methods.I do highly recommend this book, especially to anyone that is planning challenged."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"In just 1 1/2 weeks, this book has completely changed my home in the most wonderful ways! I have a newborn baby, but I am able to make wonderful meals with little effort. My husband and I thought eating was going to have to be an afterthought once the baby was born, but instead it has gotten amazingly better! Not only that, but my grocery bill was about $50 cheaper this week (a huge deal now that I'm a SAHM) and last week I didn't throw out any uneaten or unused food! Plus the Garlic Lime Chicken is everything the book reviews said it would be....my husband is still talking about it a week later!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I love the shopping lists. I could never put together lists like those myself and who has the time anyway? I love only having to go to the grocery store once a week and knowing on any given night that there will be something healthy to make for dinner. I love how easy and fast it is to prepare most meals. There aren't a lot of fancy recipes and not all the meals are really great but my family eats good, wholesome food almost all the time now and sometimes the meal is really, really yummy! Some people have complained about canned food but canned food is sometimes as healthy or healthier than fresh and it is easier too. If you want a good solid and consistent game plan for family dinners and you want to eat a variety of healthy foods buy this book."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I keep buying copies of this book to give to other people. I like it because it has simple, tasty recipies that appeal to a lot of people, ie kids & husbands. LeAnne uses different seasonings (I have tried some new ones for me) that always turn out delicious, and not too much. I don't use the shopping lists, I just use the book for the recipies. I like the fact that the recipies are basically very nutritious and the recommended side dishes are easy to do and very healthy. Some of my favorites are Mexican Torta, Carmelized Garlic Chicken and Skillet Pizza. I took the Mexican Torta to work for a potluck and everyone wanted the recipie. I am an experienced cook and fairly well organized and love having new healthy recipies to try!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I really liked this book. It has a bunch of easy to follow, and easy to make, recipes that serve 6, which is good for my large family. I recommend it to anyone who has a busy life and a family to take care of."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"It really does save. I use it for patients and several have purchased it due to the ease and savings!!!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I enjoy Leanne's style, and have enjoyed a few of her recipes as well! My kids are enjoying the Themed dinner schedule, and I am still trying to get into the rythym of the system but I know it will be great when I do!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I ordered this book afer I came across it in our local library. For about 3 months, I was on this constant search for how to plan healthy, quick meals that would satisfy my family of 6 (4 kids ages 2 1/2, 5, 7 and 8). Cooking is my hobby. I must have 100 cookbooks that range in difficulty (very gourmet--to Cooking with 5 ingredients) & I am a self proclaimed, Food Network \\"junkie\\"---I could watch that channel all day long--huge fans of Barefoot COntessa, Rachael Ray and Emeril, and do find joy in using their recipes. I tried using Rachael Ray's magazine weekly pull out shopping list and menus for my family---even tried to include my older kids to help me to cook---some meals came out great, however, most were still too spicy, too \\"weird looking\\" or too time consuming (even though they are supposed to take 30 min, who really has 30 min of uninterrupted time?)Also, I found myself having to search in the grocery store for most of the ingredients---then I came across this book. I must have been drawn to SAVING DINNERS as I quickly scanned the cookbook section at the library insearch of yet another tool to help me perfect the shopping/cooking/cleaning/feeding part of my daily life as a mother. To say the least, it has been an amazing tool! The shopping lists are easy to follow (and can be downloaded from the website instead of lugging the book), include regular ingredients you most likely have on hand---they tend to repeat, too, so you are not stuck with a container o something you wont use and it goes bad. As for the recpies and how they taste---they are very basic. In my opinion, you need little cooking skill to complete them (chopping, measuring, stirring, baking, saute, some briol, etc). They are not spicy, not salty, and are generally low fat---so you might have to add a little of this and a little of that--but don't you always?. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is trying to figure out how to \\"do it all\\" but most importantly, bring the family back to the table for dinner and relieve you of stress."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Love this book and everything about it. I went to go buy one for a cooking-clueless friend for her wedding and shame on me for not looking closely at the size dimensions of the book. The cheaper copy is a palm-sized paperback... What a pointless format for a cookbook! They should stop printing it in this format. The recipes are far from conveniently on a one-page glance. Save yourself return shipping and get the bigger book!! Besides this a big fan!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I have just received this book, and I am so anxious to try out the recipes. I like the author's approach to cooking for the family. I have used her recipes before from a site on the net, and have always been pleased. It's also so handy to have the shopping list right there so you know just what to buy. This should be a &quot;best seller&quot;!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Leanne's book is absolutely wonderful! It simplifies my life tremendously (and with 8 children, going on 9 I need all the simplification I can get!) The recipes are delicious and the side dish suggestions are exactly what I need. I also subscribe to her menu-mailer. Well worth the money!!!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Well...I was very excited to get this book for Christmas, but I have to say the recipes are not my favorite. Some seem a bit too strange to me, like sweet bean burritos (using sweet potatoes and black beans). Most recipes have lots of onion as well, so you have to chop onion every night. Not fun for me. I agree that they seem a bit bland. It's fun to see new ideas, but when the ingredients are some that I have never even heard of...I was just a little disappointed. It's a good thought!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I own over a thousand cookbooks, now that I have Leanne's I can start donating many of my old ones. If you have a busy life and would like to feed yourself and your family some good food without breaking the bank or spending hours in meal preparation, this is the book for you. This is an excellent way to get organized around your cooking and meal planning - this will take care of the what is for dinner panic that can hit us at the end of a long day.This book is written logically and thoughtfully - what may be common sense to some is unknown to others and I was one of those people that needed more things explained to me - thank you Leanne for getting it and for understanding that we are not all born organized and knowing how to cook."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I was really excited about getting this book, and I hate to be a negative reviewer on this, but....The first problem I had with this book is that the recipes are kind of \\"out there\\" - pretty exotic stuff in many cases. My kids just aren't going to eat Apricot fish, cube steaks with blue cheese, or Moroccan fish tangine, you know? And I honestly lack the time to make fancy meals on the weekdays - if it has more than 5 or 8 ingredients, I'm not likely to cook it, unfortunately. Maybe when my small children are older I could cook like this, but it is not happening right now.The second problem I had with this book is that most of the recipes center around meat - salmon, chicken, fish, etc. We are a single income family struggling so I can stay home with our young children. Our grocery budget would grow out of control if I made meat the \\"Main Dish\\" at every meal. I could not afford to feed our family this way.My last dissappointment was that this book really is JUST a list of recipes with shopping lists. I thought there would be more in the way of tips for getting home cooked meals done for your family, or tips on eating healthy, etc. But no, its just a list of recipes w/ attached grocery lists and nothing else. You could easily come up with something just as good on your own using the internet and picking recipes your family will actually eat and can afford. There's just not much to this book.So, for me, this was a waste of money. I know the author is trying to do a good thing and has her heart in the right place, but I would not use 80% of her recipes to start with [which makes the shopping list useless], and I couldn't afford to eat like she does even if I wanted to. There are cheaper and better ways to eat healthy!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"When I looked at the number of positive reviews, I almost decided not to write one... then I realized I had a unique perspective... I haven't actually read this book - I have just been the happy beneficiary of my wife getting a copy!I love to cook - in fact, I used to do most of our cooking. But when I got more responsibility at work and didn't have the time, we fell into a pattern of fast food, frozen dinners, and one or two quick 'standby' meals.My wife asked for this book, and my first impression was basically, \\"Why? We already have a ton of cookbooks we aren't using!\\" but I'm glad I got it for her. She has been cooking some excellent meals, and she finds it fun and simple. The fact that shopping lists are already prepared is a small, but time-saving feature. This isn't just recipes - there is a complete menu, shopping list, and weekly plan. She has become a much better cook, and I lost 4 pounds in two weeks!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"wow.. You know, I don't normally review books, however I am going to make an acception here. A friend had suggested this book to me and having owned several cook books I was hesitant to add another one to my list. But this isn't your every day cook book.Leanne includes helpful information, recipes that are easy to follow and a weekly shopping list for supplies. It can't get any easier than that to plan ahead for the week and feed my family.Carpooling two teenagers to sporting events took it's toll. Eating fast food not only expanded my waistline, it shrank my pocket book. Using this book helped reverse that trend. The best part? My family LOVES the meals we prepare.. She even has a lo carb version, which I own as well and those recipes taste so good, my family doesn't even miss the carbs!!If you are wanting an easier way to bring the family back to the dinner table without killing yourself or your pocketbook, then this book is definatly for you. I like it so much I've purchased them as gifts for friends."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Leanne Ely does exactly as promised in her book's title...Saves Dinner and brings the family back to the table to eat together! This book has been a Godsend for our busy family. It makes dinnertime a breeze and cooking actually fun! I used to dread dinner time and shudder when my husband or kids would ask \\"Whats for dinner?\\" Now I can just glance at one of the pre-planned lists and tell them. The menus are made out, the grocery list made, the recipes simple but most of all, they're delicious and healthy too! Thanks Leanne, I don't know what we would have done without you! (Love your menu mailer too!)"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"What a great book for the family on the go. If you need a little extra help getting a homecooked meal on the table- Leanne's book will help you out. The shopping lists are a true God-Send. Thank you so much Leanne! Our family now eats together."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I purchased this book expecting to use it as a supplement to my already in place menu and shopping system. I have found myself using the menus and shopping lists exactly as what is found in this book! I have a husband and 4 children and the reviews from all of them have been outstanding. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I love this book. I actually enjoy cooking, but I don't always enjoy planning what's for dinner. It is so refreshing to have a grocery list already prepared. I know that when I get home from the store I have everything I need to make healthy meals for myself and my family all week long. The best part is that I never have those 'cupboard full of food and nothing to make for dinner' moments.The food tastes wonderful and my family has already picked up a few new favorites. None of the recipes would be difficult for a beginner, and the author is careful to note potential pitfalls (for example pointing out to cook, not boil, a cream soup and why). Separating the menus by season is another nice feature, as is the nutrional information with each recipe.There are no pictures, though, so if you need a picture of dinner to be inspired to cook, this is not the book for you. Otherwise I would recommend giving Saving Dinner a try."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I have been waiting for this book to be available! I already knew of Leanne Ely from Flylady, and had already tried several of her recipes with great success. Leanne has taught me a lot about healthy cooking, how to stock my pantry, and how to plan a well balanced meal. All this from her Food for Thought essays through Flylady. So when I heard she had written a new book, I couldn't wait to get it. One of my favorite things about Saving Dinner are the side-dish suggestions with each meal. I feel so good knowing I am feeding my family completely healthy meals. My family RAVED over the Crock Beef Sandwiches on page 7, which was one of the easiest meals I have prepared in a long time. My husband and I also loved the Apple Chicken. We look forward to trying more and more recipes from Saving Dinner, and I am adding Leanne Ely's other cookbooks to my Christmas list! Thank you, Leanne! I wish I could come see you at the Flyfest in Chattanooga!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Meal planning has always been a chore for me. I used to come home from the grocery store after spending over $100, and my husband would ask, &quot;so, what's for dinner?&quot; Well, that was a good question! This book saves me time (no meal planning and list making) and money! I bought a week's worth of groceries at a fraction of the cost, my kids love the food, I know the meals are healthy and best of all, &amp; I am much less stressed!!! Thanks, Leanne for a wonderful resource. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I got this book, and I was so excited by the idea of a weekly plan and shopping list, but I guess my family is too picky. I made an entire week right out of the book and my family did not like a single recipe.The concept is fantastic, so I think I will pick my own set of recipes and then construct my own shopping list and go from there."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Having a shopping list for the week has saved me so much money in wasted food. I used to buy stuff thinking i would cook it, but then without a plan, without a recipe in mind, we often just ate out and then had to throw the uneaten food out once it spoiled. Such a waste! Now, everything I buy has a PURPOSE! Less wasted food...less wasted money.And that's not even the best part! The recipes are actually GOOD! My husband is one of those picky, meat and potatoes guys, so for the first week I let him pick out which week in the book he thought sounded best. I think he got three quarters of the way through before he found one, and even then he was skeptical! But everything I've made he's gobbled up, and that has included pasta, chicken, turkey, soup, and even fish! So now that the water has been tested, I feel confident making any weeks' meals in this book; it's just...good...food.This book is as much about lifestyle as it is about cooking. It gives you direction, and it takes the \\"i don't know what to do with this\\" or \\"I'm missing this one ingredient\\" out of the equation. Everything you purchase gets used, and the recipes are simple and good. I am buying this book for my mom who is a busy real estate agent, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to cook more and eat out less."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Thank you, Leanne, for helping me feed my family better! No, not everyone likes all of the dinners but I have them marked as to which ones the family likes, which ones the kids like and which ones my husband likes. I make the ones the kids like when my husband works late and sometimes I'll make the kids something quick and easy and make something nice just for him and me. Also, my kids have tried new things and discovered that they actually like many of them! No, they still won't eat zucchini but they do like fresh spinach and other things, much to their surprise! And, with the shopping list built right in it takes out so much of the stress of buying groceries with toddlers in tow! Thanks again for all of your hard work and for all you've done for my family! :)"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"This book has helped me make dinner a routine rather than an crisis.

The positives of this book for us were:1. The meals are delicious!2. Most of the meals are easy to create.3. There was a lot of variety and we got out of the recipe rut.The negatives for our family were:1. We don't like eating this much meat.2. Our food bill went up. We never ate dinner out before either, so we didn't notice a cost-saving there.3. The recipes call for a lot of fresh produce in the winter, which doesn't always make sense. I rarely use fresh tomoatoes except when they are in season."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I use this book 6 out of 7 days! These recipes are very good & nutritious and will save you a ton of money on your grocery bill! I'm probably spending about the same amount of time cooking, but now my results are far superior and my family is much happier. Since the menus are broken out by season, you will be taking advantage of the foods that are in season and at their peak. The shopping lists simplify life and the planned menus take the thinking out of cooking. You can set yourself on automatic pilot and simply implement the plan. You'll have the peace of mind knowing that it was put together by a nutritionist, too. Prior to \\"Saving Dinner\\" my 11 year old would only eat white food: chicken, fish, rice, pasta and of course, refined sugar; needless to say, a very picky eater. She calls Leanne's recipes, \\"the yummy food\\" and I no longer prepare separate meals for her. I am halfway through the book and hope Leanne Ely puts out another one before I'm done! She has certainly taken the hassle out of cooking and shopping for this household!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I'm spending less $$ in the grocery store, we eat more healthy and complete meals, and I spend half of my grocery store time in the produce aisle.

My family does have some dietary allergies (including seafood, which is included in every menu), so I do not use the weekly menus or the shopping lists.I am annoyed by the author's somewhat pompous attitude, like her inclusion of a fake dessert section in which she states \\"you don't need me preaching at you to eat your vegetables and then wreck it with a gooey dessert recipe that will pack on the pounds and send your pancreas into overdrive.\\" If we don't need your preaching Ms. Ely, then why include that page at all? Presumably we are adults who can decide whether we should make and eat a dessert by ourselves. You may be a nutritionist, but you're not our mother.Also, do we really need 27 pages of \\"testimonials\\" from the author's blog readers, in addition to \\"rave recipe reviews\\" printed with some of the recipes? We get it lady--you're a good cook and menu planner. How do we know? We already have the book in our hands! Your egomania is \\"distasteful.\\""},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I love this cookbook,as well as the low-carb version. I was skeptical when I first heard about this book, because I didn't think it would be likely to have the same goals in cooking as I did. I like meals to have well-balanced nutrition, great flavor, be easy to fix, use produce that is in season, and have variety from meal to meal. This book has it all!My husband loves these meals, he is the envy of his office at lunchtime when he brings leftovers.This book has improved my life, no more sitting in front of a blank sheet of paper with a blank mind trying to come up with a weeks worth of meals.I now am giving this book at bridal showers."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"This is one of the best cookbooks I have ever seen for making practical, everyday dinners. The recipes are healthy, easy to prepare, and extremely varied. You can follow the weekly menus or pull from various weeks, which is what I do. Even though I don't follow the menus day to day, it is still an invaluable tool that I could not do without at this point. The majority of the dinners that I make now come from this book--even for company! AND I have tried several cookbooks!! This one does not leave me stressed and panicking about dinner every night. I am also going to buy the low-carb version for some more great recipes! OH, also, I gave this book to two different friends who both LOVE it and primarily use it for their meals now!!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"This takes the thinking out of dinner time and the recipies are great. My family loves the variety and it makes it fun for me to cook new things...not the same old stuff. We are not big fish eaters so I leave that off the shopping list. I love having a list to grab and go shop without planning for an hour first. Dinner is ready everynight. Great book!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I put this book to use right away after it arrived using the first week of spring recipes even though it wasn't officially spring yet. I loved the provided shopping list ... even took the book to the grocery store with me & just followed the list. I definitely love the concept of having all the items on hand at home for a week's worth of dinner recipes ... kinda' wish I had the same set up for breakfast & lunch but the concept of this book is an example of how to plan ahead for the other meals too. Not all the dishes have been liked by my family -- I personally have liked all of them -- but they can be finicky sometimes. The planning ahead element & the having everything on hand when preparing dinner is great ... I also like the variety of recipes because sometimes it seems like I'm fixing the same things over & over and it gets boring ... and it dawned on me that for those recipes in the book that we determine we don't want to make again, I can switch out with the dishes we do like & just plug in those meals for those days. This book definitely tackles one of moms' daily challenges -- what to have for dinner today & do I have all the ingredients."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I must say that I have used this book for 5 years and had to get another copy since the other was worn out. My husband loves the recipes...it is broken down by season, so you always find the ingredients. You shop by week (no need to run to the market every day)--you have flexibility about when you make the recipes of course (it's nice to have a plan all thought-out for you!) Finally, the recipes are delicious and healthy!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I borrowed this book from our library to try it out before buying and after trying it out I decided to buy it. Have tried several weeks worth of recipes in this book. A few misses, but most recipes have been excellent and it has gotten us out of our rut! Love the organization and layout. We have a family of 4 (2 very young children), so we often have leftovers because each meal serves 6. So, I don't always make all of the side dishes, or I will skip a day or two between meals. I will say that I get excited to cook and try the next recipe she has ready!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I was sceptical at first. I started the flylady routines and this book was recommended. I ordered it from Amazon and upon receiving it, I look through the entire book. All the recipes are seemingly ordinary with common ingredents that a well stock kitchen would have. So I tried it. I have only used this book for about four weeks now but it has changed everything. The recipes are simply delicious! I'm amazed at the variety and the ease that it all comes together. My husband like to cook, but has trouble whipping up a meal without a direction to start. This book is the perfect solution. All I have to do is go to the store, using the book's included shopping list, buy the food, and bookmark the day's dinner. On days that my husband gets home before me, He finds a booked marked recipe with easy to follow instructions and I come home to a superbly cooked meal. Since it is just the two of us, we have leftovers for lunch the next day all ready to go.There is just not enough time nor space for me to write the amounts of compliments that this book deserves. Try it! It's a wonderbook."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"This is such a great concept- and it works, if you are faithful to it.I got cookbook/guide a while ago and used it haphazardly at first, choosing to follow it on some weeks and ignore it on others.Then, a friend of mine who saw it at my house and ordered it started following it faithfully and told me of her good experiences with the book. I decided that I would give it a go, and have not been disappointed.I have only skipped one recipe in the \\"schedule,\\" called Beans and Greens, because I knew my family would not go for it, but I make all the others without prejudice. For instance, last night I made the Mexican Lasagne and even though I KNOW my daughter doesn't like beans/legumes, I put the black beans in the recipe anyway, just as it was written. Surprise! She loved it!I am of the opinion that it is good to expose our kids to all kinds of different foods and not give in to their eating quirks and preferences or you end up creating the \\"mac and chese-only\\" monster.My family has enjoyed every recipe I have made, and I spend far less time stressing over dinner. We have saved time, money and effort, and I can safely recommend this book now from EXPERIENCE.One caveat I should mention- sometimes I notice that the author could be a little more clear in her instructions. If you are a brand new cook, you may run into some confusion over some of the recipes. I would suggest reading through them first and making sure you understand everything before you begin cooking. For example, in the recipe I cooked last evening (Mex. Lasagne), one of the ingredients listed was a can of enchilada sauce. A can? How many ounces? I couldn't find enchilada sauce at my grocery, so decided to make my own from a recipe, but I needed to know how many ounces of sauce to add to the recipe. I ended up doing a search on the internet and found that Ortega sells cans of Enchilada Sauce that are 10 oz. it would have been a lot easier if the ingredient list called for one 10 oz. can of enchilada sauce....Still, a little creativity usually overcomes these few shortfalls. I still think the book is good enough to give it a 5 star rating."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I received this book as a wedding present and didn't open it for the first year I owned it because the recipes were too simple for my husband's and my taste. We love to cook and love experimenting with flavors, and everything just seemed bland and unimaginative.However, it was the only cookbook I brought during the time I spent in South America doing research for a few months. I love the joy of cooking complicated recipes for my husband at home and honestly, I was worried that without him I would be too lazy to cook healthy meals just for myself. Also, I knew that it would be difficult to get many different spices and I didn't want to buy things in bulk that I would not go through in two months.When I got there, I realized that the nearest supermarket was ten blocks away, a distance I would have to walk with grocery bags, and that because my stay was only temporary, I didn't have all my kitchen supplies from home to use.I have given a number of the recipes in this book a try, and while I still hold the same views I did before, I have to say that for someone who needs to eat simply and does not have a wide range of ingredients or kitchen tools, these recipes have turned out reliably well. I have made the garlic lime salmon (not the chicken, although I substituted chicken for the salmon, but it is a different recipe than the one everyone raves about) and pepper chicken. I was glad to have extras so I would not have to cook every day, which took the stress off.So I would recommend this book for someone who needs simple recipes with easy-to-find ingredients."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I bought this book because of the wonderful reviews and the endorsement from the FLYlady. What a wondefrul tool for anyone who, like myself, was challenged in the kitchen. I felt overwhelmed by coming up with dinners to feed my family and for doing the shopping. It took me all of one minute upon opening the book to realize how simple Leanne makes cooking for people like me who are not born organized. My family, especially my husband, has been extremely happy with the progress I have made using this as my kitchen bible. I now take pride in being in the kitchen and being able to prepare a meal for my family. I highly recommend this book and encourage anyone who relates to my situation to get this book now. If I can do it, so can you!!!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I've always know nutrition is important and variety is the spice of life, but before this book I would get into dinner ruts where I'd make the same six meals week in and week out. I have two toddlers that eat the food I make with this book and like it. I buy so much produce and actually use it! It is so easy to make great meals quick with this book! The meals will not be ready in ten minutes (well a couple are, if you do the night before tips) but really if you are using good ingredints to make a healthy meal should it take 10 minutes to prepare? This book makes me confident in the kitchen, and always introducing new foods to my family!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I enjoyed this book and her low-carb book as well. It was great for getting back into cooking after having a baby and working full-time. I just followed it like a manual, whether we liked the food or not, so that we weren't picking up takeout yet again. The food, however, was very, very bland to us. We are used to a lot more flavor and spice, and not so many gravies on foods! But we stuck through it for a couple of months, and then started modifying recipes (a lot). I highly recommend it to begin to get into the habit of cooking and grocery shopping with a plan--but for the sake of your taste buds, branch out some after you get used to getting in the kitchen!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"The meals are great; the shopping lists are focused; the children are eating a better variety of meals; and we save money. We have given a copy of this book to friends we like it so much."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I love this book! I have gotten rid of a lot of cookbooks that were sitting around never being used. Not this one! This has fast, healthy recipes and a nice variety. Thanks, Leanne for saving dinner!!!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"This book has brought variety and nutrition back into our dinners. To date there has not been a single dinner we altogether hated. Some we preferred over others, but that's life. They were all straight forward to prepare and chuck full of veggies and other healthy items.We have been using it over 2 months, every week. Very happy with it."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"This book is a great start to planning daily meals.

(and help your family try more variety in their diet)And then to have someone else figure out the shopping list (all you add is what you need for breakfasts,maybe a few lunches (since the dinnner leftovers-if there are any- make great lunches and household/personal items.

After listening to us rave about the recipes and the plan, my mom is buying a copy for herself and my brother. I have always enjoyed cooking, and have developed a 4-week menu plan with shopping lists. However, after using those 4 weeks for 7 years, we were tired of the recipes. It was wonderful to find Saving Dinner, with a similar approach but many more weeks of recipes. Many of the recipes are unusual, but all are delicious! I like all the vegetables that are used, and although we don't eat red meat, find it is easy to adapt any recipe to suit our preferences. The variety in the recipes as well as the healthy menus make this book a keeper."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"The shopping lists are organized and easy to use, and I love that I can print them off the Internet. The recipes are easy to follow and quick to prepare. The big test came one night when I was late getting home from the office. My husband, who doesn't often cook, knew I had the day's meal marked in Leanne's book, so he jumped right in and made dinner. It was fabulous! He said, &quot;This is the best cookbook you ever bought.&quot; That's significant because I collect cookbooks.Thanks, Leanne, for saving us disorganized cooks!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I think this is the best investment I have ever madeLeanne's cook book is not just saving my dinner butwe can have leftovers for lunch and I don't have tothink about menus or make a shopping list with 2 smallchildren helping.

I didn't think Leanne could teach me anything. But I love the quick, healthy, recipies. Do we love everything--no. I have a couple of hundred cookbooks. But I have never cooked as many recipies out of any book as I am out of Leanne's Saving Dinner books. Some have complained about her vegie selections. I am thrilled to have the healthiest vegies she suggests with our meals. Buy this book if you want to save time and eat healthy."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I have tried about 4 receipes from this book and the hubby and two young children and my self have all been very happy with them and they are reasonable ingredients to obtain, and seem to be a kit with the kids!! Bonus!!!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"The book has helped us with meal planning. They give shopping lists and you make use of stock items you already have at home. Even guys can do the recipes in this book."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"All of the recipes that I have tried from this book have be fabulous! Even the picky eaters in my family are eating things they never imagined eating & liking. I definitely recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I have two small children and a picky husband. It's hard to find things that they will all eat. I was pleased with the selections in this book. I have made several of the meals and they have really enjoyed them. The meals are easy to prepare and use common ingredients."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Because of this book, I only make one weekly trip to the store, and I always know what's for dinner. I don't have to stare at the fridge and pantry and wonder what I can fix. I know that I have all the ingredients that I'll need to make 6 yummy dinners. I'm eating a lot more veggies, trying new things, and spending less money. I got this book for my sister for Christmas and after I flipped through it, I decided that I needed to get one for myself. I'm so glad that I did."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"After trying menu mailer- I decided to give this book a go.YES- my family likes most of the recipes. Of course there are some that not all of us likes- there is no pleasing everyone all the time so please don't expect it to! I write who liked what right in my book. I have found several that are \\"company is coming, wait till they try this great dinner!\\" recipes.YES- the sides can be repetitive- but OPTIONAL. They are starred in the grocery list so they are easy to find and omit if need be. The point is- I don't want to cook 3 involved dishes. The main dish and some simple salads/vegetables to go with it are ideal for me. That is why they're like that- she says so in the book. Most of us don't have an hour to make dinner.YES- I love that there is a crock-pot recipe every week, and the \\"do ahead\\" tips (like cooking more of something to use in the next night's dinner recipe) are great!YES- MOST of the veggies it calls for are fresh. Not much canned food is called for in the book at all.YES- I have more fresh food in my cart and more from the produce section than I ever have before- and more than anyone else's cart I see!YES- Some of the dishes call for things I usually didn't buy and have never tried. Not only that, at the check out I am often asked what things are by the cashier, so not alot of people buy these items much either. But I like the different foods- and I am not afraid to try them myself and make a good impression on my family for being open-minded enough to try new things.YES- I am secure enough to make substitutions! We don't like cilantro- so I use something else! Duh! We are not robots, and don't have to follow the exact rules!This really helps put good food on the table. I work, run a home business, lead a Girl Scout troop, and have busy small children. I am busy! I know that I have a hard time planning a menu- it's a pain and hard to make time.Leanne, thank you for a great resource!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"This book by Leanne Ely is a great buy for both new cooks and those (like myself) that have been cooking for ages. I have also been a Personal Chef before settling down to be a full-time mother and homemaker. Take it from me, this is a GREAT cookbook!Her menu suggestions are very healthy and the dishes are very tasty (and not bland at all...if you find that is the case, then just season to YOUR taste). My family of 5 (including 3 very picky teenagers) LOVED the food.Leanne is also a sweet lady. Although I do not know her personally, when I was in need of some advice, she was very prompt in sending me a personal e-mail reply.I HIGHLY recommend this book (it also makes a great gift). Please do not be put off by those that did not give this book a good rating. There are always going to be those that tend to be critical and pick apart what others consider a masterpiece. This book can stand alone and also is a great complement to the other books on my shelf."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I have been using this cookbook for about 6 months now making meals 2 to 3 times a week as my husband cooks or we are out the other days. I adjust the shopping list for just the meals that I'm going to cook. I also tend to make the meals I think we'll like as I don't make all 6 meals in the week.First off, after using this cookbook for a couple of weeks, my husband said &quot;Don't ever use that cookbook again&quot;. But I kept at it! Then I made the Garlic Lime Chicken and I've never heard any complaints since! (By the way, I must be the only person in the world you didn't care for the GLC.) I think that he wanted the things that I used to make (lasagna, pasta, steak, etc.), all meals that were heavy in red meat and carbs.We have gotten used to eating Leanne's healthy way and as a bonus I've lost 10 pounds. Also, I have leftovers that I can take for lunch the next day.The meals are simple and quick to cook. Plus, it's a bonus not thinking for 10 minutes about what I want to eat and then ending up ordering pizza.This is the only cookbook I really need!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I signed up for Menu-Mailer, and after trying it decided to try this book. My family loves the recipes, and we are trying so many more things to eat now! Shopping is simple now (just print the list off the internet), and since the recipes are for 6 we have leftovers to have for lunch or the 7th night (since there are 6 menus per week)! We are eating so many more vegetables, and I love it. Before, we didn't even eat at the table very much- this book has brought the family back to eating at the table."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Around 5:00 at the place where I work, you can hear the women asking each other &quot;So, what's for dinner at your house?&quot; One coworker says she doesn't mind the cooking, but she wishes she didn't have to think up what to eat every day. Another bemoans the fact that her family ends up with take-out food so often. Ely's book can really help with this situation.Each week, you can print out a shopping list from the website associated with this book, write in breakfast and lunch items, and head to the store with confidence. You will be able to come home from work every night and cook a healthy, balanced meal for your family. I live in a rural area, but still have no trouble finding the items on the list.The menus for each week include a soup or salad meal, fish, a crockpot meal (most families nowadays have at least one day a week when they need to eat in a hurry, so this is a plus!), and beef and chicken dishes. The meals rely on seasonally available produce, and cooking methods reflect the seasons -- for example, you don't need to use your oven in the summer. There are only six meals given for each week, so you can pull a family favorite together for the seventh day, or have a meal out. Having used the book for a few months, I have found that the shopping lists leave me with enough extra food to cook for the seventh night. There are no breakfast or dessert suggestions, but the neatly categorized lists print out with space to write the needed items in.The recipes themselves are very good -- if you like vegetables, lean meats, whole grains, and spices instead of salt, fat and sugar. If you are concerned about your health, this is the way you should be eating, so it's worth giving it a try. I am not going to pretend that my kids get excited about brussels sprouts, but they are gradually getting accustomed to eating healthy foods, and I appreciate that. The variety of dishes is excellent -- there are homey foods like burgers and elegant dishes like Chicken Pasta with Artichokes. All are quick, easy, and flavorful. I probably wouldn't have bought this book just for the recipes, but I have been surprised by how good these simple dishes taste.I still use my large collection of cookbooks (after all, you only have 6 dinners for each week in this book -- that is not all the cooking required of moms), and occasionally pull a recipe from the internet when I am willing to go to the amount of trouble involved in that. But I love this book, and I think that most family cooks will find that they save time and money by using it, even if dinner doesn't need saving."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I was at wits end, looking at the grocery store specials and trying to figure out what to plan for a week of meals. Inspiried by the testimonials about this book (received through the flylady site) I decided to buy it. This book has managed to bring down my stress level by planning my meals for me and, has the added bonus of a grocery list! The recipes are so simple and not too time consuming which is great when you have three kids to keep an eye on. My francophone friends and family wish there existed a French version of the book."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I consider myself a VERY good cook, and I collect cookbooks. My problem has always been deciding WHAT to cook! This book sure makes things easy for busy people. Even if I don't follow the daily recipes exactly, I might make the suggested entree of the day from an old family favorite recipe. Leanne's suggestions are quite varied, and the grocery lists make it simple to only need to go shopping ONCE a week! I recently ordered another copy of this book for a friend, and am getting myself a copy of her new book....using low carbs for meals. All of the recipes that I tried in this book have been delicious and easy to make. I'm looking forward to trying some low carb dishes, as I am a caretaker for a disabled man who is diabetic, and it has been difficult figuring out what he should should be eating and yet being creative. Thanks Leanne!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I have been cooking for my family for 25 years. I was bored stiff. More often than I would like to admit we were eating takeout because I couldn't stand eating the same five meals over and over again. For Christmas I got Saving Dinner ( by the inspired Leanne Ely).We have gone through almost 16 weeks of menus. I LOVE IT. My neighbour was so impressed by my raves that she bought The Low Carb version. A nutritionist at work ( hospital) told me the average person uses 3 recipes from any new cookbook they purchase. I've used 90 so far. I love feeding my family again. Thank you. I feel like I have my self-respect back in the kitchen. I wish I could email a bit of the joy I feel. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.5"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Hooray for this book. I won't go on about how great the shopping lists are and how liberating it is to know what is for dinner every night and to have everything on hand. That's really the icing on the cake. The real beauty of this cookbook is the amazing, simple recipes that my family absolutely loves. So many of them I serve when extended family or friends are over and I'm always getting asked for recipes. And I've only done the Fall and Winter sections so far! The Italian Turkey Meat Loaf is such a favorite of ours. It is the best meat loaf and so healthy. Both my kids, 5yrs and 18 months, love it. I double the recipe and freeze the extra one or take it to a family with a new baby who needs a break. We also love the Baked Rigatoni, too easy and so good. Our favorties include: Garlic Lime Chicken, Baked Ziti, Herb-Crusted Chicken Piccata and the Winter Vegetable Chowder is so good and hearty, I wish I could make it every night. There is also a Crock-Pot Beef Stew that is wonderful and makes the house smell great all day. I love the serving suggestions and my family has never eaten so many vegetables in our lives. This is one great cookbook."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Having someone plan menus (including side dish suggestions), make complete grocery lists (and make them available to print out via the internet), and compile all necessary recipes in one book is a tremendous help.My family appreciates eating something other than our oft-repeated family favorites (MY favorites, because they are cheap, easy or both).I think the author is doing a colossal service for those of us who want to spend less time planning and more time enjoying the company of our families."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I can't say enough good things about this book. My copy is wrinkled, written in, and has been loved nearly to shreds!I purchased this book at the suggestion of a friend who subscribed to Leanne's on-line service. I was skeptical at first, and thought it sounded great, but doubted I could really get much from it. I was wrong.I have hundreds of recipes, but few of them ever ended up on my table, especially on week nights when we are tired and hurried to make dinner. Leanne's genious is in giving you the recipes, menus, AND the shoppings lists! You can download the shopping lists from her website. I've been using the book for 6 months now, and now receive the on-line menus too, and I've been following them faithfully every week.I choose just 4 of the recipes each week, and usually have leftovers 2 nights from the recipes. Not only have I become a better cook, but my shopping bill dropped in half. I'm not kidding. All the while, my family is eating better, and I can tell they really appreciate it. The meals are very healthy and balanced -- not just each individual meal, but the entire weekly menu. She gives you side dish suggestions too.The book may not be for everyone. If you're born organized, and are able to come home and whip something up without any stress, you may find the book unnecessary for your family. But if you are like most people, and could benefit from somebody doing most of the thinking and planning for you, this book will be a wonderful addition to your kitchen."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"This is the greatest book. I love to cook but with 3 kids, a part-time in home job, homeschooling and all those extra curricular activities I just didn't have time. And although I love to cook I hate to shop. This book has made shopping a breeze and cooking is so easy that we always have a homecooked meal. My husband and kids have loved each meal I have made from this book. The author really knows her stuff and has helped me to create nutritious meals that everyone loves. Thank you Leanne for your hard work in putting this book together. You will never know what a great service you have done for me."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I love the concept, the recipes are generally good, but I wish someone had proofed the lists and recipes better. There are ingredients missing from the shopping lists that you later need for the recipe and quantities are misprinted. The website has a link to go and check all the updated corrections but I thought the point of this was to save time. I think someone will come along with a better version soon. It needs to be at least thorougly proofed before publishing again."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Saving Dinner is not just a cookbook; it's a lifestyle change. Who would have thought that a single parent could work all day and still come home and put together a great meal day after day after day? We used to eat out 3-4 times a week, just because I was too tired and we had no time to cook. Somehow Leanne has weaned us off that crazy lifestyle and my kids and I are eating healthier and spending less. These are terrific, easy recipes and are organized by the season. A must-buy for everyone."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I just recently recieved this book as a gift, having used the Menu Mailer in the past. I looked through it, and can not WAIT to start using it. Everything I have made from Leanne has been between good and fabulous, and this book looks to be just as promising. THANK YOU, LEANNE!! Now all I need is the Low-Carb book, and I will be set for the entire year, LOL."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Not only will you have your meals planned for the whole week, you will probably loose weight! They are all very satisfying, healthy meals filled with veggies and healthy grains.The recipes are divided into each of the four seasons, with 8 weeks of recipes for each one. Each week of recipes has only 6 meals planned, so you can have a night to either eat leftovers or eat out. Each week typically has 2 chicken dishes, 1-2 vegetarian meals, a fish night, and a beef night. At least one of those recipes will also utilize the crock pot. You will take advantage of what is fresh and in season. I love that the summer recipes use the grill a lot, and never have you turning on the hot oven. On the other side, the winter recipes have you using the oven for great meals and the crock pot for yummy stews.This book got me so organized, and stopped our family from eating fast food more than we should. You'll love it!!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"This is the best cookbook I own. I have to confess, I don't use it the way it's meant to be used. I tried for a couple of weeks, but there were too many dishes that didn't sound appetizing to me. My husband and I are not into sweet dinners (made with apples and such) and there are a few, so I just couldn't follow the book. There were also a few that I just knew wouldn't be something I'd like, so I skipped them. I figure there's not a cookbook in the world that I'll be able to say I enjoy every recipe in.However, I went through the book and picked out a few meals that sounded good and gave them a try, and they're excellent! That alone made the book worth the money for me. The meals are really simple to make (and unlike some reviewers I've had no problem finding any of the foods at the store) and they're really good. I've had to tweak the recipes a bit, but nothing major. I have been searching for a cookbook that has simple meals that your average person would cook (not some gourmetish type meals) and this is the first book I've found that has what I've been looking for, real meals for real people. I'm a new mom and I'm trying to find a few meals that I'll be able to cook for my family.Favorites - my husband and I loved the Chicken Piccata. Very simple and very tasty. I've made it about 4 times now and it's always good. He loved the Stuffed Quesadillas (I thought they were good). We both loved the Red Beans and Rice. This was a dish that sounded too simple to be as good as it is. And last night I cooked the Chicken and Rice Chowder and my husband LOVED it. You have to understand, my husband is not a man who gets excited about food, but he said, &quot;Wow, this is really good!&quot; And later last night he asked when I was going to make it again. I really loved the Parmesan Drumsticks, which I must confess I was afraid to make. After reading the recipe I thought &quot;That's going to be a disaster.&quot; I watched them cook in the oven and then gave them a try, and they were mouthwateringly delicious! I making them again tomorrow night.So, of all the cookbooks I have (and I have many) this is THE only one that I use on a regular basis. I would buy it again in a heartbeat."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I love Saving Dinner! I think the variety of recipies is great and I really appreciate the fact that the recipes are different and not the same old stuff that my family and I are sick of! My daughter and her fiance are home from college this summer and my almost son-in-law loves the variety and range of meals that I've made for them. I love the shopping lists. I print them out online and off to the store I go. I have found that I already had most of the spices in my pantry so it has been easy to purchase the produce, meats frozen items and canned goods that are on the list. I don't like fish, but night before last I made the potato crusted fish with tilapia filets. It was great! I would NEVER have made a fish dish, but since I had tried several other things outside my comfort zone, I decided to try it and it was a success! Thanks for making cooking fun again and for making it so easy to try new things!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I love to cook and I have A LOT of cookbooks. I subscribe to cooking magazines and I surf the web for recipes. I have to say that this book is one of the most practical, well-rounded, and thoughtful cookbooks out there. Leanne's objective is to give you a no-excuses approach to preparing a home-cooked and healthy meal for your family. The recipes are arranged by week according to the seasons (which allows you to take advantage of seasonal foods and preparations...like the grill). Each week begins with a shopping list for that week's meals. The recipes are simple and many have ethnic influences (Asian, Mediterranean, Italian). Meals include meatless, fish, chicken, turkey, and beef...you won't find any pork recipes--but many of the chicken recipes can be prepared with pork if you like. The emphasis is on the main dish, she suggests sides that are simple like steamed carrots, baked potatoes or a tossed salad. Also, dust off that slow cooker, because every week includes a slow cooker/crock-pot recipe---and they are not the canned cream soup kind! In fact, all the recipes are from fresh and healthy ingredients, not processed foods. Very few canned items are called for...just beans, tomatoes, broth, etc. You can learn more about Leanne by visiting menumailer.net (there's a free week's worth of menus there also). And if you can't seem to find the time to make dinner, you may also want to check out flylady.net where Leanne is a contributor. Thank you Leanne for your loving guidance!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"As the man of the house, I do all the cooking by my choice. I love to cook. As so many these days though, I'd found my family relying more and more on takeout or delivery food then home cooked meals. Time is a hot commodity in most peoples lives, but Saving Dinner really helps you temendously.I consider myself a pretty good cook. What I was lacking was the organizational weekly shopping list to help pull the meal together. I found myself stopping at the store almost daily to pick up the items I needed just for that evenings meal.Well, Leanne's cookbook saved the day. I now have the lists I struggled to put together on my own. Her meals are delicious and, best of all, take little time to prepare. It saved our meal time.The recipes are easy, fast, and delicious. And lots of really good variety. Not the standard stuff you see in so many cookbooks today. And, I might add, one heckuva bargain from Amazon at just over 10 bucks."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I have used several weeks of Leanne's recipes now, and I must say that 98% of the meals have surpassed my expectations. Of course, the best feature of Leanne's brilliant book is the categorized shopping list. Making a menu and a list are a huge hurdle for me. Leanne has completely eliminated this stress and saved me so much time, bless her! Occasionally I have had to make substitutions when I couldn't find an ingredient...but the recipe still turns out great. These recipes are also *simple enough* for a cooking-challenged person like me to accomplish. Several have been only 15 minutes' preparation. The blackened salmon is absolutely delicious and so simple to prepare.I will say that Saving Dinner has raised my grocery bill a bit. However, when one considers the meals we were having before (pancakes, scrambled eggs and potatoes, canned foods, etc.) it becomes glaringly obvious that I wasn't spending enough on my family's nutrition. This way, we get fresh vegetables every night (something we rarely had before), and I am certain the vegetables are going to be used up, not left to waste away in the fridge like before. Our food is tastier and more pleasing to the eye. We have fish once a week, whereas before we had it only when hubby went trout-fishing--and I only knew one way to prepare it: breaded &amp; fried.I will also say that, unlike others with picky eaters, I have not seen a huge improvement with the intake of my picky ones. Four out of my five children are persnickety when it comes to food of any kind. However, my eldest daughter eats well, my husband and I are thrilled with the meals, and the leftovers (if there are any after my hubby gets through) make an excellent lunch the following day. We simply serve pancakes for the picky ones on the 7th day! I have determined to continue with these delicious recipes, trusting my children will eventually &quot;get with it&quot; as they grow older and their tastes mature (the pickiest ones are still very young).How nice it is to have all the ingredients on hand for 6 delicious meals. I can follow the menu in order, or choose another meal to prepare at the last minute without having to run out for anything.Twice I have had guests for dinner using Leanne's recipes and both meals were received with rave reviews. The chicken with roasted potatoes was sooo simple to prepare and mostly hands off...the oven does all the work. Yet the results were delicious! What a wonderful company recipe. My husband said they were the best potatoes he'd ever had. Thank you, Leanne! God bless you."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"The recipes are enticing enough even for me, a person who considers boiling water and opening a box of macaroni cooking. I've cooked a different recipe every night for the last two weeks. That has NEVER happened before."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I hate sitting down with my cookbooks and planning a week's worth of meals. It's not that I CANNOT plan a meal or that I DON'T KNOW how to make a balanced dinner. If I invest hours and hours of my time, I can usually pull off a decent weekly menu. And because it takes me so long to sit down with my library of cookbooks, guess what. I rarely did it. Quite often, I winged it, and quite often, my husband and I would end up eating string cheese and cereal, or hamburgers, or, when the cereal was gone and the grill was out of gas, mediocre pizza from the gas station/pizza shop down the road.Then I heard about this book that gave you weekly menus and suggestions for side dishes. This book was \\"Saving Dinner.\\" I bought the book and gave it a whirl for a week. My husband, who usually only comments at the extraordinary, commented that it was SOOOO nice to come home to the smell of dinner cooking instead of coming through the door and seeing me on the phone with the pizza shop. Wow! And the shopping lists are nice for me, because at the store, I tend to get distracted by all the neato things in bright boxes that I don't need. Having a list keeps me centered on the task at hand.If you're already a whiz at planning meals and it's something you actually enjoy doing, bless you, then this book probably won't satisfy you. But if you'd rather gouge at your eyes with hot metal pokers than pore through your cookbooks EVERY WEEK to extract a workable menu from them, then this book is your first step in making healthy meals for yourself and for your family. I like to think of it as a toolkit or Meal Planning 101. The Dinner Diva does not expect you to follow all instructions to a T, although you can. When you become comfortable doing so, you can begin to use this book as a guideline. Are you tired of steamed kale and sweet potatoes? Well, then, maybe it's time to have some butternut squash and a dark green salad instead. The book doesn't come with handcuffs--it's all about free will, here. Use this book for a while, maybe even subscribe to Leanne Ely's Menu Mailer, and maybe someday, this humble but fabulous little tool will become more than another cookbook on your shelf. Maybe someday, \\"Saving Dinner\\" will become your springboard to kitchen greatness... or at the very least, you'll be able to use what you learn following the leader for a while, and eventually draw up your own menus, competently and painlessly.This book isn't about wowing your family with a towering souffle or gorging them with gourmet goodies. It's about the basics, getting them to the table for a good, balanced meal. You can still get out your \\"impress me\\" recipes from other cookbooks for special occasions, but the recipes in \\"Saving Dinner\\" will feed you fast and healthfully day-in, day-out. It sure beats cereal and string-cheese."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I don't need any other cookbooks with this jewel! My family loves the recipes, and I love the time saved stressing over what will we eat, and what do we need to buy? We are out of the rut we were in eating the same 5 or 6 things over and over and over and over again. We are on our third week of FLYing and our second week of Saving Dinner, and our favorite (so far)is the Italian Turkey Meatloaf----DELICIOUS! What an awesome resource for FLYers, or anyone who wants to save a little time and stress! These entrees are fabulous, and the sidedishes are fabulous too. Quite often, I just don't know what to serve with the main dish, so we end up having an incomplete meal, but now that just doesn't happen anymore! We tend to need to adjust the recipes because our family eats more than 6 servings, but that is quite easy when you already have the grocery list all put together for you! We just add breakfast food, snacks and lunches and then we're done! Thank you Leanne!!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Several of my friends bought and are using this book and love it. I have a big, busy family, and we aren't home many nights until almost bedtime so I felt leary about being able to follow the book's weekly menus, but thought I'd give it a try.It's been great! Now, I'll be honest with you, we haven't loved every recipe...but we are trying lots of new foods. I write notes next to each recipe that we try so I'll remember if we liked it, and if not what we thought it needed or had too much of so I can adjust it next time.Because we're so busy, I find that I use the weekly shopping list to buy all the ingredients and then I spend a chunk of time once a week assembling most of the meals at the same time, and then storing them in baking dishes in my fridge. Then when we get home late I can throw a dish into the oven, and by the time homework is done we're ready to eat. This is working for us! It also saves a lot of time when I can cut up all the veggies and pre-cook all the meat ahead of time, rather than each night. I don't have a lot of time to mess with side dishes so I mainly do a big salad, baby carrots or other cut up veggies that are quick.Miraculously we are eating a full, healthy meal most week nights which is a huge change from the quick grilled cheese or whatever I can throw together, or worse yet ordering take-out food.I highly recommend this book. I'm only a few weeks into the fall menus and already feel it's paid for itself in the money I've saved not getting take out, or buying food that rots in the fridge because I don't have a plan to make it."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I just have to say, this is probably one of the most useful books I've run across lately. Leanne has done an excellent job of giving great ideas for meal-planning year long. I'm in graduate school right now, as is my husband and the last thing I have time to do is sit down and plan dinner for more than one night at a time. This book has been a wonderful resource for my family. In addition, a good friend of mine recently had a baby and I've been able to share meals with her family, despite my hectic schedule because dinner is nearly ready every afternoon when I walk in the door.I highly recommend this book to anyone who thinks they don't have time to plan and sit down to the dinner table more than once or twice a week. I'm happy to say that most weeks my husband and I sit down to dinner around our table five nights. Using this book gives us a chance to connect before we go our separate ways for the evening.Thanks Leanne for all you do! We love the book!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"My husband and I love to cook, and we're always on the lookout for new, healthy, QUICK recipes, so we decided to give Ms. Ely a try.While I applaud Ms. Ely's mission (and appreciate her presentation--premade grocery lists are great, as is getting in the habit of planning menus ahead of time), every one of her recipes which my husband and I have tried have been...bleh. Not terrible, but seriously underspiced and EXTREMELY mild-flavored, with one-dimensional flavors and textures. (I just made her pumpkin soup, and even after goosing up the taste with the addition of some more spices, I wish I had followed my hunches and thrown in some more elements--maybe a sauteed apple, perhaps some croutons...anything to relieve the monotony!) I'd also appreciate a greater emphasis on fresh, seasonal produce and herbs rather than canned this and powdered that.Reading other reviews and testimonials leads me to believe that this might be a good resource for people who a) don't cook at all, b) don't have exposure to a lot of kinds of food (if you don't know what to do with cumin or butternut squash, Ms. Ely can point you in the right direction), or c) don't have any time to pre-plan menus or write up grocery lists before heading out to the store. (However, once you get in the swing of it, planning on your own is a very fast process!) But even for all these people, there are much better resources out there--an excellent place to start is Mark Bittman's \\"How to Cook Everything.\\" If you have any experience in the kitchen, give this book a pass."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I found this book through Flylady like so many other people. It's a wonderful idea to have grocery lists and menus all in one book. I think this book will be helpful for people who have a difficult time getting organized in the kitchen which is probably who this book is aimed for. I REALLY wanted to love this book but just don't. I think all the meals are okay but nothing more. I like meals that taste better than \\"edible\\" and did not find it in this book. I also liked that she added sides to the meals but they are very repetitive. This book definately will and has been helpful to many women. If you consider yourself a skillful and organized cook it might not be for you. If followed, this book will give you healthy meals which is definately not a bad thing. It's just that the meals will be okay instead of delicious."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"After reading all of the glowing reviews of this book, I couldn't wait to order it. When it came, I quickly went to the week that matched what season we were in and looked at the menu. There were a couple that I knew we wouldn't eat, but I printed the grocery list on line and went shopping anyway. I really wanted to try new things for dinner. This was two months ago and I have not printed another list since. Each week I look at the menus and I just don't like what she lists to cook. I am getting really tired of boneless, skinless chicken breast. Every week includes one or two meals with this item. And garlic is used very often. Even the recipe rave (Carmelized Garlic Chicken) was average at best. I also don't like the concept of a soup for dinner. My family would look at me crazy if I put that on the table for dinner. I'm still going to keep going through the weeks and hopefully the selections will get better. For now, I have gone back to my \\"tried and true\\" menu and I add a recipe from the book that looks good. There are a couple of good recipes here and there, but it's just not our taste. I'm just disappointed because I could have saved my money and just kept scrounging around the library and internet for recipes. This book did not change my life in the kitchen like I hope it would."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I really bought this book because I have two small girls and I wanted my family to be the family who cooks dinner every night and eats at the dinner table instead of feeding the babies and us eating later. So I thought this would be more of a workbook or something to help me accomplish this. Okay, so I already have cookbooks and I can honestly say I can write and use a grocery list. So this seems to be all this book is. A cookbook with a grocery list. If cookbooks and grocery lists did it for me, I would already be cooking dinner for the family every night."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"After months of reading all the excellent rave reviews that FlyLady sends out, I decided to try it out, despite the fact that my husband has repeatedly asked me to not buy any more cookbooks, and keeps trying to get rid of the ones I already own. Although I love the concept of cooking by the seasons and the variety presented each week, and having the menus and grocery lists made up before heading to the store, I found it hard (and/or expensive) to find many of the ingredients she recommends, and I had never heard of many of her recipes before. That is scary when you are short on time and the dish sounds like something risky. A whole week's worth of questionable dishes is not my taste. Also, she uses spicy and cajun-y dishes often (not our taste), and we have to get rid of sweet dishes as my husband doesn't like them. So then you end up re-doing the menus and shopping lists anyway. In addition, her side dishes, although healthy, are repetitive and unimaginative--and I would have to look up in another cookbook how to even make them. (Far from saving time, energy and work, this creates *more*.) As for desserts, they are not in here either, supposedly because they are not healthy. But a fruit salad is healthy! All in all, I was disappointed after all the hype from FlyLady and the list (I guess nothing's for free--Ms. Ely got a lot of free advertisement). It would have been better in my opinion if it had included normal recipes I could actually use. I am trying to save time and money, not spend hours in the kitchen concocting weird-sounding dishes we may or may not like. A better idea would have been to give us normal-sounding, familiar recipes, with maybe an exotic dish thrown in once a week or so, and taught us *how* to plan menus and make grocery lists based on foods we already know how to make/know we like or don't like, and *how* to cook by the seasons. For example, I have no idea what is in season ever. My grocery store just provides almost everything all the time. That kind of information would have been more useful. I returned the book and bought something else."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Didn't realize that this was a small paperback.

The content is good and informational."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Okay, so I checked out the sample menu mailer on Leanne's site and thought it was a pretty good idea. I figured the book would be even better. Wrong. The sampler had both vegetarian options with shopping lists and menus for two people. The book has neither. I need both. I am very disappointed as this book is useless to me. Of course I can divide the recipes by 3 to get portions for 2, but that defeates the purpose of the book (to save time) and the shopping lists would be wrong as well. There are errors in almost every recipe I've tried (an ingredient mysteriously appears in the preparation instructions but isn't in the list of ingredients or an ingredient is overlooked during preparation), the food is somewhat bland, in my opinion, and could use more spices. All in all, a waste of my money."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I like what Leanne is trying to, and judging by the reviews she has helped many people. But, this book is really suited only for people who just don't know how to cook or who are incredibly time limited. I really haven't liked any of her recipes, although I want to. They simply aren't all that interesting. I find that it doesn't take me that long to sit down with a couple of cookbooks and think out a weekly menu plan and shopping list. I copy these to notecards, so I have the best/easiest recipes close at hand for future menu planning."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Where are all the 5 stars coming from and what have those folks been eating!!!! I bought this to have help planning GOOD, HEALTHY meals, but this is so centered on canned ingredients and ground beef, etc --without really any vegetables or vegetable dishes to speak of (the average \\"menu\\" suggests you just \\"add a salad\\"), that I'm not sure it's healthier than average fast food. And the recipes so far haven't even tasted very good. Why not just buy frozen dinners if one is that desperate to sit around a table at home. At least you'd get green beans in there."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I bought the book (mistake!). Flipping through, I thought I recognized some of the recipes. I use the Internet very frequently to find recipes that fit the &quot;theme&quot; of what I want to serve the family, so that was the natural place for me to look. Well, I was rather surprised to find every recipe in this book (I didn't check them all, just a few) already posted on-line! My advice -- don't waste your money on the book. Just print the index from the Amazon site and do a Google search."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I thought I had my act together when it came to making dinner...I love to cook, and have tried to make dinnertime a priority with my family. However, we were getting stuck in a rut. I'd go through my repertoire of about 10 meals, occasionally trying something new. Then, I saw this book recommended on the Flylady website, and that sparked my interest. However, I thought I didn't really need such a cookbook...I had plenty already, and I loved making my favorite recipes.Well, as I researched a bit, I found out that this wasn't just a convenience cookbook (although it is VERY convenient...shopping lists are included, and we are given a new perspective on side dishes). Leanne Ely is a nutritionist, and these meals are healthy and balanced. Plus, they provide an ENORMOUS amount of variety! I have been using the menus quite faithfully (with occasional substitutions or modifications) for two months now, and my husband, three-year-old son, and I all love them! Some meals are better than others, but all have been at least as good as what I was making! We have been introduced to delicious new spices and herbs, are eating more healthfully (more veggies as side dishes), and can invite guests over at the drop of a hat!One caveat: each 6-menu &quot;week&quot; (the cook needs a day off, too!) includes a crockpot meal. You might want to consider this if you don't own a crockpot. I am not a slow-cooker fan, but I have modified several &quot;crockpot&quot; recipes and just made them in a regular pot, maybe using some extra liquid and a very low heat. Otherwise, this book is a true find! I can't believe mine is the only review here! Whether you are trying to bring dinner back to your table or are just looking for TONS of family-friendly recipes, this book is worth its weight in gold. It's a true gem."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I started by using Leanne's recipes off of FlyLady but found I wanted more!!

WOW! I have not been dissapointed. I am one of the world's worst cooks and with this book I can actually feed my diabetic husband, myself, a very busy 15 yo and a vegetarian who eats at wierd hours with the same meal plan and shopping list.

(I'm a flybaby and heard about it there.) My husband, who is pretty easy to please when it comes to cooking and usually compliments my food, was uncharacteristically silent after every meal I prepared from this cookbook. At the end of the first week I was left with a turkey ham that was on the shopping list but never showed up in any of the recipes. The next week, I made a stew that was too watery to qualify as stew, but too lumpy to be soup. It looked so unappetizing that I threw it out and made something else. After a few more weeks of bland, mediocre meals made from sometimes difficult-to-find ingredients that my kids wouldn't eat, I tossed the book aside and eventually dropped it off at the VOA with a load of donations. I was disappointed that I couldn't use Leanne's cookbook in the way it was promoted. It fell way short of my expectations, which were based on all the praise it got from so many people.On the positive side, the concept of this cookbook is great. I made a number of my own menus and shopping lists using recipes I found on the internet. There are so many delicious, easy recipes on the internet...it's fantastic.

But when I do a Saving Dinner week at my house, they venture way out of their comfort zones and I have about a 75% success rate. That may not sound so fabulous but as the mother of these two, I am floored.You can see from the other reviews that the shopping lists are handy, the ingredients are inexpensive and easy to find, and the recipes are simple to pull together, healthy and delicious.I've indoctrinated 3 girlfriends... absolutely everyone who tries it loves it."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"This is the best investment I have ever made in the kitchen. I tried several times to recreate this concept myself.

Leanne has eliminated this waste and the time-consuming task, and allowed me to put much more interesting menus on the refrigerator door! Any night of the week I can choose what to make - and my mom or MIL can make dinner if they are watching my baby daughter. (I still don't trust my husband with anything but the knife and cutting board)I work outside the home, and shop on my lunch hour. Dinner is done and on the table by 6 pm each night and we are all happier, healthier and less stressed out. I love to cook and am also on Weight Watchers. My husband is a meat and potatoes man, no weird casseroles for him! Recently we purchased our first home, and our oven does not work. I have been able to prepare wonderful meals that we both love, save tons of money shopping, and I have not used our oven in 9 months. Sounds crazy, but between the crock pot meals, our grill, a bread maker and the Summer week menus, we have had wonderful home cooked food every night, and no worries if a friend stops by to see our baby daughter or our new house any time.By the way, I have also used Menu Mailer for 2.

None of the recipes are boring and are carefully arranged by Season so you wont be looking for anything unusal that may not be available.&quot;Saving Dinner&quot; is written in a very down-to-earth fashion and there are no cryptic abbriviations or a need for a chemistry degree to decipher the recipes.Reading &quot;Saving Dinner&quot; may make you want to buy more cookbooks but, I can guarantee you wont need to."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I found out about Leanne Ely at the best possible time!

Everyone should try this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"This book proves that an old dog can learn new tricks! I've cooked things I've never cooked before, and my DH loves it. We don't eat out much anymore, and the fastfood places are suffering, lol. I wish I had this book when I was a young harried housewife. Meal planning, shopping and cooking would have been so much simpler.With the shopping lists, I spend less and shop faster. With the menus I can plan ahead. I don't have to stand in front of the refrigerator with my head leaning on the door wondering what in the world we're going to have for dinner.I find that I can put most of the meals together in 30 minutes or less, which is great for my limited stamina and attention span, lol.And, there's a great support group out there, just for saving dinner questions and suggestions. You can't beat this!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I just have to say, this is probably one of the most useful books I've run across lately. Leanne has done an excellent job of giving great ideas for meal-planning year long. I'm in graduate school right now, as is my husband and the last thing I have time to do is sit down and plan dinner for more than one night at a time. This book has been a wonderful resource for my family. In addition, a good friend of mine recently had a baby and I've been able to share meals with her family, despite my hectic schedule because dinner is nearly ready every afternoon when I walk in the door.I highly recommend this book to anyone who thinks they don't have time to plan and sit down to the dinner table more than once or twice a week. I'm happy to say that most weeks my husband and I sit down to dinner around our table five nights. Using this book gives us a chance to connect before we go our separate ways for the evening.Thanks Leanne for all you do! We love the book!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"This book is wonderful!! I love the menues, shopping lists and most of the recipes. Some are a little spicy but the next time I just won't use as much as indicated. We are eating healthy, and there is no agonizing over &quot;What's for dinner?&quot;. My shopping bill has also been lower because I am not buying stuff I don't need."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I got this book about a week ago. I have been following the week's menu and it is great. The shopping lists make buying groceries a breeze, and I spent $70 less than usual!! My daughter doesn't like everything, but she is getting used to the idea of vegetables. I recommend this book to anyone who cooks. It is good, simple home cooking, with the added bonus of having solid nutritional thought behind it. I have been a subscriber to magazines like Cooking Light etc., but these days the magazines are calling for more and more esoteric (and expensive) ingredients. This is a book a normal cook can really use.I only wish it had been printed on laminated paper!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I've never ever used a cookbook this much in my life.In the past, my family and I used to eat out the majority of the time because we'd buy cookbooks, pick out 1 or 2 recipes that looked good or wander aimlessly around the grocery store, picking up items for an old stand by and hope we didn't forget any of the ingredients. Most of the time, we were unsuccessful and I don't know about you, but my hubby HATES to go to the store after work, so usually, we'd end up eating out and the food we bought would go to waste. More money down the drain.My family now eats veggies we never tried before and we like them! I also love that the side dish suggestions are so simple. Ely aslo stresses that they are *optional*, so there's really no reason to complain about her selection.I do have to say that we are not a family that is fond of fish, so after trying a few weeks with the fish recipes, we now skip those and either substiute an old stand-by or just go shopping a day earlier.So.... not only is my family loving eating at home, but the recipes are great tasting."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I have been using this book since summer and I think some of the negative reviewers must have impaired tastebuds. My family was stuck in a rut of the same-old dinners week after week and Leanne's recipes have made it fun to come to dinner! The recipes are not difficult to make but taste like something you would pay the big bucks for in a restaurant. My son has a dairy allergy too and I have had to modify some of the dishes, but this has not been a major issue. The shopping lists make sure you have everything on hand. I just recommended this book to my sister-in-law, and I would heartily endorse it to anyone!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I have used Leanne's Menu Mailers from flylady.net on and off for several years. My sister sent me this book for my birthday since it had been on my wish list for a while. As a divorced working mother of two daughters (15 and 11), this book is great to have for the shopping lists and planned sides as well. We have liked almost everything we have tried so far, and if an entree or vegetable is included that we don't like, we just change it. Even my 15-year-old who likes to experiment in the kitchen loves to try the recipes. Plus both my girls are eating fish now...we had Cornmeal Fish today...they hated most fish before trying some of Leanne's recipes. I do own a bunch of cookbooks, but pouring over them and making out shopping lists after working hard all day and taxi-servicing for the kids is something that doesn't fit in my schedule.Thank you, Leanne, for relieving that stress for me by doing the planning for me. If I take liberties with your recipes, I know you won't mind. I am learning how to FLY one intentional baby-step at a time. Thank you for blessing me with your knowledge and your gifts."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"after making beautiful meals and blowing my food budget week after week i decided to use this book after reading about it at flylady.net....i am a great cook and end up going to the grocery store way more than i should because i only plan \\"special\\" meals....my DS's would be climbing the walls waiting for dinner or going crazy as we stop at the store to \\"get a few things\\". you have brought organization to my meals...sure we don't LOVE all the meals but we have moved them around and very simply made it work for US...thanks for showing me how to make my lists work and save me money, time and sanity in the process....love the frugal menu planner and low-carb from your site as well...you and flylady have allowed me to enjoy my DS's and our time together more than you will ever know...peace and blessings...finally flying in baltimore, md"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"The incredible rave reviews from flylady.net enticed me to buy this book and, instead of putting it on the shelf with my other dusty cookbooks, I actually began using it. I and my family had been living off of \\"dollar menu\\" fast food for years. We either never have the time, the money, nor I the energy to think about what to make or shop for foodwise for the week. The rare times I did buy a week's worth of groceries, a good third of it lay in the refrigerator until it spoiled (a typical fly-challenged pre-fly-baby syndrome).Since buying and using Leanne Ely's book (and webpage) Saving Dinner, we buy groceries regularly and eat from a weekly menu. I make extras and use leftovers for lunches and busy times. We LOVE the food!!! Because she supplies a complete grocery list, I save time there. After using her grocery list for a month, my grocery shopping time began to be shorter than ever. And the first time I shopped for my first week's menus, because I was buying ONLY what we needed to use (and the least expensive version), I SAVE $40.00 on my grocery bill! This was the biggest surprise.With the savings every week, I now can buy desserts (who has time to make them!) and other household supplies. Realistically, there is NO WAY I would ever sit down and create whole menus and grocery lists to go with them.One other surprise was that I, being extremely overweight from years of \\"dollar menu\\" and other convenience-food eating, have lost weight without really trying and feel really fed doing it.My family and I love Saving Dinner so much, I now subscribe to Leanne Ely's Menu-Mailer for a year. I can't wait for her Low-Carb Saving Dinner book to come out. I have printed her sample week's low-carb menu off her webpage (it looks yummy) and will be trying it on my family next week! We now make a special note of our family's RECIPE RAVE recipes each week, including each family member's special RECIPE RAVES (for cooking them special meals on special occasions). Thank you, Leanne Ely --- and FlyLady (which I also bought and use)!!!!!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"After being a member of Flylady for several months, I finally purchased this book after reading dozens and dozens of positive comments regarding it. The recipes in it are fabulous, the layout is very easy to follow, and overall it is a WONDERFUL cookbook.However - I already love to cook... I already loved planning menus, creating shopping lists, and so on. There was nothing in here that created as much of an \\"Ah-hah!\\" moment as Flylady has for me.Looking back, I would have probably tried to locate this book in the library. As I said, the menus and recipes are wonderful - but nothing that I wasn't already doing. (And there are no desserts or pork recipes) :(To someone that truly needs some inspiration or new ideas in the kitchen, or just the chance to organize their menu planning, this book is great."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I recently bought this book and am looking forward to trying many of the recipes. I read the summary and thought I'd give it a try. I have her other 2 books (in fact, we published them) and have found many good recipes within. From what I can tell this book looks to be equally well-done and full of hearty, healthy meals. Some of the recipes may not strike you as &quot;every day fare&quot; but Leanne has always had a way of making everything taste great, which is why I'd highly recommend her work and menu services to anyone looking for a way to &quot;save dinner.&quot;"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I purchased this cookbook because I am a fan of Fly Lady.I didn't like the recipes.I like to decide the menu we will be having.A great cookbook I really like is Desperation Dinners.This was suggested by a friend w/ 5 kids.I find the recipes quick,healthy,and very kid friendly.My 11 yo daughter is a very picky eater yet she eats almost everything I make from there!!!Now that's a 5 star easy time saving cookbook!!!!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I had seen the hype for this book on the Flylady site.There are some good recipes in the book, and the concept of the book is great (weekly menu/shopping list). However, after putting it into practice, I was not impressed. I didn't care for many of the recipes, and had to alter the shopping list as there are only three in my family. In the end I gave up and made my own menus (which I've been doing for quite a while) and my own shopping lists. I will use a recipe from the book, but will no longer use the menu plan & shopping lists.

The cooking impaired. This will put a floor under your meals. They will be edible, and well balanced. They will also be rather tiresomely repetitive. Small children may enjoy this.2. Those who are organizing-challanged. If you can't plan several meals in advance (you may, for example, find you are working 80 hours a week, and have several small children at home. Or you may, and shame on you! find that you would rather watch TV than pick up several cookbooks and copy down what you're going to need in the coming week.)3. Those who wish to lose weight. Not that you would find these meals particularly unappetizing, at least for the first month. After which you will find that the author knows few vegetables, and fewer ways to prepare them, is apparently not acquainted either with pork, or with tofu, rock cornish game hens (if I can find them at Safeways, Ralph's and Costco, so can you!) zuccini, liver, ribs, chard, brussel sprouts, cheese aside from neufchatel and low-fat cheddar ... I hardly exagerate, but to get back to the point - want to lose weight? If you prepare the meal as mentiond, you will have conformed to certain Cooking Light/Weight watcher standards that will at least inform you of what you're eating, should you stick to the portions provided.But eating is more than this, and so is cooking. Hats off to the authoress that at least she recognizes how important it is to cook, and to have a family gathered around for dinner. Even better, if she wants to improve your health, had she also gently suggested more exercise (why, for example, are you reading my rambling prose, rather than doing 10 jumping jacks, right now?) But what do real cooks say?A) The fresher the better. So why all this canned food?B) Variety is the spice of life (of which, see above)C) A completely vegetable meal can be healthy and enjoyable (of which, there are none).If you are completely overcome, if you just can't figure out meal planning or what is supposed to happen in the kitchen, then this book is for you. But I have a higher opinion of you than that. Look for Vegetarian Express by Nava Atlas, or anything by Pierre Franey - you'll be far better off."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"i took this out of the library and saw that the ingredients were expensive and some i did not recognize. what is cilantro and tarragon? lobster for a whole family must be expensive. i am glad i did not waste money on this book."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I found this cookbook to be of poor value, will return it for something better."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Leanne is a nutritionist by trade, not a chef and the recipes reflect this. She does her best to make simple, tasty entrees that will get you cooking.Pros:- Weekly shopping list is available for printing on her website, so it's easy to create a shopping list.- Recipes rely on a variety of canned, fresh and frozen foods, without resorting to bad canned foods like cream of mushroom soup.- The six entrees for the week are a mix of chicken, beef, seafood and vegetarian, so you are not eating one type of food all week.Cons:- Not a single pork recipe in the book.- Not written by a professional chef, so there are bloopers that most cookbooks don't make. (i.e. Use 3 tsps. 3 tsps = 1 Tbsp, so why not just use the easier measurement?)- An overabundance of chicken breast recipes with a suggestion to buy frozen chicken breasts. Yuck! I'm all for saving a buck or two, but frozen factory farmed chicken in those quantities is not particularly healthy.Leanne should be given a lot of credit for convincing people to cook at home instead of dialing Domino's. In that sense, this book is a success. I look forward to a revised edition in the future."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Pros:1.Excellent concept - menus by season2.Six menus per week including a fish meal, one or two chicken meals, a red meat meal, a meatless meal and a crock-pot meal3.Healthy ingredients and side suggestions4.Nutrition statistics for each main meal recipe5.Unique ingredient combinations that taste surprisingly good6.Recipes don't take too long to prepare7.Extra suggestions and information above and beyond recipes and menu suggestions8.Shopping lists for each week in the book and also available from the author's web site.9.Shopping lists printed according to type of food so one can more easily find the food in the store.Cons:1.

It is a nice change from my menus that always seemed to have cream of mushroom soup or spagetti sauce in them! Thanks!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Saving Dinner has saved my home, probably my marriage and made dinner time around our house a much more pleasant experience! I have had a very different experience than these last few reviews. I bought Saving Dinner just after it was published and half heartedly thought it would work for me. Being skeptical, my hubby and I marked all the recipes we liked and put together our own \\"shopping list\\" like Leanne's. Every night was a great review. I intermixed the meals with our good ol' standbys to keep the 4 kids (10 and under) happier as we started to change our eating habits and enjoying new foods and tastes. Occasionally there are things that they don't like, but hey, they didn't like half the stuff I cooked before Saving Dinner either! Now I just print out the shopping lists as is and hit the grocery store.I think some of the suggested cons are misleading in these prior postings. You can probably find similar recipes online, but this book is more than just recipes. The hardest part of cooking is putting together a shopping list and knowing it is complete. It's quick to adapt and you can also print out the shopping lists from the savingdinner.com website. I even got really sick one night and my hubby took the list off the computer and went shopping. He thought it was totally cool and was happy knowing we had everything to eat for a full week.You may use more pots and pans, because you'll actually be making a meal - not a main course from a box or a can! Ingredients MAY be hard to find depending on your grocery store and where you live but half the challenge may be learning that your local store carries 10,000+ products and just learning where they have them and what they look like is the actual problem. You can also ask your grocer to carry products. If it will keep you shopping at their store, they'll order it in. Shelf space is a premium - supply and demand is what stocks the shelves.If you've never used spices, the meals may seem spicier so...just cut back a little on the spices. Some people complain that they aren't spicy enough! The recipes are very, very flexible to adapt to a wide variety of food preferences. Meats can be substituted for one another - beef for pork, chicken for beef, fish for chicken, etc. This makes it easy to buy what's on sale and adapt it, too, if you desire.If you are buying name brand, red capped spices then yes, you'll be broke! Check out the spices in the little baggies over by the int'l food section of your store or at the dollar store. (If you've never seen that section, then that might be why you are having trouble finding ingredients. LOL) I've never paid more than $1 for a bag of spices. Watch sales and learn to shop. You'll find that you'll actually be saving money as you cut back on eating out, don't go to the store as often and picking up eroneous unplanned items, etc.Side dishes are only suggestions and marked very distinctly on the menus and shopping list. I buy the ones we like and buy more of the ones we like and cross off the ones we don't. My kids will eat corn 5 days in a row if you let them, and there's really nothing wrong with that.My \\"picky eaters\\" are now eating asparagus, broccoli, brussels sprouts, squash, fish and things that I never imagined! We play a game and rank the foods each night pretending that we are food critics and I mark the ones we like the best. Those with super high rankings, I mix back in on day 7 or in-between every 3-4 meals to help them begin to recognize the meals more and more as \\"ours\\".I actually started a support group for the book on yahoogroups - simplysavingdinner - where we discuss and help each other learn how to use the great meals in this book that has changed my life! We share helps on the ingredients and are learning together how to really cook great meals that take relatively little time (typically 30 min. or less) and developing the skills to keep my family at home around the table and out of the drive thru line."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"What sets this cookbook apart from others is the - hooray! - shopping list for each week. I love to cook, but supper on the table 7/52 for a family of four got to be really frustrating. These meals are quick to put together and family-friendly. The book is organized by season, taking advantage of what's available in the store, with menus by the week. But my favorite part is the weekly shopping list, compiled and ready to go! Having the menus and the shopping list already done is a HUGE timesaver for me - I just open to the evening's recipe and cook, which some evenings is about all I can manage. Also, one of my children is a vegetarian, so I can substitute vegetarian &quot;burger&quot; crumbles for ground meat in the recipes and it works. In fact, my husband thought I had put hamburger in something last week, but my daughter had seen the package, so she knew it was okay to eat. (It also saves time and cleaning because there is no pre-browning of the meat.) Other nights, I just give her a packaged vegetarian entree, and serve her the same side dishes as the rest of us are eating. No more double meals to cook!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I love Saving Dinner by Leanne Ely.

This book has been a blessing."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Because of all the FlyLady hype, I decided to give this a try. However, I prefer the &quot;Desperation Dinners&quot; book much, much more. I have a family of four - but my two children usually split a serving so to make a meal for six adults is just too much food. I end up spending MORE each week buying specialty cheeses and food that I just never get around to cooking before it goes bad. The recipes themselves are not &quot;bad&quot; (except I do not like sweet-and-sour and almost all the chicken recipes for Fall were sweet-and-sour). However, if there is a duplicate recipe from &quot;Desperation Dinners&quot; I always prefer the &quot;desperate&quot; version - plus ALL the desperation meals only take 20 minutes from start to finish. I guess I also prefer the flexibility of knowing I can stock certain foods, open up the Desperation Dinners and find something on the spur of the moment that fits my mood that night. Before buying the book, I would at least recommend checking out Leanne's website and using her menu mailer for a couple of weeks."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Wow, I have only used this book for three weeks, and it seems as if everything around me is better. I never realized how much time I spent thinking, stressing, planning, shopping and cooking for dinner until I got this book. The very first day I got this book, my husband (who is a medical resident, so is rarely available to help) came home early and said he would watch the kids if I wanted to hurry and run to the store for some milk and bread. I grabbed the book saving dinner off the counter and was out the door (I only had an hour) I chose the first week in winter, got all the items on the list and returned home in 40 min. MY husband was dumbfounded. He has continued to be dumbfounded since. The past weeks have been wonderful. I feel like an organized mother and wife. I never would have thought my life would be dramatically better because of the book, but it is.The meals are easy to prepare and use minimal dishes. The recipes are yummy and so healthy (we have never eaten so healthy and enjoyed it!!) This is the first time I have gone through the effort of writing a review for a book.

For a while we tried using the weekly list but had a few problems. Many of the ingredients can be expensive, including quite a bit of meat, etc. and also several dinners per week did not appeal to my family, so I couldn't use the weekly list because I had to weed out the ingredients that were needed for the recipes I wasn't going to be making. So it ended up being easier for me to go through each recipe and make my own list which defeated part of the purpose of the book. There are lots of recipes in here that I have made more than once, but there are also many recipes that I have never tried again, or would never try in the first place. So if you are looking for a good recipe book, you'll find one here... but if you are looking for the weekly meal plan/grocery list deal... you probably will not be happy with this."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I have to say, Leanne has done a remarkable job in creating recipes that are easy to use and appealing to some of the most discriminate palates, children.

Well worth it!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I liked this book very much. To say it is a cookbook, is a mistake. It is more than a cookbook. I also have the low carb cookbook, & I have to admit I like it better. This one's receipes can be modified as well as the side dishes to make it more carb friendly. I cannot beleive some of the reviews I've read. Do people not look thru books before buying them??? Do you have to like every receipe in a book??? Chicken is one of the most low carb protein sources and one of the main ingredients on many diets therefore one would expect to see a lot of receipes with that ingredient. I do know how to cook, but sometimes it is nice to not have to think about it. That is where this book comes in. If you are not as organized as some people, or if you are tired of the same old meals you have been dishing out, then there are some really good & tasty ideas. This book is not for everyone, but then everyone does not need this book. Thank you, Leanne for both books."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I love the concept of this book, but after having diligently tried it for five weeks, I have decided it is just not right for my family. I love the shopping lists, and I love that I am serving my family healthy meals. And I'm cooking every night! But for a family of picky eaters, these recipes aren't making it into their bellies. She uses a lot of unusual ingredients that many families do not keep stocked in the pantry, which can drive up your grocery bill. However, at the same time, I loved that I could go to the grocery store, buy only what I needed and know that I was buying enough for a full week of dinners. My mind didn't need to think &quot;maybe I should buy this just to have on hand&quot;. I didn't need anything else on hand! What a great feeling. I did love that we were trying new things and I did get some great ideas from it. One thing we did that was fun is we rated each meal from 1-5 stars. This alone got my pickiest eater to at least try it. I will say, there was only one meal that received only 1 star. I will continue to use it occasionally, but I am preparing to buy the Rush Hour Cook, which sounds like the same concept, but seems a more practical choice for my family."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"In my house Leanne is a superhero! We talk about her like she's our best friend--and she is because her book changed our lives. It's fun to read, she gives great tips in the sidebars, and the recipes are fabulous. We eat tasty, healthy dinners every night--that are quick and fun to prepare together.Like many of you, we have shelves over loaded with cookbooks, subscribe to at least 4 cooking magazines, and could never figure out what to have for dinner. I had a refrigerator full of food, and we'd eat at 8pm because I'd spend so much time wandering around the kitchen wondering what to prepare--and usually ended up eating out of a box.Now I KNOW what I'm making every night, shopping is a snap, we cook our food from real ingredients--and everyone I know thinks I'm a genius because of the garlic lime chicken. Sure, I make substitutions if there's a recipe that doesn't work for us (but usually it's because we loved something so much, we have to have it again!), but I have never used and loved a cookbook like this one. I never thought it was possible, but I'd rather eat at home than eat out these days.I can't say enough positive things about this book--if you could see my battered copy you'd know it was truly loved. I also purchased Leanne's other book, Healthy Foods and love that as well. I bake out of it every single week. And you'll never order pizza out again.Best of all you can subscribe to Leanne's Menu Mailer and she'll email you a menu every week. It doesn't get any better than this! This is easily the best cookbook ever written...even if you don't want to follow the shopping lists--you'll still love it for the wonderful, amazing, healthy, delicious recipes. It'll save you money too!Leanne we love you! Thanks for such a wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"I dearly love this book. It is such a good idea and well worth its price. Some of the recipes are too spicy for my taste and might not rate well with children but the whole concept of getting the family back to the table is all important. Of the recipes that I have tried, the delicious ones far outweigh the bad ones. The meals are so nutritious and I already feel better. This makes it a money saver in that thre are less doctor bills.

I have picky eaters and a tight budget- I really doubted this book would fit our lifestyle... but I wanted to try. It has been a month of heaven so far. We are eating healthier, the meals don't take long to make, my grocery lists are done for me, it fits my budget, and I am making meals with names I would have never imagined our family eating. I love not spending the 20 minutes just trying to decide what we are going to eat for dinner! I can even change my mind and fix something that was planned for later- it doesn't matter- I KNOW that I have EVERYTHING I need for at least one week of meals. I just can't say enough about this book. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"This book has been a wonderful tool! For what we have saved on eating out in a week, we've paid for this book exponentially...! I have a fairly picky family with two young kids who don't care much for vegetables, but Leanne's recipes have been tasty and satisfying even to their picky palates! I would recommend this book to anyone struggling to get good-tasting, home-cooked, healthful meals on the table. Most of the recipes can be done in 30-45 mins and many things can be done ahead (if that's easier for you). And once a week there is a crock pot recipe to make it even easier.

I don't use it like it's intended, making the whole weeks recipes; I skip around. I've made several of the recipes and have had my son rate them as I tried them. I just KNEW that some of these dishes he would turn up his nose at (and he's not an extremely picky eater, just a normal kid), but he rated almost every recipe that I made from this book as an \\"I love it\\", and I rated most of them the same way. I made minimal changes to a few of them, and since we rated each one, I know which ones are \\"keepers\\".

We also love fresh, flavorful food. My sons, who are rather health conscious, prefer homecooked meals. Saving Dinner, which I initially heard of through FlyLady, seemed to be the answer to our nightly dinner dilemma without eating the same six meals every two weeks or augmenting with takeout.While, I love the concept of weekly meals with pre-made shopping lists, I was disappointed in this book. The recipes were too complicated for weeknights and required too many dishes which made clean up more onerous. The ingredient lists in some of recipes lacked appropriate detail such as the recipe that called for a can of tomatoes but did not specify a size. The recipes, as many others noted, were on the bland side. Other recipes were good starts but would require a good deal of reworking to be acceptable to my family's palette. I don't mind doing this on the weekends but for busy weeknights, I need fail-proof recipes that are nutritious and fast.I wanted to enjoy this book much more but after two weeks and a careful perusal of the rest of the book, I will be looking for another book to help me diversify the family dinner offerings."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"This book is a must have for all cooks, all levels of cooking experience! In this busy day and age, having the grocery lists is half the battle. The recipes are delicious and easily changed to suit your tastes. I can leave out things we don't like (beans, lol!) and the recipe is still delicious. It keeps us away from fast foods and I know we are eating much healthier and losing weight without trying. All of my daughters will get this book for Christmas this year. Thanks, Leanne!"},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"This book is not for everyone. People who are glued to Food TV and love to cook won't like it because it is too basic. People who are reluctant to stop eating fast food or who refuse to eat their veggies won't like it either. People like me who are busy and don't like cooking and planning meals but want to eat healthy will love it. It's wonderful for working moms too.The meals are simple and can be easily adapted for your family's tatstes. Leanne uses the fastest, easiest ingredients but you can easily substitute fresh for canned or an ingredient your family likes for one they hate. The food is very mildly spiced which is great for picky kids but can be easily changed for adult tastes. She uses a lot of kid friendly meats like beef and chicken but again it's easy to make your own changes. Others have complained about the simplicity of the recipes and having to change them to suit their tastes but that's exactly what I love about them. My copy of this book is getting dog-eared and worn we use it so much. My husband and roomate who are fast food fanatics love it and eagerly ask for dinner from \\"the yellow book\\". Recipes from this book and the Low Carb version easily adapt to a popular diet I'm on so we're all happy."},{"Title":"Saving Dinner: The Menus, Recipes, and Shopping Lists to Bring Your Family Back to the Table","review":"Bought the book, and LOVE it.

I used to hate grocery shopping. I never took a list and it always took me a long time to think of things to make for dinner that week. And inevitably I would always forget some items and have to make a second trip. This book has solved my problems. I have been using this cookbook for 7 weeks now and have loved every recipe. It is such a relief to know in the morning what I'm fixing for dinner that night. Instead of my old self rushing home to thaw something out and throw an unhealthy meal together. Now I know what I'm having and it is much healthier for me. Not to mention that I have cut our grocery bill in half by using this book. It truly does bring a little peace to my life. Thanks Leann for writing it."},{"Title":"CHINA: THE SILK ROUTES","review":"We spent two months in NW China this summer and used this book so much that we threw away my other guide book (It is a very lonely one now). We finally left China: the Silk Routes with another traveller in Xiahi as we left the Silk Route regions. It is simply the best guide book for the Silk Road available, listing locations and towns that are not yet covered in other books, plus great essays on historical areas and the sites. It also has a handy index (with Chinese characters) of food, phrases, and other useful words to ease communications."},{"Title":"CHINA: THE SILK ROUTES","review":"Last fall, I traveled on the Silk Road, from Uzbekistan through Western China to Xian, with two companions. This was far and away the best travel guide we used. Not only did it guide us to the best accomodations available in out of the way places, but it also gave us excellent practical information wherever we were. Because we did not speak the local language, we relied on this excellent book to give us interesting background and historical info. When communications were all but impossible, I would open the book and point to the relevant phrases written in Chinese characters, and we were able to get what we needed! This book is worth its weight in gold for anyone traveling independently in this part of the world."},{"Title":"CHINA: THE SILK ROUTES","review":"Two great virtues make this an excellent guide indeed. First, it is a really useful planner in that it contains sufficient details for you to map your routes, pick your transports, accomodation, eating places, etc. Alongside are also well written sections on the history and other aspects that an inquiring traveller demands and appreciates. Both the traveller/writer and the publisher are to be heartily congratulated"},{"Title":"CHINA: THE SILK ROUTES","review":"One nice thing I can say about this guidebook is that the glossary in the back, as well as the micro maps provided of various regions, were extremely useful and tailored specifically for tourists ignorant of Chinese culture such as myself.The two biggest problems are that it is outdated and that the information and coverage is inadequate. If you use this guide alone for Beijing, as we foolishly did, you'll be missing out a lot. Even in Eastern Turkistan (Xinjiang) a tremendous number of historical sites were left out in Kashgar and Yerken. If you're just interested in trekking and adventure traveling and the history and culture isn't that important, then you can go ahead with this book and the Lonely Planet guide to Central Asia. However, if that's your attitude you're really missing out on a lot and it's not worth all that money to come to this distant corner of the Earth.For East Turkistan, the small section in the Lonely Planet Central Asia guide was much more useful for purely practical information (such as hotels and restaurants) than the considerably larger section in this book."},{"Title":"The Wanton Troopers","review":"Looks like I'm going to be the only one to write a review on this book;and I wouldn't be surprised if nobody even reads my review;but here goes anyway. At least I'll get it out of my system.First of all,it was the picture on the cover that jumped out at me. It was the work of one of my favorite Artists,Alex Colville. You'll see a review of his latest book \\"Alex Colville Return\\" in my reviews dated Dec.2,2005,if interested.The painting is called \\"A Lone Swallow\\" and shows a Bank Swallow flying above bullrushes near a bluff along the Minas Basin.I don't read a lot of this type of fiction by authors from the academic world and I am not much into poetry.I do enjoy Robert Service,but generally poetry about moods,trees, sunsets, and all; pretty much escapes me. My preference of poetic language is more along the lines of the above title; and there is certainly a lot of it in this book.The novel is quite odd in that it was published in 1988. The author had other novels in the late 50's and 60's ;but passed away in 1983,at the early age of 50.The novel is set in a small Nova Scotia village of Lochartville,about 3 miles from Hantsport, where the author lived until he was 19. He was born in 1933.As with many novelists,he takes a lot of artistic license with facts.There is a community of Lochartville,Halifax,Truro and Moncton;but not the nearby communities he speaks of,such as ,Larchmont,Bennington,Frenchman's Cross or Ginsonville.The nearby towns would more likely have been Hantsport or Windsor;but then again this is fiction.The author paints a picture of what we today label a dysfunctional family,living on the edge of disaster because of poor education,lack of a stable income and personal problems,particularly drinking. This situation can be found anywhere and usually right amongst people in the same community wo were able to cope quite well and actually prospered.I grew up in a town not too far away and saw the same type of things happen. The episode of putting bullets in the school stove brought back a vivid memory. A school chum of mine came from a similar family,where drinking by the father,kept them in a marginal existence on the edge of town and on the edge of poverty. One morning I went to visit my friend,I found his mother sitting on the woodpile behind their little home,and crying away. When I asked what was wrong;she told me ,\\"Just go into my kitchen,and you'll see\\". When I went in ,the kitchen was a disaster ,all covered in soot,the ceiling in shambles,the stove blown all over the place;what a mess.It looked like the place was hit by bomb. When I asked my friend what happened,he told me his father and friends got drunk and someone threw a shotgun shell into the stove,...and Kaboom!There is a lot of picturesque language throughout the book and reminded me of the stuff of Angea's Ashes or the novels of Erskine Caldwell,such as \\"God's Little Acre\\" or \\"Tobacco Road\\".How's this for starters?\\"Eddication's a mighty fine thing,Kev.Yuh can't git too much of eddication,I allus say.\\"The old woman shook her head vigorously and increased the speed of her rocker.\\"Mark my words,son,yuh keep on a- drinkin' an' a-runnin' up store bills an' a sellin' hens an' cows an' pretty soon yuh aint even gonna have a shirt tuh put tur yur back. Wilful waste means woeful want,son. We're poor folks-poor as dirt-an' we gotta remember it!\\"Just to keep you on your toes the author sprinkles words like soporific,sibilant,lambent,pertinacious,timorous,prowed and palpitant amongst his colorful writing.Don't expect this novel to go anywhere;but it is amazing how many people, raised in such circumstances, have overcome it all and lived successful lives.These people aren't stupid and are a good example of the adage; \\"If you're ignorant,you can always learn; but if you're stupid,it's permanent\\".By the way, I never did figure where the book,s title came from."},{"Title":"The Reproductive Husbandry of Pythons and Boas","review":"This is a book that you simply must have if you are at all interested in the keeping and or breeding of Boa and Python snakes.

Worth every cent."},{"Title":"Reconstruction in Philosophy","review":"John Dewey's &quot;Reconstruction of Philosophy&quot; is a work of enormous importance in its analysis of the origins and development of the western philosophical tradition. Dewey takes an instrumentalist approach to the problem of how human experience can give rise to its imaginative reconstruction in memory. It is, Dewey says, in this realm of memory and imagination that ritual, religion, and ultimately, philosophy develop. Further, he relates the classical and medieval world views--still remarkably influential in the modern world--to the structure of classical society. Dewey provides the reader with a challenging exposition of the sources of many weaknesses and flaws in western philosophy and suggests remedies for them.Some readers may find Dewey's prose awkward and occasionally difficult, but for those interested in a history of philosophy which is more than a chronological recounting of philosophical systems, &quot;Reconstruction&quot; is well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Reconstruction in Philosophy","review":"John Dewey, as I've heard, was never comfortable with labels. Throughout his career he shifted from and to many rubrics: pragmatism, interactionism, instrumentalism, transactionism, experimentalism. Truth be told, all of these are present in \\"Reconstruction in Philosophy\\" and partly because of that, this is probably the best intro to Dewey available.Dewy has a bone to pick with traditional philosophy. Not only has it lost track with real, as opposed to academic, problems (anyone walking down the street can tell us this) but it never really was that good at depicting real questions and descriptions anyway. Take comcepts like Plato's ideal forms and Kant's a priori. Neither of these are teneble in any realm of experience; rather, they were a misguided quest to explain the permanance and stability of the world.Dewey's book is an attempt to pull the carpet out from under their feet; science and inquiry using its methods shows us that the world changes and if anything, stability is something that is felt by us - not inherent in the world. Thus a prioris, ideal forms, seperation of the noumenal and phenouminal amongst other current 'problems' in philosophy - all based on the idea of permanant/transitory dichotomy - are not only wearing thin, but are fast showing to be irrelevant. From this, he builds the groundwork of a philosophy in between rationalism and empiricism. Taking from rationalism an admiration and recognition of reason's power to direct action and combining it with empiricims fascination with experience, Dewey creates a philosophy that puts the spotlight not on one or the other, but on both as leading to and taking from eachother.The first chapter are a philosophical survey of how philosophy went wrong; particularly in Ancient Greek and early Christian philosophy (both having a love affair with absolutes outside of experience). The second chapter focuses on the mistakes when philosophers, like Francis Bacon, widened the chasm between the real and experiential and the ideal and rational.From here, Dewey proceeds piece by piece to show what was wrong and how to fix it by making clear tht scienctific inquiry (the equal interaction between subject and object) leaves no room for absolutes, forms or a prioris (or at least, not in any pragmatically useful sense). By extension, things like formal rules of logic above experience, non-experimentalism in moral or political theory and psychology that includes the individual without an equal part of the social; all of these become little more than unfounded but continually persisting glorifications.For the reader interested in Dewey, naturalism, instrumentalism or the implications of pragmatism, this is a great introduction. From here, I suggest Dewey's \\"The Quest for Certainty\\" followed by \\"Experience and Nature\\", topped off with \\"Human Nature and Conduct\\"."},{"Title":"Reconstruction in Philosophy","review":"Reconstruction in Philosophy presents a program for just that: a radical re-building of western philosophy. Dewey criticizes the current state of affairs as being tied to the past in ways that are no longer relevent to the current world. He traces the creation of various social institutions, then shows how these actions of ancient times, such as creation of ancient philosophical traditions (such as the idea of a split between \\"higher\\" and \\"lower\\" reality cf. Plato), which although useful in their time, now [slows] intellectual progress. Dewey puts forth the argument that much of modern philosophy (and human thought in general) is concerned with the same problems that the ancients were concerned with, although those problems are no longer relevent. Rather, philosophy should concern itself with current issues of social, economic, or political importance, and ask what can be done to improve them? Dewey's method is concerned with concrete solutions to concrete problems. Rather than over-broad generalizations about \\"the State\\" or \\"Life\\", we must ask think of answers to problems concerning this individual state, or that individual person. Likewise, he advocates dropping the notion of the Universal having more importance than the Particular; doing so, he claims, leads to intellectual laziness, and a denial that problems exist (extreme optimism). Rather, human intelligence must be focused on particular problems, with an eye towards improving that particular situation.This often-overlooked book is the perfect antidote to the image of the philosopher as an out-of-touch abstract intellectual,"},{"Title":"Reconstruction in Philosophy","review":"It is an excellent book to initiate a novice to the Deweian way of thinking. A pre-requisite to books such as &quot;Experience and Nature&quot;. The ease and accessibility of the matterial provided alone, makes it worthwhile. A must for an Educational Foundation student."},{"Title":"Reconstruction in Philosophy","review":"Written soon after the First World War, Reconstruction in Philosophy by James Dewey attempts to lay out a program for making philosophy adapt to the needs of a new time and age. As man's experience has changed in the modern era, so must philosophy change; philosophy must evolve in order to explicitly address those issues from which it originally arose - those dealing with the everyday concerns of man. It is contemporary philosophy's (in 1919) detachment from man's real life and goals that Dewey wishes to diagnose and address. Philosophy must break the bonds of tradition and become entirely secular; the scientific method which revolutionized man's life must be embraced by philosophy - the facts and experience oriented spirit of science must pervade the reconstruction of philosophy.It is the rise of science as the great shaper of human life and culture that constitutes the greatest change in human experience. Pre-historic man's life - which, according to Dewey, consisted of brief periods of food gathering and the rest of long periods of reverie - gave rise to conceptions of the nature of man and the world. As men's culture advanced, so did men's accounts of the nature of man and the world; these developments culminated in the works of the classic ancient thinkers, notably Plato and Aristotle. These were philosophies that denigrated ugly matter and imperfect change, and idealized perfect, eternal forms. These philosophies, and those in modern times which carry their influence, place ultimate value and ultimate reality in otherworldly or extra-sensory things - in the Forms, Celestial Spheres, the Categories, etc.The Pragmatic method proposed by Dewey seeks to dispense with the old dichotomies and idealizations and transform knowledge and philosophy from the \\"contemplative to the operative.\\" Science broke the old dogmas about the physical universe and philosophy should similarly make experience the test of our principles; abstractions, principles, generalizations, etc. should service concrete action, not the other way around. \\"The true is the verified,\\" writes Dewey. This is the method by which logic, epistemology, morals, politics, etc. should base its reconstruction.Dewey's program, it may be argued, only serves to relocate rather than resolve some of the main issues of philosophy. How exactly the methods of science are to be absorbed by philosophy, and whether philosophy does in fact differ from the sciences only in its degree of generality are unanswered questions. While deriding \\"fixed and final\\" end in ethics, Dewey posits \\"growth itself as the only moral end.\\" And by defining society as \\"the process of associating in such ways that experiences, ideas, emotions, and values are transmitted and made common,\\" he makes both the individual and the state subordinate to this process. Have we not traded one thing to subordinate ourselves to for another? This is not to say that Dewey doesn't offer a framework that perhaps allows us to offer more satisfying answers to philosophy's issues (which is just what Dewey argues for); its just that he is proposing a new methodology for answering those issues, not (in this work at least) offering specific answers, or defending in a satisfying way the assertion that his program is in the first place tenable. These comments aren't mean to trivialize Dewey's program offhand, but to point out the sort of questions he raises which should be answered.For a much more fruitful and rigorous defense of a pragmatic-type approach to some of philosophy's central issues, see Susan Haack's Evidence and Inquiry: Towards Reconstruction in Epistemology (for the title of which she borrowed from Dewey). This work by Dewey, however, is required reading for those who wish to study the American Pragmatist school."},{"Title":"Reconstruction in Philosophy","review":"Dewey's philosophy is hard for some people to get into, or take seriously, because his whole body of concerns and ideas are present behind every sentence-- so, even though his language is plain-spoken, it is \\"saturated with meaning,\\" to use one of his phrases. So it takes real work, and he doesn't always succeed in keeping the foreground clear, while remembering the background. It's DOING philosophy, rather than merely writing ABOUT it. This book is a great example -- what does philosophy do for us, how does it contribute when it is woven into the other enterprises of life, and what ideas in philosophy stand it the way of its making a living contribution. The book is full of dramatic, and even radical thinking, but in quiet, reflective language that requires relaxed, persistent attention."},{"Title":"Reconstruction in Philosophy","review":"Written shortly after World War I, John Dewey's classic RECONSTRUCTION IN PHILOSOPHY offered an introduction to the philosophy of pragmatic humanism, arguing against traditional philosophy by suggesting their fountains in self-justification were flawed and proposing an examination of core values based on other criteria.

Yet our easy cultural access to the face so closely identified with the American pursuit of freedom and equality also carries its own limitations. Our photographic record of Lincoln does not begin until the late 1840s, and that legacy often seems to mask as much as it discloses. Historians have lately become more intrigued with Lincoln's darker side, portraying him as moody, unhappy, hamstrung by depression, even suicidal. Any serious scholar of Lincoln knows the sources that can lend support to such inquiries. As is often the case, however, historians committed to deconstructing Lincoln's character become preoccupied with fragments that poorly represent the whole of his humanity, the reflective depth of his spirituality, and the playful yet sophisticated nature of his intellect. In this wonderful volume, Thomas J. Trimborn explores the many sides of Lincoln's character and thankfully never loses sight of the whole. His images--at once haunting, amusing,and inspiring--take us beyond the familiar photographic record and give us a chance to better understand why the nation's sixteenth president is placed at or near the top of nearly any presidential ranking one cares to examine. Trimborn's nimble prose provides fascinating context for his work, but the book is clearly about the art. Make no mistake, this is a frank celebration of Lincoln as author of our modern conceptions of freedom and democracy, but it is a celebration that in the end convinces us that Lincoln deserves every bit of the praise that issues from Trimborn's insightful progression of character studies. Most importantly, the artist presents us not with otherworldly iconography, but a human being whose greatness stemmed from a clear sense of his own limitations. He doubted, he feared, he hoped, and thankfully for us, he fueled his leadership with a capacity to change, to learn, and to explore. The man who in 1861 remained unsure of his racial views and not yet committed to emancipation eventually called the nation to a revolutionary understanding of its political heritage in his address at Gettysburg. Trimborn takes us beyond verbal description and gives us a fresh opportunity to feel Lincoln's passion and purpose. Offered in an affordable format and accessible to all ages, Trimborn's keen artistic vision deserves a prominent place in every Lincoln collection."},{"Title":"Encounters with Lincoln: Images and Words","review":"\\"Encounters with Lincoln\\" is a book for all ages about a man for all ages. It captures the image of Abraham Lincoln in different stages of his life, in a range of settings, and with a variety of media, including colored pencil, watercolor, pen and ink, scratchboard, tempera, and graphite pencil.Encounters with works of art, Thomas Trimborn writes, are uniquely personal. They invite responses from those who experience them. That is particularly true of the images in this book. About twenty offer face-to-face encounters with Lincoln--the young man, the steadfast man (shown in five merged images), the thinker, the melancholy man, the humorous man, the determined man, the eloquent man, the reader, the speaker, the wearer of spectacles, the recipient of tributes. One image, titled \\"His Eyes Say It All,\\" prompts readers to turn to earlier pages to look again at those transfixing eyes. Trimborn also presents images of persons whose encounters with Lincoln through the years have shaped our perception of the great and complex man, such as Frederick Douglas, Walt Whitman, Carl Sandburg, Mahalia Jackson, Martin Luther King, and John F. Kennedy.Thomas Trimborn is by profession a musician and music educator at Truman State University, but he is obviously not confined by his discipline or by the walls of his university. To accompany his excellent artwork, Trimborn has crafted a compelling and historically accurate narrative. \\"Encounters with Lincoln\\" makes an excellent gift, as my brother-in-law and his grandson, to whom I gave a copy, attest."},{"Title":"Encounters with Lincoln: Images and Words","review":"The drawings in this book are simply breathtaking in their detail.

It's a moving experience."},{"Title":"Till Eulenspiegel: His Adventures (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"A classic of German literature which spawned a thousand watered-down progeny, _Till Eulenspiegel_ is a cheerfully scatalogical (but never raunchy) collection of loosely related fablieux-like vignettes depicting the life and times of the eponymous hero. It's little-known in the English-speaking world, largely because of the lack of a good, faithful translation, and this edition is obviously intended to remedy the situation.It's a worthy goal, and the translation itself is lively and fluid without straying too far from its Germanic roots. The story itself is a good read, which moves too quickly from scene to scene to ever get boring. The trickster hero more or less devotes his life to deflating the pompous, the rich, the smug, the petty, and anyone else who dares obstruct his merry path through life. He does this largely by interpreting figurative or idiomatic phrases literally, like an infuriating younger sibling, but there are a good many tales that centre around more complex and witty scams, and it's these which make the book worth considering as a read. And, like other books in the _World's Classics_ series, the introductory essay is broad-ranging and stimulating.It's not _Gulliver's Travels_ or _The Decameron_, but it's a very respectable cousin to both."},{"Title":"Till Eulenspiegel: His Adventures (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"\\"Till Eulenspiegel\\" consists of a series of vignettes about a young man who roams through Germany and other countries having adventures, playing tricks on people and goofing off. It seems like the punchline of every single story has to do with Euelenspiegel defecating on or in something or someone. That's it. That's the book's running joke. I suppose if you were an illiterate German peasant sitting around a hearth fire in the 1500s, you'd find these tales of feces and bad puns hilarious, but I didn't. Dumb humor doesn't become entertaining just because it's old. Of course, since a good majority of modern Americans are probably less sophisticated than an illiterate German peasant from 400 years ago, perhaps Till Eulenspiegel is due for a comeback. Hollywood could cast Johnny Knoxville as this retarded crapped crusader, and he could crap all over American audiences, who will double over with laughter at every fart noise."},{"Title":"Adventures in Appreciation--Classic Edition","review":"Suitable for high school level instruction in modern classic literature, specifically intended for use in Grade 10.

After reading a number of contemporary works about the causes of past and current conflicts in the Balkans, I decided none of the authors agreed on every point or many points for that matter, and most seemed a bit biased in their reporting and interpretation of events, probably owing to their inability to attend to the terrible events of the last century and not choose sides.THE EARLY MEDIEVAL BALKANS is the most objective work available about what really happened all those years ago when the Byzantine Empire ruled what is now known as the Balkans, and Serbs, Croatians, Ottoman Turks, and others migrated and/or invaded and settled the area the Italian Romans called Illyria.The book is part of a two-part work covering the Middle Ages in the Balkans. Part I THE EARLY MEDIEVAL BALKANS includes a critical survey of the area from the Sixth to the late Twelfth Century. Part II THE LATE MEDIEVAL BALKANS covers the period from the late Twelfth Century until the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in the 14th Century. Fine was a Professor of History at the University of Michigan for a number of years, and his work is incredibly scholarly. He has been considered the leading expert in the world on this topic by his colleagues.I came away from the work with two impressions. The first is that the various ethnic groups who inhabited or invaded the Balkans (and there were so many one loses count after awhile as they migrate or remigrate over and over) were so thoroughly mixed during the Middle Ages that the indigenous tribe, whatever that was, must have disappeared thousands of years ago. The second fact I deduced from Dr. Fine's work is that most if not all the animosity between groups today probably has a basis in religious conflict. Given that the three major religions involved -- Roman Catholic, Orthodox Serb, and Muslim advocate love as an organizing principle, one has to wonder what went wrong.I gave this book 4 stars because it is difficult to read. For a more &quot;fun&quot; read try the series on Byzantium by J.J.Norwich."},{"Title":"The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century","review":"I am from Bosnia, of mixed ethnic origins, and after 7 years of exile, I had only faint memories of the history classes dedicated to the Middle Ages (in the 6th grade).

And the impartial position of the author is another plus.And if you want to learn Balkan history ,Slavic and Turkish(Bulgarian)participation and the stance of the Romans(Europeans insist on Byzantine) this book is the one o the good ones."},{"Title":"The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century","review":"I purchased this book for use as a quick reference on the time period and region, fully expecting it to be too dry for sustained reading. I was very pleasantly surprised. This is a lively, interesting account with just the right amount of detail.The author begins with a geographic description of the Balkan region and an overview of its history until about 600 AD. The subsequent history might properly be called \\"The Origins and Development of the South Slavs\\". The next decisive event in Balkan history - the Slavic Invasions - is treated in some detail. The Slavs of the time, although numerous, were fragmented and lacked any centralized control. They also fielded an army predominately composed of lightly armed foot soldiers. So foreign tribes of horsemen - The Turkic Bulgars, and the probably Iranian Serbs and Croats - were able to subjugate and dominate groups of Slavs. Since the Slavs were much more numerous, they were ultimately able to assimilate the invaders - but kept their tribal names.The development and history of Bulgaria takes up most of the book, the rest deals with the Serbs, Bosnians, Pannonian Croatians, and Dalmatian Croatians. Other Balkan peoples such as Vlachs and Albanians, who were re-emerging in history at this time, are hardly mentioned at all, nor are the Greeks (I mean the Greeks of Greece, not the Byzantines, who were obviously major participants in the events of this book). The Macedonians Slavs at the time were considered Bulgarians. And the other powers in the area - Hungarians, the afore-mentioned Byzantines, Pechenegs, Cumans, Normans, Venetians, Franks - are mentioned only insofar as they impacted the history of the South Slavs.Which is not to imply this is a bad thing - the resulting history is very tight and focused. The origins of the South Slavs, and the history of Bulgaria, are interesting topics.I found myself wondering why Bulgaria gets so much attention. Part of the reason might be that due to Byzantium's close proximity, this area was better and more decisively documented in the sources. Perhaps this area is of special interest to the author. Upon finishing the book, however, I concluded that the reason for the prominent role of Bulgaria in this narrative is that Bulgaria seems to have established the most powerful and abiding state in this time period.This is an excellent and fascinating narrative, and I find myself looking forward to purchasing the next volume, the continuation of the story into the late Middle Ages."},{"Title":"The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century","review":"I am from Bosnia, of mixed ethnic origins, and after 7 years of exile, I had only faint memories of the history classes dedicated to the Middle Ages (in the 6th grade).

A fun read, but not his best."},{"Title":"Roadmarks","review":"This novel is an example of good Roger Zelazny. Not great Zelazny. Nothing like _The Dream Master_ (1966), _This Immortal_(1966), or _Lord of Light_ (1967). But like the Amber novels. Like _Isle of the Dead_ (1969). Like _Doorways in the Sand_(1976). Like them. It is nothing to sneer at. Good entertainment should not be derided. The setting is a vast highway built long ago by a race of dragons. It stretches through time-- way back in the past and way on into the future. Not everybody can do it, but there are a few who can find this road and travel up and down it to different historical periods. There is an ex-Crusader fleeing from the Holy land, who seems somewhat bemused that nobody can tell him for sure who won the Crusades. There is a short man who is suspiciously like Adolph Hitler driving down the road in a blue Volkswagon. There is a Victorian gentleman who is appalled at the violence that he encounters at a wayside inn. There are cops who patrol the highway (though not always as quickly as you might like). Charles Baudelaire and Walt Whitman appear, though not in forms that you might expect. And there is a Frenchman who might be Antoine de Saint-Exupery giving this advice to another traveler:\\"You have never been beyond C Seventeen? My God, man, you owe it to yourself to get as far as at early C Twenty at least once in your life! To fly, that is why! A man is not complete until he has known the freedom of the heavens! Not the big sky- boats that came later, where you might as well be taking your ease in a provincial parlor-- no! You must leave your petty bourgeois concerns behind and get up in a light craft with an open cockpit and feel the wind and the rain, look down at the world, the clouds, up at the stars! It will change you, believe me!\\" (145)And, of course, there is the hero, Red Dorakeen, who discovers that somebody has put a contract on him for no apparent reason and that somewhere up the road it looks as if he is bound to die. Zelazny tells his story tightly, always showing rather than telling. His tongue is firmly in his cheek, and for this reason it may appear that Red sails through crisis after crisis a bit too easily. But I believe that there was a reason for this. Zelazny wanted to capture a kind of comradship that is there on time's highway. It is a dangerous road to travel at times, but there is also freedom and fellowship that makes the journey worthwhile.Recommended."},{"Title":"Roadmarks","review":"Ok so that's a little weird but it's a side effect of wanting to reread this book. I read this book back in high school. When I remembered it later in life I couldn't find it and bought a new version. It was just as good the second time as the first. Most books you remember how the story starts and how it ends and that maps to the first page and the last page. When you think of those books your brain fills in the middle, there usually isn't a great desire to reread most books. This book is not like that, the book and the story flow such that your brain can't fill in the middle as easily or remember if there was an end.I am a Zelazny fan. I agree this book is too short I want more each time I read it. I have probably read this book 4 or 5 times over the last 25 years, and will read it again I am sure.

Chapters Two follow Red and Chapters One follow Randy and how these two stories relate to each other is the main crux of the book.The book is only 187 pages, so a quick read, though one might need time to mull the chapters early on. I have to admit that I cheated and read all the Chapters Two first and then went back and read all of the Chapters One. I'm finding that I don't always like reading a book linearly and that it's not always important to read from page one all the way through to the end.

I finished its 185 pages in two days. It's just too bad that it was a weak read. The plot, while reminiscent of Philip Jose Farmer's \\"Riverboat\\" series (which contained a cast of characters/real people from history all living at the same time), isn't very focused. Zelazny never quite figures out whether he is going to focus on the time-traveling 'Road' and who created it/why it is there, or whether he is interested in the idea of talking about famous people or places from times past. The chapters bounced around like a cat on a lit hibachi, and only coalesced in the last 70 pages of the book. This time vasolation was clearly meant to play on the idea that the characters are playing with time, but this created a chaotic narrative for the reader, making it difficult to remember what happened earlier in the book. While I thought this was an enjoyable book with some truly humorous pages and some interesting takes on time travel, overall I cannot give it more than 3 of 5 stars. An overall disappointment for a strong Zelazny supporter such as myself."},{"Title":"Roadmarks","review":"I recently reread Roadmarks. I had forgotten what a great (but short!) book it is.

We miss them, but Zelazny's new hero and his beat-up blue Dodge pick-up soon take up the slack.The basic parallel world theme is present: history can be reworked and branched in a new direction by, say, the misfiring of John Wilkes Booth's pistol in the Ford Theatre. When \\"Roadmarks\\" begins, Red Dorakeen is running guns to the ancient Greeks at Marathon, so that they will defeat the Persians and set history back on its \`correct' track. As you might have guessed from the beat-up Dodge pick-up, Time is a multi-branching Road in this book, designed by the Dragons of Bel'kwinith and accessible only to certain special humans such as Red.Unfortunately for our hero, someone has taken out a perfectly legal contract for his death. The assassins get ten shots (so to speak) at him, and it is really this device that drives the plot forward, rather than Red's rather vague notion of learning his true identity.

There are no contrivances to insult the reader, and most important for a literary novel, the writing is really good; the author clearly loves the English language and knows how to use it to tell a story.

In the mean-time the terrorist has altered his face through plastic surgery thanks to Russia. He is going to kill the Israeli prime minister.

He uses his expertise on the middle east superbly and has written one of the finest books on espionage with a twist of a love story. This book is sure to awe everybody who chooses to give it a try."},{"Title":"Heat of Ramadan","review":"I really enjoyed reading this Israeli espionage-and-intrigue novel, which keeps the action moving and contains some memorable characters (my favorite: an unlikely-looking IDF instructor named Boaz). Readers may find it a bit dated nowadays, what with its Cold War-era background and heavy role ascribed to Soviet support for Palestinian radicals. But if you are looking for a quick diverting read, you could do a lot worse.My main gripe with this book is its title, which betrays an essential ignorance of the Islamic world. Ramadan is of course a month in the Islamic calendar--which, as a lunar calendar, is shorter than 365 days. And for this reason there can be no correlation between ANY month in the Islamic year and ANY given set of seasonal or meteorological conditions (hot weather, for example). Hence to speak of \\"the heat of Ramadan\\" is about as non-sensical as to speak of \\"the heat of Tuesday.\\" This misfire probably won't bother most readers, but as a Muslim reader I have to say that it really stuck in my craw."},{"Title":"Heat of Ramadan","review":"This is one of the more compelling espionage thrillers I've read - found myself sneaking chapters in the middle of work, staying up late - well-developed, deeply sympathetic, but flawed lead characters - both protagonist and bad guy; support characters were intriguing enough I want to follow their stories; nice insider-info feel; and plot and writing style move you steadily along with very few missteps or bog-downs. My only quibble was the two obnoxious bureaucratic officials were too one-dimensional. This book was a delight. Hartov just made my must-read author list."},{"Title":"Heat of Ramadan","review":"Steven Hartov and all his characters are genuine. The situations and people in his trilogy-The Heat of Ramadan; The Nylon Hand of God; The Devil's Shepherd-are all based in reality. This is only one of the many differences that set him apart from all other 'spy thriller' novelists.You won't find any James Bondian-type gadgets or \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" plots, or \\"could not be done in real life\\" exploits.What you will find is characters so real you're sure you know them, doing things only Genuine Heroes do: They risk-and give-their lives in the pursuit of fighting evil, and they do it every day, without recognition or even very much pay. And they do it because they are committed to fighting evil, no matter what it costs them.Mr. Hartov's books read like tributes; as if based on people he knows or has known who are anonymous, unrecognized, and unacknowledged. But in his books these people-and their brave deeds-are made known, in writing that will transport you to other places with its realism, and leave you breathless with emotion at the supreme bravery demonstrated.His writing is lyrical and prosaic without ever leaving you lost in a jungle of ego-driven descriptive prose. Every word is necessary and furthers the plot or gives the reader valuable insight into his characters.Steven Hartov's books are truly classic, with pulse-pounding tension and action, and characters you grow to love (or hate!) on dangerous, urgent missions only the very bravest men and women would undertake.I only wish he would write faster...."},{"Title":"Heat of Ramadan","review":"In this book former Krav Maga Chief Instructor Boaz Aviram trains the characters in Krav Maga."},{"Title":"Heat of Ramadan","review":"First of all, I couldn't tell you how it ended, cause I never got that far.

I first came upon this story while patrolling the intricate rivers and canals of the Mekong Delta during the Viet Nam War c. 1968-1969. A public library had donated several books to the ship's library, this enchanting story being one of them. I have since read this hard-to-find book (usually via special searches at the Los Angeles Public Library) several times. This epic novel about the experience of a single woman travelling alone from England to Algeria can best be appreciated when read against the social and cultural contexts of what constituted appropriate behavior for respectable ladies in 1905 England. A young woman travelling unescorted to a far-off exotic land was quite a titillating piece of literature which might not be appreciated from a 2001 perspective. That aside, Robert Hichens' ability to capture the rich historic texture of Algeria at the time, juxtaposed against the deep complexity of one of the novel's primary characters, and the &quot;dark mystery&quot; with which the author so effectively teases the reader through the second half of the story, has not lost its intrigue in the almost 100 years since its writing. The author's talent and sensitivity are displayed in his ability to convey to the reader the hot sultry climate; the din and cacaphony of high-density Algerian cities; the sensuality of romantic and exotic evenings; the rhythms of ethnic Algerian music and the smells of Algerian food wafting through the reader's nostrils. In fact, the author's talent, love and respect for the cultural backdrop of his story can perhaps be more appreciated by today's readers who are more competent at modern global cultural competency efforts. This book is an absolute treasure which delivers a somewhat disappointing denouement only because the shame that in 1905 is the mystery of one of the principle characters, to readers in the second half of the last century, may not only be viewed as not shameful, but perhaps even as liberating. During my first reading of this enchanting work, at the moment when the great shame is disclosed to the reader, because social mores have changed dramatically since this book was written, the revelation was anti-climatic. Nonetheless, the story is as enchanting as it is intriguing. Not only is this book worth the reading; adding this book to your collection is worth the investment; and I guarantee that like me, you will read this book more than once if you are one who enjoys re-visiting earlier literary expereinces. (And yes, from this novel the screenplay for &quot;The Garden of Allah&quot; starring Charles Boyer and Marlene Deitrich was written.)Chuck Pace, MPH West Hollywood, California"},{"Title":"Fight Back!","review":"An excellent summary of solutions for terrorism and other security issues.

It defines threats, backgrounds and considerations for personal preparedness. It suggests that we are the first responders for our own personal safety, suggests the same prudent recommendations apply to non-CEOs, and provides appropriate responses to known threats.My only regret is that practice is not stressed as much as awareness. Shelter in place covers what is required, but does not seem to stress the drill. How long will it take you to seal off? Did you miss anything? What personal modifications for shelter in place do you need? How long does it take you to accomplish this? What did you miss the first time you tried?If you don't practice, you won't know until it counts. That's too late.Terrorism ain't just for CEOs anymore. This book has excellent information not covered in the press, prudent responses, and prudent preparations. My only suggestion is practice. It enables personal adaptation of the information provided."},{"Title":"Fight Back!","review":"This book is written in a tone that's surprisingly mild without a heavy dose of panic. It is rather factual in nature making some rather fundamental comments about personal security. Many of these, removing tree branches that might be used to allow entry to your house through an upstairs window, clearing shrubs from around your house, keeping a battery powered radio (with fresh batteries) around make good sense where there are terrorists involved or not.The first half of the book on knowing how terrorists organize, think, and act is quite interesting. He also discusses several organizations, some of which (Al Qaida) pose a definite threat to the US, some (Hamas) haven't operatee in the United States, some (Black Panthers) are basically defunct.One thing that I was expecting because of the title was a recommendation to keep a gun at home. Out here in the west everybody (nearly) has a gun. I was surprised at this knowing a little about Liddy's reputation.There are a couple of errors in the book. For instance there is a comment about using duct tape to seal your house. He says that FEMA recommends tape that has a minimum of ten millimeters (0.01 in). Ten millimeters is nearly a half inch. That's pretty thick for tape.A final comment. Much in this book is good advice. It makes sense if there is a terrorist threat or simply a hurricane like Katrina. On the other hand, to concentrate on the terrorist threat doesn't make all that much sense. 9/11 killed about 3,000 people. That's about how many people are killed each and every month by driving accidents. But a book on driving accidents wouldn't be of much interest."},{"Title":"Fight Back!","review":"I found it geared more toward CEO's of large corporations that need protection rather that the common individual."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Once again Lemony Snicket out does himself with the 10th book of his series, The Slippery Slope. 3 orphans, Violet, Klaus and Sunny, fight for they're survival against Count Olaf and his hench-men. Only this time, Sunny is trapped in the clenches of the enemy and Violet and Klaus must escape a runaway trailer to save her and also find the mysterious headquarters of V.F.D. before Count Olaf does.This book takes place in the Mortmain Mountains where the V.F.D. headquarters is to be located. As always, Violet thinks up outrageous inventions to get them out of troubles way. Sunny on the other hand is as close to danger as she could be. After having to endure villain bad breath, sleeping in a casserole bowl, making meals and clean dishes in the snow, Sunny finds one thing that helps her endure all of this.... No one can understand what she saids. This very thing is what keeps her going, that and the hope that her siblings are all right.This book is more based around Sunny and her actions, with a little bit of Violet and Klaus taking up the rear. Though, Violet and Klaus do have their moments here and there. And... What's this? Has Violet fallen for a boy they met on the way up the mountain?? ;) *Gasp*Two new characters are introduced into the story, though Snicket doesn't name them for certain reasons unknown. When these two people show up, Sunny notices something, Count Olaf's almost... Afraid of them??? *Deeper Gasp! * Whoever these 2 mysterious people are; they carry with them the Snicket file. (DUN Dun dunnnnn)I enjoyed this book very much, seeing as this is the only book series I read besides Harry Potter. I laughed, I cried, I laughed, and I yelled, \\"DON'T GO TOWARD THEM YOU FOOLS!\\" and I even mumbled under my breath as I read this touching/horrifying chapter of the orphans adventure.I believe this book would appeal to anyone who's read Harry Potter or likes to read something a little different from: They lived happily ever after.So I'll end this with the following questions to rattle around in little brains: Can Sunny over hear Count Olaf and discover the truth? Will Violet and Klaus find the secret of V.F.D? And....

Let me just say that I was not disappointed.This book was a lot more tense and dark than the other ones, but delightfully fun at the same time. What kind of author can do that? Lemony Snicket can. He can be humorous, touching, sad, or just plain silly all at the same time. He really does have a gift.This series is charming. Although it's a bit below my normal reading level, it is a pleasure I have no reason to be guilty about. It includes some very cute references to other great literary works, something which Mr. Snicket has maintained through this entire series. Sunny's garbled baby interjections will be funny to young readers, but meaningful to older ones (\\"Busheney!\\" is her way of saying \\"a horrible man with no regard for others;\\" that one really got me cracked up!) This series has something for everyone.Also, it has the makings of a very fine mystery. With each step, the likeable Baudelaires (the protagonists) are coming closer to finding out more about a complicated plot that hangs a shadow over their lives. Parents should know that these protagonists are children that you want your children to be: extremely interested in learning, very courteous, and just plain intelligent. These are not teenagers-getting-attitudes. 14 year old Violet is an inventor, 13 year old Klaus is a voracious reader, and baby Sunny loves, well, biting things.There is something for everyone in these books; i couldn't urge parents more to buy these. If your kid is tired of Harry Potter, just know that there's way more out there in store. Mr. Snicket is a literary jewel for children."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"I've read all the books in Lemony Snickets Series of Unfortunate Events and I think that they are all amazing!

The three protagonists Violet, Sunny and Klaus Baudelaire, are separated leaving Violet and Klaus to their doom. Throughout the book the Baudelaires manage to: Lose Sunny to the antagonist Count Olaf, escape a speeding wagon, get chased by snow nats, find fire and shelter, run into a rather cruel and familiar enemy, meet a VFD member, get to the VFD hideout to find it eliminated, reach Sunny, get caught by Olaf, figure out his plan... And after all this nearly nothing is accomplished. The Baudelaires may have reached one goal and that was to be reunited. But VFD and their parents still remain a mystery.The book definitely has a lot of character, with Count Olaf and his troop and the Baudelaires, but it is mostly plot. With Count Olaf always scheming something to get hold of the Baudelaire fortune, the Baudelaires always trying to outwit him and especially in this book with the Baudelaires trying to find out the mystery of VFD.Personally this is one of the best books I've ever read because of how fun the writing is. Lemony Snicket has the funniest, oddest most entertaining writing there is. And he chooses to be a little more adventurous in this book by giving Violet, Sunny and Klaus the most difficult situations in the series. Anyone who reads this book must read the other nine in the series, because many of the mysteries in the series are uncovered in this book. Although just enough is hidden that there is still much suspense and thirst to read the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The Baudelaires are yet again on the run from the evil Count Olaf.

This book is apart of a ten book series, and this is the tenth book. The previous book in this series ended talking about how the Baudlelaire orphans are going to the Valley of Four Drafts, looking to find the headquarters of VFD and hopefully their parents. On the way up the mountains, they figure out that the evil Count Olaf has captured one of the Baudlelaire siblings, Sunny, and is going to burn down the VFD headquarters. Also, he's going to keep Sunny to finally have the Baudlelaire fortune (which he has been trying to get his hands on since the very first book in the series.)In my opinion, the Slippery Slope is a great book. It has so much action and humor, and it will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very last page.

She's useful around the camp and since Olaf and his troupe don't think she is able to eavesdrop and learn important information.THE SLIPPERY SLOPE is a very important book in the chronicles of the Baudelaires. New characters are introduced, old characters are re-met, and small mysteries are solved. When I read this story it felt to me like it was the beginning of the end of the saga. With only three books left in the series it very well should be. But, THE SLIPPERY SLOPE is just as exciting and dangerous as the previous books in the series.

This splits them apart from Quigley and they are to meet him at the last safe place of the V.F.D organization, which is said to be the Hotel Denouncement.

If you haven't read this book, read it. (unless you haven't read any of the series at all, then read up the series untell you get to this book, then read it.) Now im not going to give you to much information, but if you know the Quagmire triplet, you will want to read this book because lets just say they fount a Quagmire.

When Violet, like always, finally devises a plan to get the caravan to stop moving, she and Klaus take the things that would seem the most important, and set out to find their sister. After walking around a while, they encounter the Snow Scouts, whom one of the members offer to help them search for Sunny and to get to Count Olaf. Imagine Violet and Klaus' surprise when they discover that this member is really Quigley Quagmire, brother of the two triplets Isadora and Duncan, and who also was believed to have died in the fire that the parents of the triplets also died in. As Quigley, Klaus, and Violet share all they know about VFD to one another and devise a plan to get Sunny back, they also find out many more secrets about VFD along the way.The tenth book in the Series of Unfortunate Events has it all- mystery, action, suspense, and humor. One minute you'll be laughing at Lemony Snicket's witty humor, and the next, you'll be wondering if Sunny really will return to her siblings. I was so engrossed in this story, I finished it in two hours. It's an excellent addemum to the Series of Unfortunate Events. Hope you like the book!"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"In my perspective,Lemony Snikett is the most brilliant children's book writer in the history of literature. His unusual yet darkly funny sense of humor keeps children (and adults) of all ages mezmerized. His sense of timing and suspense is genius level. I gave my middle-grade nieces his boxed set, and for their 6,7 and 8 year old cousins I discovered an adventurous and fun bilingual picture book (written in Spanish and in English), DRUM,CHAVI,DRUM!/TOCA,CHAVI, TOCA! It is set in Little Havana's largest Latino fextival. The little girl teaches the adults a big lesson. It is filled wth drum sounds that kids will repeat and love to mimick. These books are driving the whole family wild wth joy. Kids that read don't get into trouble.Snickett did it again!!!"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The Slippery SlopeWritten by: Lemony SnicketThis is the tenth book in \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\". The main characters include the Baudelaire children, Count Olaf, and Esme Squalor. Sunny is the youngest of the three Baudelaire orphans. She is only two years old but is courageous and demands independence from her siblings. Sunny has sharp teeth, a very limited vocabulary, and a strong will. Klaus is the middle child. He is 12 years old, loves to read, and is very intelligent. Violet is the eldest of the siblings and is 15 years old. She is imaginative and loves to invent things. Violet's inventions are well known among her admirers. Count Olaf is a wicked old villain who is out to get the Baudelaire's fortune. Esme is the evil girlfriend of Count Olaf. She is the \\"in and out girl\\". This means if it is in-style she'll embrace it, but if it is out she'll despise it.The plot of the book is about the adventures of the Baudelaire children as they try to find out if one of their parents is still alive and try to find their kidnapped sister, Sunny. They encounter many obstacles and disappointments in their journey.The setting takes place on the slippery slope of Mortmain Mountains. The mountains are freezing and are infested with evil insects called snow gnats. These insects will sting anything and everyone. It is a miserable place to be.The theme of the book is about realistic trials and their outcomes. Unlike many stories this story does not have a happy ending.I liked this book because it has unpredictable twists and turns. The author has a very unique style of writing! It will most definitely capture your attention."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Obviously, I can only add to the glowing reviews that this book has already received. I will not contradict - a word which here means \\"tell these people that they're opinions are as useless as infant slavery\\" - the prior reviews as I am in total agreement with them.What I want to add is that the writing style transports me back to those days when I was a child trying to come to grips with how adults behaved. To a kid things are simple and clear, and yet the actions and motivations of adults are cryptic. And in this, Lemony Snicket has (over the course of 10 books so far) taken us most of the way through the journey of enlightenment for three young orphans.The virtues demonstrated by the protagonists are uncompromising and serve as a splendid example of how to live your life in the face of so much uncontrollable disaster. As with the greeks and forever more, tragedy is the highest form of art.This is the most enjoyable series I have ever read, children's or otherwise. And is the rumor true, that as there are 13 chapters per book, that there will be 13 books in the series? The clues are everywhere."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"This fantastic novel grabs the reader in a whirl of excitment and adventure from page one. In this book, the three orphans must face a swarm of snow gnats, an annoying group of snow scouts who can't think of an adjective for x, and a fashionable woman dressed like a fire, sledding down a frozen waterfall.This may sound strange, but Lemony Snicket's books are all about strange. I highly suggest this book to anyone. Some may think the series bad at first, but, if you keep on reading, you will understand Mr. Snicket's powerful writing.However, start with book one, The Bad Beginning, before reading this.By the way, the clue for book eleven is: \\"Many people have the same initials which can lead to much injustice.\\""},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Best of the series so far. Alternating the action between the two older siblings in one chapter and Sunny in the next really worked for me."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"I think The slippery slope is a great book. I Love all the Series of unfortunate events books. 1-10 are great I want to read # 11. I like when the gnats attack! I wound not want to get stung by a snow gnat. I like Violet she is very smart.I think Count Olaf is a great villian.Count olaf is crazy!!! He Steals sunny I cant tell you the rest so read it.if you are interested in reading These books dont wait start now!!!!If you start reading these books start reading from #1. The best one is # 10 It is great They try to get to the peek of a moutain. They are hoping they find one of there parents there they ask themself which parent will be there or will count olaf be waiting for them.Will they ever see sunny again."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The storyline is fascinating as it reveals a greater amount of information regarding V.F.D. The part I enjoy the most is where Violet and Klaus flee from the snow gnats and take shelter in the Snow Scouts' cave. It is extremely interesting to read about the elder Baudelaires and the \\"sweatered scout\\" communicating with epithets such as \\"Voracious Fierce Dragon\\", \\"Vain Fat Dictator\\" and \\"Vinegar Flavoured Doughnuts\\".It was also pleasant to read about Quigley Quagmire's explanation of how he recovered from the usually fatal affliction of death in the Quagmire mansion. I find it touching that he volunteered to help the Baudelaires before searching for Duncan and Isadora, although I suspect that it was not out of an especially kind feeling but more out of personal reasons. However, for whatever reason he chose to assist the Baudelaires, it is nice to know that there are still people who are generous and selfless.Unfortunately, I felt that it was not Klaus who orchestrated the mental gymnastics of this book, but Quigley. This is not so good, as it is usually the Baudelaires' intelligence that makes the storyline charming.The only thing which I feel spoils the tale is the author's refusal to describe what exactly happened between the third Quagmire triplet and the eldest Baudelaire on the icy ledge. I do not know whether Quigley really was talking to Violet, or if he was describing the wall or something else as quite lovely indeed.I marvel at the author's ability to tangle a simple plot into an extremely confusing puzzle -- the existence of fire survivors in the Baudelaire, Snicket and Quagmire households; the identity of Beatrice; the relationships of the characters. I am confident that the end of the series will be innovative and witty, and I hazard a guess that someone will die (or else the ending will be too happy, and it also cannot be too depressing, and therefore will be bittersweet). I hope that the victim will be Quigley, to make for more drama, although I presume that it will leave the eldest Baudelaire broken-hearted."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The Slippery Slope was a great book. It was about Klaus and Violet Baudelaire along with their friend Quigley who try to rescue Sunny from the clutches of the mean Count Olaf. The book was a great mystery with many twists that kept you reading. The setting and adventure was so well described, that i had a very good mental image of what was happening. It was also kind of funny. The author would stray from the story and tell explain something barely relevant to what was happening. Once again this book was great."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"If you are addicted to Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events, then the tenth addition to this thirteen part series is a must have! If you enjoyed the early books but found the last few somewhat formulaic, then I still recommend Book the Tenth!After countless tantalizing hints and suggestions, we finally get some real clues. Without giving anything important away, I can reveal that information is uncovered concerning whether or not both Baudelaire Parents really died in book one's fatal fire (hinted at in the last book); we draw much closer to finding out what the initials V.F.D. mean; we are reacquainted with at least two characters from the early books; and a hitherto missing person makes an astonishing appearance subsequently shedding considerable light on the tragic events blighting the Baudelaire sibling's lives. Furthermore, although you won't be able to read about it (for reasons of privacy), Violet has an unexpected romantic entanglement in a very cold place!The last book left readers with a cliff-hanger: Sunny had been abducted by Count Olaf and his entourage and was being driven uphill, whilst Violet and Klaus were rolling downhill in an out-of-control carnival caravan. If that sounds bad ... then be warned ... things get much worse! If you enjoy cheerful books about mischievous elves, talking mice, magical spells and soft, fluffy teddy bears, then don't order this book - however, if you like alphabetical pledges, snow gnats, trained eagles, mysterious hidden letters, and find vicarious pleasure in the misfortunes of others (an expression which here means you like laughing at luckless orphans), then this is the book for you.Finally, the obligatory dedication to Beatrice is the funniest yet!"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"It was humorous at many parts what Sunny said (such as Busheney, which means an evil heartless man with no care for others, does that sound like a mixing of our president and vice president's names? Looks like another politician ^-^). Anyways, there are many surprises, and, of course, disatrous events anyone will love. READ IT NOW! If you haven't read the others, do so!"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"If you haven't bought this book yet, I suggest you buy it. It is the longest book yet (over 300 pages), but in this case, bigger is better. In this tenth sequel to one of the most popular book series out there, the Baudelaire kids reunite with old friends, and are seperated from Sunny by Count Olaf. Violet, Klaus, and their two friends have to find Sunny in the wilderness. Meanwhile, COunt Olaf and his troupe forces Sunny to commit to chores an average baby cannot do. And you might be quite surprise at what Sunny SAYS.As usual, Snicket keeps you guessing at the end of every chapter. And even more suspensful, the note to the editor is even harder to read than past books, which you may or may not like. The book is a little slow-moving, but is well worth your money. Go out and buy this book that keeps you guessing from page 1 right now!"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The Slippery Slopeby: Lemony ShicketPeriod: 1In this book, Klaus and Violet get separated from Sunny Baudelaire, the yougest child. Violet likes is an inventor, and she always keeps her haor tie when she is thinking of an invention. Klaus is a reader. He loves to read, and his reading education always seems to help the Baudelaire children when they are in trouble. Violet thinks of a plan to stop the moving vehicle. Then theu colllect the items they thought they needed on start to walk. They follow the river, which had fish in them. The fish looked like they were coughing because of heavy smoke. Snow knats attack them. These knats sting them, and they keep away from the smell of smoke. Klaus and Violet find shelter in a cave. Inside they meet the Snow Scouts. They were on a Snow Scout hike, going to the Spring Pole. They see one person mysteriously connunicating with the Baudelaire children. They know that each other were doing the same thing: looking for VFD. Sunny on the other hand is kidnapped by Count Olaf and his horrible team. She is forced to cook, and she sleeps in the trunk of the car. She does spying, and she learns that these two wicked people burned down the secret hideout of VFD. They have the Snicket File, which can prove that the Baudelaire orphan's father or mother were alive. It was the proof of the fire that had killed their parents and burned down their home. Violet miraculously saves the Baudelaire children and Quigley, the other triplet of Baudelaire's friends. They slide down the frozen waterfall on a tobaggon. They get separated in the raging river. Quigey went to the other side of the fork, while the Baudelaire children went to the other side.In this book, I like the quote, \\"...and we're not leaving without her.\\" Klaus said this, and he said that after Violet and Quigley came bak down from the waterfall where they went to find Sunny. Klaus wanted his sister, and he said this. It showed that he cared, and that he was determined to get his sister back. Violet let her stay with Count Olaf because she wanted to do more spying, and Sunny said that now, she was a big girl. If they had taken Sunny, Count Olaf would've been suspicious. They leave her there, and Klaus said this boldly. He loved his sister, and she cared for him as well.\\"...accomodating, basic, calm, darling, emblematic, frisky, grinning, human, innocent, jumping, kept, limited, meek, nap-loving, official, pretty, quarantined, recent, scheduled, tidy, understandable, victorious, wholesome, xylophone, young, zippered.\\" This is what the Snow Scouts say they are. They say that to people they meet, and to describe themsleves or something else. They say that they are these things, but then Klause realizes that some of them don't make snese. No one can be xylophone. They say that that is the only word that starts with an \\"x,\\" but then Klaus says that they can be xenial. Then Bruce, the Snow Scouts troop leader says that they cannot change the pledge. I liked this quote because it makes me laugh. They have a word that starts with every letter of the alphabet, and they use them to describe themselves. It was a good part because it is funny. I liked this part of the book.My favorite part of the book was when Violet thinks of inventions very quickly. She ties up her hair, and in a few minutes, she thinks of an invention they need with the supplies they have. One time she saves them from getting pushed off a cliff. She hops onto a tobaggon, and the other children follow, Then the slide down the frozen waterfall. They make it out in time, just to find more tradegy in front of them. They unfortunatley get separated. Another part in the book that I like was when Quigley, Klaus, and Violet come cross a device that locks the door to VFD. They have to answer three questions to open it. They each use their masteries to help open the lock. Violet used her skills of all the famous scientists, Quigley with his mapping brains, and Klaus who used a book to solve one of the questions. These were my favorite parts."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The Slippery Slope is a good book that has lots of adventure. It is about a girl and boy named Violet and Klaus Baudelaire looking for their little sister Sunny Baudelaire who got kidnapped by a man and woman named Count Olaf and Esme Squalor. They kidnapped poor little Sunny because they want to steal the Baudelaire fortune. And Klaus and Violet go through a lot just to get their sister. They go through snow gnats, Snow Scouts, and many more.Violet and Klaus get chased by something like bees but their called snow gnats that sting people for no reason what so ever. The snow gnats chase them into a cave and end up meeting these really strange peopleand this one mysterious kid. This mysterious kid leads both of the Baudelaires up the Vertical Flame Diversion. The two Baudelaires think the snow scout in the sweater is not trustworty. The mysterious snow scouts in the sweater was leading them to the V.F.D. Headquarters.After their done climbing up the vertical flame diversion the boy uncovers his face and it is one of the Quagmire triplets. It is Quigley Quagmire. Then while Count Olaf and his associates are at the top of the mountain Count Olaf forces Sunny to make them food and clean all of the mess that they make. Then Olaf meet these two strange people with no name which are called the man with a beard and no hair and the woman with hair but no beard. They give everything Count Olaf needs to get the fortune.Then Violet makes a invention to get to the top. then they lure Esme Squalor down to the bottom to get their sister but they change the plan all around and everything goes wrong. Then when they bring Esme back at the top they see the snow scouts.Then they get captured. At the end they get seperated from Quigley and probably might never see each other ever again. I really liked this book because it has a lot of adventure. I really like the Book The Slippery Slope."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"In the previous episode of this tragic series, we were left at an excellent cliffhanger where Violet and Klaus Baudalaire were speeding down the Mortmain Mountains, while Sunny, the youngest of the three children, was left with the evil madman, count Olaf, traveling in the opposite direction. If you haven't read this series, then you will not know about any of this. I strongly suggest you put down this book at once and go search for a happier story about flying children who prance around finding a large amount of gold or silver. This story takes place in the Mortmain Mountains where Violet and Klaus are about to be killed from the drop that the House of Freaks caravan was about to experience. Violet and Klaus are forced to walk along the snowy path, attempting to keep up with their baby sister Sunny. Suddenly they stumble across a flock of snow gnats, which enjoy stinging innocent civilians for pleasure. Klaus does some quick thinking and wraps an oversized coat around himself and Violet, to protect them from the snow gnats. While trying to figure out the mystery of V.F.D., they find Quigley Quagmire, their best friends' brother, who supposedly died in a fire. The next thing they know they are face to face with Count Olaf, trying to rescue their baby sister Sunny.Despite the first paragraph, this series has excellent detail (such as when they are climbing a huge mountain with forks attached to their feet), which is added to an excellent plot, for a great story. You will also find a bit of humor snuck into certain parts to make the story even better. The mystery behind the many secrets of V.F.D. gives it a taste of fun, similar to books where you try to solve many mysteries, which leads up to a bigger mystery at the end. This book, so far, is probably the best in the series. I love it!"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"For the tenth time we follow the adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, Violet, Klaus, and baby Sunny, though baby Sunny has grown up quite a bit since the first book. While I have looked forward to this book, there were certain aspects of the book that I found disappointing compared to my expectations.As you will recall from the last book, Count Olaf and his henchmen have kidnapped Sunny. Violet and Klaus are presumed dead in the crash of a caravan. Things are looking grim once again for the trio. However, all is not lost for the Baudelaires as we know from our experiences with the first nine books.In this book the orphans reach the Mortmain Mountains, the home of the long-sought headquarters, though not simultaneously or together. The questions for this book are: Will the orphans rejoin each other as they search for clues to their mysterious past? Will the orphans reach headquarters at last, and if so, what will they find there? What is the meaning of the mysterious initials \\"VFD?\\" The Baudelaires are clearly in a Very Fine Dilemma in this book. Watch out for the obnoxious snow gnats and beware of Snow Scouts wearing masks.While I enjoyed this book, I had a vague feeling that perhaps Lemony Snicket was losing a bit of momentum in his writing. The story seemed to move forward more slowly than the previous books. Violet's inventions were fewer and less inspired. Baby Sunny attempting to stop a toboggan with her teeth made me queasier than the previous uses of her teeth. The revelations in this book just didn't seem quite as creative to me as the previous books. It's possible that reading ten books with a similar style of writing has caused me to become accustomed to the style and it's no longer as fascinating as it once was. However, the story was interesting and I look forward to the final two books in the series. It will be interesting to see whether there is a Baudelaire parent that has survived the fire of the first book. Will Count Olaf finally get what is coming to him? Just what is in the mysterious Snicket file? The questions are endless, and will keep me reading to the end of the series."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"I like this book very much.My friends and I really enjoy reading the Lemony Snicket books.

And as ridiculous as the stories are, I've actually started to care about these kids, which surprises me, actually. It will be very interesting by volume 13 to see how Mr. Snicket reconciles the cynicism with the end of the series. I mean, Count Olaf can't actually win in the end, can he?One reviewer didn't like a comment made in this volume about our current president....Well, you could look at it like this: Count Olaf and his henchmen and women are like George W. Bush and his administration. All the ineffectual or responsibility-shirking people who should help the orphans but don't are the democrats and the liberals. And who gets to be the Baudelaire orphans? You & me, baby, that's who: us working class people and we're just slippin' down that slippery slope faster and faster all the time. Does that help?"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"There are many things you could do with The Slippery Slope. You could substitute it for an umbrella to keep from getting soaked during a rainstorm, you could use it as a doorstop when another not-round object can't be found, I suppose you might be able to use it as a fan, but that might not work very well, you could read it but why you would want to do that is beyond me, or you could just not buy it at all.I'd recommend the second to last thing. The Slippery Slope is wit beyond wit. It's great!In the tenth book of A Series of Unfortunate Events, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are at The Mortmain Mountains where fierce snow gnats live and a headquarters of a very secret orginization is rumored to be. Oh, yeah, there's also a group called the Snow Scouts who harvest some familar faces and just don't seem to realize that nobody can be xylaphone.A frozen waterfall, a very \\"fiery\\" dress, and V.F.D (maybe you actually find out what it stands for)! also come into play.The whole series is great. Mr. Snicket is probably one of the wittiest authors out there. Oh, what an unfortunate day it will be when the last book is consumed by the readers. Sigh.If you haven't read this series yet then what are you waiting for? I suppose you don't want a treat to read. Then again, maybe you shouldn't click the \\"add to cart\\" button, the title of the series really does just say it all (just kidding)! The situations may be unfortunate but the humor is priceless."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The minute I finished the last chapter of \\"The Bad Beginning\\" I was hooked. I immediately and voraciously read through the next eight (seeing as I was late to catch the bandwagon) and loved every single word written by this truly unique and original author. Lemony Snicket has won my fandom, and once again, with \\"The Slippery Slope\\" he has won my tumultous applause and praise.\\"The Slippery Slope\\" begins as most of them do, with Lemony Snicket babbling about the sadness contained in his books and how, if able, to dispose of them immediately. The beginnings are always lovely written, and sometimes even my favorite part of the book. His dark, cynnical humor rings through the larger-than-needs-to-be type, and even after hundreds of pages of it you still crave more. The first chapters, filled to the brim with Mr. Snicket's humor, had me laughing out loud as all of his books do (and I'm typically not a laugh-out-loud person).Then came the plot.I am SO regretful to say that the plot just doesn't cut it. Unlike the other books, in which the three siblings Violet, Klaus, and Sunny have a single, obvious mission, this one you're not quite sure what they're trying to achieve. It seems as if they change their mind alot. First it's to save sunny, then it's to find their parents, then it's to decipher the many secrets of V.F.D., and then it's to find sunny again, and then it's to capture Esme, etc., etc., etc... It seems to go on and on like this throughout most of the story. Since it also had a hard act to follow, this is probably the worst in the series yet.Then why, you ask, did I give it four stars?Well, just because it's the worst in the series doesn't make it a bad book! It is a wonderful and entertaining and cleverly written book that will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time. Lemony Snicket has succeeded in making a book that definitely lives up to the series but not the expectations of the reader. But in a world that reads good, but stylisticly boring books like Harry Potter, Snicket is an escape from the ordinary into a story that is nuanced and humorous. And with the seemingly multiplying mysteries of the V.F.D, he uses advertisement like no other for his next book - cliffhangin' anticipation!Mr. Snicket, you have once again pleased me in writing an absolutely exceptional book! Just next time, please me like you did with Book the Ninth!-Jason O. King"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"I think Lemoney Snicket is a genius !I enjoy his books very much and recomend them to everyone."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The best book in the world, to me, is always the latest book in The Series Of Unfortunate Events."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"this book is probably best if you've been reading the series because it answers alot of questions posed in the previous books i also think its the best in the lemony snicket series you should so totally get it... or borrow it..or something but if you haven't,i advise you to read the rest of the series first!"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The Series of Unfortunate Events is one of the best series that I have ever read. It is a series of ten books, about 3 orphans who lost their parent in a fire. The book I am reviewing is the latest book, The The Slippery Slope. It leaves one of the 3 Baudelaire orphans kidnapped by the evil man, Count Olaf, who has been in each book, trying to steal the fortune of the young Baudelaires. He and his crew have just lefta carnival, which they destroyed, and that is how the book starts off. If you are looking for a happy ending, this book wouldn&#65533;t be your best pick, but trust me, this is worth reading. It is surely a great book, around 300 pages, and for kids from about 9-14, it is a must read. On a scale of 1 through 10, I&#65533;d have to give this book a 9.5."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"If your tired of boring cinderella-type books with handsome princes and living happily -ever-after, this book is for you. Once again, you join the Baudalaire children in their quest to figure out the mysteries of V.F.D. But this book has a twist, Sunny gets older(T.T) and cooks, an amazing survivor of a fire, and (gasp!) like 5 seconds of romance. So, this book may be filled with evil grownups, bratty kids, and the many un-solved mysteries that surround the kids, but dude, this book rocks."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"This is the best book yet, besides the Austere Academy. It is a lot more interesting than the rest, because the sibilings actually meet up with someone who understands them, and can help: Quigley, the last of the Quagmire triplets.Sunny's budding talent for cooking brings a new aspect into the story, as does the little hint of romance.The rest of the books should be read first."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"A Review by JosieStarting from where the ninth book ended, The Slippery Slope starts with Violet and Klaus are separated from Sunny. Through out this book, the children get attacked by snow gnats and run into a group of kids celebrating False Spring, led by a person they never thought they see again. Also they see many more fires and come to a point where they must fight fire with fire. They also travel many roads that are less traveled and find out secrets to questions they been asking for months Also they find a surprising person who made it out of a fire alive.I liked how this book answered the questions that I have been wondering for years. I also liked how it was very descriptive about things like the snow gnats. The book also involved things from other books and poems like the \\"Road Less Traveled.\\" Also how it showed things from the first nine books so you remember some of the things that the children want through. The three main characters are very descriptive and from the book you can tell a lot about them. Like each of their different talents and things they do well. The children are like normal children put in strange spots and I like that I can relate to them.I think it was a great book and if you liked the other nine books you will love this one. It's a great book for people who like funny and dark books. I would not suggest this book if you don't like a bit of a sad story."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"This is such a good story!It is full of fun.Trust me you won't to put the book down!"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"THE SETUPThe series setup is that the parents of Violet, Kraus, and infant Sunny were killed in a fire, which destroyed their home and made them orphans. Their evil uncle Count Olaf schemes to get custody of them, in order to rob the Baudelaire fortune.\\"The Slippery Slope\\" is a continuation of \\"The Carnivorous Carnival\\" without a break. The book opens with Sunny in the captivity of Count Olaf, with Violet and Kraus hurtling down a mountain in a runaway vehicle. Soon thereafter they team up with Quigly Quagmire (the \\"dead\\" brother of Isadora and Duncan). Kraus and Violet discover that their parents were members of the \\"VFD\\", as were the Quagmires.BOOKS 1 to 5Books 1 to 5 all are all written with the same plot and in the same formula and droll style, but becoming increasingly dark and depressing. They appear to be nominally aimed at a 4-8 year olds, but actually primarily at their parents. The author strains to be clever and witty, and succeeds, although the humorous devices get very tiresome by book 5). In Books 1 to 5, Count Olaf is portrayed as a clever greedy schemer.Since I was a small child, I've detested \\"children's\\" literature such as the animated cartoon \\"Bullwinkle\\", and most recent \\"Disney\\" animations, which are actually written for adults with adult cultural references and double entendres that only an adult could catch. Handler doesn't use adult cultural references or double entendres--his schtick is mis-defining words--which, in my opinion, is the equivalent of lying to a child, a form of child abuse.BOOKS 6 to 13Book 6 to 13 are of an entirely different style--either they were written by a different author, or Daniel Handler finally got some professional help. Books 6 to 13 appear to be genuinely written for 10-year-olds to early teens, but are fun reading for adults as well. More effort is made to define \\"advanced vocabulary\\" words accurately, and the books actually have interesting plots.. Although the Baudelaire orphans are in tough situations, the plots are not really dark. However, Count Olaf becomes darker, becoming uncouth cruel nasty and evil.CRITIQUE OF \\"THE SLIPPERY SLOPE\\"As, really, a chapter (nominally book 10) in the series, the book is typical of books 6 to 13, but perhaps a little below average. It features many definitions of words which (unfortunately) are \\"advanced\\" for many adults, such as pyromania, toboggan verdant, schism, lox, conflagration, and complied, and many phrases such as \\"a road less traveled\\", \\"take a page from his book\\", \\"roll up her sleeves\\", \\"corridors of power\\", \\"carry the day\\", and \\"Stockholm syndrome\\". GOOD GOING DANIEL!!! However, he just can't resist some awful mis-definitions. For example: \\"esoteric\\" is defined as \\"things that aren't used much\\", \\"tribulations\\" is defined as \\"opportunities to eavesdrop while cooking for the theater troop\\", and \\"Mount Fraught syndrome\\" is defined as the opposite of Stockholm syndrome."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The Slippery Slope is the 10th installment of the ever so dreadful series called \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\", featuring the three Baudelaire orphans; Violet (14 year old inventor), Klaus (her well read brother) and the youngest Sunny (the ever talented chomper).The book began with a really bad start, where Violet and Klaus are plummeling down the mountain to their death while Sunny is left in Count Olaf's hands so he could get his filthy hands on the Baudelaire's fortune. After their close call, they meet up with the third missing Quigley Quagmire, who were thought to be dead in the first place! The three of them do whatever it takes to decipher the ever so mysterious VFD, giving Violet and Klaus more important informaton about their parents' past involvement with the VFD.Meanwhile, Sunny tries her best to keep herself safe, by stalling and doing some chores set by Count Olaf and his evil troupe for her to complete, as cooking, hoping her siblings are safe somewhere and not dead in the feet of the mountains. While she is in Count Olaf's hands, she overheard some things that's useful for her and her siblings to persue in the future.At first, I wasn't really looking forward to read this one after how that last book ended. I love the cover and the plot really pulls you in like always."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"This book was a very good way to continue the series. Who ever though a book filled with misfortune and sorrow could be such an interesting story. the plot of the story and all of the mysteries gets you hooked after you read the first book. This book was very good and entertaining to read, but I thought it could have been more clear. I have read nxet three books in the series and Lemony Snicket does not answer all the questions that he has presented to the Baudelaire orphans or the readers.Over all this is a very good book and I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"\\"I've finally got one of the Baudelaire's in my clutches.\\" Said the selfish Count Olaf in A series of Unfortunate events: The Slippery Slope. This book is about 3 kids who have moved from place to place trying to get away from the treacherous Count Olaf.In this book there's Violet the older sister, Klaus the second oldest, and Sunny Baudelaire the baby.Count Olaf is a greedy and treacherous man. He is also a former V.F.D member but has turned evil but he still has a tattoo of an eye the symbol of V.F.D. V.F.D is a secret organization to try and prevent and stop evil. The Baudelaire's parents are believed to be dead but the children think from some evidence that there in the Mortmain Mountains. They also have another road block because Count Olaf framed them for all the murders he did.On the way to solve the mystery the Baudelaire's meet a lot of new and old people. So will the Baudelaire's create even more inventions, learn even more secrets, and bite more people on there way to solve all the secrets. Or will they end up behind bars for Count Olafs greediness.

They head up the Mortmain Mountains and encounter a frozen waterfall (the slippery slope in question). Along the way, they also encounter someone from the past who they hoped to never see again, someone who is a member of a rather annoying society of people who sing an irritating song using the letters of the alphabet. Yes, all of them!They also discover a shocking secret about one of the fires Count Olaf and his people started. Although not the answer they were hoping for, they are still pleased by this discovery. This leads them to attempt to unlock more secrets, which allows Klaus to use his literary skills and Violet her inventing prowess, a word which here means \\"talent\\". Sunny also becomes less baby-like in this book and is able to use her newly learned cooking skills.This book, like the others, is full of literary references, from a snippet of a poem by British poet Algernon Charles Swinburne to a very famous Leo Tolstoy novel that helps them open a secret door. The secret of V.F.D. is still not quite solved, but hopefully will be by the end of the series.I bought this book yesterday, the day it was released, and finished it in just under two hours. Like his other books, it is a quick but very satisfying read, and you won't get tired of reading it multiple times.It's hard to believe that the series is almost over (only 13 are planned), but they are books you'll never tire of reading. Buy this book and sink deeper into the abyss that is the Baudelaires' life."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Lemony Snicket shows once again that he is not only a emotionally harmed person, but also a exellent author. There are only a couple more books left. Like everything having to do with his books there will be 13. There are also 13 chapters in every book.This is because the three children are the three most unlucky children in the world. Their parents die, they get a evil gaurdian who wants to steal their fortune. This man keeps on chasing them and he will not stop until he has their fourtune. Yet now, Sunny (the yougest Baudelaire)is kidnapped by Count Olaf (the villain). So now the plot is so deep that you can't just pick up this book and understand it. Yet if you start reading this and the other books, the only thing you'll be dissapointed about is the sad story of the Baudelaire's sad life. It will keep us all guessing about how it will end."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"In the tenth book of \\"A Series of Unforuntate Events\\" Violet and Klaus Baudelaire are immediatly stranded in a runaway caravan heading down a steep slope,while their kidnapped sister is traveling in the opposite direction! Once out of the caravan and on their way to rescue Sunny from Count Olaf,they hope nothing can go wrong,but they can only hope. The two Budelaires run into snow knats, and a good friend to the Baudelaires named quiegly Quagmire who was presumed to be dead.They Also encounter a burned down libary with more clues that lead them to belive that atleast one of their parents may still be alive. While Violet is inventig tools to try and save their baby sister, Klaus and Quiegly search for more information about the mysterous VFD.My thoughts about this book:It always left me interested in more and never left me on just one subject. I recommend this book to anyone who likes books that have alot of events that continue into other books."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The absolute best part of this book is the evolution of Sunny from a rope-chewing baby into a gourmet cook whose deft one-word insults not only land undetected by villains but also on certain politicians in real life. Check out page 107 for the definition of \\"busheney\\"! I would love to make a list of the great words coined by Sunny in this book; it makes all the other characters seem dull.Count Olaf doesn't wear any disguises. Violet's inventions are predictable. Most of the brainpower is supplied by Quigley Quagmire, not Klaus.And I heartily applaud the return of Carmelita from the \\"Austere Academy\\". She will have some great scenes in the next installment now that she has joined Esme and Count Olaf. Cakesniffers!!"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"To the Unfortunate Reader-I am forced under terrible circumstances to write a review, considering that my circumstances are horrible. The Slippery Slope is another marvelously horrible book about Klaus, Sunny, and Violet Baudelaire, researched and recorded by Lemony Snicket himself. Once again, his books are marvelous, as well as they are horrible. The reason that I wish to give all of his books 5 stars is not because they are wonderful children's classics about dainty butterflies, but because they are filled with treachery, misery, and woe. His books are horrible, and I strongly urge you not to make the horrible mistake of purchasing any of them. However, if I could, I would give all of his books 100 stars, because they are horribly magnificent. Lemony Snicket is a brilliant writer, because his books show the life of the three Baudelaire children, struggling in dire situations to save their own lives. However, if you purchase any of his books, you will have yourself weeping for seemingly endless nights, just as I am sure Lemony Snicket is weeping about his beloved, departed, darling-Beatrice. If you do make the mistake of purchasing this book however, I urge you to wake to the top of Mount Fraut in the Mortmain Mountains and throw it as far away as you can into the endless gloom below. With that, I have finished this horrible review. But here is a poem- see if you can make any sense out of it:Misterious and subtleAmazing and magnificentXylphone and zipperedCracked and brokenOminous and profoundLuring and persuasiveEnergetic and effervescentMind boggling and curiousArsony and FiresNegativity and silence-The World is Quiet Here"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"SLIPPERY SLOPE is the tenth of the thirteen volume A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS. As an adult reader who came to this series recently (I saw the film version of the first three volumes, which seriously piqued my curiosity) I have had some complaints about the earlier volumes. As an adult reader, I found that the earlier volumes often moved too slowly and were too repetitive. I tried to get past that because, after all, it's a children's book, and some of the clever double entendre found in Sunny's \\"baby talk\\" in the earlier books was well worth it. Moreover, the underlying mystery had captured my imagination, and I found myself searching for clues in the books to see if I could figure some answers out myself.However, in this book, finally the story begins to move at a faster pace. New characters are introduced, we learn some answers (finally!) to the mysteries that have been haunting us since the first book, and Sunny's growth from a small baby into a little girl makes her the most charming of the Baudelaires. Yes the series was slow on occasion - the 4th and 5th books especially spring to mind - but the developing story is worth the wait. And if you're reading this to a child, you're going to be entertained as much as they are."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The book didn't do all that not fun expressions at the beginning of a chapter. And it did show a lot of information that I was hoping to get in the other books. And it was so fun that I couldn't get my head out of it. And Sunny Baudelaire was separated from Violet and Klaus and had to do all these chores for Count Olaf and his troop, even cooking. And the book was so enjoyable for me, even though I am only a seven year-old kid. And there is lots of that \\"eye\\" business. And Violet and Klaus and Quigley even didn't want for Esme to go into there trap."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The poor orphans that we have all grown to love have been split up. Yes it is true-a very heartbreaking thing indeed! Sunny, the youngest, sharp-toothed Baudelaire is with Olaf and his nasty crew. Violet and Klaus are rolling down the Mortmain(I believe) Mountains and trying to come up with a way to stop. The famed ribbon has been in the picture for quiet a while so Violet is already thinking up some kind of strange and creative invention. They decide to use some very sticky substances from the trailor they are in. Since most of you know about the sequel it is safe to say that the \\"invention\\" worked.Sunny, as I said before, is with Olaf and his troupe. She has to do everything for the lazy bunch including cooking with very sparse materials. But Sunny manages with her cooking talents and newfound maturity(our little Sunny can even speak almost as a normal person would!). But still Sunny is very far from appreciated.The Baudelaires have to find a way to rescue Sunny and in the process meet someone who should have died in a fire and an old classmate at the \\"austere\\" academy. I used to think that this was the best book in SoUE before yesterday. It seems as if the new books always exceed their standards of the previous ones."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"This book is the latest story of the famous series,A Series of Unfortunate Events.This book reveals the questions that readers have been figuring out since they bought their first SUE books (Is Quigley Quagmire alive?,What is the meaning of VFD?What happened to Jaques Snicket before he was murdered?etc.)But I must advice that the ones who just heard this sucessful series and will be planning to buy this book first,please don't buy it unless you have read one of the books.Because there are some parts of this story that the new readers will not understand.Many of my classmates heard of this series,bought The Slippery Slope and in the next day,they asked me,I don't get it.And if you are wondering what will happen in Book 11,please read more closely about the poem about the dead men,read the part when L.S. explained about his associate who threw the sugar bowl to the Stricken Stream.And also examine about the title (The Grim Grotto).Sounds clear to you?"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"what a great book. this is the longest unfortunate event book, which makes it last the longest, have the longest suspense, have the longest humor, have the best excitement. the slippery slope is one of those fine unfortunate event books including the wide window, the austere academy, the ersatz elevator, and the reptile room. Again, lemony displays really what a good book for children should have- humor, suspense, and good characters-all are in this book. If I were you I'd go to the local library and try to get this book as fast as I could because this is a book that many people rush to get. I myself had to wait two and a half weeks. If you are a person who likes books about memorizing, get this book, there is a group of kids who say something good about themselves for every letter of the alphabet.

IT'S GOING TO BE THE BEST CHRISTMAS EVER!!~Violet Baudelaire"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"This is definitely one of the best in the Series of Unfortunate events. It was kind of confusing but still, there was a great cliffhanger at the end and lots of adventures (which includes climbing up a slippery waterfall, digging a great pit, trying to rescue Sunny from Count Olaf, and spying on Count Olaf and his comrades). Lemony Snicket has definitely done it again with a wacky, unexpected, and twisted ending. But then there's always the saying,\\" Expect the Unexpected.\\""},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Is it possible that there are worse villains in the world than Count Olaf and his eerie girlfriend, Esme Squalor, and they might be working in cahoots with Olaf? Is it possible, as has been hinted since The Hostile Hospital, that someone else survived \\"the fire\\"? Can Violet fall in love? Can Sunny fashion meals out of seemingly incompatible ingredients? Are we to be introduced to the absolute worst scouting pledge of all time? Could they have finally found the headquarters for VFD, whatever that stands for?To answer: yes, perhaps, yes, yes, yes, and I won't tell you.We encounter more VFDs here: Very Fascinating Drama; Very Fun Day; Vinegar-Flavored Doughnuts; Violent Frozen Dragonflies; Voracious Fierce Dragon; Vain Fat Dictator; Vernacularly Fastened Door; Vertical Flame Diversion; Verdant Flammable Device; and Volunteer Feline Detective, amongst others. We also encounter a most odiferous young girl who fashions herself the False Spring Queen of the Snow Scouts at this particular juncture - Carmelita Spats - whom I have always envisioned as that large brute of a girl that used to beat up on Lisa Simpson. As horrid as she is, it is fun to have the word \\"cakesniffer\\" bandied around again.Sunny has really beefed up her skills as a chef. Having been abducted by Count Olaf, she is separated from her siblings and has been forced into performing chores for Count Olaf that are nearly impossible for a child her age. Not to mention that every night, at the top of a very cold mountain, she is forced to sleep in a casserole dish! Sunny's culinary abilities are beginning to blossom. One of the many creative dishes she fashions out of the seemingly incompatible ingredients that the filthy Olaf has left in the even filthier trunk of his automobile is Lox. To prepare Lox, one most have the appropriate accoutrements - or so says Snicket, in a rare misuse of a word. Accoutrements have more to do with apparel than ingredients in food, but with a stretch of the imagination, it's not difficult to forgive. Anyway, Sunny somehow finds \\"bagels, cream cheese, sliced cucumber, black pepper, and capers\\". She's also lucky enough to have salmon at her disposal, and she smokes this in preparation for making the Lox. (Not smoke in the sense of smoking a cigarette of course, or a Verdant Flammable Device, but smoke in the sense of sending out distress signals to her siblings!)A common element amongst all of these wonderfully morose yet uplifting books is triumph over adversity due to teamwork, and it is never used more than it is here. I'd love to comment on how, but that would give some things away that readers who aren't familiar with the books wouldn't want me to give away.Suffice to say, this is one of the strongest books in the series, and is also the longest. I admit to being sufficiently concerned that Book the Eleventh would be even longer (following a disturbing trend in today's publishing industry) but that wasn't the case."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"It's hard to believe that just ten depressing books ago the Baudelaire orphans were living their lives without any idea of where their journeys might end. They didn't know anything about a mysterious organization called VFD, or suspect the source of the fire that killed their parents. They were clueless as to where Count Olaf got his information about the orphans' whereabouts, and they'd have been completely baffled if you told them that the eye on Olaf's ankle was more than it seemed. But with \\"The Slippery Slope\\" the Baudelaires are wiser, if not happier. Sure they've used their intelligence and resources to get out of multiple sticky nefarious situations. Yet with this particular offering, the siblings are facing something they've never encountered to this extent before. They've been split apart from one another. It's distressing.Far more distressing is the fact that while Sunny has been purloined by Olaf and his creepy crew, Klaus and Violet have been sent down a steep mountain path towards their doom. After surviving (all thanks to Violet's clear head) the two decide to rescue their baby sister. Along the way they run into someone they've long since thought dead, and discover a host of information about VFD (though not what it stands for). Sunny, on her part, becomes a thoroughly resourceful Baudelaire in her own right. Having been exhausted as a character of her tendency towards biting, Sunny suddenly appears to also be a very clever cook. This is for the best since Olaf & Co. have decided to use her for all their menial and craft services. Most babies would balk. This one's up to the challenge. And though the ending is, in its way, depressing, it's a bit more cheery than some of the situations faced throughout this text.The author of this book has done a magnificent job detailing the orphans' moral struggles as well. Having helped the malicious Count Olaf to set the Caligari Carnival on fire in the last book, Klaus and Violet must consider just how much they can be held responsible for their actions. They've still never really come to terms with the idea of burning stuff up like Olaf, and now the phrase, \\"Fight fire with fire\\", has caused them a great deal of concern as well. Is it possible to defeat Olaf without lowering themselves to his level? Just how wrong is it of them to set traps like he does? And are they actually villains after having helped a villain, or are they victims? This is heavy stuff for any children's book to handle. I wouldn't be particularly surprised if kids reading this novella huff a little in exasperation over the orphans' moral qualms. After all, they've obviously been victimized numerous times. Still, if the author can convince kids that retaliating against evil with evil is a ridiculous notion, he's done more good than he probably intended.But that's neither here nor there. The point is that \\"The Slippery Slope\\" is a fine, magnificent, deeply depressing tale that more that deserves to be placed in the overall orphan oeuvre. The Baudelaires often complain that as time goes by their investigations churn up more questions than answers. With three books following this one in the series, it's unlikely that this pattern will abate any time soon. Until then, we'll just have to read each and every Baudelairian adventure be they high or low. I for one, am delighted with the prospect. Woo-hoo!"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"As this is the tenth book in the series, we start to get answers, but mysteries too. As Violet and Klaus look in the Mortmain mountains for the \\"survivor of the fire\\" they find him- but not who they expected it to be. Meanwhile, Sunny is having to cook dinner for count Olaf's gang. This book is full of twists, mysteries, repitedness, and of course, the initials V.F.D. Snicket can write, definiatly, and writes well, in that semi-rebillion-against-commonly-accepted-writing-rules style, which everyone loves. Overall, this book is worth every penny!"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"If you like to read about somebody in a runaway caravan that is tumbling down a mountain, would you like to read The Slippery Slope?

Its about two childeren venturing through the mountains to rescue their baby sister. The journey was told with great descriptions that gave you a nice picture image of what was happening.

That was the only thing i feel was wrong but it is still very worth reading."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"A Series of Unfortunate Events: The Slippery Slope by Lemony Snicket is a fiction fantasy book that is decorated with drawings by Brett Helquist. Snicket's writing makes you cold inside. This book has such outstanding quotes that it makes the story a nail-bitter. Here is a intense quote that Violet Baudelaire states in an intense part of the novel,\\"If everyone fought fire with fire, the entire world would go up in smoke.\\"The Slippery Slope is a book about two children, Violet, and Klaus Baudelaire hiking up a huge mountain in a blizzard to save their young sister Sunny from an evil villain, Count Olaf. On their way up the mountain, the Baudelaire's run into an old friend, Quigley Quagmire, who helps Violet and Klaus find a safer way to hike up the freezing mountain. Having 3 people, they thought would give them an advantage, but little did they know unfortunate events could occur on their way.Lemony Snicket, the author used an outstanding word choice to describe the setting, characters, plot etc. It couldn't be organized any better because his sentences kept on flowing and never stopped because each sentence had an amazing word or statement. Another strategy I like about the author's idea is that in some parts of the book he tells the reader not to read any farther because something horrible might happen in the story as you keep reading. You can tell that this author loves to write novels.This book is so spectacular that I recommend it to everyone because it pulls you into the text and you won't put the unfortunate event down. If you already read this fantasy, try reading the eleventh book of the series: \\" The Grim Grotto.\\""},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"my name is Count Olaf and i have murdered plenty of stinking people, yup.If you are reading the Sieries Of Unfortunate Events (by Lemony Snicket) then you are most likely to be murdered, kidnapped ect(by me, Count Olaf)... bla bla bla and so on.I have been trying to get my Hands on that stinkin' Baudelaire Fortune for 5 stinkin' years!

With such intriguing lines of study to follow and extreme stunts performed with grace by the Bauldinares, I loved each page more than the last.

We also find out that the last safe place is Hotel Denouement.This series is my favorite series after Harry Potter, and I can't wait for the eleventh book to come. Also in case you are wondering the movie on the bad beggining comes out in September or October.( I can't imagine that they could do a movie on all the soon to be thirteen books.

Like King Fortis the Brave, Harry Potter and Artemis Fowl, the Unfortunate Events series is fast becoming a modern classic."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Before, I didn't like the people who said things like,'The Baudelaires are the unluckiest kids in the world! Hilarious!' when they described the books. True, the books were funny. But the main plot was that Daniel Handler was sick of happy endings, and created these wonderfully odd and engaging stories. In the latest book, it comes as close as possible to the quote above (which I am paraphrasing from an actual summary) as possible. You've got all the classics: vocabulary lessons, sadness, mystery (combined with the unauthorized autiobiography, you can spend hours analysing the series-but you still can be surprised, I was utterly shocked at a not-so-new character that appeared), and yes I admit it, there is a lot of humor. I particularily liked the part about the strawberry-crazed, stick-carrying maniac *laughs*But there is also some new stuff. The book deals with some serious issues (and I don't mean dark issues like death, that has been around since book one) like the worries that the Baudelaire's had of them being villains, or that fact that Sunny is more grown up, that make for an interesting read that makes you think and is somehow sadder then the normal unluckiness of the Baudelaires. This is the first book in which the Baudelaire's are seperated and (as cliched and oxymoron like as this sounds, I normally loathe to do oxymorons) it is both sadder then most books yet lightened by more humor. (This is probably due to the fact that the book is over 300 pages long, but any Lemony Snicket or Harry Potter fan will be able to zip through and still want to log online and chat about the new clues you have found out. There are also some new characters (SPOILER! Even a romance in which Lemony tortures his fans by choosing just then to 'give Violet some privacy' >:( :P END OF SPOILER!), old favorites, and a lot of new information on VFD.All in all, this is a great book with both humor and sadness and tantalising clues about VFD, and I highly recommend it to both Lemony Snicket fans and people who just want to know if the books are as good as people say they are. (hint: they are, although I imagine that some people may find them a bit repetative-I don't, but some people might) I'm already wating eagerly for the next book."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"This book is a very good book about the Baudelaire children. In this book the two older baudelaires must get their sister back from the clutches of Count Olaf. As they get through the mountains they encouter many odd things. Some of them are frozen waterfalls, snow gnats and snow scouts. The setting is the Mortmain Mountains. Here there are caves, rivers and flat mountain peaks. This book is a very good book for anyone who is looking for something exciting to read."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Fans of Lemony Snicket will find this latest addition to the 'Series of Unfortunate Events' titles to be equally compelling. The Slippery Slope begins where the last left off, so familiarity with the previous titles in the series is recommended for a smooth transition to this continuation, which tells of two orphans who struggle to find their kidnapped baby sister. New abilities and talents must come into play during the rescue in this moving story."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The Slippery Slope (A Series of Unfortunate Events book 10)By: Snicket, LemonyReviewed by: J. LeePeriod: 1This book is about a sister and her brother who tries to save their younger sister from Count Olaf, a villain. Sunny, their younger sister, secretly spies on Count Olaf and his followers, while she is with them, to see what they're up to. When Violet and Klaus find out where the villains are taking their sister, they have to make a plan to stop them. They find out that they are heading up the Mortmain Mountains to burn down the secret location of the secret V.F.D. hideout. On the way to the V.F.D. hideout, Violet and Klaus encounter Quigley Quagmire, who is the \\"lost\\" brother of the Quagmire triplets. He helps them find Count Olaf and solve a lot of mysteries about their parents. All of the children rescue Sunny and get away from Count Olaf in time without being thrown off the mountaintop.I like this book a lot because it has a lot of mysteries and adventure in it. It was fun finding out where the secret clues were kept and figuring out couples that were written by Quigley's sister. They used all these clues to find out more information about their parents. They figured out that Count Olaf needed to know about the sugar bowl and they figured out where it was but they didn't tell count Olaf.\\" But why would they keep it a secret?\\" Violet asked. \\"And why would they have a secret passageway underneath the house?\\" page 167. \\"Jacques said that the passageways were built by members of the organization,\\" Quigley said. \\" In the case of an emergency, they could escape to a safe place.\\" Page 167. These two quotes show how Quigley explained to them a V.F.D. secret to the siblings. They show how the characters are finding out secrets from Quigley.My favorite part of this book was when they found out that Quigley Quagmire was alive. They were so happy for once and relieved that he was helping them. Figuring out what had happened to him at the Quagmire fire and at the V.F.D. headquarters was the best parts in the book."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"I love these books, fun to read, wild characters, fantastic art work! What more does anyone need for an enjoyable afternoon."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The Series of Unfortunate Events is probably one of the longest and most consistently entertaining humor/fantasies in the children's book area. The tenth entry lives up to the anticipation.Violet and Klaus having escaped hungry lions, murderous hostipals and overly fashion-conscious financial advisors are now locked in a car compartment hurtling to their doom, while their baby sister cries in the clutches of Count Olaf (nice cheerful start to a kid's book, eh?). Through the usual mix of inventive fantasy and coincidence, they manage to get out alive. Now they must focus on discovering the secret of VFD, finding the circumstances of their parents' death and most importantly, retrieving their sister.Snicket's writing is as clever as ever and you'll find yourself laughing more than once. His plot-development skills, however seem to have waned with the last book and he has trouble with anticlimatic plot points and a bit of \\"too much, too soon\\". Still, children will still love the over-the-top scenarios, the desperately likable trio of Violet, Klaus and Sunny and the hilarious Count Olaf and his band of slaves...ummmm followers while adults chuckle at Snicket's wry humor and tongue-in-cheek style. The Slippery Slope might not live up to the promise of some of the earlier books but it's still a fun, funny and often hilarious ride."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The Slippery Slope is the tenth volume in A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket. Having disguised themselves as Carnival Freaks and pretending to join Count Olaf's gang in order to get to the VFD headquarters, the Baudelaire Orphans have been discovered by Count Olaf and while Sunny was kidnapped, Klaus and Violet or locked in a trailer and are rolling backwards down a mountain road with no control over the trailer. This is where we begin The Slippery Slope. The elder orphans struggle to find a way to save themselves and then make their way back up the mountain to the secret headquarters, and Sunny struggles to find an opportunity to escape to find her siblings or to learn more about the scheme of Count Olaf.As always, one book in this series is quite similar to the others, but we learn much more about the mysterious VFD that has been hinted at for several books now and somewhat more about the Quagmire Triplets is also revealed. One gets the sense that Snicket truly is wrapping this series up and leading towards an end (not to mention that book 13 is called The End). The Slippery Slope is a satisfying book and one which should please longtime readers of the series. The fun, the despair, the words of warning, the riddles and rhymes, and the new mysterious about the old villains...all of this is included. If you like the first nine, you'll be happy with ten.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Violet and Klaus are stuck in a wagon rolling the cliffs of the Mortmain Mountains.

Does Violet nd Klaus rescue there sister or does Coult Olaf keep hiding. I'm going to leave it for you to find out.I thought this book was great, I loved how Lemony Snicket kept talking to you throughout the story. I loved the ending of the book because it just doesn't end it keeps you guessing on what is coming next. I think that, if anyone likes mystery or suspence this is a great book for you."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Like all of the recent A Series of Unfortunate Events books, \\"The Slippery Slope\\" contains a story that gives us readers a few cryptic answers, introduces new questions, and contains increasingly desperate orphans solving puzzles by unconventional means, all told by a strange author who enjoys random comparisons and explanations. The plot of this book is different, as in Sunny is separated from her other two siblings, the story is divided into two points of view, and the chapters trade off every so-often; some chapters follow Klaus and Violet while they devise a plan to save their sister and discover the mysterious secret of VFD, while others show Sunny coping with being in Olaf's clutches and trying to become a spy. This book is an interesting addition to the series, to say the least.It must be said that the beginning of this book is dry. Yes, dry. Dry, a phrase which here means \\"boring,\\" a term which here means \\"while I already have read the first nine books out of the twelve I have already purchased, I almost decided to put this book down mid-read.\\" This is because this series has become quite lengthy, so the first two chapters are packed with back story which the common readers of the series are all-too-familiar with. While it is understandable that Mr. Snicket must fill in unfortunate readers who haven't read the other books in A Series of Unfortunate Events, there must be a different way to do it then the way it's done. Show, Mr. Snicket, don't tell. I must say that the book does pick up nicely after the third chapter though, and quickly became one of the most attention-holding books out of all ten I have read so far, a phrase which here means \\"I finished this book in one day while it took me two or, perhaps, more to read the rest, despite the fact that I almost gave up on the book after chapter two, which I now realized would have been a bad idea, because enduring a little bit of \`dryness' is all right, seeing as the other eleven chapters which were quite good.\\"7/10"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"This book was the best Series of Unfortunate Events book because it had more action than the rest. My favorite part was when the children were running from the snow knats. This was exsiting because the knats were a little bit poisonous, but the children got away just in time. What was different about this book was all of the Baudelaires weren't with eachother most of the book."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The thing you will remember the most about this book, The Slippery Slope, is that throughout everything there is only snow and that means that the whole mountain is slippery and really cold. Violet, and Klaus, suffer alot because it's so cold and their sad about how they lost their baby sister Sunny. Also when part of the tip of the mountain falls, and down the Bouldalaires go to the frezzing cold waters along with Quigley Quagmire, Duken and Isorada's lost brother.The central problem in the story is that Sunny was taken by Count Olaf. He kidnaps her and uses her as her chef and asistant. Sunny even has to sleep in Count Olaf car. Violet and Klaus attempt to walk up the Slippery Slope Mountain to rescue her. Then when they find Suuny they can't figure how to rescue her from the clutches of Count Olaf. In the way they find more secrets of V.F.D. and they also meet a man with no hair but a beard and a women with hair but no beard."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"ok,book 10,it starts off really good.If you thought the plot was deep ,prepare for it too get REALLY deep.I mean sunny's with the bad guys, Violet and Klaus find somebody who's supposed to be dead,and nothing can prepare you for the greatest mysterey of them all.....no, it's not V.F.D.V.F.D. is a puddle compared to the greatness of.....THE SUGAR BOWL!! oh god, WHAT IS IN THAT SUGAR BOWL!?!?!!? If I don't find out in the last book I'm gonna go nuts!Look forward to reading this one"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"I started off buying A Series of Unfortunate Events for my son, but I like them much more than he does. This book is packed with action and narrow escapes. I especially liked little Sunny learning to cook while spying on Count Olaf's gang.This series is a fine antidote to the endless optimism of our society. So many people are fixed to the idea that human ingenuity can do anything, and that we do not need to worry about limits. In real life endings are not always happy, no matter how good our intentions are. I wish our politicians would realize that."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Slippery Slope was a miserbale one as always but thats what makes the book good! This time it was frezing cold and I got so into the book I got cold myself.Of course Violet, Clause and Sunny go through a lot this time too! They find incredible ways to escape and keep using their skills to get away from Count Olaf and find out what VFD means.Great book and definatly continue the series b/c this series of book by Lemony Snicket is great! I hope my review was helpful to you."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Now before I begin, I must say that this was a magnificent book, but apparently not for me. The term 'shipping', for those who do not know, is when people pair up fictional characters because they think they would make good couples. I am a loyal Violet/Duncan shipper and always will be, and in this book, my hopes for that shipping were almost completely destroyed. Some people may think shipping is either amusing or rather foolish, so I'm not going to base my whole review based on that one moment in the book, especially since this book had a lot to offer, and because I believe in rating books fairly, so.The Slippery Slope reveals many secrets, the biggest of which might be what V.F.D. stands for and what V.F.D. is. This book starts out much, much quicker than any of the others, that's for sure. Violet and Klaus are stuck in a caravan rolling downhill, almost about to slide off the mountain edge. Sunny is in Count Olaf's clutches.I suppose I could say that the entire plot of this book is based around Violet and Klaus climbing up and down the Valley of Four Drafts trying to rescue Sunny, but I would be dead wrong. Sunny's purpose is actually used as a spy. She finds out about the last safe place of V.F.D. being Hotel Denouement. We also see the Snicket File in this book, and you'll have to read the story to figure out what side gets it, hehehe. Also, some old characters such as the beloved Carmelita Spats are brought back to the storyline in this book.No, The Slippery Slope definitely wasn't the book meant for me, based on reasons already explained, but trust me, there's no doubt that if there's one book you'll want to skip in the series, it's definitely not this one. Read it and love it or, like me, refuse to re-read it, heh."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"I liked this book because it had great details and it had a wicked good story line. I have liked the books in this series so far, but this book is the best book that I have read in the series.In the beginning, Count Olaf and his troupe take Sunny and let Klaus and Violet tumble down the mountain in the carnival van. Violet figures out a way to stop the van and makes an invention. Then they start to climb up the freezing cold mountain to rescue Sunny. Then Violet and Klaus get attacked by snow knats, which are bugs that attack for no reason whatsoever. Violet and Klaus find a cave to get away from the snow knats and find that these people called snow scouts are in the cave also. One of the snow scouts, a certain triplet, finds path that is in the back of the cave that leads to the V.F.D headquarters. When they get to the headquarters, they see that it has been burned down. Then they see a green smoke at the top of the frozen waterfall, which is the top of the mountain. Violet then makes an invention to help them climb the waterfall to get to the top of the mountain. Guess who is at the top of the waterfall? Read the book and find out who it is.I think that fantasy readers would like this book because it is a great fantasy story and some of the things that the people and the kids do in the story probably couldn't happen in real life."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"I my opinion, books 7-9 of A Series of Unfortunate Events were mediocre. The author has turned this around with The Slippery Slope, which is one of the most entertaining and important books in the series. The Baudelaires meet a survivor of the Quagmire fire and attempt to rescue Sunny from Olaf's troupe at the summit of a frigid mountain, all while trying to extract information on VFD from the burnt-out headquarters they discover. This is a book you won't soon forget."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"In Lemony Snicket's The Slippery Slope, the reader is introduced to many new and exciting characters including a suprising survior of a fire, new members of Count Olaf's troupe, and of course, new meaning(s) to the V.F.D. mystery. I thouroughy enjoyed this addition to the Series of Unfortuante Events series, which in my opinion, this one is my second favorite, behind The Reptile Room. The plot in this novel seemed new and refreshing which was DESPERATELY needed. All in all, everything in this book will have the reader turning the pages, not wanting to put it down, which is what I did, finishing it in two days. I can't wait for book the eleventh, which I'm ALMOST positive will be called THE GRIM GROTTO. Happy Reading!!"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"I love \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\" so much! I thought this tenth book was exceptionally good mainly because so many secrets of VFD are being revealed to us. I agree with some of the other reviews that this is not the liveliest book in the series as far as action, but it is one of the most valuable since many of the mysteries surrounding the lives of the Baudelaire children are finally unraveling.I personally cannot wait for the movie (due out in December 2004, based on Books 1-3) or the rest of the installments in this series. I love Harry Potter too, but the Baudelaire's story contains much more intrigue and mystery (no disrespect intended to Mr. Potter, his life includes mystery, but not like the surprises the Baudelaire's have experienced in these last few volumes).I have read the entire series and am currently re-experiencing it on audio book. It is absolutely wonderful - I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good story filled with misery and woe."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The book starts where #9 left off. Klaus and Violet are in the Mortmain Mountains in the Carnival Carivan. Sunny is with Count Olaf since one of his new troupe members kidnapped her.

It is so much better than it's predesessor, 'The Carnivorous Carnival', which i must admit was a great dissapointment and not worth the 13-month wait. This one is moe suspenseful, more funny and less poorly written.I dont wanna tell ya the whole story, but funny and real revealin'.READ IT!! Only one problem with Mr. Snicket, though. It takes him a whole year to write each one. I do not know whether I can wait another year."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The story so far. . . After the horrors of the Caligari Carnival, he Baudelaire orphans have been split up by the awful Count Olaf, with the eldest left to plummet to thier death in a speeding caravan off the side of the Mortmain Mountains and the youngest kidnapped to be his ticket to the Baudelaire fortune and. . . Lemony Snicket has done it again!While Sunny is forced to cook for the criminals and sleep in a casserole dish, Violet and Klaus have found a true friend, a few more answers about V.F.D. and maybe a way to rescue Sunny and get out of Olaf's clutches for good.Of course, this being a Lemony Snicket novel, nothing turns out quite as good as expected and there are quite a few \\"unfortunate events\\", all of which guarantee a book full of read-out loud, and laugh-out loud, dark humor. I hate for the Baudelaires to be suffering so dreadfully, but I can't help but take great delight in thier sufferings, thanks to Snicket's wickedly witty style."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"This is the best in the series so far. It revealed some secrets (and created some new mysteries.) I can't wait for the next book to come out. Or for the movie to be played in theaters. Down below is some interesting stuff you may not have known about The Series of Unfortunate Events.The 11th book will be called The Grim Grotto. Look at the title to see one of the main settings of book 11.The 11th book comes out September 21stThere will eventually be 13 books in the series.All of Lemony Snickets books have 13 chaptersLemony Snicket is not \\"Lemony Snicket\\" real name. It is just his righting name.The movie will have Jim Carrey as Count Olaf. It will come out early December just in time to ruin Christmas (it will most likely come out December 8th)The movies will work like this... The first movie will be on books 1-3, the second movie will be on books 4-6, the third will be on books 7-9, the fourth on books 10-12, and the fifth and last movie will be on the thirteenth book. also here's another interesting thing to think about. The 11th book will be released on September 21st. If you recall the 10th book was released on September 21st last year. Could this mean that the 12th book will be released on September 21st 2005? Could be. Also you should read these books in order, to make them more enjoyable. Thank-you for taking the time to read this review please rate wether it was helpful or not.

Lemony Snicket is a clever and intriguing writer whose books are some of the greatest books I've ever read. If you haven't read any of the other books in the series, start with The Bad Beginning and go from there, so you will understand what's going on in the story.The Slippery Slope begins with two of the Baudelaire orphans, Violet and Klaus, hurtling down a mountain in a trailer, and the other Baudelaire orphan, Sunny, trapped in the villain's clutches. I was hooked on the book the moment I picked it up until I finished the last page. This book keeps readers curious and excited for what's going to happen next. Read to discover how the three children reunite, what long lost person they may meet, how they show their extraordinary skills, and how they manage to escape once again! I could read these stories over and over, and I can't wait for another thrilling, breathtaking story!"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"This, the tenth book in the \\"Series of Unfortunate Events,\\" is possibly the best one yet. We actually do find out what (or the many things that) VFD stands for, and Sunny plays her best part yet. Of course, many other unfortuate events occur, but not without the dry wit and humor charactaristic of \\"Lemony Snicket.\\" We also get to see the fate of one of the Quagmire Triplets. It took me about 2 hours to read, and I was perfectly riveted, a word which here means I couldn't put Mr. Snicket's historical account of the Baulidaire siblings down."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"you have to read this book. it is mysterious, exciting, and keeps me in suspense which I love. I love every single one of these books.It may be the same thing over and over but I still love these books. I would not give anyone of these books under 5 stars.This book it is GREAT. THIS IS A JUST HAVE 2 READ BOOK! I cannot wait for the 11venth 2 come out"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"I thought that this book was one of the best in the series. The fact that Sunny had to be by herself helped me understand her more. But, if you don't like sad endings, I recomend you don't read this book."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"What makes a book interesting is an author's own unique way of writing, and Lemony Snicket could definitely show it! His similes and metaphors crack me up, and it also increases my way of thinking when when you wonder how Violet could invent a way to slow down a caravan, to climb up a slippery slope, or to drag a whole tobaggan up! It makes you wonder how to decode a refrigerator with very fresh dill, mustard, boysenberry jam, and etc. Also, how could a sugar bowl be so important to risk a whole Baudelaire fortune? Lemony once again impresses me, and most of all, I enjoyed the resources and introduction given throughout the book. A definitely GREAT BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"This book is a perfect blend of suspense, adventure, mystery, and humor. It makes you think ' Wait, doesn't that tie in from somewhere in the begining?' You will like the surprising twist. This is a sure page flipper. I cant wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The tenth installment of the \\"series of unfortunate events\\" is a comepletely new and awesome adventure. There are so many twists and turns, it is almost unreal, with a shocking, almost u-turn twist in the middle. Once again, you get more light shed on the true meaning of VFD, but somehow, the organization is as mysterious as ever......At the end, you want Snicket to release the next book more than ever. Not only does it leave you hanging on the edge, but it cuts off suddenly, as usual, right in the middle of another twisting climax."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"I read all of the last 9 books in A Series of Unfortunate Events and really enjoyed them.If you have read the last 9 books too you would know that the last book ends when Count Olaf(bad guy)steals Sunny,the youngest Baudelaire and is escaping in his car while Violet,the oldest and Kluase,the middle,are hurtling twords the edge of a cliff in an abandoned caravan and are about to meet their doom.If you want to find out how Violet and Klause stop the caravan from going off the cliff,find out the mystery of V.F.D,read about how the Baudelaires get reunited with their little sister,Sunny and find out who the mysterious sweatered scout is then read The Slippery Slope By Lemony Snicket and Illistrated by Brett Hellquist.Snicket is very funny at times,he doesn't want you to read his books because bad theings happen to children.(still read them,they're great)Sometimes in the book he tells you to put the book down or to skip ahead to the next chapter.The other thing I like about Snicket is that when he puts a word that kids usually do not know or a saying he explains it to you unlike other authers.I recomend that you read all of the other Lemony Snicket books before you even think about reading this one."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The Slippery Slope is a great novel. I could not put it down from page 1. In the beginning, Violet and Klaus struggle to survive in a trailer gone insane. What follows is a frantic race to reach Sunny and the HQ of VFD in time. ..."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The Slippery Slope was a good book. I have so far enjoyed all of the Lemony SNicket books(except book the fourth also known as The Miserable Mill). Buy this book if you have read the other nine."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"When you go sledding on ice covered with snow you may happen to come across a bumpy area and you may go tossing off your toboggan or when you are skating on a lake you may find an area thats rough and you just might be foolish enough to ice skate over it and fall. But, Lemony Snicket's book \\"The Slippery Slope\\" does not have one bumpy area in it. Lemony's writing technique is very different, doing some research for a project he said his influences were Roald Dahl and Edward Gorey and I can truly see how he got his unique writing style, being both a Snicket and Dahl fan. This book is truly one of the best books in the series I would have to say. Though still favoring the first, \\"The Bad Beginning\\", \\"The Slippery Slope\\" is truly my second favorite!The series containing 10 books now, soon to be 11 are really a piece of artwork from Lemony's captivating writing style to Brett Helquists remarkable illustrations these books are really great.The 10th book starts where the last book, \\"The Carnivorous Carnival\\" left off...When we last left off Count Olaf had taken the Baudlaires baby sister Sunny. Olaf was now heading up the Mortmain Mountains in his black automobile with a Calagari Carnival trailer hitched to the back by a complicated knot tied by an employee. Well who is in this trailer..none other than Violet and Klaus Baudlaire, where's Sunny, well she's in the car sitting on Esme Squaler a thin, snotty, stylish woman who happens to be Count Olaf's girlfriend who's continuously poking Sunny with her long manicured hands. Well when Olaf knows the Buadlaires are in the tariler he orders an employee to cut the knot. Well, seeing how these books are so unfortunate the employe does sending Violet and Klaus speeding wildly backwards in a wooden trailer, while Sunny heads up the trail leading to Mount Fraught (Where Olaf & His Troops Will Assemble Later). Violet and Klaus must do something or they will be dead since they can't steer the trailer, plus, their on a winding road on the edge of a mountain. What will Vilolet and Klaus do? Well, Violet will tie her hair up with her purple ribbon and Klaus will start thinking of research he has done on trailers breaks etc. Well both finally come up with a plan together involving a small wooden foot stool, and manys sticky items including strawberry jam, caramel suace, and syrup. I won't go any further becuase it'll spoil the book but...Some other things that you may encounter in this humorous yet unfortunate stroy are a Large Casserole Dish, An Eggplant, Snow Knats, and a strange Fire Dress that crinkles and crackles like fire? What are all these doing in this description of \\"The Slippery Slope\\"? You'll have to read and find out! And I'll leave it at that!Though this is one of his longer books (337 Pgs.) I read the pages rapidly due to the suspence and finished in a day! You'll read these pages fast and they'll slip right through your hands as you keep going until you finish. One thing I am disappointed about was the note at the end of the series, I looked forward to finish the book and read what the next was called and a little description of it. But, Lemony decide to make it interesting and make you solve a riddle, by going to his website which I think is a neat little change.If you like Lemony Snicket books I also love the Philip Ardagh series as well which are called \\"The Eddie Dicken's Trilogy..\\""},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Book ten in the Series of Unfortunate Events has proven to be as clever, as bizarre and as maddening as the previous nine. Picking up from the cliffhanger of \\"The Carnivorous Carnival,\\" the story opens with Klaus and Violet Baudelaire separated from their youngest sibling, Sunny. Their efforts to rescue her from the clutches of the evil Count Olaf make up the bulk of the book, but the writer mixes in his usual stew of subtle clues, blatant clues, false clues and major twists until the book ends with yet another cliffhanger. It's frustrating, to be sure, knowing we'll have to wait for \\"The Grim Graveyard,\\" but it is a far cry better than some of the earlier, repetitive books like \\"The Reptile Room.\\"To his credit, the writer is redeeming some of the poorer installments of the series by bringing in elements from those books and making them important now. Furthermore, he develops his young characters quite a bit, with Violet clearly becoming more of a young woman and Sunny becoming less of a baby. Unfortunately, he does not escape the trap of his poorly-drawn adult characters. As usual, they're all either evil or fools, with seemingly nothing in-between. Hopefully that will change if and when we finally meet the Volunteers... wherever they are."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"In the Slippery Slope you're filled with misery and misfortune as you follow the sorrowful tale of the characters in this book.Speaking of characters, I'll tell you about the unfortunate people in this book. Violet Baudelaire,14, is an inventor and always ties her hair up with a ribbon when she's thinking. Klaus Baudelaire, 13, is very smart and has read tons of books. Sunny Baudelaire, the youngest of the orphans likes to bite things with her sharp teeth. Quigley Quagmire, a friend of the Baudelaire's is on a mission to find his brother and sister. Count Olaf is a treacherous villain out to steal the Baudelaires fortune. Finally is Esme Squalor, Count Olaf's stylish girlfriend.Next I'll tell you about the setting. This story takes place in the Mortmain Mountains by the ugly- colored Stricken Stream.Now for the theme which is obviously misery. The Baudelaires run out of luck and face misfortune at every turn. Despair and depression is basically what this story is about.In this tale of woe Violet and Klaus nearly run off of a cliff, get attacked by snow gnats, find Quigley Quagmire and the burned V.F.D head quarters, neraly trap Esme Squalor, and come face to face with their kidnapped sister.Overall this is a great book I give it four stars."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"This book is amazing! I couldn't put it down along with the other 9 books! What I want to know is, when's the next one coming out?"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"This series is fantastic fun, and this book, though less zany than the Carnival or Academy, had interesting developments. My only complaint is that the author threw in an insulting reference to our current president and vice president which left a very sour taste in my mouth, and has slightly dampened my enthusiasm for the series. I have thoroughly enjoyed reading each book along with my 8 year-old, but I think politics - especially of the bashing kind - should be left out of children's books."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"I think the Slippery Slope, Lemony Snicket's(author)tenth well written book is great. This book was exciting til the very last word. I personally would give this book five stars. The fourteen year old Violet has very good inventing skills because she makes snow boots for her siblings to climb Mt.Fraught. Klaus the middle Baudelaire helps decode secrets of V.F.D and this helps make the story more interesting. As a reader I think it is hard to be patient because if you read the other books in the series; you will want to know who is the mysterious survivor. In this book Lemony Snicket well describes every bit of Count Olaf's schemes. You can clearly get a picture in your head about how the Baudelaires are feeling through their struggles with \\"Snow Gnats\\" and how they feel when their baby sister is taken away. I think the setting is very good in this story because it relates to why Count Olaf came to \\"Mortmain Mountains\\" and has a lot to do with secrets of V.F.D. Count Olaf and his troupes have very antagonist feelings towards the Baudelaire orphans. They make it difficult for the orphans. Therefore, I came to a conclusion that the \\"Slippery Slope\\" is a very good book and would deserve five stars."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"If you like happy, happy, happy stories, you shouldn't read it. This book is the best Unfortunate story I read so far. It is full of adventure of Baudelairs. I think that Sunny did a lot in this book after getting captured by Count Olaf. She is ordered to make foods which is mentioned good, clean up the car and lots more. In the middle of the story, old character (whom they didn't want to see her again) comes back and the Baudelairs meets the last Quagmire triplets. Snow gnats, new villans, Snow Scouts, many V.F.Ds, the last safest place, and more.

This one is about the three Baudelaires little trip in the Mortmain mountains, where Sunny is taken captive by the evil Count Olaf and his troupe, and Violet and Klaus are left for dead. The two must make a dangerous descent up the mountain, to save their sister. They encountered many things on their way up, including a mysterious friend.One of the things i liked about this book is that the author, Lemony Snicket, kind of talks to you through out the book. In my opinion, it makes it more interesting, and keeps my attention through out the book, because one minute your reading what happens to the children, then the author begins to get off topic and talk to YOU, the reader.A Second thing I liked about this book was that there was numerous amusing thing, such as anecdotes, and explanations of such songs as the \\"Itsy Bitsy Spider\\". I liked this because I am a big fan of anything even slightly amusing, because I myself, love comedy.One final thing I liked about the book, was the ending, each book in the series leaves you guessing by the end. And usually, there isn't a very happy ending, but it still leaves you satisfied. I liked this aspect because of the very reason I stated, it leaves you guessing, and I like having something that leaves me guessing, as I am persistant, and I will try to figure out what happens."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The SERIES OF UFORTUNATE EVENTS THE SLIPPERY SLOPE is a tale about Violent, Klaus, and Sunny trying to escape Count Olaf.

It's amazing, really, how fresh, clever and hilariously warped this series remains after all this time.

Sunny, their younger sister, secretly spies on Count Olaf and his followers, while she is with him, to see what their up to. When Violet and Klaus find out where the villains are taking their sister, they have to make a plan to stop them. They find out that they are heading up the Mortmain Mountains to burn down the secret V.F.D. hideout. On the way to the V.F.D hideout, they encounter Quigley Quagmire, who is the \\"lost\\" brother of the Quagmire triplets. He helps them find Count Olaf and solve a lot of mysteries. All of the children rescue their sister and get away from Count Olaf in time without being thrown of the mountaintop.I liked this book a lot because it has a lot of mystery and adventure in it. It was fun figuring out where the secret clues were kept and have they figured out to save Sunny. In the other books before this one, Count Olaf was always posing in a disguise to fool the children and it was always fun to see what he was.\\"As Sunny said, she and her siblings did not know where to go, and they didn't know how to get there, but the Baudelaire orphans were winding there anyway, and that is one thing I know for sure. \\" page 336 and 337. This quote was very significant in the book telling that they will always showing up during the time of trouble. They always had to figure a way out and get away from Count Olaf.My favorite part of this book was when they found out that Quigley Quagmire was alive. They were so happy and relieved when they found he was helping them. Figuring what had happened to him at the Quagmire fire and learning about him living in secret tunnels were the best parts in the entire book."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The Slippery Slope is a pretty good book that would have gotten a ten if it weren't for just one thing. At first, I was excited about the fact that Quigley was still alive but after reading this book, I was wishing he hadn't. Why?, Mr. Snicket, why did you have to creat a love interest between him and Violet. Well, I'm glad that he isn't in the eleventh book. Anyway, in this book, the Baudelaires head to the Mortmain Mountains to rescue Sunny. On the way, they encounter snow gnats, a toboggan, a stream, and a trap."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"This slippery book, of course is another fine book by Lemony Snicket. There are a lot of funny characters in this pretty funny tenth slippery book, including the two white-faced women and the hook-handed man, all part of Olaf's troupe. Write where the last one left off, Sunny is held prisoner to evil, funny, hilarious and sneaky Count Olaf. Having to do all the cooking and sleep in a small, tiny covered casserole dish, Sunny eavedrops and hears Olaf and his gangs' horrendous plan.Below the mountain, Violet and Klaus survive and escape out of a hurtling caravan, only to confront evil snow gnats. Their destination is Mount Fraught, the highest peak in the Mortmain Mountains where Sunny is held captive. They escape out into a cave full of scouts who sing a pledge, describing them, using the word 'xylophone'. One of the scouts is Carmelita Spats, someone they never hoped to see again. Another is a mysterious person who they soon recognise is Quigley, the third Quagmire triplet. Amazed that Quigley survived the fire that burnt the Quagmire home the Baudelaires are led through to the burnt V.F.D headquarters by Quigley. Quigley tells the Baudelaires a long, long tale about him escaping the fire and meeting Jacques Snicket.More clues pile on and on and it seems too complex.I won't explain them to you because there is too many. Basically, all of these questions haven't been answered, and I assume more questions will pile up to this wonderful series.Sunny of course, tricks Olaf and puts a watermelon in the covered casserole dish. Violet's inventing skills work well for her to create special shoes to go up the frozen waterfall. I would of been pleased if Esme would of fallen in the pit Violet, Klaus and Quigley created. Olaf would have been so angry and mad. Also, two villainous characters are new to the scene. One with a beard and no hair, and the other with hair and no beard as Snicket describes. They were the villainy two who burned the V.F.D headquarters.To the start to the end, this is a good book. The Baudelaires run into luck. We also see another person join Olaf's group of comrades(Carmelita Spats). We also see two depart(The two white faced women). The very ending is full of action, with the Baudelaires and Quigley on a toboggan riding down the frozen waterfall into Stricken Stream. The Baudelaires seperate from Quigley as they go down different tributaries. We know what the last safe place is. Hotel Denoument.Very good book. Most of the pages deal with Violet, Klaus and Quigley finding out more about V.F.D at the burnt headquarters."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Lemony Snicket, The Slippery Slope (Scholastic, 2003)As we approach the end of the Series of Unfortunate Events, I don't want to say that the quality of the books is slipping. After all, books eight and nine showed Lemony Snicket going in a new, and very interesting, direction. Unfortunately, The Slippery Slope does nothing more than coast on the coattails of the smash hit series.It's not that The Slippery Slope is a bad book, it's just a predictable book. The sense of delight and wonder that has been a hallmark since the series' beginning seems to have lost a deal of its lustre, and while it's just as readable as the other books in the series, this is the first time one of them has really left me wondering if the series is going downhill since The Wide Window. Well, it picked up after that; I have guarded hope that The Grim Grotto will see the Baudelaire children back to being, well, the Baudelaire children. ***"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"I liked this book very much. It was very interesting in several parts. I like the way Lemony Snicket describes all the more difficult words.

He took off his facemask and explained about everything that happened to him. That was one of my favorite parts.The two story elements that were the most vivid in this book were the characters and the setting.

The villains, while we never learn their names or who they truly are, are definitely a threat, because they can cause even Olaf to get scared. Meanwhile, the Baudelaires meet up with a new friend who has ties to the Quagmires, two of three triplets that the Baudelaires met back at Prufrock Prep. Unfortunately for the Baudelaires, another classmate returns as well, the bratty Carmelita Spats.While this book has many interesting twists and revelations (we are actually given a credible response to the question, \\"What does V.F.D. stand for?\\", but anyone who's seen the movie has pretty much already figured it out), I would have to say that the thing that shocked me the most was Violet and their new friend making out on the mountain. It just completely caught me off guard.Anyway, if you have been reading the series, you will definitely enjoy this volume. The world is quiet here."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The Slippery Slope was a really good book.I had a fun time reading how Sunny,Kluas,and Violet all make it through a tough time with Count Olaf.It left me wondering where the Baudelaire children and Count Olaf will meet again."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The slippery slope is a book that will keep you on your toes the whole way throgh.Lemony Snicket wrote this book wonderfully."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The Slippery Slope, in the Series Of Unfortunate Events is a book about three young children who are suddenly orphaned. Their parents are killed in a fire, so they are sent to live with their distant relative, Count Olaf. They soon find out he is evil and no one will believe them, in the last few books they've been running from him, but he always seems to know where the Baudelaires are, and thinks of a new evil scheme each time. But as a team, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire always outsmart him. In this particular book, Violet and Klaus have to think of a way to rescue their younger sibling Sunny, from Olaf's clutches. Count Olaf and his theatre troupe have Sunny hostage up in the Mortmain Mountains.This is in the ninth book in the series, and I have read them all. I enjoy reading these books because they are like no other, they are amusing, and keep you on the edge of your seat, I've grown to love the Baudelaire orphans, and each book is full of more surprises. The one thing I don't really like about these books, is how they get very confusing at times, if you are good at connecting things and figuring out endless mysteries, then this book is for you. There are so many connections and other things in the book if your not paying attention you could very easily miss something very important."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The 10th book in the Lemony Snicket series is a wonderful continuation of the Baudelaires' tragic story. It continues to portray the mysteries and struggles the Baudelaire childrengo through. They are still trying to escape from the sinister Count Olaf, but this time around they must rescue their babysister.

The book begins revealing a few details of the mysterious V.F.D. As the Bauldiares just survive a horrific crash they venture skyward towards the Valley of Four Drafts. On the venture up they are swarmed with Snow Gnats. After sprinting to the nearest cave they meet a mysterious boy who knows about V.F.D. As they slowly make their way up the Vertical Flame Divider that incidentally is above them. When they reach the summit of the vertical Flame Divider, they come to find that the headquarters has been destroyed. How are they going to find Sunny, who happened to be right above them? (the younger Bauldiare that Count Olaf had managed to steal in the previous book)In the Slippery Slope in a misfortunate series the colorful author Lemony Snicket reveals the secrets of V.F.D. well at least plenty of them to make money off another following book. Lemony Snicket decides that this is not enough, so he adds his family and other mysterious questions to you head. At the end of the book like any incredible author he leaves you hanging. Like any series that makes hardcover it is now becoming a movie.The book did not receive any awards although it certainly deserves some. What is it that hooks kids to this series? Maybe it's the way the author writes in such question and makes the ends of the books so interesting that people want them to read the following book.In my opinion the book is a ten out of ten star book for it's colorful decription, and word choice that will impress you. Don't worry the book describes the vocabulary for itself. The thing that puts the book on the top is the hilarious remarks that the author embellishes hilarious remarks throughout the entire story."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Here we find ourselves, in a runaway caravan gonig down a slope wery fast. Or at least that's where we'd find Violet and Klaus. Here we are at last.

They are deadly close to unlocking VFD's secret, and to finding out if their parents are still alive."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"This is one of those books that if you were freezing to deathyou shouldn't burn it but read it.

Can't take them too seriously or they might frighten younger children because they have scary themes, but we have enjoyed texting, talking about them (she in Hawaii, I in Colorado), so much so, that she begged for The Beatrice Letters for Christmas."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"I thought that the book* The Slippery Slope* was a very suspenseful and enjoyable book.Here is a summary: Violet and Klaus Baudelaire are a sister and brother in a trailer being pulled by a truck. The driver is their enemy, Count Olaf. The Baudelaires, who are orphans, are in disguise. All of a sudden, Count Olaf's henchmen lean out the window and cut the knot that holds the trailer to the truck. The Baudelaires fall back down the mountains that they were driving up. Count Olaf thought they had been killed and had their little sister Sunny in the truck. Violet and Klaus use traction and a drag car chute to stop themselves. They use the few things they had to bundle up because it was very cold in the mountains. They hike up the mountains until they find a cave with a group called the Snow Scouts, including one of their mean rivals, Carmelita Spats. They find a friend who shows them the way to a place called VFD. The three friends find baby sister Sunny on top of a mountain peak. She was Count Olaf's servant. The three friends rescued her.There are many more sad details that are worth reading the book for. I like the book because you never know what is going to happen next.By Audrey's daughter, Ruth"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Sunny comes into her own as \\"a young girl\\" and no longer a baby.

I'm almost done, however, so hopefully the final book will be satisfying."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Well, I've only just started Grimm Grotto, but Slippery Slope stood out to me as the most interesting stories in the series, introducing important plot development that would go beyond just this book, as well as character development, especially for Sunny."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Slippery Slope is a good book. I would recommend it if you like books that are mysteries. This book is the 10th one in the Series of Unfortunate Events written by Lemony Snicket. I think the book would only make sense to you if you've read the other books in the series. The characters and events that happened in the other books are important to know before you read The Slippery Slope. The story seemed too predictable for me. The book is 337 pages long and didn't have a lot of action so it moved too slow."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"My favorite book is The Slippery Slope by Lemony Snicket. It is a mystery about good vs. evil. My favorite character is sunny. She is a little baby who loves to bite and is always helping them get out of trouble with her very sharp teeth.The author's writing style is smart because she makes them get out of traps in smart ways and she leaves lot's of suspense.I love this book because at the end of each chapter you can't put it down; you want to keep reading. The further you get' the better the book gets. That is why I like the The Slippery Slope and other series of unfortunate Events books. Recommended to all readers."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The Slippery Slope is \\"Book the Tenth\\" in the Series of Unfortunate Events featuring the Baudelaire orphans. Count Olaf has kidnapped the youngest orphan, Sunny, and Violet and Klaus must try to find a way to save themselves as well as catch up to Olaf and reclaim their sister. But they find themselves alone and without resources in the cold and scary Mortmain Mountains. To make matters worse, they are not sure to where Olaf has escaped. First they are attacked by snow gnats that sting for no reason, then they run into the horrible Carmelita who made their lives so miserable when they attended Prefrock Prepatory School. But all is not bad as they meet a mystery friend that comes to their aid and turns out to be an unexpected ally. But will the new friendship be enough to overcome Olaf and his evil henchman who grow in number with every installment in the series?After a stretch of books that dragged, the tenth book finally picks the pace back up. It is clear that the plot is beginning to reach a climax and the story excites the reader to continue. The beginnings of the overall theme are finally coming together and mysteries are being revealed. However, just as it is for the Baudelaire children, the more mysteries that are solved, the more mysteries that evolve.This series remains a highly imaginative and well written series. Unfortunately it dipped in the middle, but it seems to be making a comeback that will hopefully continue right through \\"Book the Thirteenth.\\""},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"This book is fascinating. The precocious mind of the eldest Baudelaire, Violet, always gets them out of trouble and Klaus, a well-read person gets them through many of the mysteries. In this particular book, the Baudelaires embark on a very mysterious journey, trying to find out what really happened to their parents in the fire. The avaricious Count Olaf always has a way to slow them down or steer them down the wrong road. Lemony Snicket's use of words makes the book more humorous and keeps you reading. Although all the problems keep on piling on the Baudelaires, they still manage to get through and rescue Sunny. The assiduous Baudelaires keep you wanting to find out what they do next even though Count Olaf always disparages them. I would recommend this book to anybody. Thanks for reading!"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The Slippery Slope is about Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire's adventures in the Mortmain Mountains. I really enjoyed this book. My favorite part of the book was when Violet and Quigley climbed up the frozen waterfall to rescue Sunny. I can relate to when Violet was worried about Sunny, because I worry about my siblings too. I really liked how the author had a lot of detail in the story. It made me feel like I was really there and experiencing the things the Baudelaires were. I didn't really like how the author didn't tell the reader who the two people were that knew Count Olaf. I think this book was geared towards fourth to eighth graders. Overall I really liked this book and I recommend it to everyone who enjoys Lemony Snicket books."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"I liked this book because you never know what's going to happen next. It always made me want to read further. Compared to the Carnivorous Carnival it was ten times more exciting and suspense building. It will always have you on the edge of your seat.The Baudelaires are able to stop the caravan from over a ledge. They are hiking up the mountain range looking for Sunny. On the way they meet Quigly Quagmire and the Snow Scouts. Quigly leads Violet and Klaus to where the V.F.D. headquarters is to find it had been burnt down. They try to make a trap to capture Esme but at the last minute decided it was not the right thing to do. They later find Sunny the mountain (Mount Fraught) that's above them. Count Olaf is stunned that they are alive and then he threatens to have them thrown off the mountain. Will they get away?The type of person who would like to read this book is someone who likes random and exciting stories."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"According to my 10 year old nephew, these are the greatest books. As his uncle, any time you get a 10 year old excited about reading, then it is a great book!"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"My son loves this series of books and cannot get enough. Excellent writing and descriptive use of the language for this age group."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"This is my favorite of the seires so far. I'm not exactly sure why. I know I'm just adding my 2 cents to $1.25 or something but I just had to say what i thought. Firstly, if Sunny ever seemed brave before, she does now. She has to sit on a villians bony lap while riding in a car up a mountain. When they reach a stopping point she is forced to sleep in a serving dish and make breakfast for villians- at which she shows off her superb culinary skills and Baudilaire ingenuity and resorcefulness. Klause and Violet are facing an equaley uncomfertable predicamint- namely, raceing head-on down a moutian-side, with no way to control the trailer thing they are in and screaming their heads off. This book introduces two new villians- who have an 'aura of menace' and tells about how some freaks who used to be the orphans friends turn aganst them with Count Olaf. It also tells more about the snotty girl from boarding school, the cake-sniffer, and tells about Quilgley Quagmire, and his knowledge of V.F.D. In my opinion, this book is one of the least dark. More of Snickets vocabulary lessons and my favorite part- how Violet, Klause, and Sunny love each other, take care of one another, and work together so well. *So Sweet*!!"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Strangely, this story continues book #9, and this series usually never continues. Even though it doesn't continue, it feels right that Lemony makes more in the series. Weird, huh? Oh, well, this was better than #9 and they are starting to introduce love into this series more. *Hint* *hint* *Quagmire* Quigley* *Survivor* *Hint* LOL. Check out this book, I must agree that the last 8 or 9 books have been making the series better! Definately a good one for your LS collection."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"If you have read any of the previous books in this series and have a stomach for any more I guess you could read this book but I advise you not to if you haven't this is not a good place place to start in fact you shouldn't be intrested in reading this review or even starting reading the series.I've only wrote this review because I've a interest in the Bauldibliaire case but I don't expect you to. I hate to tell you this but I am about to write a quick summary of this book.Violet and Klaus are rolling down a trail in a caravan and could easily go off the cliff at any second. Thanks to Violet's drag chute invention they're saved but still determened to find Sunny.Sunny is forced to do terrible deeds by Count Olaf and while doing that trying to collect information to maybe clear the siblings names plus find out information about Olaf's plan and what the siblings should do next to find the last safe place.But all 3 siblings have 2 objectives find V.F.D and find out who is the survivor.Can they complete thier objectives and more impotantly survive? Read the book(or not if you don't want to even read the title)to find out."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"As Sunny is held captive by Esme and Count Olaf, Klaus and Violet work to rescue her. In the process Lemony Snicket treats us to more verbal acrobatics while still more information is shared about the Baudelaire family, the Snicket brothers, and of course the meaning of V.F.D. Old friends reappear (the Quagmire twins - er, triplets), with old adversaries as well (Carmella Spats, anyone?)In this installment of the Series of Unfortunate Events, there is much less misery than in previous episodes (not counting the gnats, of course), but the mystery deepens even as readers are left with a real cliff-hanger of an ending."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Oh, no! Another woeful story based on the new movie! This book is by Lemony Snicket, the man behind the lives of the Baudulaire orphans. Events will take a turn for the worse when you read the tenth of the orphans' unfortunate lives. These woeful fantasies have become a miserable New York Times bestseller. The illustrator of the series is known as Brett Helquist, who has illustrated for many magazines including the Cricket.One of the many things that ruin the Baudulaires' lives is the cruel and sinister Count Olaf as he hatches his plans with a deadly array of disguises. Strangely, this book doesn't include a disguise as the Baudlaires have fled their once current guardian, a village that has called them impostors and have even called the police since the last three books. The main events are unfortunate as the title states. The way the orphans figure the small but perilous problems are clever, but that doesn't allow the book to have a happy ending. The setting for this L.S book is the \\"Mortmain Mountains,\\" a location where snow gnats inhabit the snowcapped mountains. The unlucky characters of this book are the three Baudulaire orphans. Violet, the eldest, is already one of the finest fourteen-year old inventors the world has ever known. Anyone who knew Violet well would know that when she ties her hair up in a ribbon would mean she is thinking hard on a new invention. Her 13-year old brother, Klaus the middle child, has read an enormous amount of books, much more than anyone reads in their entire lifetime. Making him very sophisticated. Lastly their baby sister, Sunny, who would rather prefer to bite hard objects more than anything else. As an infant, she can only speak in unintelligible shrieks. Although at a tender age, Sunny, like her siblings, Sunny is quite clever. Although the the orphans are very unlucky, their parents, after their death by a great sea of flames that destroyed their entire home, have left an enormous fortune.With a thought, if Lemony Snicket asks you to keep yourself from reading the book, why write it? Anyway, the book is hard to put down. Especially with the perilous problems and the surprising solutions. This title (at some points) represents the problem which happens in every book in the series. Personally, I think the books become more depressing as the series continue. I would recommend this book to people that...well, just enjoy books. Especially with the new movie coming out. Would you read this tale?"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"This is the best book yet, besides the Austere Academy. It is a lot more interesting than the rest, because the sibilings actually meet up with someone who understands them, and can help: Quigley, the last of the Quagmire triplets.Sunny's budding talent for cooking brings a new aspect into the story, as does the little hint of romance.The rest of the books should be read first.I would recomend The Series of Unfortunate Events to everyone, as they are hilarious, and sometimes very informative.Happy reading."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"A Baudelaire child does everything for goons.

Me and my friends started it and my friend is on the last 1 already. We love these books and u should read them."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"After nine books Lemony Snicket has finally run out of ideas on number 10, THE SLIPPERY SLOPE.Oh, he actually ran out books earlier, but at least he was able to get some mileage out of his cutesy writing style. Here, his writing style finally collapses on him. His paragraphs get longer and more wearisome to read. And he apparently doesn't know what \\"fighting fire with fire\\" is. It's a good thing. That he presents it as a bad thing shows he's a city boy. Living in the country, I have often seen fires sweeping across fields and woodlands. At a certain point where they want a fire break, they start fires to stop the flames from devouring further woods, fields, and houses where people live. He should look up what something actually is before he condemns it.But all along, Lemony Snicket has played fast-and-loose with his definitions, which here means that he gives the erroneous notion that words can be defined any way one wants. What sort of writer can do that? The sort who has made a lot of money off writing the same story over and over, which here means Lemony Snicket.He gets away with his tiresomeness in this book by giving away just a few answers and making a few connections in this book. Just enough to drag the children along after him, like a Pied Piper.His next book, no. 11, THE GRIM GROTTO, tries to introduce interesting new characters, but it was too little, too late. He needs a good editor, to cull back more of his bloviations. THE SLIPPERY SLOPE was too long and long-winded, and Snicket (or whatever his real name is) makes the same mistake, and worse, in no. 11, THE GRIM GROTTO, especially with his amazingly tedious work on the Water Table. And in no. 11, THE GRIM GROTTO, he embarks on what must be some sort of personal vendetta against poet Edgar A. Guest (1881-1959). Snicket's favorite reading always seems to be depressing and/or unwholesome poets and novelists, so it's not surprising he would set out to tarnish the reputation of someone who writes uplifting verse.I have (mostly) enjoyed Snicket's series through the first nine books, even though in numbers 8 and 9 he took quite a few stumbling steps. I kept giving him the benefit of the doubt, which here means -- exactly what it always means! Through the last two books of increasing size and verbiage, I hoped Snicket would recover himself. But his mistakes only got worse.It seems a shame that after 11 books I've thrown up my hands, which here means I just can't take it any more. THE SLIPPERY SLOPE was a complete disaster and one is better off not starting the series at all than stopping when the finish line is in sight because the prose is no longer endurable. Thankfully, during the last several books I had a nasty cold (not a Mr. Poe kind, but a real cold) which limited what I could do and kept me bedbound for a few days anyway, so I don't feel guilty about wasting the time it took to read this piffle.I no longer require the answers to questions that have been running through the Snicket series. Lemony Snicket is really Count Olaf. Unable to get his hands on the Baudelaire fortune, he wrote a series of books to make money by torturing children legitimately."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Needed an inexpensive alternative to allow my nine year old to finish the &#34;Lemony Snicket&#34; series that was not available at Barnes and Noble.

Some surprise characters show up, such as the re-appearance of Carmelita Spats (cakesniffers!),and although Duncan and Isadora Quagmire don't appear in this book,readers are in for a real shock over who does!

Really, Thriftbooks? The material on the binding is obviously fragile... : ("},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"This is yet another fine example of Children's Writing. I enjoyed this book. It is full of laughs and surprises. There are more twists and turns in this one than a back country road!My only problem with this series is at times it gets jumbled and over-wrought, it's almost as if you can see Mr. Snicket trying desperately to put the \\"brakes on\\" before he gives away too much. We all know they are trying to squeeze this story into 13 volumes.... (I believe) and I'm sure he doesn't want to give the store away too soon.At times the discussion of certain actions and events go a little too far. As if he is trying to squeeze more out of a storyline than what is really their. At times it goes too far. But not too terribly far!Mr. Snicket has truly, put a fanciful and wonderfully \\"Dreadful\\" world together for these three endearing orphans. As I have stated before you can't be sure whether to laugh or cry for these children.I enjoy the wry, dry wit employed in this series. I also believe the little revelations that Snicket gives us into his own fictional life are brilliant! The whole world of Lemony Snicket is truly intricate and engrossing.I just picked up his unauthorized autobiography and can't wait to crack it open. The more you learn about his \\"persona's\\" connection to the series, the more you want to know.In The Slippery Slope we meet up with Klaus, Violet and Sunny once again and get to share in their misery. They have continued to be in and out of the clutches of Count Olaf and his motley crew of cronies.The story is progressing well and ends with yet another \\"cliff hanger\\"...

This volume describes the Baudelaire orphans' trials and tribulations in the Mortmain Mountains as they encounter various eccentric, well-read, and sinister personalities (not necessarily in that order). Handler manages to actually say, out in the open, details of the mystery of VFD without hitting you over the head with it. Introduction of new (and sometimes unexpected) characters both adds to the story and the suspense. In my opinion, this is one of the better books in the series."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"How is it possible? How can one author pull it off 10 times in a row? Magnificent.

I love the way the books have evolved from the simple first few chapters to the intricit plot we're knee-deep in now."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"great book. note as good as the 9 but still very good. you learn alot about v.f.d. there are also 2 very mystreous new characters. I defenitly remomend this series for every1. read number 1-9 books 1st. READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Slippery Slope #10 is just as impressive as Snicket's earlier books in this series. It has a great storyline and great characterization, much like the Harry Potter Books and The Adventures Of Archie Reynolds. I recommend it, as long as length is not an issue."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The Slippery Slope by Lemony Snicket is the l0th installment of the story of the three orphans Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire. The Baudelaire children lost their parents in a terrible fire, and have been struggling against the evil Count Olaf ever since. In this book, Snicket has the orphans climbing up the Mortmain Mountains where they believe they will find the answer to the question \\"What is V.F.D. ?\\" The two eldest Baudelaires, (Violet and Klaus) have been separated from their young sister Sunny. Sunny has been taken by Count Olaf and is now his cooking slave. The orphans meet up with Quigley Quagmire, who is the missing third in a set of triplets. Quigley is also looking for answers. He is trying to find his siblings, his parents and the answer to V.F.D.I enjoy the writing style of Lemony Snicket. He is very tongue-in-cheek in his descriptions of people and events. For instance, when he describes Esme Squalor, he always has her talk about what is fashionable, even when being fashionable would be the least of your problems. When Esme Squalor is planning to burn down the V.F.D. headquarters, she worries about what is \\"in\\" to wear. I like the way Snicket explains his vocabulary in the middle of the story. If he includes a word not commonly used, he explains right in the story what the word actually means. When a character uses a word like xenial, Snicket goes on to explain that xenial refers to giving gifts to strangers. I also enjoy Sunny Baudelaire's language. Since she is still a baby in the stories, she is just learning to talk and sometimes her wording is amusing. My only dislike about this particular book, is that the story line is becoming too predictable. I have read the other nine books, and it is my feeling that the story should come to a conclusion. I hope that the 11th book will wrap up the story.It would be my recommendation to read this book, if you are a Lemony Snicket fan. It would be wise to start with the first book and read through to this installment. Without the background of the other books, you would not have enough information to enjoy The Slippery Slope fully. The entire series of Snicket books called \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events\\" are entertaining, vocabulary -expanding, journeys in literature. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"This fantastic novel grabs the reader in a whirl of excitment and adventure from page one. In this book, the three orphans must face a swarm of snow gnats, an annoying group of snow scouts who can't think of an adjective for x, and a fashionable woman dressed like a fire, sledding down a frozen waterfall.This may sound strange, but Lemony Snicket's books are all about strange. I highly suggest this book to anyone. Some may think the series bad at first, but, if you keep on reading, you will understand Mr. Snicket's powerful writing.However, start with book one, The Bad Beginning, before reading this.By the way, the clue for book eleven is: \\"Many individuals have the same initials which can lead to much injustice.\\""},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"So, you've finished #9 and you want to read #10, eh? OH, HOW THE PLOT THICKENS!! I almost want to lower my rating, because of how Lemony Snicket reveals just enough information about VFD and many other things (If you've read the Unauthorized Autobiography there will be more than one time where you'll exclaim \\"aha!!\\") but he keeps you drooling for more. Who is this guy, anyway?? And when will the next book come out? Another great installment...finished it in 1 day!So, if you're one of the many unfortunate souls that have become treachorously hooked on these books, this will definantly be a good read! But, like the other reviews said, if you haven't read the other books, it will make little sense."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Oh my gosh I LOVE THIS BOOK!! I am so hooked on Lemony Snicket books I read it in one day! I think this was one of the best books by Snicket. I have the whole series and I never get tired of reading them over and over.PLEASE MAKE MORE THAN 13 BOOKS I LOVE THIS SERIES!!!!~*Emily*~"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The Slippery Slope was a great book. It was about Klaus and Violet Baudelaire along with their friend Quigley who try to rescue Sunny from the clutches of the mean Count Olaf. It was very fortunate for them that they had bumped in to Quigley because he provided a lot of useful information. The book was a great mystery with many twists that kept me reading. The author gave me a very good mental image of what was happening. It was also kind of funny. The author would stray from the story and tell explain something barely relevant to what was happening. The Slippery slope is an awesome book for young readers. I reccomend it to everyone who likes a good adventure story."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Just kidding. Although the author warns the reader amply against reading this book, I don't happen to agree. But do read at least a few Snicket books first, so you'll have some idea of what's going on (this is the latest in a long series).Briefly, it continues the adventures of the hapless Baudelaire orphans, Sunny, Klaus and Violet. The last two are separated from their baby sister Sunny, who is forced to cook and clean for Count Olaf's troop on a snowy mountain. Meanwhile Violet and Klaus meet a surprising companion who helps them further decode the mystery of VFD. They get closer to solving the questions of whether one of their parents survived in the fatal fire of Book One. Oh, and the nastiest girl in the world Carmelita Spats from \\"The Austere Academy\\" makes an appearance. Little does she know, she might soon be in the Baudelaire's shoes - an expression which means \\"in a very unpleasant similar situation.\\""},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"I am a great fan of Lemony Snicket - and his Unfortunate Series. As a result, I expect a lot of his books. His books all are excellent but it reveals only a little at a time. This book includes a very nasty person who returns from book 5, two characters that are so evil that their names are not revealed, and a very tiring Pledge. Also there is a SURVIVOR of the fire. I was so surprised.Anyway, a lot of VFDs appear in the book. The next book's title is not revealed in the author's letter. And many unexpected things happen; well, just read the book!It deserves five stars, but well, Violet's inventing skills and Klaus's researching skills were used over and over again. I expect a change; although there was one in Sunny. A MUST read."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"You should definately buy(or get from the library) this awesome book! Lemony Snicket has the suspense all in this 335 page book!!!!Mr. Snicket can do anything but this book is the best! Violet and Klaus Baudelaire are trying to save their sister, Sunny from the trecherous villan, Count Olf. If you have not read any of the other 9 books Mr. Snicket has written, you should read THE BAD BEGINNIG first."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"This book is amazing! Not only does it have the usual dose of the incomprable Snicket's wit, but quite possibly the best-crafted and most exciting plot so far in A Series of Unfortunate Events. Its infinate twists and turns are sure to give immense delight to anyone, as they did to me, and leave the reader anxious to find out what happens next. There's a shock near the middle of the book that is absolutely mind-blowing--unexpected yet logical. And it shines further light into VFD, and FINALLY, we're getting a clearer picture of what the thing is, what it does, and what has happened to it. Also, where I felt the other books were short and over far too quickly, this one (though it still has the same ridiculously large font) actually seems novel length and gives justice to the story. I can't recommend this book enough! Read the others first, don't take the \\"unfortunate\\" aspect too seriously, and enjoy this one as I did!With all due respect,A Lemony Snicket fan"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Though this book was very anticipated, it doesn't meet certain expectations and in my opinion, not really the best of the series.I think Violet's inventions in this book weren't very fascinating as in the other books... or Klaus' researchings... and I didn't like the fact that Sunny and the elder Baudelaires were separated so much of the time. Definitely not one of the best...But still, it is Lemony Snicket.I read this book in a hour and my head was spinning after it. First someone the orphans hoped never to see again returns (No, it's not Count Olaf, though of course, he's still there.) Then a surprisng survivor of the fire... very shocking indeed. Additionally, 2 new VERY mysterious characters... and \\"the last safe place.\\"SO MUCH of V.F.D's secrets are revealed in this book, but not all of them.If you haven't read the earlier books of the series, you really want to read THOSE first before this one. If you HAVE read the other books of the series, BUY THIS BOOK NOW! I'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as I did.Okay, I'm ready for Book the Eleventh now. The mystery of V.F.D. is killing me."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The Slippery Slope is the latest installment--the tenth thirteen-chaptered book in a series that will eventually comprise thirteen books--in Lemony Snicket's *Series of Unfortunate Events.* The books are the product of Snicket's tireless research into the wretched lives of the three Baudelaire orphans, fourteen-year-old Violet, an inventor, her well-read brother Klaus, and their preternaturally accomplished baby sister Sunny. The siblings are orphaned in the first book in the series: as they are later informed by the apparently well-meaning but ineffectual Mr. Poe, the executor of their parents' considerable estate, a terrible fire consumes the children's home one day while they are off at the beach. The circumstances of the fire are, one must conclude, highly suspicious.Mr. Poe's efforts to place the siblings with a guardian land them first in the squalid home of a distant relative, a uni-browed actor by the name of Count Olaf, who begins scheming at once to make off with the Baudelaire fortune. Olaf's villainous activity continues throughout the series and very often involves his employment of outlandish disguises which no one but the Baudelaires is capable of seeing through. (\\"Some people called this man wicked. Some called him facinorous, which is a fancy word for 'wicked.' But everyone called him Count Olaf, unless he was wearing one of his ridiculous disguises and making people call him a false name.\\") As Olaf's girlfriend puts it in The Slippery Slope, \\"money and personal satisfaction\\" make Olaf's relentless efforts to seize the Baudelaires' fortune worth the trouble: \\"Once we have our hands on the Baudelaire fortune, we'll have enough money to live a life of luxury and plan several more treacherous schemes!\\"Olaf's villainy is a constant throughout the series, and so is the author's linguistic playfulness--his clever aphorisms (\\"Taking one's chances is like taking a bath, because sometimes you end up feeling comfortable and warm, and sometimes there is something terrible lurking around that you cannot see until it is too late and you can do nothing else but scream and cling to a plastic duck\\") ; his amusing verbal tics (\\"a phrase which here means...\\"). There are also hints throughout the series about the enigmatic, rarely photographed Snicket's curious life. References to his \\"pulling aside a bearskin rug in order to access a hidden trapdoor in the floor\\", for example, or to spending months on a mountain with \\"only a lantern and a rhyming dictionary for company\\" slip into the narrative. Snicket is evidently on the run--from whom it is not clear--and so he wisely employs as his legal, literary, and social representative a certain Daniel Handler, who is himself, as coincidence would have it, the author of novels for adults.I should confess that I am half in love with Mr. Snicket, and I would pledge myself to him eternally were it not for a previous commitment of my own and Lemony's apparent devotion to the deceased Beatrice, to whom he dedicates each of his books (for example, \\"To Beatrice--darling, dearest, dead\\"). But I *can* pledge myself to the task of promoting his research into the Baudelaires' lives, and urge you to buy Snicket's books, however filled with horrors they may be, and however much your possession of them may imperil you.Reviewed by Debra Hamel, author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in Ancient Greece"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Where the last book in the Series of Unfortunate Events (The Carnivorous Carnival) left off Violet and Klaus were hurtling down a mountain in a caravan while their baby sister Sunny was in Count Olaf's clutches. Violet and Klaus manage to stop the caravan and start to walk up the mountain, where they encounter snow gnats and the Snow Scouts. They meet up with Quigly Quagmire, who was thought to be dead, and find the V.F.D. that has been burnt to a crisp by a raging fire. There Quigly, Violet, and Klaus start planning how to save their sister.This book, like the others in this series, is one that adventure lovers will treasure, because Violet, Klaus, and Sunny have many adventures, including hiking on a mountain, crawling through a rocky passageway, and climbing up a frozen waterfall. I do not recommend it to people who love books with happy endings and people who love books where the villain is defeated.In this book, unlike the others in this series, Klaus and Violet almost become villains themselves to save their sister, but stop just in time. Lemony Snicket's suspenseful novel will have readers hooked even after it ends, and they will be waiting anxiously for the next book to see what happens to Violet, Klaus, and Sunny."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Some people may find themselves even more frustrated at the end of this tenth and longest installment in the series. Once again this book is more great fun as Sunny is held captive by Olaf, and Klaus and Violet set out to rescue her. Some new characters are introduced, and some more secrets are revealed regarding VFD. It seems strange to say that I missed reading about their misery, but I did, and it's glad to have them back. One can only hope that by the end of this planned thirteen book series, the orphans will find a very fortunate ending."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"I bought these books originally for my son, but I became hooked immediately. I thought this was one of the better of the series. The main story line is more developed in this book giving tantalzing clues to the ultimate denouement. I continue to enjoy Sunny's baby language and my son and I have spent some time with this book looking up the meanings of her \\"gibberish\\". He was astounded to learn that most of her utterings actually mean something. Lemony Snicket is a clever author and weaves poetry and other liteary generes into his books. I also appreciate that this is a finite series that is building to a climactic ending."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The slippery slope(Book the Tenth) is probably one of the best books out of the series of unfortunate events. I do have to admit that at the end it doesn't answer all your questions and leaves you with new mysteries. There are a lot of suprising parts in this book and I bet you anything that there is going to be another book coming out soon. This book is worth every penny and is great I read it in less than a month and it is the longest book out of the series so far."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Imagine that you were kidnapped by Count Olaf and had to do all the chores like cooking, and pitching tents, while you watched him and his accomplices do nothing except try to think up a scheme to steal the Baudelaire fortune. This is just of what the youngest of three siblings has to face in this book which is called, a Series of Unfortunate Events: the Slippery Slope, by Lemony Snicket. It is a story with little bit of everythingFirst the most important reason that this book is so great is that it feels like the things are really happening in it. The author has mentioned that he has been to some of the places that the Baudelaire's have been to. Also that it is his job to record the story of the Baudelaire children. The author Lemony Snicket writes about them as if they are real people. I think it sometimes can be very really realisticAlso my second most important reason that this book is the best book is that it is very adventurous. They have so many good adventures in this book, like sledding down a half frozen waterfall. They also climb up a very long Vertical Flame Diversion, which acts as a chimney and a passageway. In addition this book is so interesting that you couldn't help but enjoy it. When you want a good book to read that has a lot of excitement you need to read this book.Next, the third most important reason that this book is the best book that you could read is that it really helps you understand some hard words, and words that they just invent. If the baby in the story talks the author translates. If you are confused about some big words you don't usually have to worry because it will define some of the harder words. Since this book helps with defining words it also helps you expand your vocabulary. There may be some difficult words, but don't let that discourage you from reading this amazing book.Furthermore, the last reason that this book is the best book I've read is because it is very detailed. It expands with words and what happens in a scene in the story. It has quite a few pages but it isn't really hard to read once you get into it. All those pages Just make the story all the more detailed. Because of this book being so detailed it will keep you entertained.In conclusion, I'd like to say that this really is one of my favorite books out of all the books I've read because the author makes it seem as if the things that the Baudelaire's have been to seem very real. The age for this book would probably be 10 and above because it has some words younger children may not understand. The average interest group for this book is probably people who like adventurous books because there is so much goi g book.ng on that you will never want to put it down. If you did happen to get kidnapped by Count Olaf how might you manage all that work, especially if you were a baby? Find out how sunny did in this captivating book. You will find that the excitement and suspense in this book will make you wish it were longer so you could read more. Everybody should want to read this amazin"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"Reading through the other reviews for this book, there seems to be a common complaint that the latest installment in the \\"Unfortunate Events\\" series has not lived up to readers' expectations. I actually found the book very absorbing, and I appreciated the small changes the author had made to his writing style and the book's structure.Although the series is known for its stream of depressing events and its dark humour, when I read the books in the series back-to-back I get very sick of my heart dropping lower and lower and the twist in my stomach getting increasingly tighter as the Baudelaire orphans experience disappointment after disappointment. Reading the series becomes almost painful. It also becomes very frustrating when no mysteries are solved and apparent clues lead to dead ends again and again. The novelty only lasts for so long. I feel that in this book, the author FINALLY moved away from this predictable structure and instilled some hope back into readers, and thus some interest back into the story. Yet he did not abandon the writing style that makes this series so loved. The same funny definitions and word games, and the author's uniquely despondent writing style, still liven up the story. I particularly loved the Snow Scouts Slogan and, as usual, Esm&eacute; Squalor's antics.One criticism I have, though, is that although this book was much longer than those that came before it, I think less actually HAPPENED. The characters pretty much remained in the same situation throughout the tale. This is similar to the Harry Potter books, which get increasingly longer as they get increasingly popular, yet the added length is only due to a more long-winded writing style, which makes reading the later books in the series more tedious."},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"I got this book the day after it came out, and i must say I couldn't put it down. I read it in 3 days flat. It's 300-something pages and very thrilling and at the end leaves you hanging.

After managing to avoid certain death, Violet and Klaus must follow Olaf's path to the top of the mountain. Of course this is not easy. It becomes more difficult in the face of snow gnats, a troupe of youngsters engaged in inappropriate word usage, and hidden message in a refridgerator.By Book the Tenth, the stories are becoming significantly longer and more complex. One would assume the books are maturing with their target audience. While this happens, some of the charm of the story fades.

However, thanks to Violet's inventine skills, the two siblings are saved, and find that they must now make it up the slippery slope on foot. But when they meet a surprise person along their journey through snow gnats, a group of annoying Snow Scouts, who like to recite a drawn-out alphabet of the Snow Scout Pledge at any moment, and a snowy peak, the Baudelaires, along with their newfound friend, must rescue poor Sunny from Count Olaf's evil clutches, and solve the mystery of V.F.D. before it is too late. After all, one of their parents could still very well be alive.Lemony Snicket reaches highs and lows - never too low, may I add - with his writing, but THE SLIPPERY SLOPE may be the highest he's ever reached with his A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS collection, as it is, without a doubt, the most exciting and exhilirating book in the entire series, and will keep the reader on the edge of their seat from first page to last, in the hopes of finding out what will happen next. THE SLIPPERY SLOPE brings about new revelations in the series, by showing that Sunny is growing up, and introducing a new character - that was thought to be dead.

But this returns full swing to the classic Lemony Snicket goodness. But this one IS a little weird, don't you think? I mean, it's not as unfortunate, SO many secrets are revealed, they meet the fire survivor (I'm not sayin' who), and there are some hidden morals and meanings that some kids wouldn't pick up.

It's the best one since Vile Village!"},{"Title":"The Slippery Slope","review":"The Slippery Slope by Lemony Snicket is a nice adition to the series of Unfortunate Events. In this book, the Baudelaires are seperated in the beginning. Using Violet's superb, mechanical mind and Klaus's amazing knowledge of books and words, they get through many problems. Only this time that had alittle help from Quigley Quagmire- the triplet everyone thought was dead. Quigley had amazing information on V.F.D that he picked up traveling in the footsteps of the Baudelaires. My favorite part in the book was when they escaped from the clutches of Count Olaf and his evil crew when Carmelita Spatz attempted to push them off the mountain. Although there was a tragic ending (as always) that i won't reveal, I know we'll be hearing more about the adventurous yet sad life of the Baudelaires. Lemony Snicket is an extremely talented author who makes it easy to understand what's going on in his stories by using situations that relate to us. His books have opened my mind and made me think about what he is trying to communicate to us. It's amazing how everything he writes fits in so well and all makes sense.

The only thing she had going for her was that her siblings Violet and Klaus were close behind trying to save her and their fortune.This book was great! It had non-stop action which made you want to keep turning the pages. Lemony Snicket pretending to be a researcher of the Baudealire orphans gave the book a unique spin.

Ego reasonably in check (at least by studio chief standards) Medavoy (and writer Young) go into substantial detail on how movies get made, why they usually don't, and why when they do they're often dreadful.Medavoy's perspective is particularly interesting because he's played an active role in the industry since the late 1960's, and so can offer a ringside account of how the business has changed from the counter-culture, director-driven 70's Hollywood to the 6,000 screen opening, watch-the-foreign-grosses film biz of today.No, you won't get the juicy gossip of Robert Evans' and Peter Biskind's Hollywood histories here, but you will find an enjoyable account of how movies are put together."},{"Title":"You're Only as Good as Your Next One","review":"I would normally run from a Hollywood memoir as they are usually self-serving and boring. Medavoy's is the exception. He candidly describes his adventures in movie making over a 30 year span and admits his mistakes as well as his triumphs. Surprisingly, the book is very interesting from cover to cover. Few people have had such a long and diverse career in entertainment as Medavoy. If you are interested in the real Hollywood, I heartily recommend this book."},{"Title":"You're Only as Good as Your Next One","review":"This most interesting memoir of the prominent producer and studio executivewas co-written by Josh Young, a free lance writer. I own the hardback of this volume and enjoyed the photo section which shows the author with various celebrities such as Bill Cinton who allowed him to sit in his desk chair when President of the USA. Mike and his wife, Irena, were guests of the Clintons to spend the night in the White House. Wonder if they got the Lincoln Room -- did he see the ghost or feel Lincoln's spirit?In another was Robin Williams prior to winning an award for FISHER KING, one of his better films, more than ten years before his eerie role in ONE HOUR PHOTO (see my earlier review of this). A third was of the creative team behind MISSISSIPPI BURNING, which he considered the best film released by a studio in 1989. I agree.Mike Medavoy put his distinctive mark on more than three hundred films including eight Best Picture Oscar winners. He says that putting together the elements of a film is a succession of best guesses.Four film companies in which he was a mainstay were explainedin detail as: United Artists' Transamerica;Sony's Tri Star, later changed to DreamWorks;Orion, named after the 5-star constellaion in the winter skies.These three consumed thirty years of his prolific career.Phoenix: (his Independent company) the image was made out of the match strike from LAWRENCE OF ARABIA combined with the gong of the old J. Arthur Rank logo -- very impressive, similar to the bronze statuary of a phoenix at Belmont College in Nashville, TNHe chose that name not because it was rising from the ashes but simply because he liked the symbol, he says. Coming late in his career of working for others, it would seem that he and his career were indeed on the rise again.One of his favorite sayings is &quot;a sign of desperation is the desire to huddle in groups, escape thought, and talk about others.&quot; So, what else is new?"},{"Title":"You're Only as Good as Your Next One","review":"...the flip side of the movie business, that is, this memoir of a former agent and producer. The 300 films he mentioned are scattered throughout in italics. Mr. Medavoy writes extensively of the process of producing movies. He makes sures we know he is responsible for the success of many motion pictures. He also admits no one knows why one film which shows every indication of becoming a smash will fail, while another will come out of nowhere and become a hit. OK, but there is no gossip. There are no entertaining anecdotes. There is nothing interesting, in fact nothing to interest the average reader who is interested in Hollywood. I said the average reader. These pages and pages of numbers and formulas and musings about box-office openings are no doubt fascinating to accountants and marketing people. I picture them swooning over this book. If books could be compared on a scale with movies, one might say &quot;You're Only As Good..&quot; is the &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; of number crunchers."},{"Title":"You're Only as Good as Your Next One","review":"I picked this book up hoping for a nice, trashy Hollywood producer insider's look at the business. The anecdotes are interesting but not as juicy as they could and should be. It's a shame this book isn't written very well, given that Mr. Medavoy had a ghost writer. The ghost writer, Mr. Josh Young, should have developed better transition material between the &quot;and then I produced this&quot; stories. I don't know the full background story on their collaboration but I hope Mr. Medavoy's ego didn't overpower Mr. Young's literary sensabilities. The writing felt much too thrown together as if Mr. Young had just listened to the interview tapes or reviewed the interview notes (or however he conducted the interviews) and then typed whatever came to his head with no need or time for extensive revisions. There are too many malapropisms and badly remembered literary phrases and botched grammar conventions that sound kind of like a try for Sam &quot;Goldwynisms&quot; but that fall hopelessly flat on the ear and display no real sharp wit. (i.e., page 61, &quot;journey to the Magi for me&quot;? Maybe they have a different Christmas story in Hollywood, but shouldn't it be &quot;Journey of the Magi&quot;?). There are just too many small writer's mistakes, and ideas that need to be clarified, and so forth. However, it's a good &quot;popcorn&quot; book if you just want to pick it up and snack on a story or two."},{"Title":"You're Only as Good as Your Next One","review":"Sounds like a man who desperately needs to be accepted by those around him, who have far surpassed him in every way. This is a man who with all his things, his parties, his screenings, his speeches, has created very little. A sad character. The book is self-serving for his own library. It's something to show friends. Just another piece in the plastic armor. A man who if credit must be given probably is an overachiever. But has he personally ever put himself on the line for a film like Wendy Finerman did for Forrest Gump? From this book this guy sounds like he truly cares about himself. Throwing fundraisers so people say what a great guy he is. Nobody will think that after reading this book. Not worth the time.

This will end up in the $1 book bin."},{"Title":"You're Only as Good as Your Next One","review":"If Mike Medavoy never existed, would our lives have been less? Not at all.Medavoy is another of the tens of thousands of hollywood producers( note there are now 6 producers per movie)working in a factory to churn out an endless supply of tripe for the masses.This book-written with assistance-does nothing to set Medavoy apart from the mass of other producers.Had medavoy not warned a seat, there were dozens who might have replaced him .Why are these books published ?To fill shelves."},{"Title":"You're Only as Good as Your Next One","review":"I did not like this book. It was bloated. The author thinks he's Bill Clinton. He's just some guy who made a little money. I mean little because in the world he so dearly loves he is nothing but a secretary. I would love to hear from Sherry Lansing or Harvey Weinstein but Mike Medavoy. A joker."},{"Title":"You're Only as Good as Your Next One","review":"If you like movies over the past 30 years, you'll love this book. It's well written by an intelligent man who saw the industry from a perspective few do, as studio head. The man that writes the checks. Medavoy is pretty blunt about how movies get made and how he managed to make bad movies as well as good.The highlight of the book comes early as he is in charge of production at UA and produces Best Oscar movies repeatedly in his first few years starting with One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Rocky. UA specialized in making artist's driven movies which shaped Medavoy's footprint to stay away from youthful, tentpole event movies throughout his career. From Rocky to The Terminator to Silence of the Lambs you will be amazed at the stars and movies that Medavoy worked with. To further this study of movie history, after UA Medavoy worked at Tri-star pictures shortly after it was purchased by Sony working with Peter Guber and Jon Peters. This first-hand account of the Japanese invasion in Hollywood is interesting in and of itself.Medavoy does a great job of focusing this book on the movies, the personalities involved, and the business side of the industry. He does not burden the reader with unwanted history of his childhood. But he does give great insight into the cultural influences of his job, the intellectual environment he functioned in, and his political involvement with Gary Hart and Bill Clinton. I strongly recommend this book if you like movies, stories of the business side of making movies, or American cultural influences of the last 30 years.While on vacation a year ago, I played tennis for a couple of days with Medavoy and his business associate Arnie Weems. In my brief encounter with him, it's obvious he is an extremely intelligent man. A somewhat reserved man, who showed no real interest in intellectual discussion but only in relaxing and enjoying his tennis. His associate who was mentioned in the book was much more outgoing and friendly. I believe Medavoy's reserved nature is due to the many people who want to know him to somehow break into the movie business so his reserved nature is understandable."},{"Title":"You're Only as Good as Your Next One","review":"My friend gave me a copy of this and I couldn't put it down. Medavoy gives a killer insider's view of what it is really like to run a film studio. If you want to know what really went on behind great films like Silence of the Lambs and Rocky, Medavoy tells you. There are great stories about Robert Redford and Kevin Costner, but the funniest is about Madonna trying to get her first movie. Recommended for people who want to know more about the behind the scenes of movies in the 70's, 80's and 90's."},{"Title":"You're Only as Good as Your Next One","review":"A fascinating take on the film industry from both an agent's/producer's point of view. A number of the films he's had a direct handle in are amongst my all time favorite list and it's interesting to read backstage stories about the process, how these films came to be and how sometimes it's merely the luck of the draw.Kudos to Mr. Michael Medavoy for an extremely well written book as well as a long and distinguished career.His book is enjoyable from start to finish."},{"Title":"You're Only as Good as Your Next One","review":"Medavoy is a character I've read about before, most notably in Hit and Run, one of the most fascinating Hollywood books ever written. He has been behind many fantastic movies and worked with some terrific characters. However, this book misses it's mark--it is really worth 3.5 stars but I rounded down. There are interesting stories--particularly about building a movie company, but the stories are without that depth that the best Hollywood books provide. There are almost no personal details about Medavoy's life--which while he probably wants to maintain his privacy, leave the story lacking. His political adventures are interesting, but more interesting that his personal life? He is critical of people, but in a way that leaves you wanting more. Perhaps I love dirt, and Medavoy is too classy for that. Perhaps he wants to maintain his working relationships. Nevertheless, he plays humble, and probably is. Autobiographies in Hollywood are a tricky genre, but Robert Evans provided a terrific read with the Kid Stays in the Picture. This books has a good stories and interesting moments, but was at times slow and often told the same story over and over. We got the point the first time Mike. I'm not upset I read it, but expected so much more. He has must have some great stories in there somewhere..."},{"Title":"You're Only as Good as Your Next One","review":"Neither Medavoy, his cowriter nor his editors seem to be on friendly terms with the English language. This ungrammatical, repetitive, ego-driven, cliche-ridden front-office memoir nonetheless makes an important contribution to American cinema history. Medavoy was, after all, involved in some of the most distinguished films of the last 30 years. The author's personality dominates, revealing more about him than perhaps he intended. On the plus side, he has a sense of humor and provides ample behind-the-scenes detail."},{"Title":"You're Only as Good as Your Next One","review":"There is nothing simple about being a success in making movies. It is a time consuming endeavor and one that requires truckloads of money at (great) risk. Mike Medavoy &amp; Josh Young make their story interesting from beginning to end and talk more of the business end of films as that is Mike's expertise. There are a few stories about stars, but primarily it is the problems encountered in making and financing a movie. I learned a lot about the film industry which is now approaching an entirely new way of doing things as regards the technical composition (digital and computer enhanced)as touched on at the end of this book. This is an intelligent and interesting book about filmmaking."},{"Title":"You're Only as Good as Your Next One","review":"This book is an excellent book that should be read by every aspiring filmmaker who dreams about making studio movies because it gives you a great insight into the history, inside politics, and the power decisions that go into every aspect of getting a studio movie made.

It could have been longer. He could have discussed more movies and particularly more of the hundred he should be shot for and how and why they got made.

He completed military training in Germany before the 1914-18 War, and received promotion by the Young Turks government in Istanbul. As an Arab he was also interested in the new Arab nationlism rising up in his home country. During the First World War the Turkish government of Enver Pasha dispatched him to Libya to lead the Sanusi forces in Cyrenaica in 1915-16. His capture by the British and incarceration in Cairo led to a meeting with T. E. Lawrence. In Cairo he realised the Arab cause might best be served by Sharif Hussain of Macca and the Arab Revolt the being led by Lawrence. He was released in March 1917 to take command of the Arab regular forces fighting under the Amir Faisal, later King Faisal I of Iraq, in the Hijaz. In 1919, Jafar was appointed Military Governor of Aleppo. He became one of the first members of the new Iraqi government under the British Mandate, and spent the remainder of his life serving his country as Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, and Iraqi Minister in London. In 1936 he was assassinated outside Baghdad. His memoirs, published here in English for the first time, shed a vivid light on the early days of Arab nationalism and on the creation of modern Iraq. The origins of modern Iraq are present in this insightful volume.The great value in this book is not the memoirs, which occupy perhaps only half the book, the true gem is in the introduction, epilouge and also the massivly informative footnotes that give details, hostiries and biographies of everyone involved in the politics and campaigns of the period. The footnotes are encyclopedic and anyone interested in the Middle East in the first half of the 20th century would do well to find this book.Seth J.
