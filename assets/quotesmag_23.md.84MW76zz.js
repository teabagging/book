The book that I will be reviewing is The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton. This book was outstanding in more ways than one. First off S.E. Hinton was only 16, yes I said 16 when she wrote this book. That amazing fact is the reason that I chose this book and boy am I glad I did. Once I started this book it was amazing how hooked I was on it. Every free minute I had I put in to reading this book.The book starts off talking about two gangs, the Greasers and the Socs. The Greasers are poor kids who wear leather and slick their hair back with gel. The Socs are the exact opposite. They are rich kids who drive really nice, expensive cars and where nice clothing. They have many fights but one fight it went to the extreme. \\"I KILLED THAT BOY\\" is the remark of a greaser named Johnny. Although he was acting in self defense, him and Pony boy Curtis (the main character) run away to another toewn and they stay in a cabin until things calm down. This event is the set up of many events to come. Such as a rumble is set up. A rumble is a gang fight. All these events keep you asking why Greasers and Socs are so different and why can't they get along. After all they are both humans and nothing makes one superior to the other.All in all I think that any teenager who reads this book will like it, probably love it. I know that now I will read more of S.E. Hinton's books because if she wrote this when she was 16 then I cant imagine how good of a writer that she is now. I'm glad that is chose this book!."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"IM NOT GOING TO SAY I LOVE THE STORY IT'S KINDA LAME PONYBOY WAS REALLY OBNOXIOUS HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT ANYONE BUT HIMSELF THE STORY IS NOT SO BAD I JUST DIDN'T LIKE THE MAIN CHARACTER HE DOESN'T APPRECIATE WHAT HIS OLDER BROTHER IS DOING FOR HIM HE WANT'S HIM TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNIES HE DIDN'T HAVE BUT PONYBOY JUST DOESN'T GET IT."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders The Viking press, i80pp.,$6.99S.E.

This is and incredible story that everyone should read. I liked this book because it was written very well and it pertains to real life situations."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Ponyboy Curtis is the narrator of The Outsiders. He tells us the rivalry between two across town gangs, the Greasers and Socs. At first, being a Greaser, he only has one image of the Socs, wealthy kids with no problems to deal with. But after a fight was taken to far, everything changed. Ponyboy realizes that maybe things aren't always what they seem. Throughout this novel we listen as Ponyboy deals with rumbles, a bossy older brother, school, and the Socs, and watch him grow from it.Darry Curtis is the unofficial leader of the Greasers, who are known for their long, greasy hair. The personalities and characteristics range in this gang. There's Ponyboy who stays out of trouble and does well in school, and then there's Dally who robs stores for fun and has been locked up numerous times. Sodapop is happy-go-lucky and loves life. Lastly there's Johnny. Johnny comes from an abusive family and as a result he's very shy and fearful. The Greasers became his new family and look out for him. Johnny's a good person and becomes an important character.As you will see throughout the novel loyalty is a major theme. No matter how much trouble they're in, the Greasers always stick together. Leadership is another. Darry posses many leadership qualities. He's the leader of the gang, but also after his parents died in a car crash, he was forced to take responsibility and provide for his to brothers Ponyboy and Sodapop. A last theme is class change. The Socs and Greasers only see each other one way, rich kids and white trash. But after a character opens up to Ponyboy and shows that there's more to being a Soc than he thinks, the image starts to change. The gangs do not become friends in the end, but they do learn more about each other and broaden their image.I liked this book because it kept me wanting to read more. There was plenty of action and I enjoyed it. I think a lot of other students would like it too because they will be able to relate to it. I'm sure most students are not in gangs but the Socs can relate to the popular kids in school who everyone thinks are perfect with no problems, and the Greasers are the kids who are picked on. I would recommend The Outsiders."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders was a great literary experience. Unlike other class assigned novels, this one was very interesting. How so? Well, teens these days aren't so interested in reading novels that take place during the American Revolution, or any other historical themes they can't relate to. The Outsiders takes place in a time period that may not be the time period they live in, but is very close. The novel contains many modern day themes and situations that kids of this time period will understand. There are fights, guns, fires, drugs, romance, and murder. Teens tend to enjoy something if it is close to real life, or something they have experienced. The Outsiders is that something.Set in a small neighborhood, live 2 social groups: The Greasers and The Socs. The Greasers are the lower class guys in town, while the Socs are upper class. These two groups have been at it for years, and showed no signs of stopping. That is, until the main character, Ponyboy Curtis, encounters a tragedy that will change the groups' lives forever, as well as his own. Ponyboy is a high school student who lives with his 2 brothers on the \\"rough side of town\\". Ponyboy is a straight A student, a track star, and a well-mannered kid. But not all is perfect in Ponyboy's life.His parents died in a car accident, and he is a member of the Greasers along with his brothers Darry and Sodapop. Darry Curtis is the oldest of the brothers who could have made it big in college. After his parents' deaths, he is forced to cut college and support his brothers. Darry can be described as buff, big, responsible, and very strict. He yells at Ponyboy constantly, just to keep him in line so he can live the life Darry could have had.Ponyboy believes otherwise. Sodapop is the family mascot, as he is funny, and always happy. Or so his brothers think. It seems that Sodapop can make the sad man happy, and can wash the frown off of anybody's face. Sodapop is Ponyboy's hero, just like how today young kids look up to siblings and worship them. The Curtis brothers are greasers, as stated before. Not only are the brothers Greasers, but their closest friends are too.This includes the brutal Dallas, the peaceful Johnny, the wise crack Two Bit, and Steve.This novel is mashed together by 3 themes: Loyalty, Leadership, and Social Differences.There is much mention of loyalty in the novel, because of the gang members stick together and never turn their backs on each other. When Dallas is mentioned to have been jailed several times in the story, the gang never turns their backs on him, and are not ashamed of giving him the title of \\"friend\\", even though Dallas is the most feared guy in town. Friends come before reputation in the outsiders, and that is true loyalty.Leadership was another major theme in The Outsiders. The Greasers are nothing without their leader, and they fear that they would fall apart without one. There are two debatable leaders in the outsiders: Darry Curtis and Johnny Cadge. Darry is a leader on the outside, while Johnny is a leader on the inside. Darry is a leader, because he is the most responsible man in the gang. The Greasers also see Darry as the toughest of them all, which clearly states their beliefs for a strong leader. Johnny on the other hand, shows none of these characteristics. He is not very smart, brave, or strong, but everyone in the Greasers has a place in their heart for Johnny. Johnny's parents are abusive drunks who honestly wouldn't care if Johnny died. Johnny has never experienced a real family, and the Greasers ARE that family. Everybody in the gang respects him, and listens to his request. Even Dallas will listen to Johnny's requests, and he doesn't listen to anybody but himself. The gang believes that the only reason why the gang hasn't broken up is because of Johnny. Without him, they fear that the Greasers will just be some other destroyed gang. This is proof that Johnny might possibly be 2nd in command of the Greasers. The last theme is a big one that basically IS the book's plot.This theme is called \\"Dispute between social classes\\". As stated, Greasers are lower class, Socs are high class. Socs drive mustangs, Greasers drive their feet. Socs drink alcohol, Greasers drink soda. Greasers have long, greasy hair, Socs have short, clean hair. These two groups are the exact opposites, and continue to fight over their differences. Fights burn on, just so the groups can prove who is better than the other.The book is almost entirely involved on the never ending disputes of the two groups.That is what makes this theme, the most important.This book is a classic, and I'd recommend it to just about anyone. Although this review makes the novel sound like a violent bloodbath, it really isn't. There's plenty of drama, romance, crime, and even humor. I'd give this book a four out of five. I don't give it a five because some events are a bit too old, and a bit unbelievable. Now I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll leave it up to the readers to understand what it is I'm saying.\\"The Outsiders\\" is a great novel that is intended for today's youth, who will get a better understanding of the events. You do not want to miss out on \\"The Outsiders\\"."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Soda is different, different from anybody; he understands everything, almost... He's always happy-go-lucky and grinning...\\" said Ponyboy as he walked from the movie theater.When ever anybody asks me who my favorite character is I always say without thinking Soda Pop Curtis from The Outsiders, written by S.E. Hinton. Soda Pop is a very sensitive sixteen year old boy. Soda's sensitive side shows when he gets a letter in the mail from his girlfriend saying that her parents wouldn't allow her to marry a gang member, Soda Pop. Another time when Soda is sensitive is when Ponyboy, his brother, runs away. Soda Pop cried for 2 nights straight.I think Soda Pop has the right to be emotional because his parents died in a car accident, the Socs never leave him and his gang alone and when his brothers, Ponyboy and Darry fight he is always the middle man, like a tug-a-war match. Soda Pop's sensitivity is what makes him my favorite character."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Have you ever read The Outsiders before?I have and man was I vexedwhen the book came to halt.It just popped up with such bewildering events,describing details,and fantastic characters that I just couldn't put the book down.If you're up for something bewildering, you can always count on The Outsiders. When you start reading the first page, you can't help but to become interested.Then you start getting reluctant to put the book down, until you just read and understand everything.It just gets better and better, once you read chapter by chapter.When it comes to detail, you can always look up to The Outsidersfor an example.Each word in every sentence has such describing details that you can see the moving images inside your head.Sometimes,each paragraph with another event and character, makes you feel as if you're a character yourself who watches everything happen,as you read the book.As when there was a rumble between the Socs and the Greasers or when Pony and Darrel got in a fight. You can just feel the tension!The greatest thing I love about the story of Pony,the Greasersand the Socs,were the characters!Each character was different in their own way, with their own attitude that helped the story move along.I rooted each character until the very end.Even though I have read every phenomenon event,every describingparagraph,and the chapter that told me what happened to the characters, Istill feel as if I'm attached and being pulled to the exciting story of The Outsiders."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Have you ever wanted to be in a gang? Well don't join a gang because one day, you might be dead! You never know when someone might shoot you. The Outsiders, by S.E. Hinton, is a good book about gangs. It made me realize that being in a gang is not fun and that you can die really quickly. When I was eight years old I used to read lots of books from S.E. Hinton, but when I read The Outsiders, it changed my life.This book is about a boy named Ponyboy. Ponyboy is in a gang called the Greasers. They also have their rival gang, the Socs. The Greasers don't like the Soc and the Socs don't like the Greasers. The Soc are a gang of rich people and they can have whatever they want. Socs are also always provoking the Greasers so they can fight. The Socs and the Greasers fight each other very often, which is the part I don't like. When gangs fight, it means that they have lots of differences between each other, like the Socs and the Greasers. Ponyboy lives with his brothers, who love Ponyboy and if anything happened to him they would go crazy. Ponyboy has a friend named Johnny, who is Ponyboy's best friend because they are in the same gang. Johnny's parents don't care if Johnny comes home, so he just hangs out with Ponyboy until he wants to go home. Ponyboy is about 15 or 16 years old and he is always getting into trouble. Ponyboy and his brothers know how to get out of trouble, but there is one day when someone takes things too far.The genre of this book is realistic fiction, and its level is 4.9. The Outsiders has about 180 pages. While I was reading the book, I was thinking to myself, I wonder what would happen if all of the gangs got together for a big fight, what would happen to them? Would they die? I really liked The Outsiders because it taught me how dangerous some gangs can be. I learned a lot of things from this book. For example, I learned not to do or say anything that might make a gang want to jump you. Another thing I learned is that you should not try to join a gang if you can't take what they will do to you. If I had not read this book, I would not have known how much pain they go through when they are in gangs.I would recommend this book to anyone who is or wants to be in a gang because when you read this book, you will not want to be in a gang anymore. I would also recommend this book to anyone who likes violence because there is a lot of violence in this book will really make you think what they are going through."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I think out of all of the books I have ever read. The Outsiders was definitely one of the best. It is set in the 1960's. The popular Socs and the rough Greasers have always been enemies, but they take it to the next level at a rumble. Ponyboy and Johnny have to go through a lot together throughout the book. Ponyboy's parents have died and he lives with his friends and brothers. Johnny has parents, but they could not care less about him. Ponyboy, Johnny, and some more friends are the Greasers and they have to learn to fight back strongly in the rumble or risk losing their reputation.You also learn that the Greasers aren't as strong as they look when it comes to losing \\"family.\\" There are lots of deaths in the book. Each death teaches the boys to be closer together and lose their tough demeanors. This reminds me of the saying, \\"Don't judge a book by its cover,\\" because people can change and grow.Middle school and high school students would enjoy The Outsiders the most. The only thing is that they are many deaths, but overall it is great. Once you finish The Outsiders, there is a movie too. I think the movie is just as good as the book. There are some parts of the movie that are different though. This one of the best novels I have ever read. We read it as a class, and most of our grade loved it.-Madison Broussard"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"My daughter was required to read this book for school. Despite her dislike for being told what to read, she found that she really enjoyed the book and actually ASKED for more by the same author! We have since purchased 3 more, all of which were well received.Its a great story line, keeps the reader interested, and pulls a child into the story so they are rooting for characters and understanding different points of view that they might have never been exposed to in their own lives.A true classic!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"\\"When I stepped out into the bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie house, I had only two things on my mind: Paul Newman and a ride home.\\" This is how S.E. Hinton begins her heroic story with a theme of friendship and belonging entitled The Outsiders.This fiction book is about a fourteen year old kid named Ponyboy Curtis. He is in a gang called the greasers with his two older brothers. They are called greasers because they use a lot of hair grease. His older brother, Darry, takes care of him and his other brother, Sodapop, because their parents are dead. They live in a beat-up house in the middle of the city and get into fights with other gangs for fun. But in one fight a kid in Ponyboy's gang, named Johnny, kills another kid in self-defense. He and Ponyboy run away and hide in an old rundown church. Do they get caught? You might just have to read the book to find out. As the story goes on Ponyboy isn't as afraid of the other gangs and learns to stand up for himself.I would recommend this book to people who like action and suspense. Here is an example of the drama from page 5 of the text. \\"They walked around slowly, silently, smiling. 'Need a haircut, greaser?' The medium-sized blonde pulled a knife out of his back pocket and flipped the blade open. I was backing up, away from that knife. Of course I backed right into one of them. They had me down in a second. I faught to get loose but they tightened their grip on me and slugged me a couple of times.\\" If books were rated like movies, I would give The Outsiders four out of four stars!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Om my son's wish list for Christmas.

I recommend this book because this book will get kids not to fight.This starts out talking about three main boys that lived in a house trying to make ends meet. There names are Darry, Pony boy, soda. There three best friends trying to just get by and on the way they got into mischief.The setting of this takes place mostly outdoors. It is mostly outdoors because they don't have any place to live except their car. They always get into fights with other people who live on the streets to. Some time they don't get caught by the police.They would be like family because they where like brothers. They would look after each other. They where good friends never fought with each other always people that start fights with other them.

So hard to believe, yet it has staying power because of some timeless themes and teenage angst.It was a fantasy world, no question. Three orphaned brothers living together with a bunch of friends who seem to have absent or apathetic parents all clustered together to live their \\"tough guy\\" male bonding. They seem to have no cares but to have a good time and posture at the local hangouts. They discover that although they do not have all the material things or appear like the socs, they are all similar underneith. And, like a lot of people in their youth, they aspire to leave their own city and go someplace else where they can start afresh and there will be no problems or having to answer to any social pretense. Alas, they do this and it's a continuation of their jaded pasts only more lonely. I think Ponyboy and Johnny experienced that when having to hide out in the abandoned church in the country.It would be foolish, if not downright nieve, to assume that part of the appeal of this book was not fostered by the accompanying movie version. Patrick Swayze, C Thomas Howell, Ralph Macchio, Emilio Estevez, Rob Lowe, Tom Cruise, Matt Dillon and all ushered in every pubescent girl's bedroom decor. Be still our hormones.

A dull, 192-page mediocrity that thousands of American schools appear to have seized and decided to hold up as one of the greatest works of American literature.I love literature. I want Americans, especially young ones like myself, to appreciate it as well. And trust me- making our children read rubbish like this is probably not going to help. However, if our children must read rubbish literature, let them read books at least as good as this. Because there is worse. Much, much worse.Maybe you have to be a bigshot English professor to appreciate this book. Maybe you have to be a pompous \\"Top 1000\\" reviewer. Maybe you have to come from the setting and lifestyle it describes. I'd have been inclined to kill somebody who started calling everybody around me \\"Sodapop and Pony Boy\\". Names like that, in the schools I went to, were insults. Not cute nicknames or badges of honor. I never, ever lived in a neighborhood where the poor kids and the rich kids routinely beat the **** out of each other in \\"rumbles\\". Why was anyone even mildly surprised when somebody got killed in the middle of all this? I mean, seriously now.I think my biggest problem with this book is that what it ultimately seems to be trying to tell me is a message that I already learned a long time ago, and was rather annoyed to have to sit around for hours in English class being told it again. The whole book, I believe, is best summed up by the film version, in which a girl who runs with the Socs- whatsername- tells Pony Boy, \\"Things are rough all over\\" in that wonderfully generic Southern accent of hers. Things are rough all over? Really? I never could've figured that out had I not read \\"The Outsiders\\". S.E. Hinton is above average in my mind, and certainly has skill as a writer. But in some cases, the ability of a writer can be discerned from looking at their whole career rather than one book. Besides this one, can you think of a single other book S.E. Hinton has written? It's been over twenty years, and though I do know she's written some six or more books in total, I can't name any of the others.But I concede that, unlike \\"The Pearl\\" and \\"Brave New World\\" it may have some merit. Even if I can't see it. But among \\"coming of age\\" novels, there is better than this. And if the stuffy old English professors- or whoever it is- that keep making public school children read this kind of stuff would get their heads out of the clouds, stop yammering about \\"coming of age\\" and \\"socioeconomic issues\\" and so on and actually think about finding a way to turn students toward literature instead of away from it, America could make a lot of progress. And books like this would collect dust on the shelves where they belong. Or, they would spend less time in the hands of numerous resentful students and more in the hands of fewer interested students. I love literature too much to want someone to have a bad time reading a book. So if anybody, especially a high school student, happens to read this book and like it I'm glad for it. S.E. Hinton is not as good a writer as Shakespeare, Stephen King, Harry Turtledove, or my favorite writer of all time, Pat Conroy. Those writers have written far more famous works than just one, and surpass Hinton's skill in writing quite solidly. But even if no other book she has written ever become famous, this one has and despite my believing it to be mediocre is worth a look.One final note- remember this even if you forget everything else I wrote above- say a review was helpful, or that it was not, based on the quality of the review. Not whether you agreed with their assessment or not."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"It excites me that so many students have found this book so enticing and satisfying as a reading experience, but my excitement has everything to do with the act of reading, and not this specific book. I'm glad a book turned them on this much, but I hope they move on to better books, less insulting ones, and I hope other teachers feel this way, too. Look at some of the low reviews--by both kids and adults, and you'll see that there's a great deal of divided opinion, and not just because the book was the dreaded \\"assigned reading\\".The Outsiders is an absurdly weak novel. It is almost artless in its prose, and yet Hinton doesn't supply us with persuasive grittiness in its place. The tough scenes are tough because the book wants them be so, and because the facts of death and guilt have impact on us--but not because Hinton successfully locates the real, grinding forcve of these happenings. So we have a book that just lacks expressive force, making it at most a series of sometimes engaging incidents. The characters and dialogue are problems, too. Hinton's teeage kids alternately fail to see some of the most manifest, obvious meanings behind some circumstance and then fill a whole page with insight after insight about each other and the discriminatory society they inhabit. Near the end, in the course of a couple pages, we get a whirlwind of family revelations as Ponyboy understands something about Darry because of a little shouting match and then Darry and Ponyboy realize something about Sodapop's family anxieties. The rush of these sudden epiphanies makes them hasty and unconvincing, and the fact that Hinton was a teenager when she wrote it is a problem, not a justification.It isn't even clear that the book has compassion for its own characters. In the flashback that tells of Johnny's bad mauling by Soc kids, the other greasers show up (they always seem to know where to find each other immediately after something awful has happened) and they just sit around listening. So Johnny's supposedly gut-wrenching pain becomes merely a cause for character conversation, and that flashback just leaves him there bleeding, in the company of friends. He is the novels' maudlin spectacle. Frankly, Dally is dangerous because the book keeps saying so, not because the book really demonstrates or illustraes a dangerous quality in him. Many of the characters are just indistinguishable guys with unrevealing dialogue or action; they lack definable individuality.The theme of being judged by appearances has been done better in almost every work of fiction I have ever encountered. Heck, I read my own children a funny, spirited picture book called \\"I Stink,\\" about a garbage truck, and that offers the topic more useful examination than this does. The unremitting suffering and misuderstanding and misdirection these charcaters undergo in Hinton's novel is more punishing and melodramatiuc than revealing. The book is simply substandard reading that satisfies the way a bad summer movie does, and it cares about that much for its characters and is about as insulting to its readers."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Shipping took longer than I expected but the book condition was as I expected for a new book"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"hi,um yeathis book is not very good, b/c it is boring b/c i dont like it and b/c i dont like to read. and also it is just boring and not a good book. so you people that like this book keep reading it but please shut up bout it. haha. thanks for reading this.goodbye*~Melissa~*oh yeadont forget,i have selective hearing.

Some of the themes in the book is to stay gold, and alawys stick together as a family. The background of the book is the two gangs constantly fighting. They normally fight over little things, such as walking their girlfriends home so they were safe. They also have rumbles which is almost the same as fighting only a little worse.

What the auther did well was portray that not everybody in a gang is a \\"thug\\",like darry and pony, they are really smart even though they live in the hood.It's a really amazing peice of literature, it's message to me is \\"theirs not just white and black, the world is painted in shades of gray.\\""},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The title of this book is, The Outsiders, written by S.E Hintion; she wrote when she was 17.

Hinton ZMB"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The author of this book was S.E Hinton and the title was The Outsiders. I would say that this book was a realistic fiction becuase it didn't happenbut, it could have. The theme of the novel I think was friendship and loalty.This book was filled with excitement. There were gang fights, murder, fires, runaways, and death. Once you get into this moving story, you can't get out.Not only is this book exciting it also has depth and has heart. This book shows how teenagers deal with the daily troubles of social groups. Teenagers can relate and parents will be intrigued. This book opened my eyes to a whole new world, hopefully it will touch you, too.I would highly recommand it for people of any age to dive into this novel about the crime of gangs."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"According to the main character ponyboy, there are two kinds of people in the world greasers and socs.Greasers are the less fortunate crowd.

Johnny is the other main charecter. He is abused by his parents and is the Greasers pet. Dally is the toughest greaser. Two-bit is the joker of the group.

My final thought is that this book was boring!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This story is to much dark.I read all story,but there's no one's fun and happy.And this book,in killing story,narcotic.It looks like American crime story."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a book written by S.E. Hinton. SHe wrote this book about teenagers in her neighborhood. This book is nothing that any of todays children can realte to. The Greasers are a gang they are composed of Two-Bit ,Dally,Johnny,Darry,Soda Pop,and Pony boy. Their rival gang is the socs.This book is not what teenagers can not even relate to. The main character Ponyboy, yes that is his real name, has family problems. Both of his parents are dead and he is raised by his brothers Soda Pop , another real name, and Darry. Darry and Soda Pop both dropped out of school to give Pony Boy a chance at a better life. Johnny is an abused child who no one loves. His \\"real\\" family is the Greasers . Dally and Two-Bit are tough, not because the book portrays that but because all lthe author ever saids is Don't mess with Dally because he grew up on the streets of New York City. He does not do anything tough the whole book. Except when he is over run by grief and wants to die . He robs a conveinent store and when the police find him he turns a broken gun on the police. They of course shoot him.The Socs are the rival gang. They dont like the Greaers because they put Grease in their hair. So because of the way they do their hair the Socs attack and some times kill the Greasers. I having a teenage daughter know that this book is nothing like any teens life. A child is ridiculed in school because of the way they dress but you could never die because of it. So one night Darry hits Pony Boy and Johnny run away to a church. Dally helps them run away , yea thats real tough, and tells them how to lay low. When they leave the church with Dally to go to the Dairy Queen the church catches fire and children are trapped inside. Johnny and Pony Boy risk their lives to save them. Johnny breaks his back while trying to save these children. Johnny refuses to see his mother and only wants to see the gane because his mother hated him. If I was dying in a hospital and I hated my mom I would want to tell her I loved her before I couldn't tell her any more.Pony Boy starts to fail English and he writes this book so he can pass. The End....I don't really see where this book went. The author wrote it when she was a teenager, but it still does not change the fact that this was npt really a book . It was more like the prolouge.Many teachers force their Sudents to read this book and they often enjoy it because of the violence . I don't think this book should have been published. It was not well written because the Greasers don't think about life like teenagers will. Instead they have page long analysis's about why they are he way they are. Like Dally ,who the author claims is so bad because he has been to juvie,is said to be bad because he grew up in New York City and had a hard childhood. A child would see this as he wanted attention because if his behavior was because of his upbringing then why is he nice to his friends if he was a horrible person. The author portrays that the Streets of NEw York are so bad to live on, but I don'tsee how where the Greaers were living was so much better."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The main character is Ponyboy.

Since Johnny was wanted for murder the only thing Pony and Johnny could do was run away, that's what they did while they waited for Dally (a greaser) to come rescue them. Pony and Johnny stayed in a church while they waited. They had to disguise themselves so Johnny and pony cut off their hair and Pony bleached his. Finally when dally came he took Johnny and Pony out to eat. When they were all done and they got back to the church, the church was in flames with a couple of children in there.

Now it is 25 years later and I re read it and I still don't like it. The main protaogonsit in the book is a guy called Ponyboy(!!!) Curtis who belongs to a gang known as \\"greasers\\" i.e.dopey working class tough teenagers who wear leather jackets and smoke too much. What is even worse is that his brother's name is Sodapop Curtis!!! One has to wonder if their parents had a malicious streak in giving them such odd names.Ponyboy is a sensitive, caring teenager who loves sunsets and likes to read. One gets the impression that Ponyboy would last about 5 minutes on the Mean Homeless Streets of New York City.Ponyboy's best friend Johnny kills a member of the Upper Middle Class ( known as 'Socs\\") and they are on the run from the Law.It is kind of sad that none of the losers depicted in this book ever realize that they are fighting a System that was designed not to be beaten.There is another character worth mentioning in the book, namely a girl called Cherry Valance who is is a member of the Socs and yet is strangley attracted to one of the young tough guys in the greaser gang. No doubt Cherry will grow up to be a \\"Professional Victim\\" and marry an mean alcoholic who beats her up every night.If you like reading about Rampant Teenage Hormonal Desires and Violence then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Let me just say this a bluntly as possible: The book stunk. It seems to scream that violence and smoking is ok. In addition, no one can relate to the characters. They wear lots of hair gel and leather jackets. They beat people up. They smoke.

In todays society with all the broken families, the subject rings true; there are many more kids out there raising each other than one might suspect. Even a child of a single parent will also be drawn into this book. If you get it on the Kindle edition, you might want to go through it first and highlight the slang words -- then make notes for your kids- who might not know what a \\"heater\\" is. The built in dictionary will not help with the slang. My son read this book in about two weeks, which for him is really really good. It is hard to get him to read anything longer than a magazine article. We bought the Kindle edition, and he was hooked within a few \\"pages\\".There are some unsettling topics covered, but it was not a drawback; it actually helped spark discussion about what makes a family, and why some older siblings might choose to raise their younger siblings if they felt it was necessary."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"When I first heard about this book, I was at school.

Happy Reading!!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders and Rumblefish are films which I really loved and which came at a rather an impressionable age for me - late teens and hungry for life and cultural experience.I'm not sure why it didn't occur to me to go and read the books, but I didn't. I suppose I've always been more likely to see a film based upon a book I've read than the other way around.The good news for me with this read is that the images I held from the film didn't haunt my reading at all, the book doing all the work on that score.The Outsiders is a great title. It has roots in the way I felt when I saw the film and, strangely, the way I feel about myself now.It's the story of gangs polarised by economic and social divides told from the point of view of one of the poorer kids (ie Ponyboy the Greaser).Ponyboy's a great character. He's immersed in the culture of the gang and its codes, yet he's open-minded enough to be able to rise above it and see the bigger picture. As he eventually discovers, everyone has it tough in some way or another.Through a logical progression of experiences, Ponyboy finds himself in the hands of the Socs (the rich gang), hands which force his head underwater at a fountain until his friend saves him by killing the aggressor.Ponyboy and Johnny (the knifer) go on the run and there follows an exploration of their values and the vulnerability of their situation in life.I won't go any further regarding the plot. All I'd like to say is that it opens up beautifully and even when it closes down it still leaves space for thought and reflection.You'll probably know that the author was only a teenager herself when she wrote the book. Sometimes it shows through and I wonder if I made any allowances for that fact. I think the book's also written for a young audience of readers ready to explore the world and who want to suck up life's experience - I also wonder if I made allowances on that score.I think that, in the end, it's such a great read that I did forgive it for any flaws or cracks in the way it's written. It does force me to ask a lot of questions about writing, too.There are passages in The Outsiders that I'd want to be editing or changing or taking out and there are rules broken here that I try to stick to in my own work. And then again, who the hell am I to be suggesting changes to this modern classic? The best thing to do with this book is too leave it exactly as it is.SE Hinton has done something very right in this tale. I was completely engrossed to the point of me stir-frying vegetables with one hand and holding the book in the other because I didn't have it in me to stop reading when I should have.I found myself fully engaged emotionally and loved the characters and the setting. There's often a tension as the story moves forward that means that getting to the next page or next chapter is essential.There are questions that are asked and left hanging, there's style and cool, there's the exploration of what it means to be part of friendship groups and of why teenage boys sometimes do the things they do (even more impressive in a sense that the author wasn't one herself).Above all, it's the voice of the book that is utterly captivation.It's consistent and full of wonder and bewilderment as a teenager's might be.When I was half way through the book, I was so happy in my reading that I went to the computer and ordered a copy of Rumble Fish. By the end, I'd placed an order for That Was Then, This Is Now. I think that says a lot about the way I feel about the Outsiders, as it does that I can't wait for those books to arrive through the post.A fabulous read."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is a truly inspirational book it really is my favorite book and made me think a lot and i honestly think it changed the way i look at things."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Great storryy amazing i would suggest it for any one that loves clique s book i loved it i had to read it for a school reading assignment but ended up loving it !!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"my 8th grader needed it for school,but wasnt allowed to bring it home,then we had to take a unplanned trip to florida.not only did she enjoy the story she loved the fact that if we werent at the hotel she could continue her reading on my iphone kindle app.so great story great electronic delivery"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Iwas in 5th grade the first time I read The Outsiders and at 22 it is still my favorite.

I am thrilled that it appears on so many school reading list."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It told of problems that teenagers don't think about, things like how people in a different social class get treated. I know from experience the way different groups get treated. I used to hang with what we call the preps (Socs) then somthing came over me one day and I didn't like to hange with them anymore so I started to hang with the black jackets (greasers) I know how the cops treat each group different, how people in the school even treate you different. The preps are liked and the black jackets are not. Younger students are afraid of us and we don't do anything to them. The teachers even treat us different, as if we are no good for anything. I use to think that the black jackets where a terrible group to be with, but that was before I knew them and they have feelings as well maybe just don't like to show how they feel sometimes. This book expresses things that some people can relate to and I am one of them. It makes you think about how you treat people that are in different groups. Sure the group I hang with now likes to drink and party abd the preps go home and study but at least I am having fun and the preps use to judge people because they didn't do good at school and stuff like that but black jakets don't do that. Thats why I hang with them and the book lets us see things about different groups and things like that"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I think that this book is alright.

This book was one of my favourites of all time!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The book &quot;The Outsiders,&quot; though written when S.E. Hinton was but 16 years old is an emotional tale of a group of teenagers growing up on &quot;the wrong side of the tracks.&quot; Growing up, the story's main character and narrator, faces adversity from his enemies, the socs, and even his teachers. After the main character's parents die, his older brother Darry is forced to work to provide. When Ponyboy's best friend kills a soc, they must flee their town. The suspense S.E. Hinton puts in this novel is great. There are many hidden meanings. You, as the reader, must take it for as you read it. Some may think that the book was purely entertainment, while yet another may get a life lesson from it. &quot;The Outsiders&quot; is a truly great book good for all people of all ages.

The thing about it is that the I wish it could have lasted longer but it didnt."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I've seen the movie a dozen times. I was Ponyboy's age when it came out, but I had never read the book. I wondered how a 15 year old could write something so well it would be considered for the \\"big screen\\". Well, it's now years later and I just read the book, and now I have my answer. S.E. Hinton sheds light upon differences not only in classes at school but social classes as well with her well written story. Even though I am in my thirties now I can still relate to it all as if I was young again. A major thing I learned as I've become older is no matter what kind of clothes we wear, songs we sing, or crowd we run with, we're not that different from one another even if we do appear to be. If you're young and want to give this book a try, please do and read it with an open mind and heart. Although we might not ever think of putting grease in our hair these days the message should still be a valid one that Ms. Hinton delivers: Stay Gold!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"\\"The Outsiders\\"Wow! Reading the book and later watching the movie... Oh my God it was awesome. The book written by S. E. Hinton was a piece of art anyone would like to read, as well as the movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola. This last week I just watch the movie of the outsiders, and I really think it was awesome. The actors from the movie acted really well, they were \`tuff,' as the S.E. Hinton described them in the book. Each character acted in his/her own way, as the book described them. I loved the way Dally, Johnny and Ponyboy acted, they were very in with their personalities. I think Francis Ford Coppola, chose the correct people to act in his movie. The setting and plot of the movie really matched with the book. I imagined the scenes just as S.E. Hinton described them; but some things I think that didn't match a lot were Darry, Sodapop, and Ponyboy's home. It was different as I thought it was. I thought their house would be smaller, and more humble. Things went OK with the characters personalities, but I though they could match better. For example, I imagined Two-Bit \`tuff' and so different as he really is.The book and the movie matched a lot; just for little details it didn't. At the beginning and at the end of the movie, we can see that Ponyboy is writing an essay; for the other part, this happens just at the end. When Darry is angry with Ponyboy, in the book Darry slaps him, but in the movie Darry pushes Ponyboy. In the movie Ponyboy becomes blond because they needed to change their way of looking for the cops not to find them. In the book it says that Ponyboy sleeps while they were in the train, while in the movie he didn't. Also, when Johnny and Ponyboy are going to the church, Ponyboy asks a man that were is the church located; in the movie he doesn't. Another thing was when Dally wanted to rob the store. In the Movie he goes to a normal store with magazines and other stuff; while in the book he goes to a grocery store.I think that the book is better. This is because characters were really well described and the book gave you a much clear idea of how things are in the world of Greasers vs. Socs. I give this movie a rating of 3, I thought things were going to be better and that the movie would be better described. This activity helped me a lot to have a clear idea of how both things were.*Carolina Cant&uacute; Rosales"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"this is the best book and you have to readit and see the movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! if you dont youll miss out on so much! i so highly recomend it. it portrays the life3 of a teen so perfectly its scary!11 btw my email is [...]if thers any Q's about the book!!!!!!!!1"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is such a good book about gangs, friendship, and doing whats right.

I read it like a month ago for the first time for my eighth grade english class, and I was amazed at how i had never bothered to read it before, that's how good I thought it was.

This book is very easy to get into and VERY hard to put down in the middle of it! This is kind of for a classic book report thing but I would not consider this a &quot;classic&quot; because the way I define classic is a very boring book that must be read just because its a classic and lots of people have read it. A normal classic I'll read once and say &quot;phew, at least I won't have to read it another time now that I know what it's about!&quot; This book is way different, I'll keep reading it over and over just because it's so GOOD!

They were rich, but not in the things that really matter. The Socs had money, but not the loyalty and feelings that the Greasers had. Ponyboy was loyal to Johnny when Johnny had killed Bob. He stayed with him at the church. That's how true friends are. It showed how teens today feel: desperate and unloved.

Some boring old book.' i was so wrong.This, of the many many books i have read, is BY FAR my very favorite. S.E. Hinton- believe it or not, was only 15 when she wrote this. Amazing. Every page, the further you read, the more you understand, all the more your lust grows- the more you wish you were the one to be apart of this. I know it's been a long time, and call me crazy...but don't you wish you could go back in time and become a greaser and see what it's like for a while?? I do; very much so. This book changed my life. Their language, how they lived and dealt with things. Aside from Dally and Johnny dying, I loved every nanosecond of it. I love it so much it's the only book I've read in 3 months. Whenever I finish it, I flip to the beginning and start again.I really wish she'd made a sequel about the Curtis gang, but either way it's my favorite book ever.

It remains just as relevant, affecting, and impressively written as when it first captured my imagination as a still-skinny prepubescent who was still mostly scared of girls. Intrigued, curious, and attracted, but still largely scared. I suppose it's only fitting then that it was a female, the author S.E. Hinton, who shocked me from the delusion that I was going to be a professional athlete. After reading The Outsiders I knew I wanted to be a writer. Once I found out that S.E. Hinton was only 16 years old when she wrote The Outsiders, I thought that it just might be possible for me to be a writer. With its plethora of memorable and entirely accessible characters who all inhabit a world that was so far removed from my own upbringing, yet somehow managed to feel so very much like my own, this is an excellent novel that makes me laugh, cheer, and cry each time I read it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book is a breath taking story of unbreakable friendships, heroism, brotherly love, hardships, life, crime, and most of all, feeling like and outsider.

Even though I didn't grow up in a bad neighborhood as a greaser in the 60's, or was involved with a murder, I can see the human in Ponyboy, and I feel like I know him. I've read the book at least five times (in 1 or 2 days each) and I own the movie. Just writting about about the story gives me shivers. S.E. Hinton's writting is so beautifully descriptive, exciting, funny, and heartwarming, once you start reading this book you can't stop. This book isn't some stupid fantasy, this is a realistic story of hard, true life.I was shocked to find out S.E. Hinton was only 16 years old when she wrote this book!

Shepherd, Nessacus Regional Middle School) \\"In my opinion \\"The Outsiders\\" was as very catchy book. Once you read the first, maybe second chapter, you never want to put the book down, it is so good. It is about a gang of boys called \\"The Greasers\\" from the east side of town. They consider each other to be \\"family\\". Most of them are poor, and live in apartments. The members of the gang are Darryl (20), Sodapop (16), Ponyboy (14), Two-bit, Johnny (16), Steve (17) and Dally. (Darry, Soda and Pony are all brothers). There is another group of boys called the Socs (Socials), who live on the west side and are rich. They are the main rivals of the Greasers. During the story, many fights occur between the Socs and the Greasers. One night when Johnny and Pony are walking home from the movies, a group of Socs jumps them. Under self defense Johnny kills one of the Socs. From there Johnny and Pony run away to an old abandoned church. They stay there for about a week. When they go out for food, and come back they see the church is on fire. Some kids that were on a school field trip at that time were trapped inside of the church. Johnny and Pony ran into the church and risked their lives to save the children. This is just one of the many ways that some of the gang change their lives thoughout the book. At the end of the story, Johnny writes Pony a letter, and tells Pony to \\"stay gold\\". When Johnny says this he also writes, \\"The way you dig sunsets\\". I think Johnny means for Pony to keep doing the things he enjoys, such as watching sunsets, reading books. Johnny says, \\"to stay gold, \`cause like the green grass, everything can't be gold forever. So he wants Pony to stay gold! To see what happens through the rest of the story, look for this book and read it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The story of Ponyboy, Johnny and the rest of his greaser friends is a timeless classic that will remain a favorite of all time.

I am now 28, and still several parts of the book (nearly all of it) bring tears of happiness, sadness, anger or elation. Written from a viewpoint of hard and experienced innocence, this book is a study in the goodness in everyone, and everyone's propensity to hope.

It is a classic piece of literature that every generation can relate to. Go into any middle/high school across america and yell out the words \\"stay gold ponyboy\\" and i swear to you, you will get multiple nods of understanding. If you think I am crazy read the book and then you will understand. With names such as Ponyboy, Sodapop, etc. the characters of this book are ones you will never forget. This book also references other remarkable pieces of literature such as Robert Frost's \\"Noting Gold Can Stay\\" and the epic \\"Gone With the Wind.\\" This book teaches the reader valuable lessons like to stay gold throughout the hardships of life and how to use a glass bottle as a weapon. It also addresses the classic issue of the haves vs the have-nots (or in this case the socs vs the greasers) as well as the special bond between friends and how far they will go do to protect each other. Compared to all the other pieces of crap most students read in middle school (namely Tex-sorry s.e.hinton, The Face On the Milk Carton, My Brother Sam is Dead, Cold River, Canyons, Hatchet, the Pigman, and other such so called novels ugh)this work is a masterpiece. Please heed what i say, read this book and most importantly (in the words of Johnny)STAY GOLD!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Not only is this story absolutely incredible, interesting, and dynamic, but the author was a 16-year-old high school student when she wrote it!This novel proves the theory that I hear over and over again: Write what you know.

A red haze filled my mind and I slowly relaxed.\\"You've made the biggest mistake of your life. You're faced with the decision of life in jail or hide. Which way do you turn? This is the decision that Johnny Cade and Ponyboy Curtis are faced with in the novel The Outsiders. It is at this point in the story when the remarkable character development really takes off with the description of every thought that goes through Ponyboy's head. The Outsiders is so full of details and description. It's like a movie playing through your head you can absolutely get the full picture.S.E Hinton's famous novel The Outsiders is an amazing heroic story of bravery and courage right down to the last few pages; it kept me on the edge. I truly encourage anyone and everyone to read this amazing book. It's a good exciting book for anyone from the extremely good readers to slow readers because it's fast paced and thrilling I can't put it down. This action thriller will have you coming back for more of Hinton's work.PR27"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Published in 1967, it's arguably the oldest Y.A. book, and I still hadn't read it. Well, now I have. I know this won't shut up the critics, but I'm going to say it anyway -- \\"THE OUTSIDERS is Y.A.\\" It's got the young protagonists, edgy teen voice, and everything else required for membership into the Young Adult world.Rival gangs have split the city in two territories. The Greasers are the lower-class, slick-haired kids who look like thugs. The Socs (or Socials) are the high-class, sweater-wearing kids who look like they have it all together. The thing about rivalries like this is, like in Shakespeare's ROMEO AND JULIET, it only takes a couple of love birds to cross the lines and screw everything up.Ponyboy doesn't realize that's what he's doing when he falls for Cherry, a redhot Soc who, for some reason, lets Ponyboy and his friend Johnny sit with her friends and talk. With their parents out of the picture, Darrel hopes to raise his brothers, Ponyboy and Sodapop in such a way that gang ties and social prejudices won't be able to keep them down, but that stuff doesn't like to go away easily.Despite the accidental murders, lost friends, and city-wide brawls, THE OUTSIDERS isn't about all that. It's about teens from different social classes trying to survive life's pressures, because life doesn't let up on anyone, rich or poor, loved or unloved, noticed or ignored. It just keeps coming, and they have to deal with it.-- Reviewed by Jonathan Stephens"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"...still a great read that I read first as a eenager, and I am way older than that now!

The people in his gang are Dally, Johnny, Steve, and Two-Bit. They are all friends and are loyal to each other. The gang have had the best of times having \`rumbles' (fights) with the \`socs' (another gang) until it goes too far. When a soc tried to take Ponyboy's life, Johnny killed the soc and both of them end up on the run.The reason I gave this book 4 stars out of 5 was because I think it suggest violence is okay. But, overall this was a fantastic book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"When I had to read THE OUTSIDERS in seventh grade, at first I was just like whatever because I thought it was going to be another boring book we had to read and why can't we ever get good books to read? But from the first chapter, that was it. I fell so hard I still haven't gotten up.This book was my inspiration for writing my own teen novels. It's one of those books that has characters you're so into you wish they were your friends. Well, first you wish they were real. And then you wish they were your friends and you could call them any time you wanted and be like, \\"Hey, Ponyboy, what's good? Can you meet up at Chat 'n Chew for some grilled cheese and backgammon?\\" That's what hooks you in from the beginning...the way this story feels so real. The intense energy of the dialogue and the fast pacing of the plot make it impossible to put this book down. And when you do put it down because you have to go to school or sleep or whatnot, you can't stop thinking about it, you can't stop wondering what's going to happen next. It's like you don't even know how you can get through the day without finding out.So I want you to be as hooked as I was and read this so many times that page 73 is falling out. Because this book makes you feel alive. And that's an amazing feeling."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I think is book was great. this book influenced me to value family and the people closest to me. No matter what, I should be there to support the people I love despite how much fighting goes on. This book taught me that the mistakes you make, you have to face them. Everybody makes mistakes but running away from them does nothing because in the end you do face them. Ponyboy used metacognition by thinking about what his brother Sodapop feels about Ponyboy and Darry fighting and realizes fighting with family isn't good. Sodapop used perseverence because he kept trying and trying to keep the family together."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"We were supposed to read this book for class, which means that it is never going to be any good.

I can identify with Ponyboy's thoughts in the book. I've read this book about 4 times and I've never gotten tired of it. It was the only book or movie that I cried during. I have the book and the movie and I am contsantly reading it or watching it. This is a really great book and S.E. Hinton is a wonderful writer.

The only reason I read it was because a friend told me that it had \\"cussing\\" in it. (Those were different times, folks.) All these years later, it is one of the few books that I can't forget from that period. I reread it recently, and found it to be just as relevant today as it was then, and just as interesting. When I first read it, I had yet to live through the high school experience, with all of its associated social negativity, and so did not appreciate it in that sense. When I reread it, in hindsight, the book seemed even more relevant to our society than the first time I read it. Even though the events in the novel occur 50 years ago, it still reads like a modern novel, and is not dated otherwise. Unfortunately, I saw the movie with Matt Dillon between readings, and the second time through I could not get the brat pack faces out of my mind--the movie was good, but I don't really want to imagine the characters looking the way they did in the movie."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton tells the troubles of a young boy and the very stereotypical neighborhood he lives in with his brothers and close friends. The boys live in a small town in Oklahoma which is socially separated by the \\"greasers\\" and the \\"socials\\". This social battle is the reoccurring problem of the novel. The problem starts off when a young social was killed by a greaser. This causes the battle to get more heated but the characters start to see how this battle is taking over their lives and causing more heartache than anything.This book had a plot unlike any others. I was not able to guess what would happen next and it had a very inspiring theme. Although the book was written by a 17 year old female, evidence of this is not present in the novel. It was extremely well written and really creates a movie in your head. You get to know each character intimately and feel a part of the story. I definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a good book. It does contain some content like violence and illegal actions so be prepared for that. Other than that, it is an outstanding book that is used in many classes for a good reason."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"During my freshman year of high school, our English teacher had us read some novels from S.E. Hinton, a teenage female writer who wrote about rumbles. Her best and her original was \\"The Outsiders,\\" which told about the lives of two gangs, the Socs and Greasers. Primarily, she told the story of the Greasers and through the eyes of one certain Greaser, Ponyboy Curtis.Ponyboy is the youngest of three, living with his brothers Sodapop and Darry after the death of his parents. He hangs out with a gang that includes a few others, most notably Johnny Cade and Dallas Winston. The novel covers Ponyboy and the many rumbles that he has to fight, how he has his eye on a redheaded girl named Cherry, and the friendship that grows between him and Johnny.This novel is an excellent gem with the strong chemistry it creates between characters and at the same time has a strong development of action throughout the rumbles. This is one of those pieces that should definitely be on a high school reading list and holds plenty points of discussion.Hinton tried and tried again with rumble style stories such as \\"That Was Then, This Is Now\\" and \\"Rumble Fish,\\" but unfortunately didn't hit the mark with those. \\"The Outsiders\\" is a true and original classic that is one of a kind."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book made me think, made me cry and made me imagine. It's well written and it's obviously a classic. But I must admit I could tell it was written by a female. The tale is well crafted and most of the dialog is pretty good. However there are few lines that no young heterosexual boy would say to another. Which just gives away the fact that a woman wrote it. That is really the only gripe I have. The story is powerful and resonated with me. It's a timeless class struggle set in the most confusing years of a young man's life."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"We once had to read this during literature class, and everyone in the classroom enjoyed it and the film based on it. The storyline, albeit it contains violence, is interesting and filled with action all while remaining in a basically normal setting, without any extraterrestrial beings from outer space or wizards or mythological creatures. However, the main reason why I felt the need to publish my opinion on Amazon.com was because a boy in my class who usually hated to read finally found a book that he enjoyed after reading this. It did not encourage him to read more, but he found a novel that interested him so that is definitely worth mentioning for anybody who knows a middle school student/reluctant reader. If you find yourself an acquaintance or relative of someone who, like my friend, dislikes reading, this is definitely for you."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book is a marvelous piece of literature about a teenager growing up in the middle of gang warfare. He just sticks to the status quo, until two friends die because of gang warfare, and then he sits down and writes a paper on gangs for an English class project. This is a deep novel, about the physical and emotional hardship of being in a gang. This created some interesting thinking points, and what made it a remarkable book was that it was written when there weren't any realistic novels about teen life. This novel portrayed a darker and truer world, and enthralled readers with its honesty."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"\\"The Outsiders\\" by S. E Hinton is an early novel based on two warring juvenile gangs, divided by economical and social background, the lower East side Greasers and the upper West side Socs. There was all kind of feelings going through my mind as I read the S.E. Hinton novel \\"The Outsiders\\". Envy, love, roughness, strength, happiness...which leads me to think of this novel as a dramatic humorist nonfiction story that represents the reality that a society in every place on earth has to face with. There are always two sides: the good ones and the bad ones. Obviously it is not possible to define each one because there are different ways of setting a preference for who is the good or the bad. The Socs are the privileged kids from the Westside that as the word Soc means society, they have nice cars, they are rich and they live for bluffing. The Greasers are the unprivileged ones who live in the poor side and have to put up with the Soc's attacks, in both moral and physical ways. A special detail to look at are the changes the protagonist undergoes during the novel which I think is one of the main purposes the author wants us to pay special attention to, since the entire plot is based on Pony's feelings and expectation for his life. In every story there are certain events that will always remain not just in our memory, but within the deepest side of our hearts which will make us remember the story forever. These events happen throughout the story and in addition to telling it, they describe the characters; letting us know how they react to different situations. This novel has different stages in which we can easily identify each character by the specific details described from each one. \\"The Outsiders\\" is a relevant novel to study as in today's society the concept of violence is an ever present theme. It is a theme that dominates adolescents all over the world. As to survive in today's society many adolescents are faced with the turbulence of growing up in a volatile society and many face the prospect of dealing with some form violence or gang warfare or know of a friend who has. I believe students would enjoy this novel because it is about \\"people roughly their own age, contemporary time, the obvious, but none the less potent, parental relationships, challenging authority, establishing one's own personality and future relationship with peers."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Not only did this film lead to a good movie, but it is easy to see how it spawned other great films: American History X (which follows largely the same narrative pattern) and Stand By Me seem to be cousins of this book.The author here does one of the best jobs of tailoring the protagonist's inner voice specifically to the character. Indeed, for the whole process, the author seems deep in the mind of Ponyboy, not just pretending to be a junior high Greaser, but actually living as one for the duration of the book.In terms of payoff for reading effort, it is hard to do better than this book, which is less than 200 pages."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I had been wanting to read this book for a while, but kept putting it off. I finally ordered it and finished it in a couple of hours. It was such a good story, sad at times but had a good message in it. I gave it to my 11 year old son to read, and he enjoyed it just as much."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"In The Outsiders, Ponyboy Curtis is a greaser. He lives on the east side of town in a tense rivalry with the west side- the Socs. The greasers are hoods, menaces to society, while the Socs are the rich kids. But Ponyboy is different. He aches for something better, with no Socs or Greasers, just people.His gang of greasers consist of Two-bit, the loud crazy one who never stops talking; Steve, Dally, a tough, hard eighteen-year-old who hates the world; Soda, Ponyboy's laughing brother that could make anyone grin; Darry, Ponyboy's other brother that is older than his years and takes care of Ponyboy because their parents are dead; and Johnny, a quiet, defeated boy who was beaten almost to death by the Socs and is afraid of life. Ponyboy is artistic, intelligent, and wants nothing more than to run away and leave the trouble behind.One night at a movie Pony and Johnny defend two Soc cheerleaders from Dally- who is cursing and messing with the girls. Cherry- one of the Socs- relates to Ponyboy, and he finds himself telling her about his life. Johnny and Pony are walking them home when the girls' dates- who the girls ditched because the boys came to the movie drunk- drive up in a blue mustang. They are the ones who had beaten Johnny. Cherry succeeds in diverting the fight. That night Pony comes home late and Darry in his worry and anger slaps Ponyboy and yells at him. This finally pushes Ponyboy over the edge. He decides to run away.He takes Johnny with him and they eventually decide to go back. But the blue mustang drives up. There's nothing more dangerous for a greaser than five drunk Socs looking for trouble. Because they'll find it.This amazing book was published in 1967, but it is a timeless story that any generation will love and enjoy. It leaves you amazed and you feel like you understand the hard lives these boys live.One of my favorite parts of this book is the symbolism of gold. Ponyboy remembers his mother as beautiful and gold. Sodas old horse that he loved was gold. And pony and cherry can see through their differences because they both love to watch the golden sunsets. One of the character's- I'm not going to tell you which one- dying words to Ponyboy are \\"stay gold\\".I love Ponyboy because he can see through the veil that divides the Socs and the greasers. He narrates the story and once said, \\"We must not be that different after all, we see the same sunset\\". I think this idea can go farther than Socs and greasers but applies to the whole world. We all live in the same world and none of our lives are easy. This theme repeats throughout the story.Ponyboy sees that there is still good left in the world even through the fighting, rivalry, and death. This makes him my favorite character. He doesn't hate the world like many of the others.One thing that makes me sad is how many of the greasers see things. They don't see the good like Ponyboy; they only hate. Dally says to pony in one scene, \\"You get tough like me and nothing can touch you.\\" But what he doesn't understand is that if you live that way nothing can ever let you out. Dally is trapped in his own hatred and protective barrier. He's seen and felt too much for his eighteen years and has been hardened.Something I like about this book is the comic relief it gives. Ponyboy and his brothers will joke around or make fun of the Socs. This really helps you stop and let go of the breath you have been holding since the action began.This story uses suspense and foreshadowing to keep you turning the pages. It is a quick read. I could read The Outsiders over and over and never get tired of. I think the writing style (fantastic) is why this story will never reach a point when it won't be read and loved.The best part of this book to me is Ponyboy's insight on life that is easy to understand, but makes a difference in the way you see things. After reading this story, I find myself thinking about people's motives and trying to understand the ways the live, because no one is that different after all. We all see the same sunset.3 Book Bees Blog"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book was very good.

When I found out it was about greasers, I was excited because, to me, greasers are like the 1950s and '60's version of punk rockers, except for the fact that they don't play instruments. My favorite characters were Johnny and Dally. It is a great book that I would recommend to anyone. One of the things that I liked about it was that although it involves gangs and other questionable material,it showed the effect of all the bad things on everyone. Like, for instance, all the times when someone gets injured in a rumble or jumped, and whether the culprit is a Soc or a greaser and vice-versa, S. E. Hinton effectively and equally illustrates the hateful, destructive attitude and actions of the culprit and the hurt, shame, and anger of the victim. This ability comes in handy with boks like these, because that way, if a kid reads a part in the book where a kid gets jumped, they won't say, \\"Oh, I'm gonna go jump somebody now.\\", because about thirty seconds later, when they get to the next line and read about how hurt and ashamed and scared the victim is, they'll change their mind. Ms. Hinton also has a good ability for illustrating the consequences of violent and wrongful actions, because when you finish the book, you'll realize that everyone gets the punishment that they deserve for whatever they did tht was wrong;they don't just get away with things that are wrong. I look forward to reading other books by S.E.

She writes with suspense leaving the reader excited to read more. She has action which is found all around the book. She also writes with humor which keeps readers from thinking its a boring book. Finally she gives alot of detail in major parts."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I absolutely love this book and have for the last 19 years, having first read the novel in 5th grade. We were crazy about S.E. Hinton after that and proceeded to read everything she wrote. Outsiders is still my fave and I can still recall from memory all the dialogue. The film version stars many now-famous male actors who were quite young at the time the film was released. I would recommend the book to any young adult or adolescent who is living on the fringes of society, not really feeling accepted. The line between rich and poor is blurred by the sentiments shared by both groups in this book. A must-read for those interested in gang/youth culture."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a terrific book! I recommend it because if you are my age, it relates to you more.

I will read it again if I want to, which probably WILL happen!!!!!

The story starts out explaining the situation that is occuring all throughout it, which is two diffrent kinds of kids one from the north side and one from the south side of the tracks. The point of veiw of this story is from the point of view Ponyboy see's (The main Charecter) Now he gets into a little trouble alot and has no parents to direct him, just two older brothers. Now in the mist of all that's going on in the Hatred between, if you will north and south, there was something that happened to make it even worse. This book is a good book for the ages of 12 and up. Due to some of the themes that are involved in the story. I rated this book 5 stares because it brings in many diffrent kinds of themes such as hate for each other, Dffrent veiws on subjects that matters to each group of kids, and the way they treated each other in that day in age. This book is not that long (180pgs) but is very action packed so it never drags on and is very easy reading so you won't get stuck on words and therefor very quike to read and the time will fly by as you read it. Now Most people that I have talked to have also said it was a good book. Just as an example I asked my Freind Joe about it and he said &quot;Outsiders is a very good book and I recomernd it to all those who injoy reading books that aren't too long in length.&quot; So in conclusion I will say The Outsiders is an excilent book and if you like reading short stories or even long novels, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"It will really blow your back.

At first I was very shocked that a woman wrote this book(because of the initials in the name) But it turned out to be one of the best books, I've read in middle or high school. The story is told from Ponyboy's point of view. He lives with his brothers, one older Darry (who is raising Ponyboy)who works hard to keep the family together and SodaPop, who wants to hang out on the streets all day long. He talks about the many adventures that both he and his family go through. You also meet two of my favorite characters, Johnny and Dallas ( a true street kid). I'm telling you!!! Once you read this book you won't put it down because you want to find out what is going to happen next. There are some memorable parts such as the big street fight between the greasers and the socs and the \\"act of heroism\\" that Ponyboy and Johnny do.I will say that this book does not have a \\"happy\\" ending but you learn from the book is that friendships are forever no matter if you are a \\"greaser\\" or a \\"soc\\" and that you can make a difference in anybody's life."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Well, i did not read the book because i would have like to read it in english... cos i'm French ;)But i saw the movie.

Hinton's The Outsiders is an amazing work of literary art. This suspenseful thriller kept me guessing and will do the same to you. The first reason why I would highly recommend the book is that the plot is excellent and exciting. In the story a group of teenage gang members try to find their purpose, and this makes a great storyline and some exhilarating fight scenes really keep the book interesting. Every type of reader from beginning to end will enjoy this extraordinary novel about heroism, dealing with problems, and trying to overcome the odds.By Johnny"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"SE Hinton has written many great books in her lifetime so far. But one of her books stands out to me out of the rest, by far best book ever The Outsider. It could also easily be the Realistic Fiction book written. It's funny because it was the first she had ever written at the age of sixteen. I think that is purely amazing, the fact that she was only 16 when she wrote it. Probably because she might have been going through a similar situation.This book is mainly about a boy named Ponyboy that is in a gang with his brothers and a few other kids called the \\"Greasers.\\" There is this other gang full of rich people that are like jocks; they're called the \\"Socs.\\" The Greasers and Socs have constantly been fighting with each other but usually the Socs picked the fight. One night the socs took it too far and Johnny, a greaser, killed Bob, a Soc, and the sotyr goes on from there.But basically this is a great book, it keeps you in suspense, and there are surprises here and there that spice up the story. So if you like Realistic Fiction or even if you hate books you should try this one. You won't be sorry, believe me. It's not like a novel, it's actually quite short fewer than 200 pages, so it should go quick and it's a great book.[...]"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Wayne Barnes-Bak Middle School of the ArtsThis excellent book gives you a sense of war in a way.

Hinton, is a book about a boy growing up without his parents, having to depend on his brothers and his gang to get him through life's many obstacles. Ponyboy is the main character and the narrator of the story. He lives with his two brothers Darry and Sodapop on the east side. Darry is Ponyboy's oldest brother. He didn't finish college. After their parents died in a car accident, Darry had to get a full time job to support Sodapop and Ponyboy so that the three of them could remain together. Sodapop was the second oldest. He dropped out of high school but he was still Ponyboy's favorite brother. Then there was the gang, the greasers. Steve was Sodapop's best friend. Ponyboy didn't like Steve very much but he respected him because Sodapop would have wanted him to. Two-Bit was the oldest of the gang. He kept everyone smiling because he was always cracking jokes. Dallas was meaner then the rest of the gang. He spent a few years on the streets of New York. That's how he became so tough. Johnny was the second youngest. He was the gang's pet. Everyone considered Johnny to be their younger brother and everyone was always looking out for him. Johnny is the main reason that the Greasers hated the Socs. The Socs are a gang from the West Side. They are richer then the greasers. They drive nicer cars and wear nicer cloths. When Johnny got badly beaten by the Socs, The gang became was more protective of Johnny and the Greasers always held that grudge on the Socs. The Greasers ran into problems with the Socs throughout the entire book.My favorite character in the book is Johnny. He was forced to grow up faster then he should have. His mother didn't care about him and his father beat him, but he was still a good person and a dedicated friend to the gang. He seemed to have everything all together. It was almost like he'd seen it all and was a walking testimony to everyone else. Towards the end of the book Johnny was more open then he had ever been, and I got a chance to see the real Johnny.I mostly related to Darry in this book. He was a hard worker and he was very responsible. He cared a lot about his siblings, and he held things together. I care a lot about my sisters and I would help them out if they were ever in a sticky situation. I am a responsible person and I could hold a job to support my family if they needed me to. Darry was very worried about Ponyboy when Ponyboy ran away. He was scared to death that Ponyboy would be hurt or get into trouble. He didn't sleep well while Ponyboy was gone. I was really worried about my sister when she went into labor and was rushed into the hospital. I always heard about women who had trouble with their pregnancies and I couldn't sleep the entire night that she was gone. I worried that my nephew wouldn't be healthy and that my sister wouldn't get through it okay.I really enjoyed this book. It is my favorite book and I am currently reading it again. My favorite part of this book was when Ponyboy hugged Darry. It was my favorite part because in the beginning of the book, Ponyboy doesn't think that Darry cares about him. They were almost always fighting and Ponyboy never felt close to Darry like he did to Sodapop. Ponyboy finally understood that Darry loved him. He finally realized that Darry cared about him and that he worried about him all the time. When Ponyboy and Darry hugged, it was the first time that they ever showed affection towards each other.I have never read a book as fast as I read this one. Once I started reading it, I couldn't stop. I couldn't get enough of it. The way the book was written and my imagination helped me to actually live on the East Side and I was able to get into the book after only a couple pages of reading it. The book was fantastic and I wouldn't have changed a thing.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys adventures. The Outsiders would be perfect for anyone that is growing up or has grown up around gangs. This book is filled with nowadays situations and confrontations. Gangs fought over the same things then that gangs fight about now. This book was exciting and suspenseful. It kept me on my toes the whole time I was reading it. I recommend this book to everyone that can read. This book was easy to follow, and I guarantee that when you finish it, it will be one of your favorites."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"David...The Outsiders by S.E.

When I would be in a bad situation, I would try to avoid it. Like Johnny and Ponyboy.I thought that this book was fantastic. The way the author described every thing was incredible.

I could not relate to them in any other way because they were \\"greasers\\" and I cannot compare myself to someone similar to a hood.In my opinion, the book was and excellent book. The author, S.E.

But, he knows what to expect, until the night his best friend Johnny is forced to kill a Soc who attacks them, so they decide to run away to the country.Unfortunately, I cannot relate to any of the characters in The Outsiders.

However, when I went on a vacation to Alaska, I shared the same feeling of amazement as Ponyboy when he arrived in the country. Otherwise, I don't have any similarities.The book, in my opinion, was OK. My favorite part was when Ponyboy and Johnny escaped to the country. I recommend this book to anyone ages 12 and over.

All Greasers are poor, and are constantly getting physically harassed by Socs, the richwho live on the other side of town.

Ponyboy and Johnny end up running into the country, where excitement quickly brews in ways you wouldn't expect.Although I can't relate to any of the characters who carry switch knives, smoke, and bust the ends of bottles, I feel as if I have a relationship with each of the Greasers. I feel as if I know them like a person knows him or herself. Sometimes, I feel the way Ponyboy feels about him and Darry in the beginning, like he would never understand him. However, in my case, it's usually concerning more than one person. I really enjoyed this book, and would highly recommend it for anyone who is not squeamish, and loves adventure, but is over the age of eleven. My favorite part of the book was when Ponyboy was at the movies with Johnny, andhe meets Cherry Valance. I disliked the ending, and think that if any part of the book should be changed, that is it.

You can picture the wide city streets with the shapes that streetlights cast as they reveal pieces of action that happen in the darkness.

Readers can bring all their pre-formed concepts of what gang life is like, but by experiencing events through Pony Boy's narrative, a new appreciation for rivalry, encounters, and showdowns are formed. This is a fast-paced book, a real page-turner. Readers will see how the boys in the gang relate to each other as family. The boys, whether related by blood or not, share the same rivals, risks and aftermath of high-tension situations. Pony Boy and his friends experience heroism in their loyalty to the gang's turf war, and in their dedication to humanity. They live intense lives. Nothing comes easy.

Hinton's protagonist, Pony boy, along with his fellow \\"gang\\" members, including Two-bit, Dally, Darry and Johnny, are \\"greasers\\". Outwardly, they are an unsavory lot. They wear their hair long and greasy, wear jeans, t-shirts and, if they can eat chocolate cake and soda for breakfast, live in unfashionable homes in poor neighborhoods and are generally doomed to poor-paying blue-colored jobs. They do little to endure themselves to those who are not of their group. For instance, at the drive-in movie, they \\"introduce\\" themselves to some girls through uncouth behavior.The average greaser's nemesis is the \\"soc\\". The soc comes from a privileges background, wears fashionable clothing and often enjoys his or her parents' indulgence.Hinton, through a series of plot elements, presents the greasers as the misunderstood heroes of the book. For instance, Johnny, the least aggressive of the greasers, kills a soc. However, the killing is clearly presents as a case of self-defense. Further, we understand that Johnny had previously been savagely beaten by the very same soc who, on this occasion, without question, had intended to kill Johnny. Johnny later suffers fatal wounds when he rescues a group of children from a burning church- the same building in which he and Pony boy had been hiding out subsequent to the killing of Bob.The toughest greaser also is portrayed sympathetically. Even when Dally ends up being shot by the police after he attempted armed robbery, Dally seems more a tragic than a threatening figure. Pony boy reveals that Dally's gun did not hold and bullets; Dally desperate act is attributed to his inability to cope with Johnny's death.Throughout the book, the greasers are portrayed as loyal and misunderstood, imbued with an anger and despair that has been etched upon their psyches through years of abuse and neglect.Despite this, Johnny and Pony boy are able to maintain a grasp upon their humanity. Johnny pays with his life. Pony boy's fate is more promising. His nervous collapse at the end of the novel galvanizes the resolve of the rest of the greasers. They vow to break the cycle wherein their fate seems pre-determined if not for their own sake, then for Pony boy's. \\"Don't get tough,\\" Two-Bit urges Pony, \\"You're not like the rest of us and don't try to be (Hinton 1989, p. 152).&qout; Soda reminds him, \\"I you don't have anything, you end up like Dallas... and I don't mean dead, eather (Hinton 1989, p. 152).\\"Where Hinton's vision lacks courage is in her portrayal of the greasers as societal victims who lack genuine flaws. Certainly the greasers keep irregular hours, watch too much television, smoke and have poor diets, but they do not have serious faults. Any faults can be readily attributes to their circumstances and to the inequitable political and social systems that subjugate them. Hinton's novel would have been more of an achievement had she been able to generate empathy for the members of an underclass who are not simply \\"noble savages\\". It is easy to accept the romantic portrayal of a marginalized class of people; it is difficult to accept a cold, accurate rendering of the same group, especially when the group's attitudes, values and behaviors are profoundly different from those of the reader.Still, Hinton's work, while it is often sentimental, is also also sensitive and even poetic. We can hear Hinton herself speaking through Pony boy when he laments, \\"I could picture hundreds and hundreds of boys living on the wrong sides of cities, boys with blink eyes who jump at their own shadows. Hundreds of boys who maybe watch sunsets and looked at stars and ached for something better (Hinton 1989, P. 155)."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders was an intense book. It was an intense book because there was fighting. In the book I had pity for Pony Boy. I had pity for him because he had two good friends that where like brothers to him. There were two parts of the city, one for rich and one for the poor. Rich people always were the people that got what they wanted. The poor people got treated like dirt. So to get even they would fight. At the end they had a intense rumble.The rumble is a no rule fight. The rich people drove mustangs and the poor people walked. They called poor people greasers and rich people socks. To see who wins this rumble and to see what happens next, read this book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"ponyboy is a 14 year old boy whohas 2 brother. their name are darry and soda. darry is the oldest and soda is the middle child. ponyboys parents die in a car accident when he is a little kid. ponyboy and soda live with darry as long as they are not in trouble. a problem occur when darry hit pnyboy for coming home late. then ponyboy rushes out of the house and see johny his firend and told him they were gonna run away. they ran for a couple of blocks and then went to a park. then the socc came was about to drown ponyboy so johnny pull out a knife and kill a socc member named bob. they went to dallys home which he gave ponyboy his jacket and told them where to go and hide. when they get there they have to cut thir long hair so they wont be reconized. then dally comes to find them and gives ponyboyboy a note soda wrote. it said that darry is sorry that he had hit him. then a church is burning and ponyboy dally and johnny are helping and get sent to the hospital. there he meets and gets reunited with his brother and darry says sorry. johnny was in critical condition and l=had to say in the hospital and do did dally but dally was okay. they get home and 2 bit is gonna take ponyboy to the hospital to see his friends. on their way back pony boy is drowsy and 2 bit feels his forehead and told ponyboy that he look like he had a fever. he said he would be okay.he also had a headache. whe took about 5 asperins so he can stay awake for the rumble. then he hears that johnny dies and dally robbs a store. he saw dally kill himself and ponyboy fell and fainted. by the time he woke up his brothers were tellin him wat happened. pony boy had a small concussionand was stressed. he had to stay in bed for the week. his friend from school came to visit him. then his friend said something about johnny and ponyboy kepted reapeatin johnny is not dead and darry told his friend he should go. he was in shock to know his friend was dead"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders was a really good book.

THE OUTSIDERSThe outsiders is a really good book. \\" Ponyboy, Ponyboy are you okay, \\" Johnny said as he was running over to him. This is the change of their whole lives.Friends are always there for you. When Johnny killed the soc at the park. Dally gave him money to live on until Dally got up to where they were staying. It reminds me when I was getting made fun of . My friend was there right by my side. I am always there for my brother when he gets made fun of just because he is fat, but I tell him that they are just doing that just to make you made. My sister always told me that if someone is hurting may be someone died in their family that you should always be a friend to them no matter what.You always have some one there for you at all times. When Johnny would come home at night when his dad and mom would hit him. They would always yell at him and so Ponyboy and the gang was there for him. It reminds me of when I am always sick. My mom would always be there for me. She would be right by my side. She would always give me my medicine and make my eat my food so I could get better. It also reminds me when my sister is sick I am always there for her. The Outsiders is really a good book. I enjoyed reading the=e book in class.Johnny was an abused child. His mom and dad would always hit, yell at him when they were drunk. I really fill bad about kids that get abused because their parents would be drunk or they will not do what the parents because it is something bad and they don't want to do whatever it is. Johnny wouldn't come home for that night because they would still be drunk. Just like when Johnny was in the hospital and he didn't want to see his mother at all. He told the nurse that he didn't want to see his mother because of what had happened the night before.The book is a very sad ending because after the rumble. Ponyboy and Dally went to the hospital to check on Johnny to see if he was okay. They were there for little bit when Johnny died. Dally ran out of the hospital. He want to the gas station and he robbed it. He ran to the park and the police shot him three times in the back. Ponyboy wrote the story about what had happened at the end...."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"When I first began this novel I was expecting very much not to like it. I was completely wrong. The book was one that I was not able to put down. The endless twists and turns kept the book interesting, and the conflict between the \\"Socs\\" and the \\"Greasers\\" was well developed.The book gave a good background on how gang life could be, as well as showing life from the eyes of a child who has lost his mother and father. Life at home was tough for Ponyboy having to deal his overprotective brother Darry. When it got real bad he ran away, or at least tried to before those \\"Socs\\" almost killed him. Ponyboy learned a lot about life and seemed to grow wiser as the novel went on.The two gangs were completely opposite in the novel. This is what caused the endless conflict between them. Every little disagreement ended in violence and at some points, death. In many scenes I had the urge to step into the book and stop everything because it was getting out of hand. It was ridiculous what these groups would do to each other, and they never held back. Although I disagreed greatly as to how they handled these conflicts, the outcomes were well written and believable.The book taught me a lot about how life might have been for kids my age at an earlier time period. I have heard a lot about how gangs were very preeminent in the past. The book showed a lot about friendship and how to stick up for each other. These kids did whatever it took to protect their fellow gang member, even if it meant getting in a whole lot of trouble. The book also made me think about what it would be like if there were gangs like this at my school. How tough life would be on everybody. Sure my school is very cliquey but it never really results in a rivalry between groups.I would recommend this book to anyone who is in for excitement and anyone wanting to learn about true friendship. The book keeps you guessing till the end, but amidst the rivalry there is one boy learning about life on his own, the tough way."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The book was about three brothers with without a Father or a mother, there names are Ponyboy, Soda, and Darry. Ponyboy is an &#65533;A&#65533; student in his high school. There all in a gang called the greasers. Almost every week they will get into a rumble (a gang fighting a gang) with the Socs. One day one of the Greasers kills a Soc with a knife. Everybody thought that Ponyboy did it but it wasn&#65533;t. The person that did it was a hero and a murderer. He was a here because he saved all the children in a burning Church. But, then he get hospitalized because a big burning stick jabbed right into his back and made him paralyzed from his back to his legs. He dies a few days later of internal bleeding.I liked the book because it was very realistic. It was also scary, too, in some places. But most of all I liked it because it was a suspense book. It was realistic because it showed how the character acts and thinks. And another thing was when I read the book I couldn&#65533;t stop reading it. I just kept on reading it.I chose the book because I found it on the shelf and I heard that it is a good book. Plus my teacher told me that it is good. I usually look at the back of the book before I read it and check if it is well written or whether it is not. Since the book was suspense, I knew that I would like it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders was a great book for me to read. I like the way it was written in first person, also becuase Ponyboy was a good narrator. It was a very desciptive, juicy, well written story that drew you in from the beginning. Usually a book soesn't start off, \\"When I stepped out into the bright sunlight from the darkness of the movie house, I had only two things on my mind: Paul Newman and a ride home.\\" That, to me gets everyone's attention and makes them want to read more until tis gone. Kind of like a glass of your favorite beverage, if you like the first taste, you drink it until it's all gone.The best part of the book was the ending when the teacher gave Ponyboy the theme assignment and he started it the same as the first sentence in the novel. So it was interesting to see that we were reading what he wrote. Instead of really writing a theme he wrote a novel. There wasn't really a bad part, everything was picture making. S.E. Hinton wrote with such grace the words all came together to create a visual.S.E. Hinton was a great writer all around throughout this whole book. I was especially fond of how she went through and explained each individual greaser, named them and what they looked like. It was great to be able to create your own picture but yet also have a common base for their features. Mrs. Hinton also did a wonderful job describing the setting in full fledged detail. The chapter when Bob was stabbed in the park, the first page had all the details about how it looked. She stated that the pool was empty but the fountain was running, the tall elm trees and how they shadowed the park. S.E. Hinton did a great job and I can definately say \\"The Outsiders\\" was a great book for me to read."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I really liked the outsiders book for various reasons. One reasonis because when Iread the outsiders I was imagining every single thing that happened and it made me winder what it would be like if stuff like that was still goin on in modern days. The book also made me wonderwhat al the characters thought about being in a social group and if they all wanted to be friends.I think the best part of the bok was the rumble between the socs and the greasers. The rumble was the only thing that seperated the greasers from the socs because if the greasers won the socs would probaly leave the greasersalone for awhile. The worst part of the book ,in my opinion,was when johnny died. But when he was saving those kids at the church from the fire, he was smiling because he was doing something that would make him proud of himself. I thought that was pretty cool even though he died.The most vivid story elements I thought were when S.E. Hinton was describing how all the characters looked because it made me imagine how they relly looked. Ireally liked the detail she used when she was describing them like when she was describing the socs with their mustangs and madras shirts and how they were rich westside kids. Overall I think it was a pretty good book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a book that can relate to anyone. Ponyboy portrays any regular Joe, and the Greasers can relate to any kind of gang or group of friends that care about each other. This is why the book is very famous and is accepted by an all around public.

This book does a fabulous job of relating people of different social classes by making you understand and feel for what life is like for the other people and gaining respect for them.

Hinton because I have heard a lot of good things about it and the storyline was appealing to me. It is about the rival of two gangs through the eyes of a young teenager named Ponyboy. He has two brothers, Darry, who is always working and is always serious, and Sodapop, the ever-loved handsome brother who works at a gas station. Soda is a fun-going, loving brother who wouldn't ever do anything to hurt Ponyboy. While Darry is always yelling at Ponyboy and once he even hit him. He does not have any parents because they died so it is just Ponyboy and his brothers. He lives in a hard knock town with two rivalry gangs, the Greasers and the Socialists, or Socs. The Greasers and the poor, raggedy-looking gang. Ponyboy is in the Greasers. The Socs are just the opposite. They are rich and high class and they drive Mustangs and Corvairs while most of the greasers don't even own a car.Many things happen to Ponyboy throughout the book. His best friend in the gang is Johnny. They have known each other for a long time and in the book they go through a very big event. I will not tell you what but they are a run for their lives and only Dally, the rugged hardcore gang member who always got into trouble, was there to help them. Dally was the one who told them to run and he was the only one who know where they were. If I was on the run for my life I would cry every time I thought about what I had done and not being able to tell my brothers would eat me up inside.There are many other events and details that occur during this book. I thought it was very good and I am looking forward to reading the sequel, That was Then, This is Now. I have always liked plots with action and suspense and the part with the gangs was great too. I am waiting for more books like this one to come in my path so I won't stop reading.I am really thirteen but this was the only way it worked."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The minute you gaze into the eyes of the guys on the cover of The Outsiders, you know you're going to love this book. S.E. Hinton may have been only 16 when she wrote this, but she knew how to write and that's all that matters. Her use of slang in both dialog and in the way Ponyboy tells the story, pull you into it and make you feel like a greaser (a member of a gang of poor teens) yourself. Her book is full of suspense and drama, and each chapter leaves you hanging and makes you want to keep on reading nonstop. I was really sad when the book ended.The Outsiders is about Ponyboy, 14 years old, whose parents died and lives with his two brothers Darry and Sodapop. He lives in a poor neighborhood and he and his brothers are part of a gang called the greasers. The book centers around the rivalry between the greasers and a gang of rich kids from the other side of town who are called the Socs. Hinton gives every character their own special personality, and she makes you feel like you are there in the book.There isn't any word that can describe just how good this book is, and I recommend this book of \\"friendship and belonging\\" to everyone."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"A few weeks ago someone in a chat room told me to read the book The Outsiders because it was really good.

By the end of the novel I was so wrapped up in the book I was sad that the book had ended. The words that the autor used made you feel like you were actually part of the book and knew the characters. The book was very moving,both funnyand sad.I would catch myself laughing outloud at some of the parts in the book, and at other parts crying. It seemed as I was reading the that S.E.Hinton had experienced all the things she was writing about by the way she wrote them, by reading the book you would assume she was in a gang or had a best friend die in a fire or even rob a store.

I recommend that anyone of any age read this book because the author describes the characters in an amazing way.

The boys in this book all act tough but almost all of them cry at some point in time in the book. It helps you see that you don't have to be tough all the time. It was extremely well written. I've never read a book that is even half as good as this one. It is so great. S. E. Hinton is the greatest author. Plus, if you're not into books, they have a movie, too.

Ponyboy is a greaser, a gang member. His parents died so he lives with his bothers, Soda, a drop-out, and Darry, who grew up too fast to take care of the family. The greasers are enemies with the Socs, another gang made up with rich kids. Ponyboy and Johnny, a buddy of Ponyboy, run into some Socs and get in a fight. They nearly get killed by the Socs. In self-defense, Johnny kills a Soc, Bob. Ponyboy and Johnny run away from the police to a church. There, they save some lives and lose some.I like this book because it let me see things in 2 point-of-views and it helped me realize a life is very, very valuable and can change many people&iexcl;s lives forever. I also learned that losing one life can lead to many more losses. When I was half way through reading this book, I thought all Socs as &iexcl;bad&iexcl;. But I relize that that isn&iexcl;t true. If another book was based on the same story, but it was a Soc&iexcl;s point of view, I would have thought of all greasers as &iexcl;bad&iexcl;. But when I got to a certain point of the book, there was a part when Bob&iexcl;s friend, Randy was telling Ponyboy his feelings, I really felt sorry for him and changed my opinion on the Socs. Especially when the book tells me randy&iexcl;s expression by saying, &iexcl;Randy tried to grin, but I could tell he was close to tears.&iexcl;When Johnny and Ponyboy is at the church hiding, they save some lives. To save lives, they get injured and it leads to a person&iexcl;s death. Because a person died, Dally gets so sad he wants to suicide and he purposely threathen the police and got shot by the police. This was weird thing to happen because Dally was a very cold, tough, manly, and &iexcl;bad&iexcl;. I guess that&iexcl;s why it touched me more when Ponyboy said, &iexcl;he ran out like the devil was after him. He&iexcl;s gonna blow up. He couldn&iexcl;t take it.&iexcl;My favorite part of the book is when Jjohnny, Ponyboy, and Dally saved the little kids from the church. It would&iexcl;ve taken a lot of courage to do that because they could die saving those kids, and most of all, they didn&iexcl;t even know they kids and they risked their lives for them.

It is all about my favorite stuff as a teenager: fights, alcohol street gangs, friendship and love. The story is about the group of teenagers living on the street. They are Ponyboy, Sodapops, Darry, Dally, Two bits and Johnny. They are \\"Greasers\\", which is the name of the group's gang. The reason they call themselves greasers is because of their greasy long hair. They are always together like family because they have to have friends to back each other up when they get into fights with the Socs, who are their greatest enemy. One night when Ponyboy gets into a fight with his brother, he leaves the house and decides to spend a night on the street with Johnny, his best friend. Unfortunately, they meet five drunken Socs and get into a fight with them. The fight ends when Johnny stabs one of the Socs who is about to kill Ponyboy. They are afraid of the murder rap and going to jail, even though they are juveniles, so they run away from the city and with Dally's help hide in a church. But one night, there is a fire at the church...This novel is mainly about the friendship, and teamwork between Ponyboy, Sodapopls, Darry, Dally and Johnny for being in one crew. I really admire these characters because I think their lives are extremely tough as they have no parents and have to fend for themselves. I also like the ending of the book because of how the poem \\"Stay Gold\\" kind of sums up what's important in life. Johnny wants Ponyboy to \\"Stay Gold\\" which means to stay young inside, and not to get old and bitter in life."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I read this book 2 years ago when I was in the 8th grade.

In the book one of the guys dies... but you have the read the book on your own.The lesson in the book, I thought, was that everyone has a rough life. All age groups do and also their classes. This book would be good for ages 11-16. I think this because thats when it starts to get hard for the kids.I like the book over all. The book was kinda slow at first.

I had to read it again in 9th grade, and it was still pretty good. Now, as an 11th grader, I read it a third time. Looking back, I can't see why I even liked it!As a Tomboyish 7th grader, the violence and smoking was cool for me. Now that I'm older, it seems childish and stupid. Now, I'm thinking of questions I didn't think of in 7th grade like: Why do these guys get so much enjoyment out of beating up each other? Why didn't Ponyboy and Johnny just go to the police and tell them it was self-defense? How did Darry keep custody of his brothers? And too many other questions!In 7th grade again, there was only one kid in the class that didn't like it. Now, most of the kids in my class don't like it anymore.I also re-watched the movie and that wasn't as bad as the book, but still pretty close. The movie tried to use beautiful music and lovely backgrounds to try to make us feel bad. After the movie and book ended, I was thinking, \\"but what did he learn?\\" What did Ponyboy learn? Not to judge people? Always tell the truth? Respect your brothers? He went through all that just to learn those lessons he already had in the first place? This book was just an endless marry-go-round.If you want a good and less-violent book about coming of age, I'd recomend Sisterhood of the Travel Pants or Can't Get There from Here.Sadly, I'd rather read Twilight (another book I didn't really like) a hundred times before I'd read this again."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"An absoulutly horrible book. The plot is both much too violent and exceeds the bounds of beleivability. The characters range from absoultly fake in mannerism to outright sick, I beleive that the author his by far exceeded the bounds of good taste.

For anyone else, I must say that it would be best to leave this kind of book to those who fit the first description."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book is about a young boy and all his friends back in the day. Back then, they were considered a gang, although nowadays, the concept is laughable. Anyway, this so-called &quot;gang&quot; is known as the greasers. They wore leather jackets and had greasy hair. This went back to the Happy Days years. There is also another &quot;gang&quot; called the socs, and they are rivals. The problem is, one day one of the greasers killed one of the socs. This book tells all about all the non-adventures of the greasers. Personally, it sucked big time, but notice how all the adults in this school seemed to like it. Probably because they were alive when people like this existed. So I suppose I should recommend it to all the adults alive in the 50s. This book wasn't up to my standards, seeing how there was extremely annoying characters and promotes smoking and beating people up. Not acceptable for flourishing young minds, but maybe for adults. I hope I never have to read it again in my life. Thank You."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Worst book ever written. Do not waste your time in reading this book.

Hinton, takes place in Middle America in the 1960's, and discusses an on going struggle between two gangs, The Socs and The Greasers. The Socs live in the nicer part of town and think they are better than everybody else because they have many materialistic items. The Greasers on the other hand live in the poorer part of town, and seem to always have trouble with the Socs. The main character and narrator, Ponyboy Curtis, was walking home alone one night from the movies and is attacked by the Socs. Darry, who is the oldest brother, comes to his aid because the responsibility he has of raising Ponyboy since their mother and father were killed in a car accident a few years before. Darry is very tough on Ponyboy because he does not want him to be a Greaser all his life, so he is constantly making sure he is doing well in school. After many more conflicts between the Greasers and Socs, a big brawl is created. The suspense that S.E. Hinton uses in this novel adds to the book because while reading you can tell there is a fight about to occur, but the reader is not sure what is exactly going to happen.S.E. Hinton does a great job with this novel because the mixture of action and suspense. She also throws a little love in the book which I think relates to any women reading the book. I could really relate to this novel because of both the way the gangs have to protect each other, and the closeness that the Curtis brother's share. S.E. Hinton really lets the reader into what exactly Ponyboy Curtis is thinking. She allows the readers mind to wonder because the reader can never really know what is next while at the same time captivating the reader. The dialect S.E. Hinton chose to use when the brothers were talking to one another was also great. She uses Darry as a parental figure being the one who punishes and also the one who makes sure Ponybody stays on the straight and narrow. Also, the wording she uses is great because the reader can tell which gang is talking because the proper words that the Soc's use or the improper words the Greaser's. Also, the Soc's use more vulgar language, and in general are more cocky. The book overall was an easy read because the events were easy to comprehend as well as easy to connect to. She really molds this book into a great novel because it felt like the reader was actually in one of the gang members shoes. As the Greaser's struggle to survive, and as the book carries out, you can see the brother-like relationships carry them through the situations. With all the action S.E. Hinton includes, she also includes comedy, which is a great change. The comedy is not real obvious, although when the reader thinks about the events, the \\"smack talking\\" the gangs do to one another is comical. The friendship the Greaser's develop, and the overall way they learn to depend on one another can connect some readers with real life events. Though some of the fights, some readers may wonder if the two gangs really should be fighting or should they quit acting immature. I think this is a great point that S.E. Hinton makes because young gang members do not necessarily fight over mature things, they fight to prove who has the alpha male status. If you like fighting in a real life situation format, I highly advise you to read this book, although, if you do not like fighting and violence, this book may not be for you."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The book I am reviewing is written by S.E. Hinton. The book's name is The Outsiders. I think this book deserves five stars because it's a mystery and it had a lot of gang fights which I liked. This book is realistic fiction. This book is about gangs called the Socs and the Greasers. They beat up on each other for fun. A problem that occurs in this story is that the Socs beat up Pony boy, the main character. Then Ponyboy and Johnny, his best friend, run away because Ponyboy gets mad at his brothers. Then Johnny murders someone to protect Ponyboy. So they are on the run with a murder on the case.

Pony lives with his brothers because his parents died, and Jonny lives with his parents, but they could care less weather he was dead or not. They go through many adventures with eachother, beating up the \\"Socs,\\" and getting beaten up, until someone crosses the line.My favorithe part of this story is the brawl. They describe it in such a way that you could picture it in your mind. Another part i liked about the book was when Dally got blown away by the cops.I have read many books in the past and i would have to say, this is one of my favorites. It makes me think that just because you hear that someone is doing somethin bad, doesnt mean they are a bad person. This book also helps me look at people in a different way. These kids get into trouble, but they are not bad kids.

Excellent book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The OutsidersMy son had to read this book for summer reading before entering 7th grade. I read it out of curiousity and enjoyed it. With my son just entering manhood it seems timely to read such a novel. The story teaches young people what happens when you make bad choices and that sometimes unfortunately the consequences of some poor choices last a lifetime. This type of message is so necessary in our culture today. I especially appreciated the fact that no one excused them because they were teen-agers. Too many guilt-ridden parents today excuse too much unacceptable and inappropriate behavior because their kids are teen-agers. They are young men and women. If they are excused now when does it end?"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"When I read this book in High School it was still new. It was the first book I read in HS and the best book!

It doesn't show the 50's maltshop culture where everyone was polite and should be placed in the 'Andy Griffith' show. It shows the real fifties the ones my dad grew up in with gangs and fights. The ones he tells about how notorius he was for the 'tuff kid' because he could take down 3 boys at a time. Personally, I think it sheds a light for America ~it shows even in our glory days, we had problems, and we always will. Yes, I wouldn't let a kid prone to having tantrums and fits read this book because the characters arn't GREAT romodles, but they do learn, and they do show mistakes like the average person~ a step up from 'Nancy Drew' and those 'Fun with Dick and Jane' books."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"i fell a sleep in class doin the outsiders book and now there makin me do this review about the book and i dont like it and i didnt like it or abomidible it was abomdible i cant spell ne ways bye bye i dont really read i ride dirt bikes ant im getting sponserd in the fall bye donald trump"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Was S.E.

I thought she would have written something interesting or truthful of the life of teens in the US. How wrong it turned out to be! There is no plot, no interesting thing happening, just meaningless street fights and crazy violence. And throughout book, it shows how badly the writer is equipped with writing skills, if any skills at all. It told so many things which are unbelievable and unreal. How often do you see two skinny teenage girls, when one 6.2 foot bad boy offered them Coke, one of the girls would throw the Coke on the bully's face in return for his hospitality? Probably the this poor writer did and resulted in her forever brain damage which resulted in this crazy improbable tale. The main character's first name is Ponyboy and his brother Sodapop. I don't think there are many people in this world can find more stupid names. The names also made the whole crazy story unbelievable. What a waste of time in writing this thing called novel!

What this really means is, he covered and abetted the actions of a vandal and two boys involved in the death of another! This makes Dally a good guy? The author tries to make us identify and sympathize with these boys who are thrust into unhappy circumstances and react by becoming hoods, thieves, liars and killers! We're supposed to empathize and champion these boys? Yes, they had their gentle spots and even showed great bravery at the fire, but that cannot negate that our children are being made to like and admire these criminals! I don't want my son to identify with these kids! I don't want him associating with kids like these and I CERTAINLY don't want him to look up to or emmulate kids like this! What IS the point of this book? That everybody feels pain? Do we really have to glorify crime and deception and expose our kids to this ugliness to teach them that? Why aren't they reading Tom Sawyer and A Tale of Two Cities? Why aren't they being taught to look up to good honest, decent living people? No wonder our teens are in such trouble these days.

He has to learn to cope with harsh surroundings, gang violence and the pressures to succeed. Along the way he is faced with many life-altering decisions.The main character in this book is a young boy named Ponyboy; he is the one who serves as the narrator in the story. Ponyboy is the youngest of three brothers. The oldest of the brothers, Darry, is a gallant protector and father figure to Ponyboy and Ponyboy&#65533;s other brother because a tragic accident had occurred in the family. Sodapop, Ponyboy&#65533;s second oldest brother is a more carefree and fun loving kind of guy. He and Ponyboy are very close. The other characters in this novel are: Two-bit who brings the group their definition of entertainment, Dally a fierce notorious lawbreaker, and Steve, Sodapop&#65533;s best friend, who&#65533;s always ready for a good fight and loves the hood life. There is also Jonny, who acts as everyone&#65533;s kid brother. He is always sweet and nice due to his living situation at home, and past traumatic events.These boys make up a very colorful circle of friends. They are always there for each other know matter what. Together they have the time of their lives. They are &#65533;The Greasers.&#65533;Some of the other characters, from the Upper-East Side consist of Cherry, a spunky little red head that touches the hearts of both sides. She also happens to be a cheerleader at Ponyboy&#65533;s school. Bob, Cherry&#65533;s boyfriend gets in more trouble than you can imagine. Randy is Bob&#65533;s best friend and also his side kick. Together the boys wreak havoc among the greasers just because they can. Everyday these characters run into numerous amounts of problems. They deal with things such as fights, family, friends, girls, and even murder. Each day is filled with enough adventures to last a lifetime.My favorite character is Ponyboy. He is my favorite because he learns so much and you feel as if you are learning and growing with him. Many of the challenges and outcomes he deals with are so gut wrenching and heart touching that I did not want to put the book down. I felt as if I could relate to each and every character on a different level. I absolutely loved the book. I could not put it down. The structure and composition, combined with the energy level of the book were elaborately well done and very mind gripping. I would not change a thing about the book at all; otherwise I feel it would not be worth reading.I completely recommend this book to anyone who loves to read. I feel, that all types of people can relate, in someway or another, to this book.

This is one of those books that once you start reading it you can't put it down. Just because it is fiction doesn't mean it couldn't happen!!!This book was about three Curtis brothers Darry (age -20),Sodapop (age- 16 going on 17), and Pony boy (age-14). There parents were killed in a car accident. The three boys can only stay together if they behave. There are two groups the Socials aka. Socs (wealthy kids) and the Greasers (poor people or not as rich as the Socs.). The Curtis boys are the Greasers. When Soda was 12 going on 13 his hobby was horseback riding and he loved a horse named Mickey Mouse and this horse would not let anyone ride and was very mean to everyone except Sodapop. Soda used to go to the stable everyday just to ride him and he could spend hours there because he cut school so he could work to help pay the bills. Darry also works many hours to pay for food and pay the bills. But still finds the time to go to school and play football and work out to keep his nice build.Johnny is the child of alcoholic, abusive parents. Since his parents do not pay much attention to him, Johnny sees the greasers as his true family. In particular Dallas is the most protective of him. Johnny was once beaten up really bad by the Socs. and is now terrified of them. One day Johnny, Two-Bit Mathews (real name is Keith; he is a wisecracking greaser who regularly shoplifts. He prizes his sleek black-handled switchblade.), Dallas, and Ponyboy went to a movie. They had met two girls Sherry Valance (but her friends called her Cherry b/c of her red hair, she is a Soc and Bob Sheldon's girlfriend) and Marcia (Randy's girlfriend, and also a Soc.). They were there only because their Boyfriends were drunk and they didn't like to see them like that. Johnny, Two-Bit, and Ponyboy went over to go sit down and they started talking. Ponyboy and Cherry found out they have a lot in common. Dallas drove Johnny, Ponyboy, Two-Bit, Marcia, and Cherry home in his T-Bird. When they were driving they noticed the blue car drive by and Marcia and Cherry noticed it was the Socs. car, they started to get very nervous. Then when Dallas had stopped the car the Socs. had come back around and Randy and Bob had come over to the car because they thought they had seen their girlfriend in the car. Randy had asked why they were hanging out with the Greasers and Marcia said \\"because you were drinking and I don't like to see you like that.\\" Then Marcia and Cherry got out of the car and told the greasers that she would see them later. Johnny and Ponyboy had laid down to look at the sunset and they feel asleep. When Johnny had woken up he saw that Ponyboy was still sleeping he had woken him up and told him to go home. When Ponyboy had gotten home he had realized that he was extremely late. Darry was waiting there ready to yell at Ponyboy. When he opened the door Darry let him have it....Sodapop tried to stop them but it wasn't going to work. Darry got so mad that he hit Ponyboy! Ponyboy had never been hit and he got so upset that he turned around and ran back to where he and Johnny were laying. Darry felt bad and tried to get him come back, but Ponyboy just kept running. He got back to Johnny and Johnny had asked what was wrong and Ponyboy had explained the whole thing to him. Ponyboy thought that if they went for a walk around the park he could go home. This is where disaster strikes them.....You will have to read the rest and find out what happened!This book is very interesting and I can relate to some parts. Just remember your friends will fight and defend you if they're real friends. This book has affected me by letting me see what it is to have a really bad life. I advise you that you should ask your parents to set a guideline and lay down the rules because when you get too much freedom things can go wrong!*****Have Fun!*****"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Well... **1/2The Outsiders has potential for \\"being gold\\". There is some very fine, well-written dialouge and unique ideas for the time period (1950s). But on the whole, this was definitely not my favorite book. The characters go through \\"A Series of (Unfortunately) Predictable Events.\\" It's the domino affect: one \\"tradgedy\\" leads to another, with little interest in between. And let's not forget the small but important fact that S.E. Hinton was 16 when she wrote this; this was not written by someone with a college degree in writing. I do not know if anyone noticed but the whole thing is a recycle of \\"West Side Story\\" which the author must have regarded fondly as she wrote the Outsiders. The gangs growl, yell, then fight, the kill somebody, a great unanimous gasp goes up and shakes the love affair going on. The morals are pretty used too--see the good in the world; be yourself, etc. And the characters, with the exception of Ponyboy and Cherry, are very one-dimensional, thin, and cliche. However, as I said before, kudos to the graceful stream of dialouge--that's one thing the author's nailed; conversation rarely sounds cramped and doesn't slack to the usual \\"Greaser\\" talk one might expect.Still, I won't spoil it for you. If you want to read the book, that's fine; just be aware of what you're reading."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Ponyboy is a youth fourteen years of age split into two personalities, one a good natured boy confused and afraid, the other the classic steriotype of an inner city youth. Set in a dank, inner city neighborhood, two rival social groups have escalated their hatred for eachother to a new level. The &quot;Socs&quot;, one of the groups, are a seemingly endless mob of vicious, violence-frenzied, rich and malevolent problem children dwelling in \\"the West Side\\". The other, named the Greasers, are the home of Ponyboy (the protagonist) and poverty-stricken children fighting for survival. Following his heart, Ponyboy meets a &quot;soc&quot; girl which leads to a chain of events which will forever more, change the greaser's life.This text does not deserve the &quot;20th century classic&quot; rating which has been given to it. While a better 5th Grade reading alternitive to Judy Blume, this book is surprisingly plot-oriented for a supposed &quot;classic&quot;. The book has no reedeeming symbolism, nothing to give to the world, nothing to teach us about ourselves like most classics do. This book is great for young readers though, who can never read a story unless the plot starts in the first few chapters. But for more experienced readers, the book may come off as childish and callow. The plot is hollow, and S.E. Hinton's writing style is quite simple. In conclusion, as a book, &quot;The Outsiders&quot; is decent, not horrible, not great. However, as a Classic, it pales in comparison."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I ordered this book for my daughter at college.It was delivered to her on the date specified.I am pleased with seller."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Purchased this used paperback (\\"The Outsiders,\\" S.

It was a terrible read and I found the violence to be in the book because it was needed to advance the characters. Good books should be lead by great characters. Violence, or any action should only be in the book if it's character lead - not the other way around. No wonder this author got a D+ in English! This book, and movie only survive because teachers have been taught that they must teach this book.While the \\"idea\\" of this book is interesting, exploring class warfare through the eyes of teenagers, the book itself is not worth reading. Hopefully the educational system will catch on and stop making kids read this horrid book!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Imagin if your parents where dead, and you had to live with your brothers and the rich people jumped you as your walking down the street.

I still remember the shock when Johnny killed the soc Bob Sheldon it was unbelievable. The socs habit of jumping people for kicks has some grave consequences here and things are never the same again for any of the players. One thing leads to another here where Johnny and Ponyboy go into hiding then Johnny dies and Dallas too. I was so sad for Ponyboy and felt his pain at losing his best friend. What a lonely and sad world he suddenly faced for despite the wild ways of Dallas Winston it was Dallas he hung out with along with Johnny and all this ended for him practically overnight.This book is still as good today as it was then and I highly recommend it especially for young people.A.M Torres author of Love Child (sold here on Amazon)"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I loved this book.

There were many things that the readers would like. I think they would especially enjoy the parts about the church. This book has taught me many things but I don't want to give anything away. When I first saw the book I didn't want to read it because it didn't look good. But when I started to read it I couldn't stop reading it.

Unlike the typical fun loving 14-year-old babysitter, the main character is a complex and fragile being, while being likeable and tough. The story is told from his point of view, and in a world where everyone is divided into two clashing social groups: The lower-class, hair-slicking greasers and the upper-class socs, donning madras shirts and expensive cars. Ponyboy regards the constant spars between the two as normal teenage life, until one day his friend Johnny does something terrible.The book itself is well written, with a healthy balance of poetic adjectives and easy to read content, and the author does an excellent job of portraying the various characters through words. The story itself tends to have grim undertones without being too dismal, and keeps the plot fresh and exciting. I read the book in about a week, both the facts that it is a page-turner from the beginning and the relatively small length of the book both contributing to my brief yet satisfying trip to the end. The finale is very peaceful, and the whole book is written from what seems to be much experience.The only negative feedback I could possibly draw from this book is that the main characters might possibly be a bad influence on small children, as they smoke, drink, curse and fight regularly.I definitely would recommend this book to those who enjoy Lois Lowry's The Giver or are interested in reading on previous pop culture in general, as both The Giver and The Outsiders focus on characters raised in harsh environments, then grow up to realize their own perspectives on the land. Action-filled and ripe with emotion, The Outsiders is a true classic."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton was written in the 1960's. I enjoyed reading this book because I can relate to the characters in the story. It is about a 14 year-old boy named Ponyboy Curtis who grows-up in a poor, Texas neighborhood. His parents died in a car accident, this left him and his two brothers, Soda-Pop and Darry orphaned. His brothers and his friends, \\"the Greasers\\" where now his only family, they were a gang. This gang was made-up of Ponyboy and his brothers and these other characters; Dally, Steve, Two-Bit and Ponyboy's best friend, Johnny. These kids were always together and took care of each other as a family would..With gangs, there were always rivalries between groups. The \\"Socs\\" or socials were rich and didn't like Greasers because they were poor. The Socs were terrible. They drank and smoked too much and when they were drunk they took it out on innocent people. The Greasers could never go out alone because they could get jumped by the Socs. One of the big events in this book is when Johnny, one of the younger Greasers, got jumped and almost killed by nasty group of Socs. Johnny was Ponyboy's best friend and he was almost killed by Bob, the leader of the Socs.Johnny is one of the most important characters in this book. Johnny's parents were not the greatest. They didn't like him at all. He usually needs to leave his house at night and sleep in a vacant lot. Johnny never leaves his house without a switch-blade because of his run-in with the Socs. One night, Ponyboy and Johnny doze-off in the parking lot of the movie theater. They were supposed to be home by 12:00. Pony knew he would be in trouble with his older brother, Darry for being out too late so, he went home. Ponyboy was now in serious trouble with Darry. Ponyboy and Johnny decided to run away from home. The two boys met up in the park. What they didn't know was that night things were going to change drastically for the two boys.I recommend this book to every reader that likes a good story. It is a classic book. It was written in the 1960's and still ties in with real life today after all the years, troubled teenagers forming groups and picking fights. When I read it I was amazed by how much this group of friends can do together. Nothing got in their way. Even though there are some sad parts in the story, it just made it more addicting to read. It seemed like I couldn't put the book down after the first couple of pages. The Outsiders was a very enjoyable book and I had a lot of fun reading it.

The socs are a group of vicious kids and the greasers are a group of miserable kids that don't have money but they have heart. The socs are always bothering the greasers so now the greasers have to carry a switchblade to be safe.One of the members in the greaser gang are Ponyboy who is 14 years. He is smart and was the only member that went to school out of his gang and brothers. He is Johnny's best friend and he has two brothers who are Darry and Soda and are in the gang. Darry is 20. He works at construction to take care of his brothers. Soda is 16. . He works at a gas station. These two gangs hate each other and are always fighting. It all starts when a greaser comes out of the movies and the socs get him and start to beat him up.S.E Hinton was only 15 when she started writing The Outsiders. She was inspired to write The Outsiders because one of her friends got jumped by a group of \\"nice\\" kids. She said that a lot of Ponyboy's thoughts were her thoughts. S.E Hinton was a tomboy. She played football and her closer friends were guys. She had friends from both sides. She didn't know that the guys she hung out with were greasers until one day they were walking down the street and the socs screamed at them, \\"Greasers.\\"The Outsiders is a great book. It explains the lives that the teenagers had and the two different gangs that don't get along with each other. It is also a great book because the teenagers that would read this book they would know how life was and would know how life is now and the gangs that they are on. I think that they would learn a lot of good things if they read this book. Even though this book is old you would be able to relate the teenagers with the gangs. After reading The Outsiders, I felt sad because is a life cycle that teenagers pass through and suffer just for being in a gang. It also touched my heart because three brothers fight against life to be together. I started with the poem because it says it all. The thing that the poem is trying to say is that at first life is great and it holds everything. Everything is a new but it only can last for an hour. Then everything goes away and nothing could stay forever."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Have you ever read a book that was so good you could not put it down? A book where you could relate to some of the characters and the problems they had? Have you ever thought that your brothers/sisters don't understand anything that you are going through in life and you just want them to get out of your business? Well that has happened to me and it happens in this book, The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton. It is a great book that all teenagers can relate to and understand very well.The story takes place in Oklahoma in the 1950's. It is about a group of poor friends that are in a gang called the \\"greasers.\\" They face a lot of problems with the rich kid's called \\"socs.\\" But throughout the story Ponyboy, the youngest from the gang, finds out that even the socs have their own share of problems.Ponyboy Curtis is the smartest and the youngest of the gang. He has two brothers. One is named Sodapop and he is 16 years old and another one is named Darry and he is 20 years old. Their parents died a couple years before in a car accident. So Darry, the oldest, takes care of Ponyboy and Sodapop. Darry is considered their guardian but if they get in trouble with the police they could be sent to a boy's home. Darry and Sodapop are also greasers. The greasers' lives are going great until someone takes things too far and changes their lives forever.I think that this is a very good book. While I was reading a summary of the book I saw a quote that immediately told me it was a drama and maybe a gang relative book. It was, \\"Nobody in this neighborhood's going to call the fuzz.\\" I think people who like teen drama would love this book. When I started reading this book I could not put it down. It got my attention so much. I could really relate to it because almost all the situations in the book are true ones that some teenagers go through. It talks about issues like the \\"in group,\\" the \\"out group,\\" gangs, and friends.The one thing that really got my attention in this book was that the author S.E. Hinton she wrote this book when she was fifteen. Then it got published when she was sixteen. She was a tomboy and she had friends that were greasers and socs. She found out that socs had their own share of problems too. She said that all of Ponyboy's thoughts were her thoughts too. Her inspiration to write this book was when one of her friends got jumped by these \\"nice kids\\" because they didn't like his being a greaser. She was very mad so she started pounding out a story of a boy who was beaten up while he was walking home from the movies. That was the beginning of The Outsiders. She also wrote other books like That was Then This is Now, Rumble Fish, and Tex. These books all have one thing in common, and that is that they all are teen related books that teenagers can understand. And even if the book was written a long time ago, teenagers today can still relate to it very well. I truly recommend this book to you and you will see that this book is filled with drama and action. Once you start reading this book, you will not want to put it down."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"this is the book that changed my life. i first read it as a teenager and recently re-read it. the emotions are still there, as are the fascinating characters like ponyboy and sodapop. i gave a copy to one of my nephews who is known to be a reluctant reader. he loved it just as much as i did, despite the 20+ year gap between us."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book- putting it as simply as possible- is amazing.

It got better. The first few chapters aren't that great but the rest is kinda good. There are 2 gangs who oppose each other in this book. The greasers and the Socs. {That is short for \\"socials\\"}. Not \\"socks\\". The whole book just revolves around the members of the greasers and one member who is a part of the gang, but doesn't claim himself one. Near the end of the book, {you probably guessed it} the 2 gangs face off and fight. Before that, the greasers aren't sure about everything since things are screwed plus the main character is an orphan to begin with. He's afraid he might be put in a boys' home as said in chapter 6. I have seen quite a few films which were books beforehand. They are all very close to each other and some are cool such as HOLES and/or TUCK EVERLASTING. The setting of \\"The Outsiders\\" is in Tulsa, Oklahoma in a very bad neighborhood where many of the Socs usually beat the living CRAP out of each other...litterally. There's not much the greasers can do about it because they're rebels and still only wait until the end because they occasionally talk about what they need to do about things like that and not procrastinate. Perhaps it sort of sends out an important message...besides, there IS a good poem that represents one of the situations they get into.

The combination of action, comedy, and tragedy makes this book 5 stars. Hinton really got into the characters' minds as each member of the Socs and the Greasers had a different personality and way of doing things. I recommend this book for ages 11-16."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I would say that this is a five star book because I thought it was good. The way the characters are described makes you feel like you know them. I felt the book had many strong points that can teach the reader things and would recommend it as a book to read."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book is narrated by Ponyboy the main character. The events of the book deal with the conflict between the Greasers and the Socs, what caused changes in the gang, and the importance of friendship.To the people who have not read this book yet, you've got to read it. It really makes you think about you and your friends."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book is soo good. Hinton really did a great job to get you to understnad and get to know the characters and how they felt. I loved it, I cried when Pony read Johnny's letter, but books that can get someone that emotional, over a book, defanitely must be wirth reading. The book had a great message, read it if you want an awesome pleasurable book. Thanks, Hinton."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book unlike a lot of other books is based on real life. The author describes the characters so well, especially Johnnycake, that you feel like you know them and can tell exactly what they are going to do next before it shows up on the next page. For me it was almost like I was at the comdemned church helping Ponyboy and Johnny get the school children out of the burning structure."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I loved this book. I read it within two days! Once I started, I couldn't stop!! It was so good, my parents are now reading it!!!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"So many others have said this but it is true. This book is so different from anything else that was available at the time and even now there is not one book that compares to it. It is realistic in terms of people and emotions. Adults, if you have not read this book, you should. When I was in high school I was a tutor for a remedial math class. These kids were reading &quot;The Outsiders&quot; in their English class. We could discuss it and for the first time we all connected. It sounds cheesy but it's true."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is the best book ever! It talks about the problems in life and that predjudice solves nothing. This book has suspense, action, drama, and a good moral. I have read two others by Hinton, and I almost enjoyed them as much as this one."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders was a great book that relates to a teenagers life in some or many ways.For example,in school teens are getting beat up for no reason just because they are not &quot;cool&quot;.That realtes to the book because the &quot;Socs&quot;(the popular,rich kids) like to go around and pick on or start fights with the &quot;Greasers&quot;(uncool,long hair,poor).The book is very descriptive in the text.In the begginning when Ponyboy(one of the main characters)is explianing what him and all the pepole involed with the book.For example He told how Soda hair color was even in the summer.Also during the fight when the explain how everyone got hurt and told how all the people in the fight felt.The Outsiders has alot of action put into the book.For example the way there is more then one thing going on in the book at once.I personally recomd the book &quot;The Outsider&quot; to read for all the details, how it realates and all the actoin."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"\\"Stay gold ponyboy\\" said Johnny to Ponyboy just before he died.Ponyboy lives with his two brothers. Their names are Darry and sodapop. Ponyboy is a 14 years old boy, which is in a click called \\"The Outsider\\" because he is the different one that likes to watch movies and read books. The Greasers, which are on Ponyboys side, they live on the eastside of town. The socs are the preps that live on the Westside of town and like to get in fights with the Greasers. The Greasers are mostly poor while the socs are the rich one that have nice up to date cars. Ponyboy Darry and Soda are brothers that have had to survive with out a mother or father. They go through a lot in this book and I think you will enjoy it. S.E Hinton did a good job with showing detail. It is a good class book with barely any boring parts so have fun and enjoy \\"The Outsiders\\""},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"First off, I would like to thank my teacher for letting our class read this book. Second, I think that this book deserves a 4 star award because it has some good qualities and some null qualities. Por la audience: This is a pretty good book because it speaks somewhat truthfully. It starts well enough because it has gangs and the usual troubles that come with it. It also has some qualities that other books lack. Such as the old-fashioned version of speaking. It also has things that don't make sense. For instance, it has the characters that think they are unbeatable. It has people that die, and it has people that are more of quantity than others. The Socials or Socs are a pretty decent members of society besides the fact that they jump poor people and treat anyone who can't afford their own clothes rudely and with extreme prejudice. I think however, that some people can be pretty odd at times. For instance, it has a gang called Greasers that are completely the opposite and aren't prejudiced in the least bit. They act accordingly to their own laws, and mostly they don't like fighting unless they absolutely have to. The Greasers dress poorly, wearing jeans and sleevless t-shirts or just normal shirts. While on the other hand, the Socs dress in Expensive clothing, drive expensive cars, and pretty much get a kick out of fighting with other gangs, such as the Greasers. Overall, this book is pretty well built, whether its the problems happening throughout the story, or the scenes depicted, it is an above average book altogether. This has been a 13 year old portraying his response to a fine story."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I think that the Outsiders was a good book.

His friend Johnny kills a Soc (social) defending him, and they had to run away so the police wouldn't find them. From there, things were really exciting and also really sad, and i can't count the number of times i cried while reading, althought it's not really one of those soppy, teary books.

That incident made Ponyboy and the rest of the gang realize that there is not one difference between a social and a greaser. This is a realistic novel, and I think that is why I like it so much.

My 8th-grade son was reading it for one of his classes and I made the effort to follow along. I am an avid reader with most of the books being nonfiction works. \\"The Outsiders\\" is a wonderful view of the illogical nature of class warfare between young adults. Perceptions reenforce actions and expectations in the different groups. The characters seem very authentic and, despite it being published in 1967, extremely relevant to kid culture even in present day. Ms. Hinton's book may be about almost exclusively male characters, but she certainly knew her subject matter. A great, touching, exciting, insightful story that not only young adults should read but there are plenty of American adults that should crack open this baby and learn something. It led to a few wonderful discussions with my son about the human condition.

They are not rich or poor they are somewhere in the middle, but the socs are rich.I think their relationship with each other is that they are like brothers because they are always together. They are almost the same because they are in the same gang and like fights except Ponyboy. Ponyboy is different than them because he doesn't like gangs and fights but since he is in the gang he has to fight. They are different because each of them like to do something else.The problem in the book is that the socs, the other gang, and the greasers are always fighting and another problem is that the socs beat up Johnny who is a greaser. Another problem is that Ponyboy almost got killed by the socs because they were drowning him and Johnny killed one of the socs and his name was Bob. He was like the leader of the socs.One interesting thing from the book is when they do the rumble. In the rumble they meet together, then they talk, then they start the fight. The first one that got hit by the socs was Ponyboy and he was on the floor almost the whole time. Everybody was fighting but then the socs were losing so they got a stick and they started hitting the socs. Then they left running so the socs won the rumble and they were celebrating.The greasers are like me because the greasers had a rumble and I did too. I had the rumble when I was in fifth grade. Some of my friend's names that were in the rumble are Maria and Omar.I think Ponyboy is like me because he looks young and I look young to. I think Johnny is like me because my parents use to fight a lot but now they don't and I felt bad when they would fight and I would get out of my house for a little bit so I wouldn't see them fight because I would get sad.I liked this book because it has a lot of action and because it helps people to don't be in gangs because it shows what could happen. I liked this book because it might help people to think after you do something bad. I recommend this book to all the people because this book is fun and I think everybody would like it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders was the best book I have read. It's by, S.E Hinton. There is a lot of suspense in this book. It wasn't ever boring. It kept me on the edge of my seat. There is a lot of action in the book. Things happen really quickly. Even when I was tired I still keep on reading. Things you don't expect will happen. Pony is the main character in this book. The rest of the characters are Johnny, Darry, Dalls, and Soda. Pony is 14 years old, Johnny is 16, Darry is 20, and Dalls is 20 also. Three people die in this book. There is conflict between the two gangs, the Greasers and the Socs. If you want to know who dies, you have to read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The OutsidersThe book The Outsiders was the greatest book that I have ever read. The author is S.E Hinton. It takes place in Oklahoma in the 1960's. It was always exiting and suspenseful. There wasn't one part that I thought was boring or put me to sleep. If you were picking a book to read with your friends, family, or just by your self I would suggest this book.It is about a high school gang, called the Greasers, that goes through many troubles. The gang faces the Soc's which is a different gang that is very rich. There are also a few Greasers that die from a fire.

The soces are groups of mean people who hate the greasers like Ponyboy and his brothers.I would reccomend this book to any boy that wants to read it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Great book, but I was a little shocked to see it come up when I searched for books for an 8 year old. This is definitely not appropriate material for a third grader. Maybe a sixth grader, or a particularly mature fifth grader, but with gang violence and death it's much too heavy for a kid under the age of 10. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under 12, personally."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"great! Was able to download quickly on my son's kindle fire. He was reading the book in class and wanted to be able to read it at home too."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book by S.E. Hinton, \\"The Outsiders\\", is a book I loved and my children loved when they were teenagers. I will now be giving it to my teenage granddaughter who, I know, will be just as fascinated and impacted by this honest, gritty and descriptive book as her parents (and grandparents) were when they were her age. I can't wait to see her reaction when she receives it (in a few weeks) and actually READS IT! It's a classic she'll never forget. I never have...and neither have either of my (grown) children. S.E. Hinton is a wonderful writer and I plan on giving both my grandchildren ALL of her wonderful, descriptive books...in which the emotional life of teenagers and young adults is so sensitively and honestly depicted."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I've read and reread this book since shortly after its release. It has now become an ongoing teaching standard at middle-school level. I still enjoy it immensely and that quirky ending usually sets off a reread marathon.

He wasn't too enthused but after getting into the book he enjoyed it and commented that it was very good. He finished the book in no time. I recall the storyline and would recommend this book for 8th grade or so. It's a good traditional life lesson regarding inner city youth but the values morals and life lessons fit teens in general. The price of $9.99 surprised me but I imagine it's that cost because its still relavant for school assignments."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The book came fast and in perfect condition. Exactly what the description was on the site. Not a thing wrong with it. I was pleased with everything to do with the delivery and product condition."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I had to read this book in 8th grade for an assignment. My aunt had just read it and encouraged me to do the same. At first, I was reluctant, as it was not a book I would normally pick up. Once I had to read it, I'm glad I did! From the first chapter to the very last page, I was hooked! Hinton's writing was electric! The book kept me turning pages! I had to know what happened next! Most people might veto it because of the violence, but I wouldn't. I even convinced my mom and brother to read it. My brother isn't too hot on books, but I think he likes it. Then, of course, I had to have the movie. Not as good as the book, but definitely something I would want to watch over and over again. I would reccomend this book to any of my friends and family. Wait to go Hinton!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders takes place during 1960s in a small town in Oklahoma. It is a story narrated by the protagonist and main character, Ponyboy. It follows the lives of Ponyboy and his gang, explaining the hardships they must go through as lower-class \\"greasers\\" versus their rivals the \\"Socs\\", who are the West-side rich kids. They live hard lives as it is, but when Ponyboy and his friend Johnny are involved in a murder things take a turn for the worse. Not only does Ponyboy have to run away, but he also has to deal with the struggle between him and his brothers remaining a family. Ponyboy has a journey of self-discovery throughout the novel. S.E. Hinton does a great job at writing the story through Ponyboy's eyes in a way that the reader can relate to him. This is because she was only 15 years old when she started writing it.I remember reading this book in elementary school and falling in love with it. It is a great book for young adults to read because of the themes they can relate to. It is a heartwarming story about fitting in and friendship that makes me tear up each time I read it. Even more than 10 years later, reading it again, it was still as wonderful as I remembered. I would recommend reading this book at least once in your life."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders by S. E. Hinton is an emotional story about a group of \\"greasers\\". Greasers are poor boys who drink, smoke and get into trouble, they wear a lot of grease in their hair, hence the name \\"greasers\\". The main character, Ponyboy, tells the story of his experiences living in rough neighborhoods in Oklahoma in the 1950s with his gang and his brothers. Ponyboy and his friend, Johnny get into a lot of trouble and have to skip town. The story gives great examples of cause and effect and reminds us of consequences to our actions. It uses plenty of characterization and completely draws in the reader. I read the whole book in one day because I couldn't put it down. In my opinion, the plot and difficult situations throughout the book wouldn't be appropriate for anyone under the age of thirteen. It is a tragic story at times, but truly shows the close and loving friendships and brotherhood between characters. The theme of the book explains the conflict between the rich and poor boys in town and how, at the end of the day, they're not as different as they seem. It's a great read, I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I guess I didn't think this book was so great. It is told from an interesting point of view, but the plot development was too shallow. The beggining is better than the end because there is more description and detail at the beggining. I don't know about other people, but from where I am, this book has no relation to present-day occurences, and I certainly can't relate to it at all."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"It still confuses me as to why teachers insist that this book is read and analyzed in school. S.E. Hinton wrote this novel when she was still very young, and trust me, it shows. I give her credit for trying to write a book while still in high school, but her plot couldn't have been more obvious, her details more unrealistic and unnecessary, and her characters less like gang-members. Ponyboy and his two brothers, along with a few friends, make up a gang that represents the \\"greaser\\" faction of their school, with their rivals being the rich \\"Socs.\\" S.E. Hinton is obviously a woman, and her characters that are supposed to be strong and completely masculine are instead incredibly feminine. Perhaps she should have written from the point of view of a girl; it's hard to write from the viewpoint of a different gender at such a young age. Her story was terribly obvious, and I didn't find it poignant at all. This book drew very little emotion from me. As I sat in my seventh grade class reading the story of Ponyboy and his friends, I found myself to be bored and dissatisfied. Her only redeeming point can be found in her usage of the words, \\"Stay gold, Ponyboy\\"- although even that metaphor is easy to see through. All in all, this is a truly mind-numbing book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I think 'The Outsiders' was a great book!! It taught people that like 'Greasers' and 'Socs' (soshes) no matter if you have money or are more popular everyone should always be treated equally. 'The Outsiders' had many different emotions including shock when Johnny killed Randy or happiness when Ponyboy met Cherry Valance. 'The Outsiders' was a very touching story. This book was well written and was really just fantastic!!! Although there is a murder in the book it shows there's a little hero in all of us just like Ponyboy Curtis, Johnny, or Dallas Winston! I think that a moral in this story that PROBABLY WASN'T intended was that police are bad' because they shot Dallas without even giving him a chance to explain. But you should still trust a police officer when your in trouble. If you haven't read 'The Outsiders' yet, I suggest that you do!!! Well what are you waiting for? Go read The Outsiders!!!! Thanks for reading my review and I hope you'll read this wonderful book 'The Outsiders' !!!!!!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This was an awesome book! I recommend it to all ages.

I finally found it one day and couldn't put it down. Very good story. The only thing I didn't like was the names of each character in the book. Also the fight scene that was built up in the whole book was way too short when the fight finally happens!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"My son really enjoyed this book and since has purchased several other of her books."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Nick WrightThe OutsidersThe outsiders is a book about two groups of who don't get along. One of the Groups is the Socs, who are the rich kids. Then the Greasers, who are the poor kids with a tough life.My favorite part in The Outsiders was when Johnny and Ponyboy saw the church that they were living at was on fire. There was school kids around and one of the teachers told everyone there were kids still in the house. Ponyboy and Johnny jumped in a brokenwindow. They saved the kids that were in the burning house. Johnny and Dallas were hurt while doing this. This showed that greasers aren't uncaring people who wouldn't help someone. This was my favorite part because I think it made a lot of Socs change there perspectives about greasers.I think that this is a great book for everyone who can understand it. This book shows a lot of different things. I think this book shows that even though you're different people you can still be friends and have stuff in common. It shows that everyone needs friends and that people have to work out there differences. Also it teaches the lesson that you don't pick where you come from but you can be friends with anybody. I think The Outsiders was a great book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"i realy like this book because it show what the realy meaning of persevre is because in this book the characters never gives up and there always toghether, and I think is a realy good book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I really liked the this book, particularly way the book was written. It was a very, very good book. But, even at the age of 14 I had to read the ending twice, and I still don't quite understand it, but I would certainly recommend this book to anyone. Like I already said, it is a very well written book. The author, S.E. Hinton, let's the readers know exactly how the characters are feeling. She does such a good job, that there were actually moments when I felt like I was part of \\"the gang\\"."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I purchased this audio book to help my students with reading disabilties.

I read it many years ago and wanted to re-read it. It was as I remembered and I thank you for sending it so quickly."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Despite some complaints I saw about the narrator's accent, this has been a success with my classes. I did inform them in advance that Hinton was from Oklahoma, so she probably wrote the characters to be in a city in that state, so they would have southern/western accents. After that, it didn't seem to be a big deal for anyone."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"A 3.5 is my true rating, but I wasn't able to set a half mark. No matter--at first, the voice on the cd didn't seem to fit the character I had in my mind. I agree with one of the other reviews; the twang was too much. But, after you listen to it for awhile, it's not so bad. Over half of my students enjoyed it as much, or more, as listening to me read it, and it's about them so it was worth the money. Still, if it was re-recorded with a different voice, I'd spend the money again for my own satisfaction."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is often considered S.E Hintons' best book and I'd have to agree. It is a first person book with the main Character Ponyboy narrating it. Ponyboy is a 14 year old kid who is raised by his two older brothers because both his Parents had died. He, his brothers, and his friends are members of the Greasers, a gang consisting of lower to middle class guys who rival the Socs, the more wealthy people. The gangs have several fights so there is no shortage of action in this book.One of the things that makes this book great is the ups and downs that Ponyboy has to go through. A big down moment occurred to when his best friend Johnny severely injured his back in an attempt to rescue others from being harmed. The emotional impact this made on Ponyboy was very well described and the whole situation made you want to read on.Overall, I think this is a very good book, certainly worth taking the time to read. The Characters are all well drawn out with their distinct personalities. Some of the things that prevented me from giving this book a 5 star rating were that the history of the gangs and why they were formed were never described. Also, I have read better books before, but this is a very good book, and I would recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"After watching the movie, I had decided to purchase the book.

I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Although its hard not to notice minor similarities with this and Westside Story I would have to consider this Hintons best book. Whereas Westside Story is \\"ethnic\\" and urban The Outsiders is seen from the white working class viewpoint (which is rare)in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The Outsiders is also a great story on top of that. Just talk to a few old timers and you can also find out that things like what went on in this book were far from a rare occurence. Big rumbles happened quite a bit back in the day. But there is a lot more to this book than the big fight towards the end of this book.You basicly have a sensitive kid whose parents are dead and his late teen brothers are forced to drop out of school to make ends meet and their group of friends who are all tough working class white teens who look out for each other and operate like a surrogate family. There are constant conflicts between them and the kids from the other side of the tracks whose families have more money. One of their group kills one of the rich kids in self defense and two of them go on the run. The whole thinng culminates in a big rumble. I can't give too much more away without ruining the story but its well worth reading."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Why should you stay golden?Because it's so easy to lose yourself when things get out of control.

This book us powerful all the way till the end I enjoyed reading this book from start to finish.-Shauna Cunningham"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Ben dagen block 2Have you ever wondered how bad gangs are? This book is a book that teens should read. I believe this because it offers another teen's point of view on current teen issues. In this story the characters discover that everyone has basically the same problems just to different extents, and intensities depending on their social class and group.The main character in this book is ponyboy, a 14-year-old boy who is classified as a greaser or hood. Then the leader on the opposing side, the soc's, is bob a big mean prep that terrorizes the greasers.This book is a very quick read, if I had not been kept at the same pace as the class I would've finished this book in a single setting. This book is also a very good piece of literature. The author uses the same language that teens of the time period would've. This book is a book written to appeal to people of all ages and genders. I believe this book should be read by all teens for the simple reason that it shows life how it really is in some places"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders Puffin Books, 1967, 180 pp, $ 7.99S.E.

Well that's what Pony boy lives through.In \\"Outsiders\\" written by S.E. Hinton, Ponyboy lives with his two brothers Sodapop, and Darry. Ponyboy is always running from Mustangs and Stingray Corvettes carrying loads of SOCs or a gang of rich kids who prey on kids of their age that have a financial status lower than their own. Ponyboy isn't willing to beat down a SOC at any time. He doesn't carry weapons, he is polite to girls, and he actually cares about people, Ponyboy and his friends Steve, Johnny, Dally, and Two-Bit are all together with some other allied gangs waging war against SOCs. One day when Darry slaps Ponyboy for being late home, Pony runs away with Johnny. They get attacked by some SOCs that accuse them of \\"hanging with their girls\\". That night Pony and Johnny have to run away to an old abandoned church after one SOC takes things to far!I recommend this book of historical fiction, action and unexpected twists to sixth graders and above because that's what I liked!

In their city, there are two groups of social classes. The lower class are called Greasers and are known for their &quot;tuff&quot; (cool) hair. THe high class are called Socials, or Socs. The story follows a 14 year old named Ponyboy, who lives with his two older brothers, Darry and Sodapop, because their parents died earlier. The Greasers are close friends that always stick together and have various fights with the Socs to defend their name. Ponyboy and his best friend Johnny got into a fight with some Socs one night and ended up killing a Soc accidentally. They hid in a church in the countryside and they stayed there for several days. They left for dinner once and when they returned, they saw that the church was on fire. They rescued children that were inside and became heroes, but they still had to worry about the murder and the police finding them. Even worse, Johnny's life was being threatened by serious burns and the Greasers had to learn to stick together even more to get through the hard times to come."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I think this book was a great book.

He thought that Darry really didn't care but he saw him sort of crying and they gave each other hugs. That was sweet. I also like it because there was some action and hattred that made me read more. Like when they were having a rumble.Another thing that made me like this book was the fact that there was real close friendships and caring going around. Everyone cared about Jonny and always respected him. The sadest part in this book was when Jonny was dead. I thought that was sad because to me he was like an innocent.

That was sad because Dally lost the only person he really cared about.

It also shows us the lives of a gang of Greasers. Three of them are brothers whose parents died in an automobile accident and are left to fend for themselves. But they have friends to help. All six of them are different in many ways but also are the same. In the end it's different than the beginning but they will work through it together."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"&quot;The Outsiders&quot;The Outsiders, a book which I was assigned to read, was surprisingly good. When it was first given to the class I had doubted that it would have an in-depth plot. However, to my chagrin, the story turned into an involving tale about teenage gangs in the 60's. In the story, a few members of the &quot;Greasers&quot; get into rather serious trouble when they kill a &quot;Social&quot;. In order to avoid being caught two of the murderers flee to country where they hide out for a week. When they return, their lives had changed like they never imagined they would.I believe that this book represents the results of gang activity. It has changed slightly over the years, but the general result remains. This book's real-life plot was enjoyable and informative. I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to read a book with a true-story resemblance and a few interesting surprises."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I think the Outsiders was a good book. It's about a little gang called the Greasers and they always fight another gang called the Soc's. It's a good book for ages 12-15 cause kids at that age always act like little Thugs and Homie G's. Well when I read the book I got interested in it and I don't even read books that much. I think everyone should read this book. It's all about a gangs life and how they live in a city. Next time you go to the library check this book out sometime."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book is a good book about two different ways of living between the Socs and the Greasers. The narrator is a boy Greaser who shows us the good and hard times about being a greaser. However, if you do not like violence, I don't think you should read this book. There are a lot of situations in this book that contains violence. Overall, I really liked this book, because most books we read in school aren't very good. If you like stories with some violence and a lot of thoughts and emotions going on between the characters then you should read &quot;The Outsiders.&quot;"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I think The Outsiders is a very good book. It gets into the story pretty fast and doesn't go off the subject. It is very dramatic and intense, especially when one of the main characters' friends gets scared and makes a dangerous situation lethal. I reccommend this book for kids that are at leat 9 or 10."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I thought this book was a good book.

The characters seemed so real, and I loved the close relationships between the three brothers and the friends. This is a really short book so would be good for teenagers who don't like reading. Despite the cast of future big stars, the movie wasn't as good as the book. I have read all S.E. Hinton's later books and also enjoyed them."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I had to read this book for Literacy, and I thought it was gonna be boring, but it wasn't.

He may seem that he is really strong, but really he is a normal boy going through a lot of pain. I think that he is really brave becuase he lost his parents, and then he goes through a lot of trouble because of the death of the boy in the other &quot;gang&quot;. I think that most of the time, Ponyboy was trying to hide al his pain, and I thought that was brave too becuase that is really hard. I think that this book has been one of the best books I have ever read becuase it is really real and it is serious. I would recommend this book to strong readers because sometimes it gets a little hard and confusing."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The prettiest book I have ever read is The Outsiders.

That was one of the best Tuesday nights I have ever spent in my life."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I thought the Outsiders by S.E. Hinton was a great book. It was a little humorous and it showed realistic problems and how they're solved. But what I enjoyed most about the Outsiders is, it was a story of an everlasting friendship amoung adolesence. The Outsiders focused on two gangs, the Socs and the Greasers. The main character, Ponyboy, is different from the rest and is kind of caught in the middle. Throughout the story their alikes and differences are expressed. I recommend this book for teens. I recommend it for teens because teenagers could relate to the issues these characters face.

They were trying to dround him when Johnny pulls out his switch blade and kills one of the socs. But my favorite part of the book was the rumble. The book was good but the had to much mushy stuff. I think that Ponyboy and Johnny got to soft, they could have been more like Two Bits.Othe then that the book was prety good.

I really like to read but I can't read unless I'm really interested in the book, and let me tell you, I was really interested! This book gave me outrageous mood swings of happiness, sadness, enjoyment, sympathy. I swear, there wasn't a second when I wasn't feeling something! If I am only 12, and in grade 7 and I can read it, I'm sure that everyone else can! S.E. Hinton has written a masterpiece and it should be all of our duties to read it!

It bores me, but for some reson I can't put this book down. These characters are great. Ponyboy is my favorite! He seems like he is really nice, and he really cares. Unlike Dally who you think might not care as much, but really does. This book was outstanding, its on the top of my list. I have never read anything like it. My favorite character besides Ponyboy must be Sodapop. He is just so great, he is always there and careing. He is also always trying to help Ponyboy in anyway that is possible. Soda really looks out for Ponyboy and I think that is great to have someone like that. Who is always helping you and asking whats wrong when you seem down, and just loving him more then anything and showing that he actually cares. And once again this book is great!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders are a wounderful book It is full of excitements and ful of sensory details.

THe Book should get award bbecause of its realistic fetures."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I'm someone who's read many books before in my short life, but The Outsider surpasses many of the other great books i've read. The way the author was able to have the readers relate to the story kept the readers reading, which is great! I'm not someone who cries a lot, and it takes a lot to make me cry. I cried while i was reading this book. I felt it was so real. i pity the greasers. after this book i swear i'll never in my life look at people poorer then me in a negative way. If they act mean i swear it on my heart that i'll try and befriend them. I do not pity Ponyboy, Johnny, Dallas, Sodapop, or Darry. Instead, i feel for them, not out of pity but because when the great characters died in the book i felt the same exact pain the characters felt. i know i'm rambling, but there's just so much thought about this book in my mind to put it in good words so I'll stop here. To tell you the truth, no words can say how great this book really is."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"\\"Things are tough all over\\" If you think that all the rich kid got it made, so you can think again. The book The Outsiders will make you understand this. You will soon realize that even if you have a lot of money and get all the breaks challenges will always come. Soces and greasers really do have it tough all over. Even though this book is a historical fiction, it is also an adventure book.The greasers are the normal lower class citizens, but are always loyal to their friends.the7y get their name from the large amounts of grease in their hair, also because most of them don't have a lot of money. Soces are the town bullies, in the upper class of the society. The soces get their name because of how rich hand snobby they are. Their idea of a good time is Jumping (beating up) greasers.In the outsiders Ponyboy Curtis, the main character, is tough and yet sensitive. Dallas Winstein is not sensitive at all he is mean and as hard as nails. Johnny is the quieter of the bunch but he is tough when he needs to be. In this book Johnny and ponyboy go on an amazing adventure from murder the saving the lives of little children.It all starts when Ponyboy Johnny and their friend two-bit walk Cherri and Marcia (two girls they met at the drive-in movies) home, when they get jumped by their boyfriends. Later that night Johnny and Ponyboy fall asleep in an open lot, watching the stars. When they wake up they realize what they did so Ponyboy runs home and gets in a fight with his older brother Darry. Darry accidentally hits pony so pony runs away and met Johnny. They decided to walk to the park when they met the boyfriends of Cherri and Marcia. As they try to drown Pony, Johnny comes from behind with a knife. Johnny stabs one of the boyfriends. That is how they start their exciting adventure.The outsiders are a very exciting book about adventure, family, friendship, courage, and bravery. The author shows great word choice, background, good voice, fluency, sense of adventure, and much more. MY opinion about this book is that it was intriguing to read and told a good story about life that every person should be aware of. In conclusion this book is an excellent reader for all ages. Also it is especially good for class room or family education."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Outsiders: a novel about a young boy and his gang the greasers.

But you will soon realize it's a heartfelt story. It gives emotion and shows love and the power of friendship.Ponyboy, a 14 year-old hoodlum, is growing up with his controlling older brother Darry, and his softer brother sodapop who's the only one Pony can relate to. He's a good kid, and does great in school, and is just like every other boy his age, but the only problem is that he's a greaser. As a greaser, Pony and his gang are constantly fighting the Soc; the upper class.All the conflicts start when Johnny, Pony's best buddy, end up going to a movie together one night.

This story is full of suspense and will likely keep you in tuned."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I think the book the outsiders is a really realistic book and it is like real live.

Darry is like the father of the house hold. I think that the rumble was well though out part of the book. But the part when Dally dies I though was not as well though out."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a story written by S. E. Hinton for all ages. Ponyboy, the protagonist, lives situations maybe a normal boy never lives, and because of that, he, his two older brothers and his gang learns to see things from a different point of view. The gang and all of the Greasers, how the boys living in the same area as Pony are called, have a lot of problems with Socs, the rich boys. Because of one incident with some Socs, life changes completely for our characters, and since that moment, he has to decide staying there and do not do anything, or keep moving. Definitely, a very good story with a lesson to take and a message to get for all of us."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"Ralph the mouse just can't resist trying to ride the toy motorcycle someone left on the hotel room tabel.

This looks SO dumb! Ponyboy? What kind of name is THAT?? But after the first three or so chapters, I couldn't put it down! I was supposed to read to Chapter three, but I finished it! This book comes from such a different point of view that I have ever known, and I could still relate to the character.Ponyboy is sensitive, but tries to hide it, because they're greasers, and have got to be tough, like the other kids in his gang. They smoke, cuss, and are still great friends with one another. The socs are mean, meaner than the greasers, even. One night, though, something awful happends, and the book just keeps getting better and better.I would reccomend this book to ALL kids over eleven or twelve, because some of the material might not be that great for kids under that age. This book teaches us that no matter what a person looks like, they have a heart and feelings too, and we should always consider that before we judge a person."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a great book! It's about two groups of boys and their sturggle with racism. When I started this book I couldn't put it down. It's an easy read and I'm sure everyone could read it. I rated this book 5 stars because of the authors unique style of writing, cicular writing, and her descriptive writing. I watched the movie shortly after reading the book and the movie is not good at all when you compare it to the book."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This is the most amazing book I have ever read. I feel like I know each charactor personally because each one is so well described and had such a significant part in the book. I can relate each charactor so well, but especially Dally. I can read this book five times through and still cry. This book reaches out to me, and sooo many of my friends have gotten hooket on it, too. The Outsiders is an example how boys can be sensitive, but still be tough. And it gives a great example of how friends can be closer to you than family. If I had to choose one book to read over and over again, this would be it."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"That's what I thought when I saw my daughter reading this classic for an English assignment. I've read this book too many times to remember so, I read it yet again the minute she left the house! An all time classic which will always be a part of a schools reading list in my opinion. This tale is about a group of teenagers who are growing up in less than perfect conditions. The story is narrated by 'Ponyboy' who feels there are only two groups of people in the world. Soc's and Greasers which he is. He tells a tale that leaves you teary eyed. Mum's, if you kids bring this book home from school and you've never read it, grab it!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders is a book that I think everyone has to read in their life.

Over all, I love this book!"},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"The Outsiders was the second book I read by S.E. Hinton. The first was Rumble Fish, which I hated. I had to read the Outsiders for school, and I dreaded having to read another S.E. Hinton novel. I read it not expecting any enjoyment. Well, I was wrong. I read it in one day because I couldn't stop. The story was engaging, and I cared about the characters. I kept telling myself that I would stop at the end of the chapter I was reading, but I would just keep reading. I wanted to slow down to savor the moments and give them some thought, but I was too caught up in the story. The book has some very emotional moments that I didn't realize until I felt the tears on my own face. I rarely cry at movies or reading a book. I thought Titanic belonged in the comedy genre. Usually I would just sit back and think, 'well that was touching', and go back reading dry-eyed.My favorite character was Dallas Winston. He was one of the greasers. Strangely, he was the one I understood the most. His actions in the book made sense to me.The Outsiders was a great book, and I loved it. I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"This book is ok it has kind of wild out of this world names like ponyboy and sodapop. If you like gang fights and fighting themes this is the book for you. Its only a couple bucks so buy it and read it for yourself. I'm not a book person but this is a good book.

I didn't really have the first clue about gang rivals and the struggles that take place in the lower class society. This book opened a new understanding for a child from Eufaula, AL. Now, twelve years has passed, and I see in our world today the same struggles for young teens all over our country.

If you are a good reader and you closely look at this book you can understand very much . Fighting is the result of misunderstanding . A sentence depends upon the way you take it . Here is a sentence &quot;do you want water &quot; . If a person asks her enemy she will think like this [she is asking me as if i don't have it or i begged for it ]. It can also be taken like this &quot;she is giving me water even though she has only a little . How kind of her &quot;.In this way an ordinary sentence can also be taken in a complicated way. If you want to end fighting in the world take a sentence in a friendly way so that by seeing you even she can change . And one thing about friendship is that you should believe that person with your whole heart and never ever doubt it . If you have a doubt never make friendship and break that person's heart . I not only like you to read but everyone in this world so that there will be no more fighting . Fighting is mainly going on land . Honestly this world is made by God and nothing is yours until he tells you . So why ther's a need of taking visa to come to another country . If you believe in someone you don't need to do this . To believe someone you should take all her words in a friendly way then by seeing your friendship she will change herself completly ."},{"Title":"Outsiders","review":"I first read this book some ten years ago in school.

Ms. Garmey actually did a pretty good job of making it clear that there was. This book goes much further, though, and should I think be required reading for anyone who wants to know what British food is really all about. (Note: I've not been to the UK, though I'd like to. But I figure the BBC's poll results are about as close as I can get for the time being.)First off, it's an excellent deal -- the US price of $$$$ is only a dollar or so more than the UKP12.99 cover price. It's a fairly typical British television cookbook, impeccably laid out with near-pornographic food shots and a mouthwatering cover picture of the iconic British quickie dinner, fish and chips, newspaper and all. It's a slim book, with just over a hundred recipes divided into ten categories, including Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Convenience, Outdoor, Party, Comfort, Tea, Festive, and even Food of Love (chocolate gets heavy play here). The book revels in its demographic data, showing differences between male and female tastes as well as regional flavors.Surprises abound. The convenience food chapter is utterly dominated by Indian and Chinese dishes, as might be expected, but Fish and Chips is the #1. American favorites like doughnuts (said to be a teatime favorite in Wales), brownies, and chili (percieved as a Mexican dish) appear all over the book as well. Scones and clotted cream are tops in the tea category, but some old standbys like steak and kidney pie don't even rate in the top ten of the dinner category. The surprise favorite dinner: Spaghetti Bolognese, an oddity that perhaps reflects the more cosmopolitan tastes of a wired voter base.The recipes are by and large hip updates to tradition; the scones have a twist of lemon zest, while the roast beef and Yorkshire pudding includes a red wine gravy (a favorite in my house for a few years) and mustard-and-thyme Yorkies. A hamburger recipe transforms the humble burger into lavash-wrapped kofta patties. Bangers and mash gets a hard cider and leek gravy. (A special word must be set aside for the rather uncategorizable (and probably indigestible) \\"Sausage, Bean, and Egg Bake with Oven-Baked Chips\\", a peculiar perversion of the classic English breakfast presented primarily as a hangover cure. Your guess is as good as mine as to exactly what that word is.)This is a book that reveals a culture that may have perhaps gone a bit over the edge with food, but has definitely come to terms with and thoroughly overcome its reputation as a culinary wasteland. To read this book is to see a Great Britain that has learned how to eat, and how to appreciate the blessings of a multicultural heritage at the table (if, perhaps, not in other ways just yet). It's not perfect -- food writer Nigel Slater, author of the foreword, expresses skepticism at some of the outcomes of the poll, which I believe can be explained by the Internet-centered nature of the poll. However, though it's a tough book to find in the US, but it's not an expensive one, and very much worth the trouble to order."},{"Title":"French, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand French with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"They always say, if you are going to visit Paris, you should try to learn a little French. Even a little, and the dreaded haughty Parisians are much more tolerant and may even trot out their textbook English to help you along.I took a few years of French a looong time ago, and for me this is the perfect program. It helped me to be able to visualize the words I was speaking but have the major focus on the pronunciation. I could remember back into the distant past and envision the spelling as I spoke. Without that distraction, I am able to focus on my pronunciation, which is the most intimidating part of speaking French for me. (All those guttural Rs, and they do not all sound the same....) After going through the 16 lessons on this set, I am really delighted with what I have learned and retained. So much so that I want to learn more...but more on that later.Pimsleur seems to be pushing their software programs more these days. I really wanted audio CDs. The 1/2-hour lesson format is perfect for my work commute. There are no written materials, it's all about how the words sound, and that worked really well for me. I feel like I have enough French to get along for a relatively brief visit, and to impress my traveling companions who, I am confident, will not have nearly as much French in their brains as I will.The downside for me has absolutely nothing to do with this particular product but rather with how Pimsleur markets their programs. This set of 16 lessons is very reasonably priced. When I got to the end I felt like I could use a little more. There is no way to buy lessons 17-32 by themselves, and the cost of 1-32 is several times the cost of 1-16. If you are determined, as I was, to continue with the Pimsleur course, it's worth it to shop around - prices vary widely. However, it's hard not to feel a little used and abused by Pimsleur's marketing strategy.Anyway, I enthusiastically recommend this set for the traveler who wants to pick up some essential French. The program is very thoughtfully designed for that purpose."},{"Title":"French, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand French with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"For my POSITIVE COMMENTS, please refer to my separate review of PIMSLEUR FRENCH that I posted under the COMPREHENSIVE version of this language programme. You should be aware that the \\"abbreviated\\" versions of this otherwise excellent programme were introduced by Simon & Schuster as a LOW-PRICED TEASER, in an effort to entice you to purchase the infinitely more complete COMPREHENSIVE courses. However, the \\"abbreviated\\" versions contain nothing more than the first few lessons of the \\"comprehensive\\" versions. So, if you purchase these low-priced teasers and then purchase the Comprehensive-I package, you will have paid for the first 8 or 16 lessons twice. Believe me, if you purchase the abbreviated version, you WILL be enticed! So, do yourself a favour and simply purchase the Comprehensive-I package.

I bought this level of CDs because it was the cheapest Pimsleur CDs I could afford at the time. Overall, I am impressed with the Pimsleur method, the lessons are around 25 minutes in length each, and the method of instruction forces you to pay attention and participate. When I mentioned the instruction working subconsciously, this refers to the Pimsleur method increasing my ability to \\"think in French,\\" rather than going through a mental translation from English to French, which has been a problem for me despite my conversational ability. However, you are unlikely to learn any new vocab from this CD, I consider it a CD to give a mental foundation to assist in further French learning. For vocab, I recommend the \\"Living Language\\" brand French Learner's Dictionary, it has helped me a lot. When I bought this set, it came with a convenient CD case, which has a \\"Pimsleur\\" logo, but does not specify that it is a French CD set.

The learning tool is great in theory, however, it doesn't teach you much besides, \\"would you like to have some wine at my place?\\". It gets kind of weird after a while when the woman starts teaching you how to say, \\"sir, you don't understand me. I don't want to have a drink with you or go back to your place later.\\" I definitely picked up on the language, but I also learned how to pick up on a stranger, which isn't something I was hoping to take away from this lesson for my upcoming trip for my wedding anniversary. It's a decent learning tool and maybe I would have been more satisfied if I bought the whole French package...possibly I would have learn more. But when I finished this set, I felt like I wasted time learning useless phrases. I would have preferred a more traveler-friendly version, not creepy-pick-up version.

I took french in high school and college and I didn't learn the pronunciation the right way in a lot of the words.

For me, it has served its purposs.However, if you are looking to learn a language, this is not the way to go. Reading the fine print, you'll find that this is actually only one small part of language learning program, and doesn't even fully qualify you for a 'money back gaurentee.' When looking at the price of the full program, you're better off going with Rosetta Stone.I purchased a Rosetta Stone package with levels 1-3 for Spanish, and I can honestly say it's the best languge immersion program I've come across. So basically, if you already have a foundation in a foriegn language and are looking to become more fluent in conversation, this is an adaquate option. If you're trying to learn a language completely, look else where (possibly Rosetta Stone)."},{"Title":"French, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand French with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"When i was learning Spanish i tried many programs (like Penton Overseas & Learn Spanish in Your Car) and I gave them all up because there was no way i could remember all those random phrases just by repeating them. (I am now conversational in Spanish and NONE of my skills can be attributed to those audio CDs). However, I am very pleased with Pimsleur so far. They play a conversation in the target language and then break it down piece by piece. By learning this way you'll be able to form sentences that actually are appropriate to whatever situation you find yourself in. To aid retention, every few minutes or so they'll go back to a word that you should have already learned... really makes your brain work. And they also have the speaker pause before answering to give you a chance to come up with the answer.If you want to become fluent in another language, I would suggest using this program along with a traditional instructor-led course. You won't learn the ins and outs of grammar with this audio program. But if you just want to be able to get around in a French speaking country on vacation, this is your best bet.If you're still debating on whether or not the program is worth the money, go on to Pimsleur's website and take the free downloadable lesson. That way you will be able to see if this is the right learning style for you."},{"Title":"French, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand French with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"I bought this course for my wife to help her review her French.

I found that I could speak Spanish without even thinking about what I was saying in English. This is definitely the best language instruction method I have ever tried -- and I have tried a few, including a year of Spanish in college.On caveat, the Pimsleur conversational course is designed to teach you how to speak and understand the spoken language. It is not particularly helpful for teaching you how to read and write the language.

I would caution that unless you are really amazingly swift, you will likely need to do each lesson a couple of times to really nail it, other than perhaps the first couple. It's not like I could have a deep conversation yet, but I could do some of the basics now. My only bone to pick here is that the 16 lessons of this set are also the first 16 of the 30 lesson comprehensive set. So I've now ordered that one to continue on when this is over, but I will have already done the first 16 lessons of the 30 in that set. I guess if you know it is going to work for you I'd skip buying the 16 lesson set and go for the 30 lesson right off to save money overall.

This conversational set should keep me occupied for months to come I am sure."},{"Title":"French, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand French with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"I have found this product to be very helpful indeed.This product will help you to speak French and also to have a better understanding of what questions might be asked of you while visiting this country.We are learning how to speak a little more French that we have been able to in the past while in France and to be able to understand the meaning of the different pronounciations of words is amazing.What I thought I was saying in the past was not exactly correct but hopefully before my next visit to France I will be more adept at the language with the help of Pemsleur!"},{"Title":"French, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand French with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"This product is very useful if you have little knowledge of conversational French & it is a good review if you already have some understanding of the language. I haven't finished the CDs yet but I'm enjoying the practice & listening to native speakers. I'll have to do an update review after I get back from France to see whether Pimsleur's method worked for me. So far it's fun."},{"Title":"French, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand French with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"I've used Pimsleur to brush up on Spanish and to learn conversational French. It's a very simple program - you just listen and speak back when you're prompted for 30 minutes a day. There's very, very little theory, and no spelling involved, which is an issue with French. With this alone, you wouldn't be able to travel to France and read street signs and menus. It does develop speaking skills, rudimentary (and useful) vocabulary, and all-important confidence. I'd recommend using this at the same time as the Rosetta Stone programs, which is great for vocabulary, grammar, and spelling, but lacking in helping you to develop conversational skills."},{"Title":"French, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand French with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"Easy to follow. Lots of repetition. After two weeks I can understand some French without translating in my head. I'm still having trouble speaking, but with other learning methods I could speak but not understand."},{"Title":"French, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand French with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"The Pimsleur system is absolutely excellent. I purchased Rocket French on-line which is the highest rated on-line language learning program (according to PC Magazine) and this is better. I had some knowledge of French which was helpful as I already had a basic vocabulary and understood how to conjugate verbs. So I was able to progress quite quickly. For those who learn best visually I would also recommend a workbook to supplement the audio.\\"(such as \\"The Ultimate French Review and Practice.\\") Great to listen to when driving, walking or playing games on the computer. As someone who teaches people how to teach I highly recommend this product.

The audio program is a quick way to learn phrases handy to travelers, like \\"how much is it\\", \\"where is it\\"? One of my favorite aspects is learning the language without an American accent. The 30 minute length for each lesson is very doable. I will buy the Pimsleur program any time I travel internationally."},{"Title":"French, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand French with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"This is the first French language product that has been an effective tool for me to actually learn French. I've taken local classes, used Rosetta Stone, and purchased Smart French audio CDS. Yes...I am an old dog and its very hard for me to learn new tricks. Pimsleur was effective because of the reviews that occur throughout the audio set. You just don't memorize it one time and then never hear it again. The next session builds on the previous session with a some \\"new material\\" and by the end you've built a \\"small\\" but effective vocabulary. I also learned specific language rules that were omitted or assumed common knowledge in my French class. I understand that other users may want a written book or guide. However, I've found that with French, it is better NOT to know how the word is spelled because it doesn't sound anything like the way it's spelled. It's definitely better to learn the correct pronounciation FIRST. I highly recommend this audio series. It was much more effective than the Smart French Audio CDs."},{"Title":"French, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand French with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"This is a fantastic product, and one of the best ways to really get an early handle on grammar, and an outstanding way to practice speaking and pronounciation at any level. However, please do not do not get disapointed when you don't speak perfect French in 8 hours. This will give you basic tools to build on, but then you need to spend some time in a French country, or take several years of university classes.When considering the investment in a foriegn language, consider that it may take 1000 hours (for an extremely easy language like French) to feel very comfortable in the language. That's one hour of serious study each day for three years. Or you can go sit in a Parisian cafe and talk to people who are willing to tutor you (extremely hard to find without some pretty good skills to start with) and you might get there in a few months.I like this product because it's the very best available for naturally teaching you the grammar basics and for helping you to build the core vocabulary (stuff like and, but, or, many, few, the, a, an, whowhatwhenwherewhy), the core language structure (negation, word order), and it's outstanding for it's ability to teach language sounds...A side note...be willing to sleep between lesson times. Something happens when you sleep, and you'll be better at it by the next lesson. That's why it's important to do this every single day, so that you have the maximum number of study-sleep cycles."},{"Title":"French, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand French with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"Pimsleur's Conversational French CDs are very easy to use and convenient. We keep them in the car because we are there often. Everyone joins in repeating the phrases. Most of the sentences are ones that you would use in getting about a French speaking area. However, I would have liked having a written booklet with it, because it is difficult to determine b or v and some other pronunciations. On the whole I feel it is worth the reasonable we paid for it. The lessons progress from one to the other so that there is a continuity in learning."},{"Title":"French, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand French with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"The conversations are brilliant along with the drill. However there is no written transcripts for you to verify the spellings or the subtleties of pronunciation, and very often the tense changes with a minor twist in pronunciation, which our non french ears may not be able to decipher. Considering the high cost of the package the company should have included the transcripts, maybe in a soft form.The other thing is that grammar is not really explained during the course. Its more rote learning. I would strongly recommend the 10 CD Michel Thomas method along with the Advanced course. Not only are the transcripts there, but the tenses and grammar are explained very well, as well as its far cheaper."},{"Title":"French, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand French with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"Let's be frank or in this case, French. There is no 'instant conversation' as in, \\"Voila! Now you are gifted with an immediate understanding. Go forth and communicate.\\" The fact is you have to put in some real effort and study to reach a reasonable level of proficiency. I know, because I speak a number of languages poorly but thanks to Pimsleur CDs I'm probably less irritating to waiters, shop keepers and hotel staff in French and German. I'm dang near certain they chuckle less too!The CDs cover ample basics and if you transfer the discs into your I-POD or plug them into your car you can play them and do the exercises until you get a working understanding going. If you're riding the train or bus you may get a few strange looks from your fellow commuters or say, learn a few new helpful phrases, like swear words I picked up from a fellow commuter. 'You never know when you might need it,' he said.The CDs provide good value for what you get and are a good learning tool too. But as I said, you'll need to invest some time and effort to get that 'instant understanding.' Take the time. The better we communicate, the better we inevitably become.A shame though the CDs don't teach you to sneer."},{"Title":"French, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand French with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"This is a good program, like all the Pimsleur products. However, I don't think it is as good as either Spanish or Italian. It is more limited in the way French is expressed in conversation.This product is designed to get you to respond automatically in conversational situations it covers. It is not designed to give you much of a vocabulary or grammar, so a rating should not be penalized for not including them. Many other products give you what Pimsleur lacks, and are readily available on Amazon. I suggest Living Language products for vocabulary, situations, good pronunciation."},{"Title":"French, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand French with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"Pimsleur language programs are really good, and Conversational French is no different.

The way it builds slowly, from individual words to sentences to whole conversations, makes the process quite user friendly. Even though they recommend that you don't try to read or look up the words until you get to a higher level, I found occasionally that looking up the word just to see what it looked like made it easier to remember.

The Pimsleur CDs have been fun to learn key phrases we may need on our trip. In less than a half hour each day, we have gained a lot of comfort in the language. The lesson plans are excellent... Just the right length of time for each lesson, good repetition to help you learn, time spent teaching the proper enunciation, and frequent quizzing to make sure you remember what you have learned. Rather than just teaching us the numbers, they teach us the numbers randomly along with the time and euro amounts.

The first two weeks have been great!"},{"Title":"French, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand French with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"This course has been great so far. I am on lesson 12 of 16 right now. The lessons are only 30 minutes long, and very easy to follow. I was quite suprised at the amount of language retention I have with this course. They don't just have you repeat a bunch of random vocabulary words either. It is structured sentences, which builds on the previous lessons. Just when you think you will forget something from a previous lesson, they ask you to repeat it again so you will remember it. Some of the lessons I have had to listen to several times before I can remember most of what they cover, but that helps me to remember it even better when I try to use it later. I am very impressed with the qaulity and content of this program. The price was great too. You can learn at your own pace, and don't have to worry about being lost if you miss something, because you can always replay the CD to review the information as many times as needed before moving on to the next one.

Admittedly by the final CD you have learnt a little French, but at what price, hour after hour of boring reptitive lessons. I've also bought the Michel Thomas series, which I find much more enjoyable. In that series you feel part of the class and that you are moving along quickly and I look forward to making time for the lessons.I wouldn't recommend this one.

The presenter is obviously American (and very good at explaining each new lesson), but the &#34;teachers&#34; are native French speakers, which I think is very important. I also believe that the Pimsleur method of circling back to have the student repeat words and phrases from previous lessons--in other words, incorporating what was learned earlier with new material--is very effective. My knowledge of French is more advanced than this set of CDs assumes, but that is not a criticism of the product itself.

I found this to be a very decent, relatively comprehensive guide to those weird roadside items of the book's title.The author, Peter Genovese, is a writer for the Star Ledger, and runs a regular series about good places to grab lunch at, and has also written several other NJ based books about such things as diners, the jersey shore, and a previous book on weird stuff in NJ. He clearly has qualifications to write such a book, and it's obvious he enjoys Weird NJ, as many of the items referenced can be found in Weird NJ.In fact, this book is really a cross between Genovese Munchmobile column and the Weird NJ Roadside Guide. This book really is not comparable to the Weird NJ book recently published by the Marks, in that they are two different books. The Weird NJ book is all about stories and myths, and although you can go out and visit some of the things referenced in the book, it isn't meant as a travel guide. This book is, and it functions quite well. It features many things not found in the Weird NJ Guide and really does deserve a spot on any weird NJ fans book shelf.Some people like his first roadside guide better, while others found that book totally useless/. I can't compare the two books but I can say that this book is thoroughly enjoyable and worth the money.Pluses: interesting trivia and factoids about NJminuses: pictures are B&amp;W"},{"Title":"New Jersey Curiosities: Quirky Characters, Roadside Oddities & Other Offbeat Stuff","review":"A great read for fans of Weird NJ, regional history and the offbeat in general, Peter Genovese's book is both entertaining and informative. Unlike Weird NJ, you won't find much about ghost stories, UFO sightings and urban myths in &quot;New Jersey Curiosities&quot;; instead, the focus is on real, specific locations that have down-to-earth yet interesting histories.One of the nice features of this book is that the curiosities are organized by region, so you can easily look up the oddities in your area.

One area of improvement would be to include more pictures, but other than that, it's a superb travel guide."},{"Title":"New Jersey Curiosities: Quirky Characters, Roadside Oddities & Other Offbeat Stuff","review":"While this book was okay, I was kind of disappointed.

This is to say that Scott Stein, while never making it obvious, serves up a wicked economy of words which keeps this fast-paced novel twisting, turning, and intelligent. The reader's intelligence is never insulted.At the same time, this economy of words (as well as to-the-point, unembellished narrative) makes the experience of travelling with the protagonist, Jeremy Keller, through his strange and ridiculous adventure, surprisingly deep and rewarding.One of the other reviews here said you'll never put the book down. I have to disagree, since I did actually put it down when I finished it. However, I picked it up again later to go back and reread a few favorite parts.Read it and be prepared to laugh out loud. Unless you don't like that kind of thing."},{"Title":"Lost","review":"Quite simply, I loved this book. Scott Stein has an amazing talent and I look forward to reading his next novel.Unlike most writers, Scott Stein takes the time to develop his characters. He does not use stereotypes and other cliches. Instead Mr. Stein uses unique details and his command of the written word to bring a sense of realism to Jeremy Keller and the other characters in &quot;Lost.&quot;Mr Stein respects his audience. Instead of force-fed, over-the-top comedy, he use his subtle sense of humor to tell us this story. It is very easy for a young writer to fall into the trap of going overboard. Writers who do this lose their identity and become machines producing drivel for the masses. Scott Stein is truly an artist. He takes the time to create a work of art and not just a novel.If you do not read this book, you are missing out on an experience that will not only entertain you but will teach you how a good writer writes. Mr. Stein should be proud of his art and his ability."},{"Title":"Lost","review":"I have been a fan of Mr. Stein's work from his essays, humor, and commentary on his website... Although his book is advertised on the site, I was reluctant to buy it without reading any reviews beforehand. Intrigued by the advance praise it has received, I decided to buy it anyway. The book blew me away on all counts. First, this book is damned funny. I laughed out loud in many places, and drew stares from people riding on the bus with me as I went to work. His wit is sharp and truthful. Second, his prose is muscular, swift, the narrative pushing the story forward without calling attention to itself. But what blew me away the most was the story itself. Despite some hilarious scenes, there's a palpable menace lurking just below the surface in Mr Stein's tale. He manages to excavate and reveal the subterranean underpinnings of life in the late twentieth century without anger, self-righteousness, sentimentality, or cynicism. LOST provided me, a voracious reader, a splash of cold reality that sets him apart from most of the books I've read in a long time. This book is hysterical, unsettling, and, in an odd way, comforting. It will write itself into you. Buy this book. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Lost","review":"&quot;Lost&quot; was a fun, fast-paced story in one of my favorite genres: the I'm-sure-glad-that's-not-me-but-I-can't-stop-reading-about-it genre, in the tradition of hapless protagonists since the beginning of time. Jeremy Keller is lost in his life, clueless enough to be pitied, but not so dumb that we lose interest in the mysterious turns his life has taken. Stein writes briskly and subtly; when the readers begin to accept all the absurdities in &quot;Lost&quot; as real life they gain another laugh at themselves. It's like getting your sleeve caught in some stranger's briefcase and being hopelessly dragged all over Manhattan, through his odd days and odder nights. Enjoy the trip!"},{"Title":"Lost","review":"This is a wonderful book!!! Great reading...you will never put this book down."},{"Title":"Lost","review":"Scott Stein successfully brought the absurd intricacies of the city to the page. In Jeremy Keller, he explores the American dreamer, but one that does not lose himself in the wave of numbing habit, but instead finds the strength to be content with the difficult reality of relative nonexistence. The elements of a man's life that shake and mold him are all woven into Jeremy's story. They are given a subtle humorous twist at each step, and make this one of the funniest books that I have read on the level of \\"Catch 22\\". However, beyond the exciting style and the unique insight, \\"Lost\\" has a message that must be extracted and not forgotten. It is a serious novel on man's absurdity first, and a fast-flowing satire about the lost city residents second. I enjoyed Scott Stein's work immensely, and recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Lost","review":"Lost is a book for your father, best friend, and cleaning woman.

I really liked Leanne as she was no pushover and spoke her mind while Hunter found it amusing.

It's funny, it's romantic, and it's realistic (if you will). :)Leanne, of course, is the haughty heroine, the frills-and-flounces lady-who-finds-herself-in-big-trouble. Hunter is the \\"renegade with a heart o' gold.\\"What makes this story, for me, so memorable, is Leanne's personality. The girl is genuinely funny. Her quips and comebacks and defensive statements are realistically hilarious and memorable. I truly enjoy this character, and re-reading it, she was still as awesome as the first time.I say \\"realistic\\" above because *spoiler* Leanne gets pregnant, and I always like romance novels where this happens, it's not just all \\"sex\\" and no concequences.Read Stolen Ecstasy if you really want a heroine to remember.

I hope there is a story either out there for Sebastion or being worked on for him. I fell in love with him. Of course I wouldn't mind one about Owen, Brandon, Mathew, and all the rest of the h and h's brother's. The story was a very fast paced and sweet romance that keeps you holding on till the end. I loved the spunky attitude that was displayed by Leanne and I might have drooled a little over Hunter's protective, manliness.If there was one bad thing I had to say about the book it would be that the ending was just a tad bit too mushy and long for my taste.

The loss is so deep that it's like a real part of you has died at the same time. \\"Letters to Sara\\" is one woman's wrenching attempt to make sense of the basic unfairness of death, and these letters become a vitally necessary form of self-therapy to try to understand all of the \\"whys.\\" Far from gloomy, however, author Anne's concise insights are sometimes profound, sometimes simplistic and oft-times humorous. Just like life itself.While each of the letters is quire short (indeed, the entire book is quite a quick read), each addresses a central question that Anne ultimately answers herself, at least partly. In this wrenching journey, written over a period of three months following her sister's untimely death at 54, Anne agonizes from phase to phase as part of a long healing process that is just the beginning. Death, like life, is irrationally unfair, and Anne experiences flashes of frustration and anger -- with herself, with her brother in law, and even her sister Sara -- trying to work through the process of being left alone as the last survivor. At the core of all of this is the central question: how to adapt to a life without a loved one.Having recently lost my own kid sister, it was difficult to read this book at a single sitting without breaking down, as the questions posed were both uniquely personal while at the same time universal. Similar to the author's situation, I knew for some time that my sister would not win her battle with cancer, no matter how valiantly she fought. But no matter how foreordained the loss of a sibling may be, you can never really prepare yourself for the huge void that the death of a brother or sister creates. Anne approaches her own grief on a systematic basis -- talking with friends, reading endless books about grief and bringing unresolved questions to her own therapist. This approach helped her to better undersand the process, if not the resolution.\\"Letters to Sara\\" ended up becoming a sort of memorial to Anne's older sister, whom she had idolized her entire life. At one point, she admitted that Sara's \\"Carpe Diem\\" personality -- seize the day! -- was the critical philosophy that made Sara's life an incredibly full one, even if tragically short. For anyone going through this very personal trauma, either approaching the inevitable or dealing with the final reality, \\"Letters to Sara\\" will serve as an invaluable map to ultimately coming out of the darkness into the sunshine. While things will never be the same, the concept of living every day to its fullest is truly a legacy which will help those who survive heal over time. \\"Letters to Sara\\" will provide help, insight and -- best of all -- hope to anyone wondering how they can ever face the future after such a devastating personal loss."},{"Title":"Letters to Sara: The Agony of Adult Sibling Loss","review":"Letters to Sara is a must read for anyone that has lost a sibling, but is just as significant to anyone grieving the loss of a loved one. The &quot;letters&quot;, often very intimate, made me truly feel Anne's tremendous sense of loss for her sister Sara. The book helped me to understand the stages of grief and I realized my own sorrowful phases were a natural progression in healing. The &quot;letters&quot; tell a sincere and candid story of two siblings so different, yet so devoted and they genuinely define the meaning of &quot;sisters&quot;. The book is an emotional and frequently funny tribute to Sara's life and I cried many times - for Sara AND Anne, but also for my own grief over the recent loss of my father. Reading Letters To Sara will help reassure that however you suffer through the death of a loved one, no matter how different it appears to others, it is totally natural for you."},{"Title":"Letters to Sara: The Agony of Adult Sibling Loss","review":"Letters to Sara: The Agony of Adult Sibling LossAnne McCurry has accomplished something really unique in her creative tribute to her beloved older sister. Using the style of letter-writing to portray her deep, agonizing loss, she effectively draws a picture of not only the important, much-too-young life that was lost, but also conveys such a strong sense of her own personal loss. I lost my own kid sister last Thanksgiving; unlike Sara, my sister's death was sudden, unexpected and shocking. I found limited resources available in the weeks and months that followed to help me navigate through this enormous crisis.Now, nearly a year later, I've found some good resources that are helping me to gain perspective. So many of Anne's observations are universally applicable to any grief situation, but with the loss of a beloved sibling, particularly an only sister who was close in age, I could really relate to her analysis that the word \\"sister\\" is now a painful one. Anne's experiences with her friends, who want her to \\"get over it\\" truly resonate. As if we will ever get over it! Anne's reflections helped me to see that what I'm feeling is not unusual.Anne's message of continued devotion and loyalty, long after death has separated the sisters and her pledge to keep Sara's memory alive are beautiful, sincere thoughts. I will hold this delightful book close to my heart as I continue to navigate this very tear-stained and slippery slope. I know now that many others have walked in this lonely territory before me; while that gives me no comfort, it provides me with the belief that I too will survive this. Thank you, Anne, for this gift to all of us who have lost a sibling."},{"Title":"Letters to Sara: The Agony of Adult Sibling Loss","review":"There are surprisingly few books written for siblings of adult children.I find this odd since the majority of us are siblings, and who knows an adultbetter than his/her brother/sister.

Christopher Fry's translation (Oxford) seems particularly nice."},{"Title":"Peer Gynt (TCG Translations)","review":"As strange as the music it inspired.I love Ibsen's later style. He is one of the easiest of writers to read. I think Lady from the Sea is a better play and being a later work is written in the natural prose style that was perfected by Ibsen and changed play writing throughout the world. However, lovers of Ibsen should read the poetic form contained within Peer Gynt to gain a fuller impression of this wonderful author."},{"Title":"Peer Gynt (TCG Translations)","review":"He writes like a comedian, waving his fist at your face, all while enthronging you to read on!"},{"Title":"Peer Gynt (TCG Translations)","review":"This ranks up there with Shakespeare.

It was allright, but definitely not among my favorites.Ibsen is a wonderful writer, and has some other great works I would highly recommend, such as A Doll's House or Hedda Gabler. But Peer Gynt was one of his first, and in my opinion, he still needed to work on his plot.Disagree? Email me."},{"Title":"Peer Gynt (TCG Translations)","review":"Often funny. Often bizarre. Always deep. Peer Gynt first appears to me as this self-centered youth who cares only for himself and the satisfaction of his impulses and whims at any cost. He is the quick non-thinker, who leaves a life of relative conventionality to roam as a dissolute wanderer. He is indeed all of these things, but all the while his &quot;self&quot; is not &quot;centered&quot;. At the end of his adventures as a libertine, the grey-bearded Peer Gynt is at a cross-roads, and he asks the character of the Button Moulder this question: &quot;What, after all, is this being one's self?&quot; The Button Moulder replies that being one's self means slaying one's Self, and furthermore &quot;observing the Master's intentions in all things.&quot; Peer Gynt contemplates this... restraint and delayed gratification have never been manageable themes with him. In my opinion, this whole idea of the search for the &quot;self&quot; is what Peer Gynt is all about. At the very final crossroads he is redeemed by the undeserved forgiveness and love of Solvieg, the woman he has once abandoned... this scene being a beautiful picture of the grace and love of God that is available to the Peer Gynt in every reader.Ibsen originally wrote Peer Gynt as a poem, and therefore we lose the Norwegian rhyme and metre in any English translation. To compensate if at all possible, I suggest reading the play while listening to the incidental music of Edvard Grieg, specifically composed to accompany the live performance of Peer Gynt. (Note: My review is based on the translation by Peter Watts)."},{"Title":"Peer Gynt (TCG Translations)","review":"The play is fine.This printing of it, however, is absolutely terrible. Do not waste your money on it. I don't care how much cheaper it is than any of the others. This is completely unreadable. It appears to have been scanned from an 1908 edition of Peer Gynt. They OCR'ed it (Quite poorly I might add), then they print it on demand.There are no stage directions. There is almost no punctuation in sentences (no commas, etc). There are numerous misspellings. It is nearly impossible to tell who is speaking as the names are misspelled, sometimes in all caps, sometimes not, sometimes indented. The Act and Scene divisions are almost nonexistent.I read about 5 pages of it before I gave up and got a photocopied version from my teacher. Complete waste of money."},{"Title":"Peer Gynt (TCG Translations)","review":"This version of Peer Gynt should be avoided at all costs. It is a copy that was made with robotic page turners and character recognition software that was marginal. The book is full of misspellings and punctuation errors. If you've never read Ibsen's Peer Gynt, this text is very difficult to follow,"},{"Title":"Peer Gynt (TCG Translations)","review":"Peer Gynt is a piece of literature that, like Goethe's Faust Part II plays best on the stage of the imagination. It is too lengthy and costly to be performed on stage. Sometimes the first three acts are performed together, sometimes the last two acts are brought together to become a whole for a theatre production.In terms of reading, this is a great fable piece. Peer is the Trickster with the mirror to his conscience. As a youth, he is Troll-like in his lusts, in his carousing. In his middle-age, he is Troll-like in his financial enterprises. At the end of his life, he is a folorn man, having given up possible true love to run around in search of his self. He is a fraud but we feel sympathy for him. He pursues life in search of distractions and power but ends up empty at the end, soon to be the vicim of the Button Moulder, soon to be nothing more than a button.This work has many levels and open to numerous interpretations. Ideally, this is the book you read for a book club. There is nothing conventional about it. The conversations will be endless and the philosophy inspired, well, might be inspiring."},{"Title":"Peer Gynt (TCG Translations)","review":"I ordered this play to read for a class in school.Not only was this \\"robot generated\\" edition extremely difficult to read due to typos and random formatting inconsistencies, but portions of it were completely missing - for example 2 entire scenes in act 4.I actually need to know what happens, and reading this version, I don't.You get some kind of membership with it that means you can view this play, and other books, online, but if I'd wanted to read the play online, I would have done so with one of the free sites that offers complete verions of texts that are in the public domain.Apparently, the \\"robot\\" technology saves on costs, and if it had cost me 2 or 3 dollars, I may have been more forgiving, but it was not, in my opinion, priced low enough to justify the extremely shabby quality.If you need to read this play, or want to own it (it is a classic, and the story itself is worthwhile), FIND ANOTHER VERSION!"},{"Title":"Peer Gynt (TCG Translations)","review":"Peer Gynt is a sort of folk tale character who we see go from being a young man to an old man and who gets in several different adventures. The play doesn't have much of a plot exactly. It starts of in a Norwegian village where Peer is a buffoonish character. He leaves the village, meets up with Trolls, gets in a shipwreck, wanders around the desert, and runs into the button moulder. All of this just happens, disconnectedly. He spends time in America also, but we aren't shown that.There is a lot of talk about being your self, being authentic, etc. If the play has a theme, I am guessing that's it.It's completely different from Ibsen's realistic works like An Enemy of the People or The Wild Duck. I'm more a fan of those works. Peer Gynt didn't really speak to me.On a side note, in the movie Educating Rita, with Michael Caine, Rita takes a test where one of the questions was 'What are some of the difficulties in staging Peer Gynt?' A: It's long. It's not in prose. It has trolls and other fantastical creatures. It has a huge cast many of whom are only on stage very briefly. The main character goes from being a youth to a very old man. The settings vary from a Norwegian village to Egypt and the Sphinx. This is why it's rarely done on stage."},{"Title":"Peer Gynt (TCG Translations)","review":"Based on traditional Nordic legend Ibsen's version would make a better narrative than verse literary effort. Obviously all rhyme is lost in a prose translation, plus the story itself defies the Greek Unities of Time and Place. Scenes are set in Norway, the tropics and the desert--lest audiences be bored with mere snowy locales. Peer's story covers his wild, reckless youth through his cynical middle age, right up to his regretful old age. He interacts with humans, trolls and other-worldly characters as he vainly romps through life. Driven to clear his reputation and earn the respect of his skeptical, critical neighbors, he embarks on a lifelong journey to discover his true identity.Possibly a cautionary tale PEER GYNT touches a human chord: the desire to improve oneself, to repay maternal care and to earn the love of a sweet, faithful maiden. Typical Nordic references include trafficking with trolls and the danger of getting a shard of glass or ice in one's eye, which distorts true vision and humanity. Despite the temptation Peer ultimately rejects trolldom in favor of maintaining his priceless human attributes.This edition, photocopied by robot, proves difficult to read because of:--lack of apostrophes in most contractions--odd punctuation which disrupts the flow of reading--inclusion of literary notes directly into the script, instead of placed as footnotesIn short: a confusing and disappointing version of an honored tale, which inspired composer Edvard Greig's PEER GYNT SUITE."},{"Title":"Peer Gynt (TCG Translations)","review":"I like this version a lot - it's full of energy, and very exciting to see in person, which I was lucky enough to do. But it's NOT the Peer Gynt you might be familiar with, or the one you want to pick up if you're looking for a more standard translation. While this one is true to the story and the characters, there's a lot of updating and a lot of language that might offend people who don't like the kinds of words you can't say on radio and TV. It's more of an interpretation than a translation.If you want a more standard version, I like this one."},{"Title":"Peer Gynt (TCG Translations)","review":"This is the first version of the play. Beautiful writing, incredible fluidity of speech. A must have between Peter Pan and Samuel Beckett."},{"Title":"Peer Gynt (TCG Translations)","review":"Few works of literature have inspired classical music that has broke into the popular press. One of these is Ibsen's Peer Gynt. Written in the late 19th century, Edvard Grieg wrote two Suites of music for the stageplay version of this Scandinavian classic a decade later. This poem / stageplay is actually a short novel, and tells the story of Peer Gynt, the ultimate ingrate of a son. Growing up raised by a single mother, he is the terror of his village, bullying younger ones and annoying older ones. Eventually he leaves his village and encounters a series of creatures and adventures bound to rattle anyone's cage. One memorable moment is when he finds himself in the Hall of the Mountain King, who happens to be a troll. This is the scene whose song of the same name by Grieg is a classic TV commercial tune. Life soon turns the young Peer into an older Peer. Near the end he reflects on his life with some characters he encounters. At this he realizes the waste his life has been. The moral of the story: don't waste your youth or any other moment of your life causing trouble for yourself or anyone else, for in the end you only isolate yourself and make life miserable for both you and those around you."},{"Title":"FTCE Exceptional Student Education (Florida Teacher Certification Exam Emotionally Handicapped)","review":"This book, while titled and marketed as a study guide for the ESE test, appears to be the study guide for the old Emotionally Handicapped FTCE test (no longer used) with a new cover.

The TARDIS lands on the planet Lakertya, and the Rani enters the TARDIS, having her alien allies take the Doctor back to her base. What is her plan?Written by Pip and Jane Baker in both formats, it features the return of a renegade Time Lord, the Rani, and introduces her new race of allies, the Tetraps. Unlike her original appearance ('The Mark of the Rani'), she has a big plan and she'll do whatever she needs to to achieve it. The Rani is always untroubled by ordinary morals.Into this plan, insert a Doctor disoriented by his regeneration, a race of pleasure-seekers, and a companion with more enthusiasm than sense, and you have a volatile mix.Having said that, the story is pretty straightforward and in the traditional Doctor Who vein, probably a politic move given the casting upheaval that it was somewhat overshadowed as a TV serial by the ousting of Colin Baker from the title role and the introduction of Sylvester McCoy, the novel benefits from some distance from this highly questionable decision by the BBC (well, the ousting of Colin - Sylv plays a great Doctor!). Having said that, the actual joy of watching Kate O'Mara playing the Rani playing Mel is actually a real treat - so you may want to watch the video for that reason alone.The Bakers also have an annoying habit of scrambling letters to create words rather than just making it up.

The story is largely patched together from various other stories by Dick - I recognised \\"The Father Thing\\" and \\"Pay for the Printer\\", and I have a feeling the Glimmung himself turned up in another book.Nevertheless, the book has a nice style, with the last scene being very puzzling. Why is Nick's double so compassionate? Is there any significance in the fact that a non-human creature like the double can show empathy? What is the significance of the long walk towards Nick's double? Is it a Jungian symbol?OK, I made that last bit up. The book is largely an attempt by Dick to make more money using as little effort as possible. Only the last ending is typically Dickian. Like the end of \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\", we are left wondering as to its true significance."},{"Title":"Nick and the Glimmung","review":"Nick and the Glimmung, we are informed on this book's flyleaf, is Dick's sole surviving young adult novel written in 1966 and available for the first time in the U.S., and the first time anywhere in twenty years.The story is typical of much of Dick's works: brilliant ideas and concepts, disjointed and confusing plotting, thin character development and a conclusion with a barrel of loose ends mostly unresolved. In other words a story that will delight Dick's many fans and perplex the casual reader.The story concerns young Nick and his cat Horace. You see cats are illegal on Earth so Nick's family decided to emigrate to Plowman's Planet instead of giving up their pet. Upon arriving at their destination the family is quickly introduced to several different alien species that speak perfect English and become entangled in a struggle concerning a magical book one of the aliens lost and was recovered by Nick. Nick also discovers pod people growing outside his home, an intelligent rodent-like species talking 1950's slang and a being that replicated home appliances like toasters but they don't function properly.The Subterranean Press edition of this title is an exceptionally well-designed book with four full-page Phil Parks color illustrations supplementing the 121 pages of large font text."},{"Title":"Nick and the Glimmung","review":"In the dystopic future Earth of 1992, jobs are so scarce they are rationed. Nick's Dad is lucky to work 15 hours a week.Everyone lives in highrise apartments.Nick's teacher has multiple classrooms and she teaches by television.And, pets are illegal. Nick and his family are hiding a pet cat. When the cat escapes, they are visited by the Anti-Pet Man, who tells them they will have to surrender their cat.Rather than do that, they immigrate to Plowman's Planet, which is nothing like the brochures. There's a war going on and the family quickly falls prey. Worse, the fearsome Glimmung is after Nick.\\"Nick and the Glimmung\\" in no way representative of the author's usual style. It's intended as a children's story and for the most part, works as one. I'd recommend it for very young readers, grades 3-5, because I think this more sophisticated generation of readers will not buy the story as well as younger ones will.Rebecca Kyle, March 2009"},{"Title":"Nick and the Glimmung","review":"For all the brilliant science fiction that Philip K. Dick wrote in his life - and for the average science fiction that Philip K. Dick wrote in his life - he also wrote some real stinkers...and *Nick and the Glimmung* is one of those stinkers. This book is Dick's attempt at an illustrated kid's novel...and attempt at a paycheck most likely.Take a brilliant, often mentally ill writer who was most likely not too normal as a child himself and task him with writing a story that would appeal to kids while he was dropping acid or some such and you can imagine this mostly bad book. Nick and his family move to a distant alien planet called Plowman's Planet to escape the Anti-pet Men who want to confiscate Nick's cat. (okay, so far? Yeah right!) From there the story really doesn't make enough sense to write a coherent review of it. As a Philip K. Dick fan, I have to admit that this book makes no sense to me; none, zilch, nada.There is a war going on the Plowman's Planet; the Trobes and Wrejes and Spiddles and Printers of the planet are battling an unseen evil force...I think. It is called the Glimmung, and it has it out for Nick...I think.And throughout all this turmoil, the Anti-pet Men tell Nick and his family they can return to Earth and all is forgiven...whatever. Philip K. Dick is one of the most brilliant science fiction writers of the 20th Century, but he was also one of the worst. For every *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep* or *The Divine Invasion* or *A Scanner Darkly* there was a book like *Nick and the Glimmung*.

It has answered so many questions for me about the Church. i.e. why the Vatican does nothing when Bishops are actually condoning evil, for one thing. I couldn't put this book down. It deals in facts and allows the reader to see how the problems in the Church start at the top. I also was very grateful for the attitude of respect for our leadership, but willingness to be honest about what has been occuring at the same time. Very well written.

A true eye-opener on many subjects, not just the Catholic Church. \\"As goes the Church, so goes the world.\\" This book is worth it to send out as a gifts to all. I've done further research since reading this book, and it all corrobates to the courageous indictment Fr Kramer and Fr Gruner bring against the rot of the modern Catholic Church. God Bless them for sharing the true story of Fatima and the blatant cover-up of the Third Secret."},{"Title":"The Devil's Final Battle","review":"I read this book in early 2005 after pushing it around my collection of to be read books. As soon as I started I couldn't put it down although it was repetitve at times, hence the taking away of one star. I think Father Kramer wanted to be sure you got the message of our Lady of Fatima and the coverup of the mysterious Third Message in case you were just browsing the book! The essential theme is that the current rejection of the message of Fatima causes the present crisis in the(Catholic) Church and the world. The crisis in the Church manifests itself in many ways, most visibly and troublesome with the pedophile and coverup scandal plauging the rectories of America. The crisis in the world is most notably revealed through acts of terrorism and general decay of societies in moral terms. On the inside cover of the book is a picture if the Twin Towers standing with thick , black smoke bellowing from the top floors; the image speaks for itself but the accompanying caption states that unless the Blessed Virgin Mary of Fatimas wishes are heeded many more disasters both natural and man made will occurr. The events concerning the appearances of Our Lady of Fatima are well documented, including the miraculous Miracle of the Sun in 1917 and the messages relayed to Sister Lucy. Although thisis the premise for the book the bulk of the book concerns the coverup and the opposition in revealing the Third Message in it's entirety. The good Father Kramer goes in great detail to chronicle the problems within the Church have a storied history that includes infiltration by less than holy men. The historical role in Portugal of the freemasons is analyzed. The rise of liberal Catholicism, it's condemnation and the perpetuation by Neo-Modernists in Vatican II is examined. Cardinal Ratzinger's(the current Pope) role in the suppression of the Third Message with the support of other high ranking Vatican Cardinals and Archbishops is also discussed. So what is the Third Message you might ask? Controversy aside, essentially it has to do with prayer, the praying of the Rosary and the consecration of Russia. Theologians have been at odds over this later issue and here wherein lies much of the controversy. The interpretations by thevarious theologians over the facts surrounding Sister Lucy's exact words as given by our Lady of Fatima is the crux of debate. Many think the true words were never revealed, the Church dismisses it as being revealed. In the meantime the Great Apostasy continues to flourish and cataclysmic events abound in our existence. There are enough suspicious circumstances and shady goings on to make this some kind of mystery novel; unfoutunately this is no novel but rather an inquiry into why the real Third Secret has never been revealed to the satisfaction of many priests, bishops etc. and of course, lay persons. The book reads like some spy drama and is fascinating. Many issues are raised,in fact too many to dissect in this brief review. However, if you are even the slightest bit curious you will find this book extremely interesting. There are believers and there are non-believers. Read for yourself to see what the fuss is all about. I would definitely recommend this book for Catholics, as well as people from all denominations and even people without religious faith."},{"Title":"The Devil's Final Battle","review":"The Devil's Final Battle is a must for all Catholics, in fact, even people of other Faiths should read it too. It is not fiction. This book is a compilation of facts, and was edited and compiled by Father Paul Kramer. The book tells that there was a 3rd secret of Fatima that Sister Lucy received. I know the Vatican claimed that the secret was revealed, but I, like many others said, \\"What? That can't be the true secret.\\" This book shows how the withholding of the 3rd secret has caused the crisis in the Church and the rest of the world.Never in my life did I ever write comments in a book I was reading. That changed when I read this book. Page after page I have underlined and made my own comments in the margins. Read this for yourself, regardless of denomination, and you will agree that this is a totally absorbing, and mind boggling book. I have also given this book to other Christians to read and pass along. It is necessary reading, especially in today's world."},{"Title":"The Devil's Final Battle","review":"Fr. Paul Kramer wrote a great book with cited evidence on the cover-up on the Message of Our Lady of Fatima. Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger who is now Pope Benedict XVI does not believe in the Message of Fatima like Fr. Edouard Dhanis, a Modernist priest---both of them believe that Sister Lucy had made up the Fatima apparition with her own imagination using pious spiritual books! For more information read the book!!It also shows how the Vatican and the Conciliar Church rather please men and not offend \\"different religions\\" or \\"our separated brethren\\" that they don't have to convert to the Catholic Faith in order to save their souls. Proper documentation exposes Cardinal Walter Kasper told an Orthodox bishop not to convert to the Catholic Faith in the name of Ecumenism!!It also talks about the role modern heretics for infiltrating the Church and introducing their heretical teachings that today affect our Church such as Fr. Hans Urs Von Balthassar, Cardinal Yves Congar, Cardinal Henri Lubac, Fr. Hans Kung, Fr. Karl Rahner, and others as well. Shocking enough they were associates and friends of our new Holy Father, Pope Benedict XVI (Cardinal Joseph Alois Ratzinger)!!!"},{"Title":"The Devil's Final Battle","review":"This book is about a dramatic conspiracy theory which surrounds the Vatican and the Third Secret of Fatima. It brings forth a lot of evidences to support the following aspects to the theory: 1. The miracle of Fatima was authentic 2. The Third Secret prophecied apostasy in the Church 3. The Church is in apostasy now, resulting from a long-planned infiltration by freemasons and communists 4. The Church has distorted the true meaning of Fatima via a Party Line interpretation of its messages 5. The Church has covered-up the true Third Secret in the past and continues to do so in various ways and 6. The proof of all of this is clear by the state of our current world, 9/11 being clear evidence of the failure of the Vatican to heed the messages of Fatima. The implication by the title of the book is that we are in the last days and Satan is exerting an overwhelming influence in the modern-day Catholic Church, starting at the top. These are strong assertions which, if true, should be taken seriously by all people.I have reviewed the book in great detail. On the positive side, it does a very good job of providing the evidences to support its theory. It presents its case in a logical order, with historical background information providing a plausible sounding development of events from Vatican II onward, as they pertain to Fatima and its messages. It is chock full of information and though a bit repetitive, it is written with passion and persuasiveness.HOWEVER, this book greatly misrepresents the facts, and distorts the historical account. I have analyzed just about every evidence provided in the book, and done some independant research to help hone in on the TRUTH regarding 'proven' points. I found a lot of critical evidence that should have been included and discussed in the book IMO, but was not.More specifically, regarding the claims, what I discovered is the following:Regarding THE VISITATION: It doesn't talk about the many different viewpoints of eyewitnesses to the sun event of October 13, 1917. It doesn't talk about the various contradictions in testimonies by the three seers, or the evolution of the messages over time. I see the authority of the event as inconclusive without further research, but as definitely questionable given a more complete understanding of the issues. It is hard for me to understand why if it was authentic it is subject to so many items which detract from its authenticity. Why wouldn't the message have truly been unmistakably authentic as the book claims it is?Regarding THE PROPHECIES: It quickly dismisses the fact that the events in the 2nd message were publically written down after the took place. It doesn't analyze the implications of the specific consecration of Russia in 1952. It doesn't tell the reader that one of the books main witnesses to the secret also wrote that Sister Lucia didn't tell the secret to anyone. It misleads the reader by quoting from a false interview to further their point. I see little evidence that the content of the message was known to be about apostasy.Regarding THE SMOKE OF SATAN: It doesn't tell the reader that Alta Vendita movement had no evidence of continuing within the last 100 years. It doesn't tell the reader that existing evidence for communist infiltration does not agree with the statements by Belle Dodd. It doesn't tell the reader that there were issues related to salvation that required clarification from the Vatican. It doesn't tell the reader that the Church underwent numerous changes which show that the celebration of the Mass prior to Vatican II was not a mirror of the teachings of the apostles--from the earliest Roman liturgies being in Greek, not Latin, to changes in the liturgy regarding the Eucharist, to the addition of singing in the 7th century, and so many more. I don't know enough to claim any expert opinion with regard to whether the Church is in apostasy, but from what I looked at I can see why some might see certain aspects of the changes to be questionable. I think a good Catholic should be very careful to understand all of the answers to objections one might have before just determining that they are in apostasy, especially in light of the history of change in the Church.Regarding the PARTY LINE: It doesn't tell the reader that Sister Lucia was nodding her approval of the comments by Sodano on the third secret and the Popes assassination. It doesn't tell the reader that the commentary states clearly that the visions were not fantasy. It discusses very little the Vatican viewpoint which draws parallels between the 2nd and 3rd parts of the message. It doesn't talk about the claims some make of signs of spiritual renewal in Russia. I think the Church interpretation is reasonable, but that there are some interpretations which favor the Church's new reluctance to condemn Russia. There are definite signs that some in the Vatican may not accept all of the messages as authentic. However I don't see that as a change in the official Vatican position toward Fatima as much as a response to new information from the continued unveiling of messages.Regarding the COVER-UP: It doesn't talk about the fear of nuclear disaster that was prevalent in 1960. It doesn't talk about the lack of any testimony by Father Alonso and others that supports the idea that the Third Secret came in two parts. It distracts the reader with its conclusions about the 1982 letter from Sister Lucia, but misses the main point: Sister Lucias comments about the third part being a symbolic revelation are very much in sinc with the vision that was revealed as the third part. It doesn't discuss the many alternative viewpoints regarding her silencing by the Vatican. It misleads the reader with regard to the 2001 interview of Sister Lucia. And it misleads the reader into thinking that Father Gruner was more important to the Vatican than the 9/11 attack, which the evidence clearly disputes. I think that even though it is easy to suspect a cover-up, the evidence points to there being no unrevealed Third Secret. Other actions likely reflect the Vatican sensitivity to the many believers in Fatima.In the end, it is a fascinating theory. Secrets by people in power are the makings of books like these because they turn on our imaginations in an exciting way. But, I tried to stick to the evidences for the theory. And I agree with certain aspects of the theory. But, my most honest attempt at being unbiased leads me to believe that this theory is full of holes which the book doesn't even try to fill. My search for truth has led me to believe that the theory lacks strong, consistent, evidence in every primary aspect: from the authenticity of the message, to the witnesses of a predicted apostasy, to an actual apostasy fueled by freemasonry and communist infiltration, to the absurdity of the Vatican party line, to the cover-up of the true secret, and finally, to the proof. Despite what the book claims, strong evidence is simply lacking.To find my full review with footnotes, do a google search for Fatima devils final battle peoplepc."},{"Title":"The Devil's Final Battle","review":"This book tells the story of the last 100 years of the planned and systematic hostile takeover of the catholic church by internal and external enemies.

The author details not only the house but the process of building such a complicated FLW house. The greatest praise goes to the local contractor who made this house happen. FLW was not very personally involved with this small house during a busy time in his career and made only one trip to the house during the construction when the local builder corrected his plan for support of the roof over the french doors. The builder was right and suggested other great improvements. FLW is rumored to have been quite upset that a local man would know more than his staff. Mrs. Hagen also gives insight into how much FLW hated basements and other unimportant details.Step by step photos are not available for most other houses so this is a chance to be part of the construction of a FLW Usonian home.

The book sold in droves on both sides of the Atlantic, and treasure hunters flocked to England. Eventually, someone discovered the treasure without solving the main puzzle. Williams later published this version, which reproduces the original book, but also explains the answer to the main puzzle. But without a treasure to find, interest in the original book declined and it is now out of print.Which is too bad, because Williams' lush paintings deserve to be seen in a large hardcover version, not the tiny paperback available now. Not only are the illustrations beautiful to look at, but they are filled with details that invite the eye to search for clues. The text is also filled with riddles that are fun to solve too. This is a book you'll want to read again and again, even if you can't solve the main riddle.One last point--the recent book &quot;The Merlin Mystery&quot; tries to duplicate Masquerade's feat, but the illustrator is no Kit Williams. If you want to read other puzzle books like &quot;Masquerade&quot;, I recommend &quot;The Egyptian Jukebox&quot; by Nick Bartcock and &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot; by Graeme Base.

Driven mad by the author's early assertion that it was &quot;so simple, a ten year old could solve it,&quot; I worked at it periodically in the years that followed and finally caved in when I saw that amazon.com sold a version that contained the solution. I purchased the book merely to end my twenty years of suffering.How close did I come to solving it? Not nearly as close as I would have liked--as an American, I have very little knowledge of England's geography (mandatory to solving the puzzle, despite the previous disclaimers). I did have part of the solution correct; I knew the letters that bordered each painting spelled out locations, but the method was not as simple as the author pretended. Needless to say, I feel much better now that I know this.That having been said, let me conclude by stating that the story of Jack Hare's journey is enjoyable, the paintings are absolutely exquisite and the mystery is still intriguing, whether the jewel is still in the ground or not.

It is a good book to me, but some people might not like it."},{"Title":"Texas Rattlesnake","review":"This book offers no revelations about Steve Williams (aka Austin) to fans who have followed his wrestling career. All of the information in the book comes from readily available public sources -- WWF videos, magazines and matches; Rolling Stone and Texas Monthly magazines; and of course (although inexplicably to a lesser degree) the A&amp;E biography.Williams had no input into the book. Nor, apparently, did anyone who actually knows him. The writer tried to make up for the lack of biographical information about Steve Williams the man by resorting to a miserable play-by-play of Steve Austin's major WWF matches. The book also suffers because it sounds much more like a flowery press release from the WWF than something meant for any kind of serious reading.Worst of all, although he acknowledges that wrestling is scripted, the author consistently and purposely confuses angles and storylines from the TV shows and PPV's for real-life interaction between Williams and his co-workers in the WWF. He liberally uses quotes from the character of Steve Austin to make them seem like things Steve Williams &quot;said.&quot; He ridiculously proposes that while Steve Williams used to be &quot;a good boy&quot; before he was a wrestler, he &quot;turned heel&quot; in real life to become Stone Cold. In other words, the author tries to make it seem as if Stone Cold is actually Steve Williams instead of a character he plays on TV.Now, add to that glaring holes in the basic events of Williams' life: Brian Pillman is glossed over. There is no mention of Williams' first wife at all or any of his friends other than Pillman (and one sentence on his taxidermist). There is barely a paragraph about Williams' two daughters, just slightly more about his other relatives. When you add in some factual errors in the few biographical items actually used, this book just doesn't cut it as &quot;the story of Steve Austin&quot; and is certainly not the story of Steve Williams.If you want to know something about Steve Williams, watch the A&amp;E biography, read the Texas Monthly article, Rolling Stone, and be sure and don't miss Mick Foley's and The Rock's autobiographies. Those few sources have more true information about Williams than this book.If you want to know something about Steve Austin, grab a Steveweiser, pull the footrest lever on your La-Z-Boy, and enjoy some of Austin's classic matches on tape. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Texas Rattlesnake","review":"This book contained information that is availible in all wrestling magazines. This book would have been better if Stone Cold would have given his input on his life. Instead the author collected articles from PWI and Wrestling Insider and WWF magazines and the WWf video \\"Hell Yeah\\" and \\"Cause Stone Cold Said So\\".Most fans don't realize how long it has taken Austin to be the # 1 wrestling Superstar in the World. Most people don't know that he was even in wcw for a couple of years. I bet wcw wishes they would not have given up on Austin like they did.Over all this book was entertaining.I also liked the Stone Cold Trivia in the back of the book.Enjoy Wrestling fans."},{"Title":"PORTO BELLO GOLD.","review":"Though the 1934 classic film version ofTreasure Islandmakes reference to a character that appears only in this novel, not in RLS' original (proving that somebody involved in making the film had read it), Porto Bello Gold is almost forgotten today, which is a shame because it is a rousing adventure and a worthy prequel to the classic adventure.RLS never told us much about the origins of the treasure, the implication being that it was accumulated from many raids over some considerable period of time. It was A. D. Howden Smith's inspiration to have it all come from the taking of a single treasure galleon, carrying the yearly mining production back to Spain, and that the portion hidden on Treasure Island was considerably less than half the total.Young Robert Ormerod's life just got a lot more complicated. Pirates are attacking just off New York harbor, he's just met a fascinating Irish lassie, Moira O'Donnell, and the great uncle he never knew about, Andrew Murray, a notorious Jacobite and pirate in partnership with Flint, has made him an offer he can't refuse: assist him in his latest scheme willingly or over his father's dead body. Accompanied by his father's friend, Peter Corlaer, a giant of a Dutchman who insists on being taken prisoner as well, an unwilling Robert plays his part in Murray's grand scheme: to take the Porto Bello treasure galleon and use most of the swag to finance another Jacobite conspiracy.As in Treasure Island the key relationship is between a naive young boy and a Machiavellian old man whose true intentions are difficult to read. Though Murray forcibly uses his grand nephew, he is also trying in his own way to provide him with a glorious future, whether Robert wants it or not. Also present are the younger versions of the RLS characters we know so well: Long John Silver, a Machiavellian not quite the equal of Murray who practices his famous charms on Robert, Billy Bones, Blind Pew, Black Dog, Ben Gunn, etc. In addition we get Smith's vision of Captain Flint (a roaring monster) and even Darby McGraw of \\"Fetch aft the rum!\\" fame.As you might have guessed, Murray's scheme doesn't go quite as he expected. Soon Robert, Peter, and Moira are attempting to stay alive amidst a maelstrom of conflicting conspiracies, and although events are considerably constrained by the plot of Treasure Island, there's still room for plenty of twists and surprises. In fact the ending fairly demands another sequel, a sequel that Roger L. Johnson delivered 77 years later inDead Man's Chest : The Sequel to Treasure Island."},{"Title":"PORTO BELLO GOLD.","review":"Arthur D. Howden Smith is not well remembered but his books are all fine pieces of writing. I approached Porto Bello Gold with some doubts even so but he handles Stevenson's characters so well and with such flair that I was seduced into loving the book. This is a worthy part of the Treasure Island saga and a wonderful read for anyone who appreciates rousing adventure stories, pirates, and buried treasure."},{"Title":"PORTO BELLO GOLD.","review":"Avast mates! Never has a finer tale of the sea to be had. Meet Long John, Captain Flint, Ben Gunn, and some of the other scurvy crew from 'Treasure Island'. Learn where the treasure came from. Fights at sea and ashore aplenty."},{"Title":"PORTO BELLO GOLD.","review":"This was an alright story in its own right, but it is not very satisfying for the dedicated Treasure Island fan. I have read Treasure Island over and over since I was a young child, both abridged and unabridged as I got older. I can honestly say it is my favorite book. Porto Bello Gold, while ok on its own, does not really do justice to the characters created by Robert Louis Stevenson. Without revealing too much of either book, I'll say that in this book, Flint is not the character that Stevenson built him up to be. Ben Gunn and Darby McGraw are also not characterized in a satisfying way. Israel Hands is completely absent. In some respects it seems as if the author took some of the locations and ideas from Treasure Island and worked backwards, and the result is sometimes too convenient. As vividly as he wrote, Stevenson left much of the past to the readers imagination, feeding and fueling it as only he could. Smith on the other hand seems to have felt to need to explain the origin of every unexplored detail. Some things are best left to the imagination (for example, how the stockade came to be or the identity of Darby McGraw). If anything, I would say the original Treasure Island should be read first."},{"Title":"PORTO BELLO GOLD.","review":"Porto Bello Gold was written in 1924, so it has a style that will seem to be a little dated and flowery to some readers. However, the story holds up, and the book is enjoyable to read. I read the trade paperback edition that was published in 1999 by McBooks Press. I am a fan of nautical fiction, and I have found through the years that the books published by McBooks Press are consistently well done. The stories are interesting ones, the covers on the books always look good, and the quality of the books is outstanding. They hold up well.Porto Bello Gold is a prequel to Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island. We meet some of the characters from Mr. Stevenson's book, and we learn where the buried treasure came from. The two books tie together fairly well. Obviously, both are pirate stories and offer us some memorable characters, e.g., Long John Silver, Flint, Pew, and Ben Gunn.In Porto Bello Gold, our main character from the beginning is young Robert Ormerod, the son of a wealthy New York merchant and the nephew of a famous pirate, Andrew Murray. Captain Murray shows up in New York, abducts Robert, and forces him to go to sea with him. Peter Corlaer, a friend of Robert's father and a man who is very handy in a fight, insists that he be taken along as well. Add a love interest to the story in the person of the young Irish lady Moira O'Donnell plus a bunch of nefarious pirates and the story picks up. Captain Murray plans to attack the Spanish treasure fleet and use the money to help finance a Jacobite conspiracy. He succeeds in capturing the treasure but then faces the problem of keeping two pirate crews happy, a difficult task at best.Porto Bello Gold is a rollicking story of the sea and is fun to read for those readers who are fond of the pirate genre. I thought Mr. Smith got bogged down a few times by too much discussion of Jacobite themes but, on the whole, the book was great fun to read."},{"Title":"PORTO BELLO GOLD.","review":"It took me years to track this book down. On any recommendations or lists I've ever heard or read, \\"FOR FANS OF TREASURE ISLAND, ETC.\\", Porto Bello Gold has been listed as number one. But of course, it's out of print. However, it's worth the search and the drama of searching. This book is great; it's dramatic, exciting, adventurous. It's deeper than a simple pirate yarn, both younger and older fans will enjoy. Like most pirate, etc., novels I've read recently, it took me a while to get through (maybe a week, of moderate-to-mild reading), meaning that it's kind of long. But it's extremely entertaining. Worth the read."},{"Title":"PORTO BELLO GOLD.","review":"This book, which almost no one else has ever heard of, is a lot of fun. A great pirate story.

With both worlds being very similar (King Arthur's Court vs. Greek mythology). The strongest contrast has to do with the morals of the character. I'm no prude, but with Kenyon's dark hunters, there's this inner beauty to all of her characters. As Kenyon describes \\"They're Mad, Bad, and Immortal.\\" They have tortured souls, they like to get down and dirty, and you can't help but love them. I have found myself in tears over the betrayals they've suffered and the purpose in life and love they discover that ultimately saves their souls. And they're all honorable. With Angela Knight's \\"Megaverse\\" her characters don't have many redeeming qualities in my opinion. You don't love them, can't relate to them. They come across as shallow, selfish souls. They're ruled by a \\"High Council\\" that has the power to end their existence with the zap of a finger for ridiculous infractions, like refusing a witch on her knees if you catch my drift. It seems to make the hero out to be less appealing if he can't even make simple decisions, without having to grovel for a favor. The only thing that brings these characters together is sex. There's nothing to endear you to them, which makes for a read that leaves you feeling kind of... dirty. These \\"Megaverse\\" books really shouldn't be in the \\"Romance\\" section. Sci-fi... erotica maybe, but not romance. I'm not saying that they are flawed in any way. Just as a matter of preference, I hope to help any of you who don't care for sex without emotion and don't want to waste precious reading time on sci-fi porn."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"I had read only 2 of these authors before, Harris and Davidson. Harris' story was a huge disappointment, my least favorite of the bunch. It was dull, went nowhere, had no spice of any flavor, and only connected to the series by relating (secondhand) what happened to Sookie's long-lost druggie cousin. Skip it. Davidson's carried her trademark style, but plotting similar to Harris' was evident. It was interesting to have a secondary couple take lead rolls in this short story. Middle of the road -- not great but not bad, still one of the top three in the book. I find Davidson amusing.Taylor's story was, I thought, awful. Too dark and \\"lusty\\" for me. I never believed for one moment that the two leads were in love with each other. Gives Harris' story a run for worst of the lot. Hamilton writes a very short story, tight and well-plotted, and obviously meshing well with hers series books. It was good enough that I'll consider reading them. Hamilton can write, but I have to read more to know if I'll really like her work. I have the feeling that I would have liked it a lot more if I'd read the series (or at least some of it), but it still falls in the top 2 or 3. A lot of people disliked Knight's story, but I thought it very original -- and that can be tough. She also had strong lead characters and some memorable secondary ones. The longest story, it did have lots of sex, but was (in my opinion) much more tasteful than Taylor's. Does this story connect to other work of hers? She's created a fascinating world, and I'd like to read more of it. I put this story in the top 2 of this anthology."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"Bite is a great collection of fantasy/sci-fi romantica. I had previously read Laurell K. Hamilton(Anita Blake Vampire Hunter), Mary Janice Davidson(Betsy Taylor Vampire Queen) and Charlaine Harris(Sookie Stackhouse/Southern Vampire Series) and loved their works so I tried this and it was Great!Buy this book now!"},{"Title":"Bite","review":"This is one of the best anthologies I've read in a while.The girl who was infactuated with death made me believe in LKH again. Incubus Dreams was painful to read, but Anita was Anita here. I felt fod Jean Claude here. These are the characters I love, the ones that had me read the whole series in one week.Sookie Stackhouse always comes through. Thanks for the info about her cousin! I just can't wait for Dead as a Doornail!I loved this anthology. Every story was a gem!"},{"Title":"Bite","review":"I bought this book because I'm fond of vampire books and I was familiar with every author on the cover except Vickie Taylor. To my surprise, it was the unknown author's story that I enjoyed most.Each of the stories present a different take on the much-used vampire mythos, twisting the traditional view on them (nearly to the point of breaking, in Angela Knight's version). The more established authors--Laurell K. Hamilton, MaryJanice Davidson, and Charlaine Harris--take advantage of the worlds they've already created for their respective series and give us tiny a-night-in-the-life glimpses of our favorite heroines.The Hamilton story, which gets biggest billing and first placement in the book, is the least interesting. Set just before Obsidian Butterfly, Anita is contracted to rescue an underage girl with leukemia who's determined to become a vampire to save herself from the pain of amputation. Her search is brief and the story ends abruptly without resolving... anything, really. The story is bland, but at least the sex was kept to the minimum, unlike some of her more recent Blake novels.Charlaine Harris gives us a short story in the Sookie Stackhouse universe in which she meets the Queen of Louisiana and one question about her family is answered. The question of Cousin Hadley is resolved in a nice, neat way. The story is brief and while it would have been nice to see Sookie interacting further with the Queen, it was quite enjoyable as it is.MaryJanice Davidson's story, while set in the Betsy-verse, has little to do with Queen Betsy and her consort. Instead, the vampire court is seen through the eyes of outsiders in this tale of a French veterinarian and the man who would like to be her lover. Sophie and Liam grow closer after Sophie sees a tv report and becomes convinced that the girl's suicide has an underlying, vampiric cause and that she needs to investigate. This course takes them briefly into Betsy's sphere of awareness. The beginning of the plot is a little difficult to believe and the story has the most glaring error I remember, but if you can get past those things, then the story is entertaining.Angela Knight's world combines Arthurian Legend and Vampires in a thoroughly original and unique way, but one that's so different it can be hard to understand completely in a short story. The tale of Galahad and a newly empowered Majae who has a vision of danger elsewhere, is fun and encredibly sexually explicit, as Ms. Knight's stories almost universally seem to be. The new glimpses into her universe were fascinating and make me want to find more set in this world.The last story in the anthology, by Vickie Taylor, while not the most original plot ever, was nevertheless easy to devour and had one of the most intriguing beginnings I'd seen recently. The two main characters even manage a surprising amount of depth for a short story, to boot.Overall, the anthology was an enjoyable read. I'd certainly recommend it, just as long as you're not buying it solely for the Anita Blake story."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"I was highly disappointed in the anthology. Each story read like the first twenty pages of a chapter..before the editors put their hands on it. Anthologies of this nature usually leave you wanting to read more by the author. Had I not known the capable writing of Charlaine Harris previous to this concoction, I would NEVER buy her stuff. These EXTREMELY short stories didn't even inspire a desire to read upcoming books by the authors even if you are familiar with the characters and their worlds. A word of advice...read this book in the bookstore. It will probably take 20 minutes and you could save 7 bucks."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"Pages 1-58 are two new stories. The rest of the book are stories that were published years ago and slightly modified so that they could have a 2005 copyright. If you are widely read, 200 pages of old stories will be a major disappointment.Also, I wouldn't judge any of the individual authors based on what is in the book. The editing appears to be significantly different than what is normal.Try the anthology \\"Dates From Hell\\" instead of this one. Much better writing and editing!"},{"Title":"Bite","review":"The five short stories/novellas in this book are all well done. Each represents a different set of expectations concerning vampire lore, and all are entertaining. The only author I was unfamiliar with was Vickie Taylor, whose story \\"Blood Lust\\" is a romance set to vampire music. This is a boy loses wrong girl to bad guy, finds right girl, gets right girl, i.e. romance. The only thing I found disconcerting was when the characters uttered typical oaths like \\"good god\\" they clearly got a negative physical reaction which implied that they were dammed creatures. The story moved quickly and was funny.Angela Knight, who writes erotic romances for Red Sage Publishing, has written a cute story set in Arthurian times, with interesting relationships between witches and vampires. Another romance, \\"Galahad\\" has a right male vampire and right female witch team, at odds with each other, defeat the bad vampires and unite in spite of mischevious witches and dragons. Cute, fast reading, and lots of graphic sex.MaryJanice Davidson\\"s \\"Biting in Plain Sight\\" stars a vampire vetrinarian who lives in a small town with a don't ask, don't tell policy. After the death of her long-time human companion, she falls into a relationship with Liam, another mortal who has loved her from a distance for a number of years. She seeks out assistance in stoppping a rogue vampire and Liam goes along with her. We also get another opportunity to see the Vampire Majesties, Betsy Taylor and Eric Sinclair, who first came to our attention in Davidson's 2002 novel Undead and Unwed. This novella is a worth addition to Davidson's vampire writings.Charlaine Harris gives us another visit with Sookie Stackhouse in \\"One Word Answer.\\" First brought to us in \\"Dead Until Dark\\" and staring in the Southern Vampire Mysteries series, Sookie has the mystery of a dead vampire cousin's death to explain. With snappy dialogue and a few puns, the story moves quickly, and ends well. A well written story.Finally, Laurell K. Hamilton's \\"The Girl Who Was Infatuated with Death\\" is from an earlier period in the Anita Blake series. This strong story, which helps bridge the period between Blue Moon and Obsidian Butterfly, helps us understand the fascination that Anita has for Jean Claude, her vampire lover. The story is about a girl with a fatal illness who wants to become a vampire rather than suffer amputation, and the mother who doesn't want this to happen. Mother hires Anita to find the daughter and stop the process. What the story helps us see is the growing moral ambivalence that Anita has over having a vampire lover, and serves as a good lead to Obsidian Butterfly. A marvelous story, well developed, too short.Over all, this is an excellent collection of stories, worth every spare reading moment."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"I was excited about reading this anthology. After all, it features stories by Laurell K. Hamilton, Charlaine Harris and MaryJanice Davidson. Those are three of my very favorite sci-fi/fantasy authors. I look forward to reading the next installment of their respective vampire books and I figured Bite would be a nice appetizer before the main course. Even though I was disappointed with the fact that Hamilton and Harris's offerings are short stories instead of novellas, I enjoyed this book to the max. Hamilton's \\"The Girl Who Was Infatuated with Death\\" is an Anita Blake story that takes place some time around Blue Moon and Obsidian Butterfly. In other words, it takes place right before the series goes haywire. Anita wants to stop a teenage girl with bone cancer from turning into a vampire. But when Anita asks Jean-Claude to help find the vampire who will do the transition, old feelings and intense sexual tension ensue between them. In Charlaine Harris's \\"One Word Answer,\\" Sookie Stackhouse discovers that a wayward cousin of hers had turned into a vampire and was recently murdered. In an attempt to offer her condolences, the Vampire Queen of Louisiana bestows a rather interesting favor upon Sookie. Davidson's \\"Biting in Plain Sight\\" is a fun novella about a vampire veterinarian who discovers she has a long-time admirer. When she finds out that a rogue vampire is responsible for the deaths of various teenage girls, she asks the Vampire Queen (Undead's Betsy Taylor) for help. Angela Knight's \\"Galahad\\" is about a young witch who travels to the world of King Arthur -- only that the people there are vampires. And Vickie Taylor's \\"Blood Lust\\" is about a fight over a stolen formula for synthetic blood for vampires.I loved the stories of Laurell K. Hamilton and Charlaine Harris the most. With Hamilton, it was like going back to the time when the Anita Blake novels were still riveting. This story took place before the ardeur and metaphysical contacts began to monopolize the plot and before Micah and other expendable characters came along. The story, albeit short, was a real treat. And Harris's Sookie Stackhouse story is my favorite one in the book. It tells the reader in various levels that Bill is now just a trusted and reliable friend of Sookie's. There is still some tension there though. After all, he still cares for Sookie and tries to protect her at all cost. MaryJanice Davidson's novella is told in third person and it centers on two new characters, but it was fun to read about Betsy Taylor and friends from other characters' points of view. I am not a big follower of Angela Knight, and Vickie Taylor is unknown to me, but their stories were entertaining. The last three stories center more on romance than anything else. As a whole, Bite is an excellent anthology. Read this if you're a fan of any of the big authors in this offering."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"For the most part I really enjoyed this book. But I have to warn those not familiar with these authors that if you have not read the previous related novels - Hamilton's Anita Blake series, Harris's Sookie Stackhouse vampire novels, Knight's - Knights of the Roundtable series - you are not going to truly understand what is going on. Since I have read them all it is difficult for me to know whether they could possbily stand on their own, but I think not. Hamilton's story was much too short to even be included as part of the anthology and it added nothing to the series. I feel Harris's story was similar in that it didn't add much to Sookie Stackhouse's adventures. On the other hand Knight's Galahad was a new adventure in her Round Table series that I liked very much and the Taylor story was new to me and worked quite well. I don't think it was part of a series, but if it was it certainly stood on its own. I recommend this anthology especially to those readers who know the authors' series. Even those stories that don't add much contain the characters we know and love, so are therefore still fun reads."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"Bite is a collection of five short stories from Laurell K Hamilton (her Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series), Charlaine Harris (a Sookie Stackhouse short story), MaryJanice Davidson, Angela Knight and Vickie Taylor.

Although the Laurell Hamilton story \\"The Girl Who Was Infatuated With Death\\" was OK it wasn't particularly deep (yes, I know it's a short story and so has limited space). It is set in the interval between Blue Moon and Obsidian Butterfly but fortunately hasn't descended, at that point, into the soft porn that the Anita Blake novels have turned into. The story itself is fairly simple and its resolution is really a chance to enable the main characters Anita Blake and Jean-Claude the Master Vampire to meet again. It was a perfectly acceptable story but nothing to get really excited about.The Charlaine Harris story \\"One Word Answer\\" is set at the end of the third or fourth Sookie Stackhouse novel where Sookie and Vampire Bill are just friends rather than lovers. It features a strange night visit to Sookie's house of an unknown vampire who comes bringing news of a legacy left to Sookie by a cousin who, it turns out, was a vampire and was staked the previous month. There's more going on than the story suggests and, for once, Sookie realises this before Bill Compton or Bubba, her two neighbourly vampires. This is a fun little story but doesn't add much overall to this series.The third story, \\"Biting in Plain Sight\\" by MaryJanice Davidson was really good and worked pretty well as a standalone story. I don't know if this author has written anything else on this theme, but if so this would inspire me to read it. Her main character is a vampire vet - all the people who live in her village know she's a vampire but it's not talked about. When she hears of trouble she finds one of the fellow villagers wants to help her and this is the start of an investigation into a rogue vampire who is causing young mortals to commit suicide. Sophie and her new assistant Liam, the friendly but slightly dim-seeming farmer, ride to the rescue and find each other in the process. It was a well-written book and I enjoyed it very much.On the other hand, Galahad by Angela Knight was a real disappointment. I expect it's part of a wider series as there was an awful lot of stuff thrown at me that I didn't have a full explanation for. But the basic story seemed to be something upon which to hang a steamy sex scene and it didn't work for me at all. The world/environment was very complex, the magic these people wielded seemed far too convenient to help them save the day, and the sex scene didn't feel sexy. A disappointment. And not actually all that Vampiric - Galahad was a vampire but that was a very minor part of the book; it was mostly about witchcraft.\\"Blood Lust\\" by Vickie Taylor was a better story. It's about a man who has invented synthetic blood, only to have a vampire steal his work and his fianc&eacute;e. Daniel researches vampires, then plans to be made into one so he can gain revenge and rescue his fianc&eacute;e by killing her (obviously she wouldn't want to be a vampire really). To do this he finds Deadre, the lonely female vampire, at a club and tries to persuade her to turn him into a vampire. Of course he doesn't really know what he's letting himself in for, particularly the requirement for regular blood as a new-born vampire, and things aren't really what they seem. This was a good story although the denouement happened rather easily, as in all of these stories.Having read the book, it is obviously something than fans of these authors might want to complete their collection, and the stories are OK in their own right, but none of them are really fantastic and the short story formula doesn't quite seem to provide enough depth to make these truly satisfying stories."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"\\"The Girl who was Infatuated with Death\\" by Laurell K. Hamilton. Ms. Rhonda Mackenzie wants vampire executioner Anita Blake to find the vampire that has bitten her daughter two times and kill. If she is bitten three times she will become a vampire which is what she wants because she will lose one leg, perhaps two if she doedn't changes over.

Mr. Cataliades informs Sookie that Waldo killed her because she was the favorite of the queen of New Orleans and he wants Sookie to stake the vampire Sookie doesn't want to but Waldo makes sure that he will not be returned to his queen to be tortured.\\"Biting in Plain Sight\\" by Mary Janice Davidson: In the town of Embarrass, everyone knows that the vet Dr. Sophie Tourneau is a vampire but they ignore that fact because she takes great care of their animals. Liam is in love with her and when she goes out hunting a serial vampire killer, he insists on accompanying her. He tells her how he feels and she takes him to bed and drinks his blood. She cares about him but she's not sure if she is better off without any emotional ties to a mortal. When they go after the vampire killer, Liam impresses Sophie with his actions and his commitment to her.\\"Galahad\\" by Angela Knight.

Deadre has fallen in love with Daniel and goes with him to fight Garth the enforcer to the High Matron. The synthetic blood make Daniel Garth's equal and their upcoming battle will leave one of them dead.All five authors have a different take on the vampire mythos but that doesn't mean one story is better than another. This is one of the best vampire romance anthologies ever produced bringing back cult favorites like Anita Blake and Sookie. The stories by the other authors would make a great series..Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Bite","review":"I anticipated this book eagerly and was sadly disappointed to find that the \\"new Anita Blake story\\" was less than 35 pages of the nearly 300 total pages. I actually really liked the whole book, but the misrepresentation leaves a nasty taste in my mouth. I know marketing, that doesn't mean I have to like it.Overall, I'd recommend this book, but I'd -also- recommend that you don't get TOO excited about new stuff from your favourite authors. The last two authors (who I hadn't heard of or previously read) got the bulk of the book."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"Laurell K. Hamilton's story occurs in the interval between BLUE MOON and OBSIDIAN BUTTERFLY. Of course, Ms. Blake is the main character. She is asked to hunt for a girl who is under age and determined to be changed.Charlaine Harris, my personal favorite vampire series author, gives us a short story involving the characters from her SOUTHERN VAMPIRE series. Sookie Stackhouse has inherited a legacy from an out of touch vampire kin. Bubba (we all know who this famous, supposedly deceased, rock star is since people still claim to have sightings of him) and Bill are the two vampires helping out in this tale.Then comes Mary Janice Davidson's Dr. Sophie character. She may be a vampire, but she is also a vet. She protects the people in her area AND cares for their animals. If ever there was a good vampire, Dr. Sophie is it.Next up is Angela Knight whose character is a witch who must team up with THE Sir Galahad (vampire) and enter a horrible super natural battle.Last, but not least, is Vickie Taylor's enthralling tale of a man whose invention of synthetic blood, to help millions of humans, is stolen by a strong and nasty vampire. The human man needs to be changed into a vampire in order to get his formula back. He ends up joining with an unwilling female vampire and starting a vampire revolution.**** Five authors of five vampire series have gotten together to create short stories, spin offs of their own series. I give a glimpse of each story in my synopsis. I purchased this book solely for Charlaine Harris's story. I L-O-V-E her SOUTHERN VAMPIRE series! The other tales are good too and this book is worth your time and money even if you read only one of these authors often. As for me, I've read all the authors and can honestly tell you that all five of these authors are terrific! ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"Other then Vicky Taylor, I've been a long time fan of all these authors. I really enjoyed all the stories.The Girl Who was Infatuated with Death by Laurell K Hamilton is a short story (too short!) set in the time period between Blue Moon and Obsidian Butterfly when Anita was taking a break from 'the boys' :-) It's an interlude between her and Jean-Claude as she's working to save a young girl from becoming a vampire. I really enjoyed this story. It fits very well between the two books and it was wonderful to have a new LKH story in an anthology, as previous ones have been excerpts from her other books.One Word Answer by Charlaine Harris: I've only read the first book in her Sookie Stackhouse series (and loved it), now I'm going to read the ones I've missed. Sookie receives an inheritance from her cousin and helps to solve the mystery of her death. It was funny, also a bit on the short side and featured Sookie's friend Bubba who is actually Elvis and very funny.Biting in Plain Sight by MaryJanice Davidson is connected to her Undead and Unwed series. I really enjoyed this story of a small town Veterinarian, who is also a vampire and a man from her town who has finally decided to take matters into his own hands and tell her he loves. They are trying to stop a vampire serial killer with the help of Betsy and Eric from Undead and Unwed. Touching and funny too.Galahad by Angela Knight was excellent. It's a story in Angela's wonderful series that joins Arthurian legend with vampire lore. Caroline is a former English teacher who has only recently become a Magea (a witch) and was heartbroken by the vampire who turned her. Then she has a vision about someone making evil vamps and her and a handsome vamp getting rid of them, and she goes in search of the good guy vamp who turns out to be Galahad. It's another wonderful, yet stand alone, story in Ms. Knights incredible new series, funny and very steamy.Blood Lust by Vickie Taylor: Daniel is a scientist who has been working to come up with an alternative to blood. The man he works for turns on him, takes away everything and Daniel wants revenge. He meets Deadre a vampire who he wants to help him. Together they find the bad guy and love."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"For fan's of Laurell K. Hamiliton, Charlaine Harris, MaryJanice Davidson, and Angela Knight this was a fun read that will wet your appetite for their latest full length. Each of these stories are shoot offs from current series that these authors have already in the works.For readers that are new to any of these authors this will be a great introduction for you and I'm sure it will compel you to run out and buy any of these author's back lists!Official Reviewer for www.romancedesigns.com"},{"Title":"Bite","review":"This book had some really wonderful authors in it and yet I found it lacking.I have to say that whoever wrote the back cover description made these stories sound more interesting than they really were.~The first story is set in Hamilton's Antia Blake series inbetween \\"Blue Moon\\" and \\"Obsidian Butterfly\\". There was a plot and a halfway decent one, but it really went no where. It seemed it all was resolved while Anita was messing around with Jean-Claude. That's really what this story was centered around, sexual tension between Anita and Jean-Claude.~The second story was set in Harris's Sookie Stockhouse series. I've never read any books from this series, so that might be why I couldn't get into this story. It really wasn't all that interesting. The characters sat around in a circle and had a chat and it all was just kinda boring. These first two stories, seemed like the authors just plopped them out, so the book could have thier names on it and be sure that die hard fans of the two popular series would buy it.~The third story was set in Davidson's Undead series and I have to say that I actually enjoyed this one. Like all of Davidson's works it was a light and fun read. You don't have to of read any of her Undead series to follow it.~The fourth story was one of Knight's and it was set in the same world as her story in the \\"Hot Blooded\\" anthology. I actually liked this story, but several people who I talked to didn't like it. They had trouble adjusting to the setting. I have to admit that the story in \\"Hot Blooded\\" was much better and was one of my favorites in that book. Because I read that story I could easily slip into this story. It's set with Arthurian characters as vampires and sounds utterly stupid, but I got into it.~The last story was by Taylor who is an author I had never heard of. This story was alright. Nothing too thrilling and wasn't horrible to read and didn't leave you with a \\"well that was pointless\\" feeling at the end. The plot was interesting and acutally went somewhere. The characters were well developed. I think this was probably one of the better written stories in the book."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"Bite introduced me to the style of Hamilton and Harris, both now dearly loved authors. Great stories, even for those who do not enjoy short stories, like myself."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"It was not what I expected.... the stories were way to short. But the delivery was quick."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"Hey everyone!Okay! this book has a really strong start, with some superplayers. But if you are looking for all stories like that think again.. Author Angela Knight puts her own spin on a vamp story and turns it into a slightly soft porn story. I wouldn't recomend this, for someone that hasn't talked to a teenager about sex first, if you are going to buy it for them. I will say though I love the other authors though, they are great. Laurell K Hamilton makes a great story for anyone thats interested in reading her, Charlaine Harris always great and Mary Janice had a great Betsy story too.."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"Great cover - made me pick this book up.And though I am a Hamilton fan, this was but a tiny tidbit and merely whetted my appetite. Disappointed in the whole book. Though there are a few good moments in the \\"otherworld\\" fantasy, there was very little romance, all in all. Too bad, since Berkley puts out some really BITEY stuff usually."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"I bought this book not really knowing what I was getting myself into. I bought it because it had a brand new Anita Blake story and I am absolutely addicted to Anita. But the Anita story in this book fell short. It was great writing, don't get me wrong, but in the end I felt jipped. The story doesn't have the action of Anita's usual dealings and it doesn't follow the story line very well. This short story is supposed to happen between the Blue Moon and Obsidean Butterfly books, but I really don't think it fits. I feel that Hamilton was just looking for an excuse to add some sexual tension into the story.Now the rest of the stories I absolutely loved. Harris' tale got me interested in Sookie Stackhouse, so I went out and bought the first in the series and now I'm hooked. Like some of the other reviewers have said, Angela Knight's Galahad stole the show. I was completely enthralled by this tale. It mixed my two favorite things in the world, vampires and King Arthur's court. I'm in love with this story. I read it in one sitting and was compelled to read it again the next day (though I kept my will power).If your into vampires and mysteries and a bit of erotic excitement, then this book is absolutely what you are looking for. It is also a great way to find new authors that you might like."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"I didn't read all of the book I only bought this for the Sookie Stackhous story. THe story was a good back story about how Sookie's cousin became a vampire."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"Good but much too short. Like several small novels or short stories in a single book, not much flow."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"I honestly got this because Laurell K Hamilton is in it. By the end of the book, the only story I really liked was Angela Knights. Laurell's is just too short and seemed rushed though from what I understand was not. It seemed like an unflushed idea that would make a decent story if more time was put in it. It was only 30 pages. Charlaine Harris I have never read before and this was not all that great an introduction to him in my opinion. I have her first book and will eventually get to it, but this did nothing to interest me in her at all. I would like to read more about Bill and Bubba and the Queen, but this particular store, like LKH's was just too short. Though I will say I liked Charlaine's better then LKH's...and I own all of her books in hard and paperback. MaryJanice Davidson I have never really liked and this story did NOTHING to sway that. Her writing is just a little on the juvenile side for me. Angela Knights was my favorite. I LOVE the King Arthur and the knights and the Avalon aspect. I just really liked it all. I think the ending could have been a little better and not so abrupt and \\"easy\\" but in a short story you can't really expect too much. Vickie Taylor's wasn't too bad, but not one that would make me look into other works of hers. All in all, I would not bother spending my money on this one. I would check it out of the library, buy a used copy or borrow it from a friend."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"I'm definitely a fan of Laurell Hamiltons earlier works so I enjoyed her story. However, Charlaine Harris, in my opinon always leaves something to be desired. MaryJanice Davidson alternates between amusing and annoying with the childish antics that go on between the vampire couples. Did NOT enjoy Angela Knights' story-too much sex, not enough substance. Still for a bit of fluff when you're totally bored it might be worth picking up. But i recommend the library so you can spend your money on one worth keeping."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"This anthology did absolutely nothing for me. The only story that keeps it from sinking into vampire hell is Angela Knight's 'Galahad'.The other four just plainly sucked (and I don't mean that literally).So not worth the money. :("},{"Title":"Bite","review":"Writers marketing guides will tell you that there is demand for short stories to be packaged as anthologies. I like anthologies where all of the contributions are strong, and varied within the genre. However this anthology doesn't make the grade. Quite frankly I picked up this book on the strength of two of my favorite writers, neither of whom deliver a strong, quality story in this offering. Anita Blake anthology contributions that were not stand alone stories but snippets of the next book to come out have disappointed in the past. Now I'll have to add Sookie Stackhouse to my \\"beware list.\\" The other stories were either not compelling or different enough to overcome my dismay at the incredibly short, short stories by Laurell K. Hamilton and Charlaine Harris. I can only wonder at the motivation. I recommend that you get this one used at the discount book store or borrow it from your local public library. Trust me, you won't regret NOT having this in your collection."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"I'm not an anthologies fan. I read fast, so the bigger the better provided it's good. The first three short stories by Hamilton, Davidson, and Harris was a huge disappointment. I have read ALL these ladies books. There was nothing there to capture me. The last two were a little longer and I found myself much more interested.Angela Knight wrote a short story intitled \\"Galahad\\" I thought was great. It was a whole new world and concept on the grail. I liked Vicki Taylor's short story, too. A guy wants to become a vampire to get back at a vampire that took everything from him, even his fiance'. I've never read anything from these two authors, so I'll definitely look into them."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"GREAT book! I bought this book mainly for the short story by Charlaine Harris, and it was REALLY good. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and would reccomend it to anyone. It was great. I also started the story right after that one, and it seemed good too. Glad I bought this book."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"I picked up this book mainly because Laurell K. Hamilton's name is on it, and, being a VERY devoted Anita Blake reader, I bought it to follow along in the series.Laurell K. Hamilton writes a short story called \\"The Girl Who Was Infatuated With Death\\" that is set between Blue Moon and Obsidian Butterfly. Even though the story is only about 30 pages, I couldn't help but read over and over the hot chemistry and scene between Anita and Jean-Claude. The story is about a mother who has a daughter that has bone cancer. The daughter wants to become a vampire to be able to live forever and ever and not get her leg chopped off. So, she goes to Anita for help. The question is, can she stop her in time? I absolutely loved this short story, I wish it was longer so that we could see something more happen between Anita and Jean-Claude. It was nice to go back in time with how Anita was before Narcissus in Chains, the next one in the series I need to read is Incubus Dreams.The second excerpt is also short and by Charlaine Harris called \\"One Word Answer\\" that is part of the Sookie Stackhouse series, which I am now going to begin after reading this short story. It is about some vampires who go to visit her after her cousin, who was also a vampire, died and bequethed her all of her money and things. Sookie is a telepathic who can read people's minds. What the story revolves around is, who killed her cousin? And why? We also see her previous lover, Bill the vampire, among others, which is also another reason why I want to read the previous books in the series (to see the relationship between Sookie and Bill).The third short story is by MaryJanice Davidson called \\"Biting in Plain Sight\\" and is about a vampire vet named Dr.Sophie Tourneau who has lived in a small town called Embarrass since the 1960's. There is a man who has also felt attracted to her named Liam and always finds excuses to go see her. The plot is about a vampire who is seducing innocent young women and causing them to commit suicide, she learns about this and wants to stop is, with a very lovable Liam by her side. This was actually a funny story and am more interested in reading more by her.The fourth story is by Angela Knight called \\"Galahad\\" and is a very hot story, starring Galahad, a very very old vampire and Caroline, a newly made Majae, a magical witch. The chemistry is very hot in this one. The plot is about finding enchanted cups that could be used to destroy and dominate. They obviously get together to fight the bad guys. Since she is a Majae, she must feed vampires or else her blood pressure gets too high, since that is what she was made for, and Galahad, being a very handsome and seductive vampire, is there to releave her of her burden. I kept rereading some scenes, they were too hot to pass:)The last story is by Vikie Taylor called \\"Bloodlust\\" and it is about a scientist, Daniel, who was able to make synthetic blood and it is stolen by a vampire, and his very deceitfully hidden fiancee, who is also a vampire, yet he doesn't know this. They rob him of his house, job, car, etc and he wants revenge. So, he seeks out Deadre, a vampire whom he wants to convert him into one. So she does and now he must figure out a way to get the formula back and to sort his feelings for Deadre.Very good short stories, I did wish that these stories were longer, nevertheless, now I must expand my reading collection to include these new authors to me."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"I it was a really good book to get you started. Especially if you are a Hamilton fan."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"The Anita Blake series is one of my favourite pieces of reading. Laurell is an amazing writer with an ability to make the paranormal seem normal and real and the monsters seem desirable. I course this means that we may havew to recognise that our attraction to them comes not from the fact that they are so beautiful but more from the fact that they appeal to our own darker side. I have always known I was gay and as a rebellious teenager I had a huge crush on Dracula (inter alia just to prove I, like all good little catholic boys learned Latin) But Laurell has a unique way of humanising her monsters that some may find disturbing and that others of us find comforting. It means that our crush on Dracula may not be irrefutable proof that we are insane, it may simply mean we are a little more in touch with that side of our natures that everyone else seems to be saying does not exist. Like so may of us, I think the men in Anita's life are gorgeous, that the courage and humanity sheo constantly displays deserves a medal, but most of all we want to thank Laurell for providing a series that we too can fantasise about, a literary home where we can become Anita for a few hours. Because the reality of the world we really live in gave us the horror of Mathew Sheppard, and every gay man lives every day with the reality that we may be the next Mathew. Laurelll shows in her worting that she knows that nothing she could ever make up could equal the real horror around us every day, and her wonderful acceptance of difference in her books gives us hope for the future. Thanks Laurell, not only for being an inspring writer; but also for being an inspriring human being. Bite was everything I hoped it would be. I may be in love with Nathaniel but I lust after Jason and the other men in Anita's life (sorry boys, but hey, my fantasies do not have to be your reality)"},{"Title":"Bite","review":"This is the first book I've read of Ms. Hamilton & I will read more.

It took me a couple of pages to get where Queen Betsy came into play. But I so love her. She's the first paranormal character that I loved and got me into my paranormal phase.

It is short, 29 pages and you will not get your Anita Blake fix. It takes you through a \\"case\\" that Anita takes on w/o any of the usual \\"activities\\" and there is nothing new to absorb or learn. I already know how & why Anita is avoiding Jean Claude. If you need an Anita fix, re-read one of the books from the series.Charlaine Harris's - One Word Answer is even shorter, 24 pages. But, a well worth its while short read, that did give me my Sookie Stackhouse fix as I wait for Dead To The World to come out in paperback. Not a lot of action but a good quick \\"fix\\".Mary Janice Davidson - Biting in Plain Site - Very good continuation of the series and another \\"fix\\". My only complaint, being from Minnesota, the main male squeeze, Liam, came off as some sort of lack witted, doofus. I had flashbacks of the movie Fargo and was screaming \\"NO we really don't talk like that\\". Betsy, the Queen, being a Minnesotan, should have whacked him upside his head with both shoes :-)Angela Knight - Galahad - WOW - Excellent. Another hot continuation of what I hope is a long running series. Too bad it was in an anthology, I certainly could have handled another 200 pages of that yummy Galahad. I am definitely making room on my bookshelves for this series!Vickie Taylor - Blood Lust - This is my first read by the author and after finishing I immediately did a \\"search\\". From what I read this is her 1st venture into the paranormal genre. This story was good and I see potential here, enough so that I have added her upcoming book, Carved In Stone to my wish list.My summation: This book is definitely worth the read. Being a series reader I put Angela Knight at tops, Mary Janice Davidson & Charlaine Harris right on her heels. I can envision several books from all series. Vickie Taylor makes a very good debut to paranormal romance.If you are a first time reader to Laurel K Hamilton's Anita Blake series, PLEASE start at the beginning. As an Anita Blake series fan I expected so much more depth & length. I asked myself, \\"Did they take a chapter that was cut from a earlier version? I hold the publisher responsible for their disservice to both Ms. Hamilton & the reader. They used Hamilton as a marketing scheme."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"I bought this anthology b/c of LKH's short about Anita. It turned out that this one wasn't that enjoyable, it was simply a filler that I thought didn't really need to be written. It supposedly filled in some of the question the reader has about the time frame between Blue Moon and Obsidian Butterfly but it left me with more questions. The Sookie Stackhouse short wasn't as I had hoped but hopefully it's leading into the next installment. Angela Knights \\"Galahad\\" was extremely hot. I thought this one was one of the better vampire shorts in a while. Also the MaryJanice Davidson story was really good, I haven't read her undead series so now after reading this short story I think I will. Last but certainly not least was the Vickie Taylor short story \\"Blood Lust\\" that story was my favorite out of them all. I wished it had been longer though, it was good enough to be made into a whole novel. Overall I think if you love vampire romance then pick this anthology up. I was extremely pleased with purchasing it and I thought it was a lot better than Cravings.

I also agree that the stories really require you to have read the other stories in their respective series in order to understand what is going on with the characters. I snap up anything written by many of these authors and will continue to do so. I recommend you find the back stories before you continue with these."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"This is a grouping of stories, many of which are part of a larger series.The first, by the most recent Queen of Vampyr Fic, is a Laurell K Hamilton piece. It is from the Anita Blake world but a) is not lifted directly from one of her larger works and b) isn't full of embarrassing sex. Pretty good. Still, I think you need to know the Anita/JeanClaude back story to get this completely.The second, One Word Answer, is a Sookie story, and is also a winner. In this case, I think you probably can read the short alone, though you're better off if you've read the series. There are just these little in's - like Bubba - that you won't get completely without the other books.Biting in Plain Sight is a Betsy story - and MaryJanice Davidson has just totally made the Clueless Vampire the Coolest one. Here we have a glimpse into Betsy's court, and it's a pretty darn funny place. You also get to meet some other vamps of the realm... this story and the Harris make it worth the purchase price, if you're a reader of these two series.Galahad may or may not be part of a further universe. I believe it is, but it explained enough for me to be able to read it and enjoy it. I liked it enough to go pick up another Angela Knight book.Finally, Blood Lust, by Vickie Taylor, is a full story unto itself. It's a good short story, and worth the read.Another fun summer book, especially if you like flighty stories about vampires.(*)>"},{"Title":"Bite","review":"I seldom give 5 stars to an anthology, however I enjoyed each one of these stories.Laurell Hamilton:Anita Blake comes face to face with tempation in this short story. Just one small incidence in her interesting life.Charlaine Harris:Sookie Stackhouse has an interesting interview with an entity sent by the Queen of the Vampires. Sometimes it's just a matter of choice, but whose choice is it?MaryJanice Davidson:Someone is triffling with the emotions of young girls. They are committing suicide for love. The local vampiress must contact the new Queen of the Vampires, Betsy, for some help.Angela Knight:A new magae has a vision. A vision of herself and Galahad fighting evil vamps. It's hard enough to go to someone like Galahad and tell him he has to help her destroy a bunch of vamps. She has had no training so how is she to do her part to protect this hero as well as herself?Vickie Taylor:The Queen of the Vamps keeps everyone under control by controlling the supply of blood. In other words, she decides who gets to feed. Daniel is a researcher who has perfected a new blood substitute. She won't allow anyone to control the blood supply but herself.

Hamilton, and because of this book I am now an avid reader of Charlaine Harris and her character \\"Sookie Stackhouse\\". I assure you that you will not be disappointed in this book."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"Ok, to be fair, my ire applies only to Laurell K. Hamilton and Charlaine Harris. But! I bought the book because those two are my favorites, and I'm desperate for some more Anita Blake and Sookie Stackhouse. Harris' and Hamilton's short stories start the anthology. Each is about 30-pages long and read like chapters instead of full stories. The Hamilton story is noticeably unfinished - the main plot dealing with an interesting ethical question of vampire making is just dropped. The End. Curious about the ethical question? Too bad for you. Boo, Anita Blake! How about some more plot and less of your romantic angst.Harris' thirty pages were interesting, but again awfully short. You learn a little bit more about Harris' version of vampire society, but it could have waited for the next full book. It was disappointing to get just a terse little taste.The winner of this anthology was Galahad by Angela Knight. This story had all that I ask for: hero, heroine, problem or question to be solved, happy ending, sex, and true love. Faint of heart, beware. Knight has some graphic sex between her modern girl and her knight in shining armor. It was a fun quickie with enough mythology to make it interesting.Davidson and Taylor's stories were also fun and entertaining. Not memorable for me, but certainly worth the read. They gave me enough of a peek at their vampire worlds and their writing styles to make me want to read more."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"*** If you like vampires, then this is a treasure trove for you. Although the last two entries in the book tend to drag it down just slightly, the one entitled Galahad would not do so if it were less, shall we say - biologically correct? Ms. Knight does exhibit true creativity in re-inventing the Grail quest, much more so than certain best sellers. If you buy the book just to read Ms. Davidson, Ms. Harris, and of course Ms. Hamilton's contributions, you will not waste a dime. Ms. Harris and Ms. Davidson both have down to earth humor that will tickle and charm you. Anita Blake fans will be thrilled to get an anthology story that does not merely reprint a chapter from one of the long books. Taking place between Blue Moon and Obsidian Butterfly, the Girl Who Was Infatuated with Death returns fans to a classic period of Anita's characterization. Although Death does not refer to Edward as might be hoped, it is still a commendable story that is not weighed down by the aspects that has long time fans feeling rather mutinous in regard to the latest books. ***"},{"Title":"Bite","review":"Bite is a book of short stories about vampires. All of the stories except the Sookie one have romantic undertones. Overall, I thought Bite was a really good anthology. I don't always tend to like short stories since they can't usually be thoroughly developed, but these were pretty good.The Girl Who Was Infatuated With Death - Laurell K. Hamilton - This is about a girl who wants to be turned into a vampire, but is underage. It's illegal for a vampire to turn someone that's underage, so Anita tries to find the girl and the vampire before he kills her and can be executed. Let me start off by saying I've never read any of the Anita Blake books. Even so, this was a pretty enjoyable story. It made me want to give the series a try.One Word Answer - Charlaine Harris - This is a Sookie Stackhouse short story. It's about what happens to her cousin Hadley. If you're a fan of the series, you'll enjoy this one.Biting in Plain Site - Mary Janice Davidson - It's my understanding that this is a Queen Betsy story. I've never read any of the Queen Betsy books before, but I've read another Davidson short story in the past and didn't like it all. Also, this was probably my least favorite story in the book. Because of this, I'm afraid to give one of her complete novels a go.Galahad - Angela Knight - This was by far and away my favorite story in the book! It takes place in the Mageverse, a magical otherworld with witches and vampires and magic. I read another of Knight's Mageverse short stories in an anthology and loved it as well! I'm definitely going to have to pick up the series. I think I have the first full sized novel around here somewhere...Anyway, this was HOT, HOT, HOT!Blood Lust - Vickie Taylor - Blood Lust is about a microbiologist that creates a synthetic blood that could change the human and vampire world forever. I thought this was a really good story too."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"I read a lot fantasy and I'm always trying new stuff, and I constantly find these omnibuses important, as they give casual readers a chance to try an author's work without investing the reader's time in a full-length novel.\\"Bite\\" has five short stories and novellas by some of the more popular writers of vampire romances.--Laurell Hamilton writes THICK vampire novels that are filled with Goth posing and rampant sex. \\"The Girl Who Was Infatuated With Death\\" only seems to exist so a couple of leather clad Goth posers who think that they are sexier than they really are can pant and paw over each other. There is some inane plotline about a vampire committing an act of statutory underage biting, but really, this was given short shrift, with the story being nothing but all attitude. 1 star--Charlaine Harris is a regional writer and \\"One Word Answer\\" reminds me of Manly Wade Wellman's stuff, only with more humor. In this case Sookie is informed that her childhood friend andcousin has gotten staked, so Sookie has to become a detective to find out what really happened and solve the mystery of her cousin's death. This was my first Harris' story, and it has caused me to go out and buy everything of hers that was in print, and get her older stuff as it got reprinted. 4 stars.--MaryJanice Davidson's \\"Biting in Plain Sight\\" gives us a hottie vampire vet, who discovering the work of a serial vampire killer does what a tough babe has gotta do. So, she heads to vampire central in Minneapolis (!), with her hunky new squeeze, to report to the new vampire queen. After the perfunctory giving in to the urge to merge, the story goes from fun to funny when they meet the queen, who is a flake and obsessed with shoes, and hunt down the killer. 4 stars.--Angela Knight's \\"Galahad\\" is like a story with grand excitement, characters, and storyline, only, without those things because it suxeth badly. Sir Galahad is a vampire (!), a woman has to get her bell rang three times from an OFFICIAL court seducer to get her witchly powers (!), and unless a witch gets sucked every three days her head explodes (!?!). The world is under fire, vampire hordes are attacking, and our two \\"heroes\\" decide that they just gotta knock knickers. The plotting is inane, and the action and sex scenes are just sad. And there are just two big ewwws that insurmountable for me, the first for implied oral sex with a fire-breathing dragon, and the other for the \\"good\\" guys tricking a woman into having sex with a goat. 0 stars--Vickie Taylor gives us \\"Blood Lust\\", a lite, sci-fi pulp tale of sex, vengeance, and super science. A hunky scientist has his wife and professional life stolen, and decides on some payback by getting vamped by a toothy cutie. Remember the story about getting what you wish for. Here was a case where the story is too darn short, because though this story is quick and fun, the ending seems rushed, as some sub-plots aren't ever developed, or developed enough. This really should have been a novel. 3 stars, needs a better ending.This anthology came out at when most of these authors were just becoming popular with their mythologies. The Harris, Davidson, and Taylor stories are fun, fast stories, but the Hamilton and Knight stories are . . . ah . . . umm . . . did I mention that the Harris, Davidson, and Taylor stories are pretty dang good? The Harris, Davidson, Hamilton and Knight stories are all set in their author's respective universes. Four stars for the Harris, Davidson and Taylor stories."},{"Title":"Bite","review":"This is a very good book. I sat down and read it one evening.

By the end of the first chapter, terms like &quot;function pairs,&quot; &quot;temperament types,&quot; and &quot;tertiary functions&quot; lay in a garbled heap in my head. But I forged on to the following chapters and found much of value. Unlike many writers about typology, Baab suggested ways of using type information to develop and enhance our less dominant functions. She gave specific, credible examples to back up her assertion that it is unwise to make generalizations about people on the basis of type. And she included the best review of the relevant literature and annotated bibliography about this topic that I have ever seen."},{"Title":"Personality Type In Congregations","review":"For those with at least a beginning understanding of the Myers-Briggs personality types, this book will offer lots of practical help. Baab includes sections on prayer and Bible study, placing volunteers, Christian education, the sometimes tricky area of committe meetings, and worship. As an instructor in a Bible Institute, I have been able to reach more students by using her suggestions.I particularly appreciated that Baab sees the limits as well as the value of personality type. She avoids the error of forcing people into the box of their personality type. Her last chapter gives wise advice to those who are recently introducted to type. She gives enough examples so that I was always able to follow her thoughts, although I am not trained in type.I would like to give a more complete review, but I don't have the book in front of me. I lent it to my pastor!"},{"Title":"Personality Type In Congregations","review":"Anyone who is involved in local church ministry and has at least basic familiarity with the Myers-Briggs personality types will find this book a wonderful help.Ms. Baab includes personal spirituality, worship, Christian education, congregational business meetings, and the best utilization of volunteers in her discussion of type in the congregation. She offers an excellent balance of theoretical discussion and examples that always allowed me to understand where she was going.Baab writes as an &quot;old hand&quot; rather than as a new convert to the use of type, and her experience shows. Her last chapter gives solid advice to those who might move too fast in implementing type. She also recognizes that type is only a partial description of a person. Family experiences, spiritual maturity, and simply the sovereignty of God all affect how a person will best grow in his or her relationship with God and in service to the church.I teach in a Bible Institute, and have found the book useful in advising students in their spiritual lives, as well as in teaching in a way that reaches students who are not of my type. I would be able to give a more detailed review, but I lent the book to my pastor, so don't have it in front of me!"},{"Title":"From Renaissance to Impressionism: Styles and Movements in Western Art, 1400-1900 (Grove Art Series)","review":"the grove dictionary of art was very useful, and helpful when writing my resarch paper. a very easy to use and accurate source of information."},{"Title":"Independence: A play in two acts","review":"Lee Blessing's &quot;Independence&quot; is a remarkably well-written realist play in which 4 wonderful female characters reveal their psyche in the most disturbing, yet interesting and funny manner. The play begins with the older daughter's homecoming to the small town of Independence from the big city after 4 years to visit her mentally sick mother and her two younger sisters, one of which is pregnant and soon-to-be a single mother and the other a teenage rebel. What really captivates the reader's interest is how Blessing brings the audience into the story by using the older daughter's need to know more about her family again. As the characters find out more and more about each other, the reader will also find him or herself reacting to the situations that present themselves. The whole play flows like a continuous &quot;crescendo&quot; up until the last moment of the last scene. Laughter, tears, surprise, astonishment and connection are only a few of the many emotions you will experience in this wonderful roller-coaster effect play. Thumbs definitely up for this one!"},{"Title":"Independence: A play in two acts","review":"As a director considering plays, I found this one to have some good characters, a solid throughline, and plenty of opprortunity to make your own decisions. It would be easy to paint any of the women (especially the mother) into being a stock character, but the web of relationships expose facets that can create a depth that takes it out of it's \\"We gotta get out of this place\\" premise.One might think, though, that the final scene was accidently typed into the script from incomplete notes that Blessing had accidently left in the stack when she sent it off.

It's hard, in part because the basic message of the strike and its outcome was and still is pretty discouraging. I had the feeling Wolff was running out of enthusiasm for the task well before he or I got to the end of the book. I was also disappointed in the map of Homestead, which turned out sketchy and inaccurate when I laid it beside a street map of the town from that time. There were useful materials in the Homestead public library when I looked (after Wolff's book was published) that apparently he didn't look into. I'm guessing better books on the subject have been written since this one came out."},{"Title":"Lockout; The Story of the Homestead Strike of 1892","review":"Lockout : the story of the Homestead strike of 1892: A study of violence, unionism, and the Carnegie steel empireNew York Times Book Review May 23, 1965Big Steel Won the BattleReview by Eric F. GoldmanThe anarchist Alexander Berkman left his restaurant and his mistress, traveled down to Homestead, Pa., fired two shots point blank at the Carnegie steel manager, Henry Clay Frink. Pvt. William L Iams of the Pennsylvania National Guard heard the news, shouted \\"three cheers!\\" and was sentenced by his commanding officer to hand by his thumbs until he was unconscious. Strike leaders were arrested for \\"treason,\\" a labor sympathizer hired a cook to put arsenic and croton oil in the food of scabs, and workers fought Pinkertons with rifles, cannons and dynamite.The homestead steel strike of 1892 was certainly one of the most savage labor battles in the history of the United States. It reflected the deep cleavage that had developed in American life by 1890's and it affected all labor-management relations for decades to come. The details from an engrossing story and Leon Wolff, author of the fine historical works, \\"In Flanders Field\\" and \\"Little Brown Brothers,\\" does it full justice in this imaginatively researched and vividly written volume.The noisy issue in the strike was wages, but a more fundamental question was whether the Carnegie Steel Company was going to continue to deal with the union, the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers. Still more basic was the issue that racked all aspects of American life in the 1890's: Was business to operate solely to make as much money as possible or did it bear some responsibility for helping to bring about a decent way of life for its employees?Andrew Carnegie, the principal owner of the Homestead operation, had written quite specifically of his respect for unions and his general concern for labor. But during the strike he kept right on vacationing in Scotland and did nothing to soften the policy of his company. He left the direction of the firm's actions to Henry Clay Frick, a pale, humorless, harsh minded man)\\"In all the world he had not one friend,\\" M. Wolff writes.) who early in life had dedicated himself to the relentless pursuit of profits. The union leadership was quite capable of naivet&eacute;. The whole country was filled with a bedlam of movements of discontent. The result were a brutal strike-one reflected in angry feelings across the nation.At first, the clash was technically a lockout. When Frick tried to land about 300 Pinkertons men under cover of darkness on the Monongahela River side of the plant, the outraged workers opened fire with every weapon available. This and ensuing event led to about 35 deaths-including at least two suicides-and wholesale destruction in the area. When the lockout turned into a strike, Frick remained totally rigid and in time the striking workers drifted out of town or came to work like so many whipped animals. The union was destroyed. Strike leaders were blacklisted in the whole industry. At Homestead the 12-hour days, seven days per week, with a24 hours stretch period every second week, was restored for all classes of workers.Mr. Wolff makes every effort to be fair. (\\"Lockout\\" is one of the most impartial labor histories we have.) But objectivity required that he describe the pathetic condition of the workers, the iron policies of Frick and the soaring profits made by the company as a result of breaking the strike. It also required his description of the strange behavior of Carnegie. Mr. Wolff comments: \\"The actions taken by the Carnegie company were in gross violation of the pro-labor principles he himself had stated for so many years. He was-or appeared to be-the hypocrite supreme.The reader shares fully the irony of Mr. Wolff's little story of the aged Carnegie, regal in his Fifth Avenue mansion, turning to a secretary and asking, \\"How much did you say I had given away, Poynton?\\"\\"$324,657,399\\"\\"Good Heaven! Where did I ever get all that money?\\"Curiously enough, \\"Lockout\\" does not sufficiently emphasize an important aspect of the Homestead strike. It was one of the major events of the 1890's which, because of their very bitterness, helped undo men of the Frick mentality. It was an alarm bell not only to the humane but to the pragmatic. Memories of the strike helped leaders like President Theodore Roosevelt make plain to the larger public that if some restraints were not put on the money-driving of the more ruthless, the whole American system of free economy might well give way to some variety of Socialism.Whatever its minor flaws, \\"Lockout\\" is not only absorbing but highly encouraging reading. In our own era, every other spring may bring troubles between labor and management in the steel industry but a repetition of the Homestead is inconceivable. \\"Lockout\\" makes clear, as only rich history can, just how far toward sanity and decency we have traveled."},{"Title":"Dressed for Death","review":"I love mysteries and this one has it all.

Guido Brunetti, his actions are very real both in his professional & personal life.Setting out to find the murderer of a seemingly male transvestite, the story takes the reader along that line. It also takes the reader into the world of graft, cover-up, local political wrong-doings & crooked banking. Det. Brunetti pretty much knows who is responsible for the murders & crooked dealings. Proving it is another matter. The ending provides a very nice twist by the author in which the bad guy is proven guilty.The fact the story is set in Venice is an added enjoyment"},{"Title":"Dressed for Death","review":"Guido Brunetti is an Italian murder detective who is not swayed by power or public assumptions, but wait for the case to unfold before making judgements.

Having only visited Venice once, I am by no means very familiar, but she creates such an excellent atmosphere, I feel as though I am in the city and know it as well as Brunetti himself. The case was interesting and Leon doesn't go the easy route by always declaring one clear villain. Brunetti himself is so likable, I feel, as I do withBarbara Cleverly's Joe Sandilands, sad that I can never actually meet him. Fortunately I can intrude into his fictional life and enjoy Leon's many books.

It's a bang-up mystery,even the second time around."},{"Title":"Dressed for Death","review":"In this novel, also published as \\"The Anonymous Venetian\\", besides delivering a tantalizing mystery, Leon deeply explores another aspect of Italian culture: the firmly rooted concepts of \\"macho\\" and proud males. When the body of a man is found with his faced bashed in, in a woman's dress, and with makeup and shaved legs, many in the police force decide that the crime is not worth their time. However, those readers that know Commissario Guido Brunetti and his ethical thinking, know that he will put as much effort in solving this case as in any other. Even if the case belongs to another jurisdiction and gets assigned to him shortly before he plans to leave with his family on vacation, Brunetti approaches this with the respect and seriousness he always shows.The investigation takes Brunetti through a very interesting underworld, where Leon shows her ability for depicting fascinating characters. The twists and turns may be limited in this novel, but the writing style and side aspects are so good that the overall quality of this work is outstanding. As is usually the case in this series, we get to witness a good portion of Brunetti's family life, and his interactions with his witty wife and teenage son and daughter. There is also a side plot that has to do with Patta, Brunetti's supervisor, and the problems he is going through with his wife. These make him the topic of conversation in the police department and will provide the reader with a couple of laughs, especially those that have hated the way he has treated Brunetti in the past.The food still plays a major role in this novel, and it is very effective in conveying the lifestyle of the main characters. Every time I read one of these books I feel like booking a ticket, going to Venice and experiment these delicacies myself. Those that enjoy mysteries with well-developed and likable characters, plus good depictions of places and cultures, will find this series to be their perfect fit."},{"Title":"Dressed for Death","review":"Donna Leon continues to bring me into the everyday life of the Venetians.

Don't pass this one up without giving it a try."},{"Title":"Dressed for Death","review":"If you haven't read any of Donna Leon books, you are missing a great writer and story teller. Also her background of Venice by actualy living in Venice, Italy is her true key to true enjoyment. The Commissario is so Italian and down to earth. A MUST READ!"},{"Title":"Dressed for Death","review":"Nancy in Seattle, WA : I really enjoyed this mystery which sweltered in a Venetian heat wave. The pace is leisurely and the search for what really happpened gradually builds up tension. This is 'Body Heat' without the sex."},{"Title":"Dressed for Death","review":"Donna Leon's Commissario Guido Brunetti offers firsthand glimpses into the everyday life of the police of Venice's Questore. This story breaks just as Brunetti is scheduled to take his family to the mountains to escape the sweltering heat of August in the city. No such luck for Guido, who must stay and solve an unsavory murder in the Maghera, a particularly repellent industrial section of the municipality. But the fingers of fate soon slither across the channel to entangle some of the most elevated members of Venetian life. Once again Brunetti proves that there is no substitute for thorough, if mundane, investigative work to assure that justice prevails."},{"Title":"Dressed for Death","review":"The Venice Questura learns there had been a death, apparently in the vicinity of a factory. Red shoes of the victim trigger the discovery of the body. Guido Brunetti hears about the matter at 2:30.Guido is filling in for another unit. He is married to Paola who has a tendancy to go too far. The death presents a puzzle for Brunetti to solve using his system. Police procedurals include intuition, the learning curve of an officer's experience. This faculty, placed in the wonderful setting of Venice, is on display here.The Brunettis are the parents of two children Raffaele and Chiara. Guido refuses to go to Bolzano with his family while the murder case is pending. In his family's absence, events move swiftly to pile on loss to a range of victims and to add complexity to baffle the crime-solvers. Complexity consists in part on suspected financial crimes turning on the relative scarcity of apartments in Venice. (No one throws away rent receipts.) Too, the Commissario, Guido Brunetti, has a difficult superior.On vacation, Paola tells Guido she has been reading THE SACRED FOUNT and it is wonderful, nothing happens. The book's story is exciting. The theme of evil is paralleled in Guido's mind by his reading of Tacitus. Bravo."},{"Title":"Dressed for Death","review":"Venice - Gritty SuspenseTake a look at the gritty underbelly of Venice..I very much enjoy Donna Leon's novels (17 or so) centering on the somewhat suave Police Inspector, Guido Brunetti. Chilling crime, depavity, revenge & murder. These novels (I've read at least 12 so far) always give a 'humorous view' of the \\"pecking order\\" within the politics the police force, region and country; as well as the way the Venetians view themselves, their news sources, food, weather, rising tides, and families. Reading these books, you'll also come to know his politically inspired wife, and other family members...Having been to Venice twice, I always pull out my City Map to follow Guido as he walks through the labyrinth of narrow calles, over the many bridges, often putting himself in danger as his investigations unfold.''Dressed for Death'' is my favorite so far, closely followed by ''Death in a Srange Country''.WARNING / NOTE: Some books published in the UK w/ different titles.

This book marks the first appearance of the remarkable Signorina Eletra, the Questura secretary who is skilled at computer research and has an amazing ability to ferret out the most secret information. I am a Donna Leon fan and have read all the books I can get my hands on (about 6, I think). This is one of my favorites.

Her tales of Venice and its habitants are a delightful read and bring the city to life. Her characters are lovable and the background terrific. If you like a \\"gentle\\" mystery, Donna Leon is wonderful. Inspector Brunetti and his staff are developed so well that one feels they could be invited to dinner. Zuppa de pesce for all!!"},{"Title":"Dressed for Death","review":"When her Commissario Brunetti series began in the early '90s, author Donna Leon, for privacy reasons, was not allowing any of her books to be published either here, in her home country, or in Italy, her adopted country.Beginning in 2003 with \\"Uniform Justice,\\" the 12th in the series, Leon relented and U.S. editions of her novels finally began appearing here. For reasons unknown, two of those first 11 titles*--all of them long available in Britain--were re-titled for American audiences: Book #3, about a respected Venetian banker who's found murdered and dressed in drag, known as \\"The Anonymous Venetian\\" in Britain, arrived in the US as \\"Dressed for Death.\\" Book #4, about a prostitution ring run by well connected Venetians and involving the illegal import of young women from Eastern Europe, and titled \\"A Venetian Reckoning\\" in Britain, became \\"Death and Judgment\\" here. You can now buy either book here under either title.Why? I'm guessing it might have something to do with the the German TV series that recently became available here on DVD in 2-disc sets. Discs #1 and 2 are based on books #4 and 3. Further complicating matters, episode #1, based on book #4, (\\"A Venetian Reckoning\\" a k a \\"Death and Judgment\\" in print) gets a third name on screen: \\"Vendetta.\\" Disc #2, based on book #3, sticks with the British title \\"The Anonymous Venetian,\\" which you may have already read under the title \\"Dressed for Death.\\" To complicate things even a bit more, the \\"The Anonymous Venetian\\" book has two product pages on Amazon--one that has the \\"The\\" left off its title and one that doesn't.I don't think the intention is to sell fans books they've already read. More likely, I think, it's to help those who are just now discovering Brunetti via the TV series to find the novels associated with that series.As I've only watched the first pair of discs in the TV series, (with German actors filmed in Venice playing Italians who all spoke German with English subtitles), I can't tell you what, if any, further confusions might have cropped up after that. Meanwhile, at this writing this reader is looking forward to Brunetti book #21, \\"Beastly Things,\\" which is due out in April.*Actually three early Leon books were retitled for America. Book #6, \\"Quietly in Their Sleep,\\" is known as \\"The Death of Faith\\" in Britain, but is not sold here under that title.

One way or another, I'm back in \\"interest\\" for the detective work of Cmmissario Guido Brunetti. This must have been one of Ms. Leon's first books because he's not so tired out as in later ones.

A Green Journey, my first Hassler book, ranks up there as one of my new favorites.Hassler is a wonderful observer of small-town America, and A Green Journey begins in Staggerford, Minnesota. Agatha McGee, a 68 year-old parochial school teacher, anchors this novel. This no-nonsense, orthodox spinster is as feisty as she is inflexible. \\"Every time Rome announced some new accommodation to a century that was already two thirds gone, Agatha felt betrayed. Her heart had already been broken countless times since Vatican II, for it was not too much to say that Agatha loved the Church of her girlhood above everything else in the world.\\" Yet, Agatha could be full of surprises--as when she takes in the pregnant teenager and former student, Janet Raft. Raft is a \\"hardscrabble\\" motherless girl from a poor farming family, but McGee sees promise in this bright teen.Unfortunately, McGee's world is threatened when her diocese is assigned a new bishop, Dick Baker. Bishop Baker is set upon making many changes to the traditions McGee holds dear. The two quickly become adversaries.The diocese sponsors a trip to Ireland, and McGee and Baker sign on with ulterior motives. McGee has an Irish pen-pal, Jim O'Hannon. She senses that O'Hannon might be her last chance for romance. Baker is looking for Irish priests to move to Minnesota, but in reality, he is trying to befriend McGee and convince her to take on a new job. Raft is also on the trip. The journey was supposed to be her honeymoon, but her husband backs out. These three make an unlikely trio, and there are some major disappointments for all of them.I very much like Jon Hassler's writing style, his character development and the way he paces his plot. He definitely has a sense of the absurd, and I really had to chuckle at the confirmation scene, as well as when the bishop thought he was poisoned by mushrooms.Hassler also has his finger on the pulse of Staggerford. He describes the parish priest as being \\"of middling intelligence serving a parish of middling spiritual and financial resources and determined to keep to the middle of the road.\\" How true of most small towns.I was disappointed to discover that Jon Hassler passed away on March 20th, 2008. But thank goodness he left behind a rich body of work that can still be enjoyed. I understand that Hassler uses Agatha McGee in his novel, Staggerford, which I am anxious to read. I can only hope that all of his books are as good as A Green Journey."},{"Title":"A concordance to the Greek Testament: According to the texts of Westcott and Hort, Tischendorf and the English revisers","review":"The first edition of this work was produced in 1897.

A former governess now retired helps her assume false credentials in order to obtain a position as governess until her twenty-fifth birthday when she gains control of her inheritance. She finds it fairly easy to settle into her humble role--but not so easy to control her emotions around her very attractive employer, Lord Trenville.Lord Trenville has never found it difficult to follow the honorable Whitson family policy of not getting involved with employees--until the very attractive governess arrives. Except for her status, &quot;Miss Palmer&quot; is everything he ever wanted in a mate. But someone in his household is a French spy, and &quot;Miss Palmer&quot; doesn't seem to be a typical governess. Circumstantial evidence--and a lack of other suspects--makes him wonder if she could indeed be guilty of treason. And if she were, would he risk his own political position to save her?A highly-recommended &quot;sweet&quot; romance with just enough mystery to keep a reader glued to the pages.

I bought this book after reading the other one, and I read about 30 pages into it, and set it aside, picking it up once or twice, reading a couple of pages, and setting it down. Today, after it sat on my bedside stand for about three weeks, I finished it. It was a good book, overall, but the beginning dragged so much I just couldn't get into it. After the heroine, Elinor, goes into disguise as a governess to escape a forced marriage, the story stalls for a while. The father of her charges, Adrian(a lord) has no clue that Elinor is really Lady Elinor. Elinor and Adrian are slowly attracted to each other. The plot doesn't really pick up until there is a race to unmask a traitor who is giving information to the French, and finally Elinor and Adrian are able to admit their love for each other. There wasn't much of a mystery as to who the traitor was(there were a lot of clues that were obvious to the reader, but not to Adrian or Elinor). I was a bit disappointed too that the children didn't play a bigger part in the book. I think that the story could have gone well without the spy aspect, focusing more on Adrian's children and Adrian and Elinor's growing affection. As it was, it was an entertaining book, despite the dragging start, but not one of her most memorable books.

Last year, I saw a copy in the bargain rack at a large retail bookstore and snapped it up.Of all the books I have regarding Medal of Honor recipients, this is the most impressive. No, it does not cover every recipient ... mainly because it focuses on those who were still alive at the time the book was being written (although several men had passed away before final publishing).The presentation of these men is somber and most importantly, honorable ... not a cheap over-the-top glorification. Ordinary men and average citizens who thought of others before themselves.

How can you forget Audi Murphy the most decorated person of any war."},{"Title":"Medal of Honor: Portraits of Valor Beyond the Call of Duty","review":"I always feel reverence for the service given by the veterans of our armed forces. For me, it matters little what they did because they spent a portion of their life supporting the defense of our freedom. Everyone in the military matters.Even so, those who have faced the rigor of combat have earned an even deeper gratitude. What they face in battle changes their life forever. It can never be the same. An evidence of this is how difficult it is for combat veterans to describe their experience of the war to those of us who have never shared in that experience. The closest most of us get is watching documentaries on The History Channel or reading serious books on the history of the various conflicts that have required so much of our soldiers.This is a wonderful and serious book. Our country has awarded the Medal of Honor, our highest military award, to only about 3,400 recipients since the award was created. Of that number, fewer than 140 are alive today. This book provides portraits of those still living. One page provides a current photograph of each man and another page briefly tells about what was done to merit the award. Each story causes me to shake my head in disbelief. These stories describe acts of selflessness, of duty, of courage that inspire a deep gratitude and admiration for these men and the thousands like them who have passed on.As I turned the pages of this book, I felt I was in a sacred place. I looked at the picture of the young man who became a hero, read the words of his heroism, and then look in the face and eyes of the older man who has lived so long after those acts, and yet I suppose that day is ever with them. I do not know, but from my own life I know that there are certain pivotal events that are never far from the surface.Millions of soldiers have faced combat and each has my gratitude. In know that there are countless acts of service and heroism that are never recognized. Those included in this book are only representative of the heroism so many have shown in combat. To all of them, I say thank you. To each of the men included in this book I also offer my deepest gratitude. Your stories inspire us and provide examples of the highest qualities for future generations.We can all aspire to such selflessness, duty, and courage if and when we are called to face an extreme challenge. It is good to document and remember these acts of heroism even if they are only representative of the truly large number heroes who have served our nation. Those honored here are indeed special men with special stories. As we hold these to our hearts with thanks we also need to think about the millions of stories we do not know and remember them as well.It was wonderful to read about the heroes from World War II and Korea that are still with us. However, I was especially gratified to read about those whose heroic acts were given in Vietnam. It is past time for us to take seriously our neglect of these veterans and realize all that was given in service on our behalf. We owe then a debt and we need to pay it. A first step is to get to know what was done for us and learn the truth instead of simplistic anti-war propaganda.You owe it to yourself to take a tour through this book and think about what these men, and so many like them, were asked to do and what they did to answer that call."},{"Title":"Medal of Honor: Portraits of Valor Beyond the Call of Duty","review":"My father, Lieutenant Colonel Jimmie Dyess, USMCR, earned the Medal of Honor in World War II. He is also the recipient of America's highest award for civilian heroism, the Carnegie Medal, which he earned at age 19. He is not included in Medal of Honor by Peter Collier because he was killed in combat and only the living Medal of Honor recipients are profiled in this book. On March 25, 2005, Mr. Robert Avilla wrote and very unfavorable review of this book because it did not include a profile on Roy Benavidez. Mr. Avilla may not have understood why Benavidez was not included in Medal of Honor. Since Benavidez died in 1998, he, like my father, was not included in the book which was not published until five years after Benavidez's death. Happily, Benavidez wrote an autobiography before he died. This book is available through amazon.com. In sum, Medal of Honor by Peter Collier is a magnificent tribute to our living Medal of Honor recipients. It should be required reading for every young person in America."},{"Title":"Medal of Honor: Portraits of Valor Beyond the Call of Duty","review":"This is a classic coffee table book. It's too large to fit on your book shelves but just right to rest on your coffee table. And, since it includes 117 separate and distinct stories of living men who won the Medal of Honor, you can pick it up, read a page or two, then put it down and come back to it later without skipping a beat. Best of all, the stories are interesting enough that your friends will enjoy scanning the book while you're off making the margaritas.In the book you'll meet such diverse characters as the man who won the [Congressional] Medal of Honor and then went on to become a janitor at the Air Force Academy, another who went on to become the Commandant of the Marine Corps, and still another who asked that his award simply be mailed to him. Then there's the fellow on whose body Forrest Gump's head was superimposed receiving the medal from President Johnson and the medical corpsman who rescued 75 GIs on Okinawa, all the while praying, \\"Dear God, let me get just one more man.\\" And what about the fellow whose award was expedited so he could receive it before he died of his wounds, only to survive? And on it goes . . .For those interested in American history and America's heroes, these stories are not only interesting but also awe inspiring. Some may bring a tear to your eye, while others will bring a swell of pride to your chest. Many will also make you wonder where such men come from and how they can do such heroic deeds.My only complaint about the book is that I would like to have read about some of those who won the award but did not survive. But I guess that would be another story."},{"Title":"Medal of Honor: Portraits of Valor Beyond the Call of Duty","review":"A dear friend highly recommended Medal of Honor: Portraits of Valor Beyond the Call of Duty so recently I was standing in the bookstore waiting for the clerk to find it on the computer. After the third try she told me it was not showing up on her screens when another shopper walked up to me and placed it in my hands. He said &quot; I overheard you asking for this and I had just looked it over&quot;With this auspicious beginning, my journey into the world of Medal of Honor winners began. As I looked through this beautiful book, I found myself taken by the photography and absorbed by the accompanying text which details the events of each honoree. Although I looked at each page and the photographs, I found that I had to pace myself on reading the text and short biographies. That is a lot there on many levels so I used the photos as a guide to decide which ones to read during this first encounter.This book evoked tears for me. I have served in the military although not in combat. Also I have served in the US Peace Corp so I have always been aware of the paradox of the human condition.While reading, I found discovered some very ambivalent feelings. Respect and admiration for the portraits of courage was obvious. Yet, simultaneously, a soul felt sadness when I realized that the &quot;enemy&quot; described on several pages, could very well have been the beloved grandfather of a dear friend I stayed with in Germany recently.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to explore the challenges of the human spirit.DG Mogle"},{"Title":"Medal of Honor: Portraits of Valor Beyond the Call of Duty","review":"I am one of those folks who reads about 50 books a year.

He then returned home to reenter the 9th grade since he had promised his mother that he would complete high school when the war was over.

In this unforgettable book, welearn the true meaning of the terms &quot;manhood&quot; and&quot;warrier&quot; in the most sacred sense.Nick Del Calzo is more than a photographer; he is avisionary of the human essence.

Who would know that men could accomplish such feats against such overwhelming odds. The wonderful photographs and powerful essays by Tom Brokaw and Senator McCain clearly bring home the respect and honor these men have earned. There are a couple of special highlights that some readers might miss. One are the inspiring quotes inside the front and back covers from the men featured in the book such as World War II Veteran John Hawk who said, &quot;I came when I was called and I did the best I could.&quot; Second is the final 117th portrait and story on the Tomb of the Unknowns where the author tells of the &quot;soldiers&quot; interred there, &quot;known but to God,&quot; who have also been bestowed with the Medal of Honor. They symbolize the service of all those who came back from foreign battlefields where they served their country and those who died there. One cannot hope to read this book and feel anything other than profound pride in the raw courage and selfless service demonstrated by these men and all who serve in uniform today. It certainly brings home how important it is to perpetuate the legacy of what the Medal of Honor represents and how &quot;ordinary men and women can challenge fate and literally change the course of history, if they have the courage to try,&quot; another quote in the book by Medal of Honor recipient Paul Bucha.

One of these people was Marine Sgt. Freddy Gonzalez, who was a platoon leader during the 1968 Tet Offensive in Hue City, Vietnam, and he died defending his men. He is probably the most honored Vietnam serviceman, because he has had two biographies written about him, many other medals, including three Purple Hearts, and South Vietnamese Army medals for valor, and the U.S. Navy named a $1.2 billion guided missile destroyer for him, on duty in the Atlantic Fleet.Sgt.

I quickly turned to the page THE RECIPIENTS, anxious to read to my grandson about a fellow Mexican American, a true American hero, a Green Beret, who, on May 2, 1968, at Loc Ninh, received over 40 wounds: seven major gunshot wounds, twenty-eight shrapnel holes, bayonet slashes on both arms, his right lung destroyed, during a daring rescue mission for a 12 man team monitoring enemy troop movements that were attacked by North Vietnamese army Battalion.Too many years later, on February 24, 1981 Master Sergeant Roy Benavidez received the Medal of Honor from President Reagan.This Medal of Honor book has little Honor excluding not only an extraordinarily brave man, but a Mexican American hero so important to myself, my family, my culture, and especially my grandson. I question the value of this book.Robert R. AvilaFormer national vice presidentNational Latino Peace Officers' AssociationRetired police officer, 31 years of service"},{"Title":"Medal of Honor: Portraits of Valor Beyond the Call of Duty","review":"Being Veteran's Day, it seemed appropriate to review a book about military heroes. Unfortunately, the word hero is being too often disparagingly used to describe a star athlete, a hot musician, or a glamorous movie star. A more befitting use is the way \\"Medal of Honor\\" tells the story of 116 American Heroes. Author Peter Collier masterfully combines 116 two-page vignettes into an amalgamation of selfless valor represented by the men who earned the United States' highest military honor, the Medal of Honor. Each portrait briefly chronicles the actions of these brave men and includes a historical and recent picture of the honoree. The gripping accounts cannot begin to express the danger these courageous men faced and their sacrifices but does outline the basis for their award.Forwards are written by President George H. W. Bush, Tom Brokaw, and Senator John McCain. Each is a famous American who advances different aspects of this book. The end of the book includes a history of the Medal of Honor, a listing of military awards, and a glossary of military terms. The inside front and back covers include inspirational ideals from each award winner. All are vital additions.The subjects in this book deserve at least a 10-star rating. They are a national treasure and as President Bush states, they \\"represent the very heart and soul of America.\\" The idea for this book is unmatched. I only wish the stories were longer and did a better job of conveying the sacrifices of our distinguished heroes.This book is for everyone. Read it to begin to understand the lengths of commitment of our Medal of Honor winners and to understand the fabric of our service members, our military, and our nation.My highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Medal of Honor: Portraits of Valor Beyond the Call of Duty","review":"Great pictures!

Each full page portrait is done with a different approach, one reading this book will be captivated by each picture of these men, these heroes. This is a collection of the last living Medal of Honor recipients, starting in 2000.

Peaceful, freedom loving people all over the world may enjoy what is offered within.Each story is amazing. As a recipient said, when a child asks \\"What is it like to have killed someone?\\" his reflection was \\"that's a real kick in the gut.\\" \\"Any human being forced to take the life of another always bears a great sadness.\\"Courage, Sacrifice, Duty, friendship, Love of neighbor-friend and foe, Loyalty, and Freedom are common themes in each story. It does not glamorize war.The book and accompanying DVD highlight stories of the Medal of Honor recipients that were still living at the time of its publication. Posthumous recipients of the award are not covered.I found it amazing that all of them represent America as a socio-economic, religious, and ethnic cross section of the population. World War II, Korea and Vietnam War veterans are covered. Each story also highlights a kind of valor/bravery/self sacrifice that was not sought by the recipient. Each one says he was not out looking for the honor but that he did what he felt he needed to do in a given perilous situation... only free men/women...driven by an idealogy of a higher good, love and freedom rather than hatred and self-destruction can make this claim.The DVD is 80 minutes long and quite touching. It highlights 11 recipients of the award in interviews.

Having been a medic in the Navy and Army Reserves, the stories told by surviving medics in this book are particularly captivating. I served in medical support for Desert Storm and wasn't in battle like these men were.In the 14 years that I served, I met only one Medal Of Honor recipient, at an award ceremony for my father on the 50th anniversary of the Korean War. He was among a group of veterans who received a medal from the South Korean government. In attendance that day was Rodolfo \\"Rudy\\" Hernandez from Colton, California, He is featured on page 104 in this book. He was left for dead on a Korean battlefield, having repelled several attacks, along with a fellow soldier in his foxhole. It took CplHernandez several years to recover from his wounds. My brother and I shook his left hand, his right hand was still fragile from his war wounds.That my friends, is sacrifice for ones' country.A member of the military does not \\"win\\" the Medal of Honor, they areawarded it, usually by the President. This book contains 116 portraits of living recipients at the time the book was assembled and published. At various military medical installations I would read the citations and marvel on what they did. The first reaction in combat is to hide or run, they don't call it the \\"fight or flight syndrome\\" for nothing.You will read of a marine who was 17 storming up the sands of Iwo Jima. Another marine, against orders, running through mine fields and grabbing up wounded marines and placing them in his helicopter. A Navy SEAL who returned for his team leader, shot and left for dead in a river basin in Viet Nam. Aviators who flew into the eye of the storm and did impossible rescues. An Army medic, Clarence Sasser, who ignored his wounds to treat others and encouraged his fellow soldiers to fight back in the Mekong Delta. The stories you read don't seem real, but they are. A sobering account of beyond the call of duty."},{"Title":"Medal of Honor: Portraits of Valor Beyond the Call of Duty","review":"i bought one of these books for my husband for christmas and he read it from cover to cover in less than 5 days. it is now in his office and he has many people ask if they can stay a little longer to read after he has finished working on their vehicles. he bought one for a friend and he loves it also."},{"Title":"Medal of Honor: Portraits of Valor Beyond the Call of Duty","review":"This book is a must for anyone whose interested in military history.

Together with the DVD, it provides powerful witness to acts of remarkable heroism. These rare individuals talk about the danger that unfolded around them and through which they emerged as heroes. They are spellbinding as they sweep us onto the battlefield with them. It is a unique opportunity to see that they are just like ourselves--unremarkable, until that moment when they knew what had to be done and then did it.

Last time I checked the President of the United States of America is required to render a Salute to a \\"Medal of Honor\\" receipient not to someone who sold over a million copies of a record! The \\"Medal of Honor\\" is the pinnacle of the morals and standards that we use to teach our children, unfortunately the Welfare System is what we teach our children is the standard today.

Great stuff !"},{"Title":"Incident at San Augustine Springs (Frontier Forts and People)","review":"This is an excellent book on the early days of the Confederate invasion of New Mexico Terrotory, well researched and well written. One can only wonder how the first reviewer concluded that this work by Wadsworth is inconsequential, since the author goes to great lengths to substantiate his work with profuse citations from Federal documents.This entire period of New Mexico history has been \\"interpreted\\", digested, argued about and mis-reported; thanks in part to many authors, most with impressive degrees and closely associated with various colleges and universities. However, impressive titles and university associations, more often than not, result in under-researched but profusely annotated volumes, based largely upon previous mutterings of yet other poorly informed historians, that were seriously factually flawed from the outset. The \\"Whiskey At Fort Fillmore\\" debate has been going on for years, rehashed in print by such notables as John P. Wilson and Jerry Thompson (the \\"authority\\" on John R. Baylor). This \\"incident\\" has apparently been traced to one - and only one - \\"report\\" which was included in a Leavenworth newspaper article and which was attibuted to some un-named soldier that passed by. This article was quickly taken up by Horace Greely and used by him in a scathing attack on Lynde. Greely was an ardent Unionist and a vocal and persistent critic of the possibility of New Mexico's admission to Statehood.Doubtless, one of Mr. Smith's great sources of information on Baylor and the Texan invasion of New Mexico Territory would have been George Wythe Baylor's \\"Into The Far, Wild Country\\", edited by Jerry Thompson. An account so biased and error laden as to be considered practically worthless as an historical document - it was , after all, written by John R. Baylor's adoring younger brother..... some 50 years later!There is not now, nor has there ever been, any shred of verifiable evidence that whiskey played a part in the surrender. Among those distinguished academics such as Wilson and Thompson we should also include Martin Hardwick Hall. Hall got most of his facts right but often did not expand upong his work enough in order to describe the larger, overall picture of the Confederate invasion and how extremely damaging it was to the native peoples of New Mexico. The readers of his books and many articles are still left with only a largely superficial understanding of the events, but do come away with an in-depth knowledge of the unit names, enlistees' names, and numbers etc. of those who were involved. For the previous reviewer to present himself as an authority on this period of New Mexico history with the credentials of having done a \\"master's degree in U. S. history\\" and of having had at one time been a research assistant for M. H. Hall, as well as having had Hall as a thesis advisor, is, to me, disingenuous and pretentious, leaving the reader with the impression that, by association with M. H. Hall, he (the reviewer) has become mysteriously endowed with a special knowledge unavailable to the rest us, the common, non-\\"Historian\\", uncredentialed rabble. He obviously has a preconceived notion that Lynde was \\"incompetent\\", an opinion also shared by Thompson. He also seems to have only skimmed through Wadsworth's book as it is obvious to anyone who actually read the book that Wadsworth indeed does discuss the \\"Whiskey\\" stories.Pre-conception is a pervasive trait among many current \\"professional\\" historians. The result of which is a seemingly endless heap of extremely biased and innacurate volumes purporting to be THE true histories. The academics, to a large part, not only produce these works but also condone, encourage and perpetuate the same poor understanding and misrepresentation of the actual and honorable work which should be at the heart of their profession - that is the documentation of ALL of the FACTS of human history WITHOUT addition, deletion, or personal interpretation.Wadsworth, in this work, reveals the circumstances by which Lynde came to be depicted as an incompetent and, possibly, a traitor , a depiction which persists to this day. Nothing of note in the history of humanity is ever as simple or as cut and dried as most historians would have us believe - a truism that apparently has not been considered by the brigade of history \\"interpreters\\". History cannot be, and must not ever be, \\"interpreted\\". History IS facts, and facts are facts; facts which happened in only one sequence, and in only one way. \\"Interpretation\\" is the domain of spin-doctors,political analysts, and the like, and is, by it's very nature biased! Politically biased and/or personal interpretation is irrelevant and unecessary, and should be condemned in the field of historical writing.What Wadsworth does is to present us with facts. The reader is left with a rounded and full account of the progression of events leading up to and surrounding the San Augustin incident. Many writers have been far too selective in their choice of just what \\"evidence\\" they use to bolster up their pre-conceptions; something of which Wadsworth is refeshingly innocent.Research is an extremely time consuming and arduous task. Incomplete research results in the faulty and partial reconstruction of events. Very often in such cases an author will \\"fill in the gaps\\" for our benefit by means of personal interpretations or - in the worst cases - assumptions which are , once again more often than not,rooted in personal bias and pre-conception. Such is not the case with \\"Incident at San Augustine Springs\\". The ENTIRE incident is examined, including those events which occured prior and subsequent to it. Wadsworth reaches no definite conclusion,displays no personal bias, and does not present the information, as so many have done,in order to confirm pre-conceived notions. In this work, Lynde is neither exonerated nor condemned. This is a much needed and well written account. Highly recommended to anyone interested in an accurate and factual account in the early Civil War and Apache War period of New Mexico's history."},{"Title":"Incident at San Augustine Springs (Frontier Forts and People)","review":"Back in the late '60s, I did a master's degree in U.S. history and my research dealt with several aspects of the Texas invasion of New Mexico under Col. John Baylor and the humiliation of federal troops at Mesilla in the summer of 1861. Naturally, I've been interested ever since in anything published on the subject of the Civil War in the southwest, so I hunted down this self-published volume, even though I finally had to go through Interlibrary Loan to get it. I'm not sure I should have bothered. Maj. Lynde was an incompetent who abandoned his post under threat from a much smaller Texan force, and who then allowed his troops to string themselves out during their flight up into the Organ Mountains -- with whiskey in their canteens instead of water, though Wadsworth doesn't seem to know about that, . . and I helped dig up the empty bottles at the fort one summer. This idiotic behavior allowed Baylor to roll them up as he caught up with the straggling column with only one shot being fired. Wadsworth seems to think most of this was the fault of Lynde's superiors and subordinates, but there's plenty of blame to go around. In any case, one need only imagine the result if the two commanders had been switched -- if Baylor had been in command at Fort Fillmore. Is there any doubt the defenders of the fort would have sent their attackers packing? Or that the federal assault on the town of Mesilla would have been successful, had Baylor been the one leading it instead of resisting it, instead of the disaster it actually was for the Union troops? But interpretations aside, my biggest gripe about this exercise in special pleading is that Wadsworth seems never to have heard of the two standard books and more than a dozen journal articles on the subject written by Martin Hardwick Hall. Admittedly, the late Dr. Hall was my thesis advisor (and I was his R.A. for awhile), but his work is still important in any discussion of Baylor, Mesilla, or the Confederate Territory of Arizona."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"I read Kane &amp; Abel and think it was perhaps the best book I have ever read.

I loved the Prodigal daughter although I do have some things I would have done differently. I for one who have call the book the Prodigal children with a focus on Richard childhood as well. One of my favorite things in the novel was that while FLorentyna was a Democrat Richard was a Repulican (The good kind not the crazy ones you have today.) I guess becuase although there is around a 10-15 year age difference between the chacters and my own parents that is how they are. (My favorite scene in this is when RIchard puts a Barry Goldwater bumpersticker on their car she rips it right off. ANother one is when RIchard after telling his wife that he did not cheat on her FLorentyna said \\"You should have slept with her\\" meaning RIchard's old girlfriend becuase that would have cemeted a business deal ) I also did not like fact that RIchard died and they brought in Edward WIncheaster as a second husband or that the book went into a future that never could come true.

It is not only an entertaining and well-written story, it is very inspiring --especially to young women. Archer neither downplays nor exacerbates the difficulties faced by women in fields that have traditionally been dominated by men, and his chronicles of Florentyna's rise through business and politics are among the best available in fiction. Archer also does a good job of portraying the years of work that go into creating a successful political career.By the time you're finished reading the book, you almost feel exhausted yourself--but the journey is worth it."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"I thought KANE AND ABEL was one of the best books I'd ever read, so I was eagerly anticipating THE PRODIGAL DAUGHTER. Although it falls a shade short of the greatness of its predecessor, this is still an outstanding novel that reveals more about the characters I had come to love in the first book.Some may argue that Jeffrey Archer cheats the reader since approximately the first 200 pages are a recap of KANE AND ABEL. However, instead of getting the story from the viewpoint of the two men, we see the events throught the eyes of Abel's daughter Florentyna and the added insight makes the second telling of the events highly worthwhile.Florentyna Rosnovski is a formidable and unforgettable character. She endears herself to readers as a young girl through her relationship with her governess Miss Tredgold and her adventures from elementary school through college. Even the expected meeting with Richard Kane takes on new dimensions as they marry despite the deep rejection by both fathers.It was after the initial marriage and career boom that I thought the book faltered slightly. Florentyna became too perfect, everything came too easily, and even the tragic events did not seem to touch her as I would have expected. However, her rise to fame and her battle to achieve her childhood ambition by becoming President of the United States is a page-turning read, one that will surely satisfy fans of KANE AND ABEL."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"This is an excellent sequel to the consummate novel, Kane and Abel. Archer once again is at his best. He remembers to interwine key details of the book with Kane and Abel, and the reader easily recalls the suspense and the pure entertainment of Kane and Abel in Prodigal Daughter. Jeffrey Archer molds Florentyna into one of the most memorable characters written. Not many authors would have dared to write a sequel to such a superb novel like Kane and Abel, but Jeffrey Archer willingly accepts the challenge. The result is The Prodigal Daughter, and it is one of the best novels ever written."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"This sequel's not as good as Kane & Abel, but still not a bad read. Jeffrey Archer is a great storyteller and he does a good job of telling the story behind Florentyna's life from childhood to her life after her father's death. The third part of the book does get very politically heavy and I found it to be a little on the boring side. The first and second parts of the book are good pageturners. I felt this novel lacked a purposeful direction and the intrigue of Kane & Abel ."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"I found this book to be very much up to Archer's standards. To me this book was every bit as captivating as his first. This is a wonderful read for almost anyone interested in history, politics, or just in search of a great book."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"Florentyna was an exceptional girl. Born of immigrant Polish parents, one of whom become a powerful and wealthy businessman, she was tutored well, learned well, and trained well. Until she threw it all away to marry the son of her father's most bitter enemy.Richard Kane had also defied his father to marry his love, and the two were cast off without a cent into the world. However, not only do they live on love, but they forge their own business empire in the process. If Kane and Abel were rivals, but successes; only to see their greatest dream dashed at the hands of the other, Richard and Florentyna show what their father's might have achieved by working together.Indeed, together they build the empire of both their father's dreams. Both of their fathers recanted their hatred at the end, and they build together. But eventually success at business bores Florentyna, and she goes into politics.Florentyna is a success in many ways in politics. Congress, then the Senate... and the White House?Indeed, I don't know if the novel makes or breaks itself with the dirty tricks played at the end. Florentyna made her biggest mistake when she didn't outright reject one offer. Character wise, I think that is the biggest weakness of the novel. Florentyna wasn't that stupid or naive. Would it have hurt to have had her cave in if the man had outright lied (and still trapped her), and her serve her term as vice-president with no illusions about him? PLus, I have to wonder if she, faced with the end of her career, wouldn't have conceeded defeat - and then dragged down certain people as well?"},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"After reading Kane and Abel I was told that this was a sort of sequel to the book and I had to read it. Once again I loved this book and the author. Its one of those books where you just want to keep reading and never stop. I highly recommend reading Kane and Abel before reading this book so that you understand the characters more completely. This book does give a shortened introduction of the characters in the beginning but it is recommended by me that you read Kane and Abel which you will enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"Jeffrey Archer's 1980 best-seller Kane & Abel introduced readers to William Kane and Abel Rosnovski, two boys from vastly different circumstances and opposite ends of the world who grew up to profoundly affect early twentieth-century America. In The Prodigal Daughter, Archer continues the story of these two men and carries it on to the next generation.Archer's storytelling technique is in some ways archaic, relying heavily on narrative prose and shunning contemporary \\"rules\\" about showing versus telling. He is able to pull it off, however, partly because most he earned his reputation in previous decades before the evolution of the modern thriller and partly because his colloquial voice and strong characters make his books a pure pleasure to read even without much action or dialog.The Prodigal Daughter is the story of Florentyna Rosnovski, daughter of hotel baron Abel Rosnovski. At the end of Kane & Abel, Florentyna fall in love with Richard Kane, the son of her father's arch-enemy, banker William Kane. The sequel begins by backing the story up twenty years and painting a picture of Florentyna's childhood. The story doesn't actually catch up to the end of the first book until about halfway through.As the story continues, Florentyna and Richard marry, against the wishes of both of their powerful fathers. They are cut off from their families' fortunes and must start life on their own. Florentyna starts a fashion shop, while Richard begins building a reputation for himself in the banking industry. By the time they reconcile with their aging fathers, the young couple have managed to become wealthy on their own merit. After their fathers are dead, Florentyna becomes chairman of the Baron Group, her father's hotel chain, and Richard ends up on the board of Lester's, his father's bank. The middle part of the book, then, focuses on their experiences in corporate life.When Florentyna decides to run for political office, their lives change yet again, and the last part of the book details her various campaigns, her time in Congress, and the nation's response to the first serious female contender for president of the United States.Through it all, Archer adds a touch of realism through ties to real-life events and public figures, placing the story within its historical context. As always, his primary strength is his characters, and he puts them in situations that make them highly sympathetic and believable. Readers who have enjoyed Archer's other books--particularly those who liked Kane & Abel--will appreciate this continuation of a story they may have resonated with. Readers who are more accustomed to contemporary political and corporate thrillers, however, may find it difficult to engage with Archer's style."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"This is an excellent sequel to the novel, Kane and Abel. Archer once again is at his best. He remembers to intertwine key details of the book with Kane and Abel, and the reader easily recalls the suspense and the pure entertainment of Kane and Abel in Prodigal Daughter.

The result is The Prodigal Daughter. While it lacks some of the intensity of K&A, it is well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"This is a soap opera. If you enjoy reading about romanticized daily life you will no doubt find this book interesting.I was expecting an action novel. It isn't here. I waded through about half the book and then gave up.

Kane & Abel was very nice, but this second installment of the series was several notches below. Almost 50% of the book is a recap of the first book (though things are narrated from Florentyna's views, but a rehash nonetheless). The second half of the book is too procedural, in the sense that anyone not knowing the American election system will be absolutely lost and bored. The second half is a little too descriptive of the electoral processes, and even otherwise there is really nothing much to the plot.

It was kind of like re-watching a movie you had already seen. I found myself wanting to skip pages till I got to a part where I did not already know what was going to happen.

This is one of his early stories and a good one. In part it is a sequel to his wordwide bestseller Kane and Abel but it is mainly about the lives of the children of Abel Rosnovski and William Kane.At birth Abel gives his daughter, Florentyna, a Teddy Bear named \\"President\\" after US President Theodore Roosevelt, whose nickname was \\"Teddy\\". Florentyna's first word is not \\"Daddy\\" or \\"Mummy\\" but \\"Prusident\\" - a sign of things to come. At age 11 she makes a pact with her father for him to finance her Presidential campaign if she wins the first major primary for the Democratic Party.Abel Rosnovski gives Florentyna every support in her education, including employing a wonderful English Governess who guides her through her early days to give her the strength, personality and skills to become a very successful person both commercially and politically.The bad blood between Abel Rosnovski and the powerful banker William Kane continues and escalates when Kane's son Richard meets Florentyna.The latter part of the book covers Florentyna's commercial successes and eventual entry into US politics. Archer displays a detailed knowledge of the US political system. While it is an older book (1982) it is not dated and much of the political action is a reminder of more recent US political events.As well as being a best selling author, Archer lived an eventful life as a UK Parliamentarian and Conservative Party Chairman and was made a life peer. His career was suspended when he was convicted and imprisoned for perjury. Despite all of these traumas Archer has never lost his great story telling skills.His latest book - Sins of the Father in the Clifton Chronicles series - still has his magic touch and the ending will keep you in suspense again until he has written the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"Having read almost every book that Jeffrey Archer has written and I missed this one.

Indeed, it is a slightly modified rehash of a section in Kane and Abel. Fortunately, I read Kane and Abel some time ago and I forgot some of it. Not all of it, so I am again skipping many pages.Unfortunately, I was not aware of this prior to purchasing the book. I am trying to warn people who read Kane an Abel recently - the repetition of lot of the material may annoy them.Still, Jeffrey Archer is a REAL writer unlike some guys whose books sell here for $0.99 and are not worth even that. Maybe I'll enjoy the second two thirds of the Prodigal Daughter - it deals with stuff after 1967, I presume. Kane and Abel goes only through 1967.I finished the book and added one star. I was considering to comment on the rather preposterous politics of Archer's writing but it is irrelevant. The book is a 100% fiction and quite well written to please almost everyone.It may become 'literature' in some 20 years. Maybe the definition of literature is that it has to whitstand the 'test of time'. I have no idea whether this book will be read even five years from now. The trouble with writing about future that quickly becomes the past is formidable."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"This is my second Jeffrey Archer novel, the other being First among equals. There's no doubt about it, Archer can write.The Prodigal Daughter centers around Florentyna Rosnovski, the daughter of Abel Rosnovski. There is background of her father and his migration from Poland to America and his subsequent building of the Hotel empire, the Baron Group. Archer paints a portrait of a self-made man who draws on his Eastern European discipline and struggle to build his empire.Though wanting a son, Abel gives Florentyna everything she needs to become successful including an education and resources. From an early age, it's clear, Florentyna will go on to greatness.Lurking in the background is a long running feud between Abel and the Kane family. A feud with a twist. Florentyna, not by design, ends up falling in love, and marrying Richard Kane, the son of the the man her father is feuding with.This sets the stage for a great novel that you can immerse yourself in.I like Archer's style. He moves us along at a good pace and the number of characters, twists and turns, don't overwhelm the reader but more colors in a great story.Highly recommended for novel lovers."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"After reading Cane & Able this book just wasn't as good. There was so much repeating what happened in the first book that I knew just what was going to happen so eventually gave up and went on to read something else."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"After reading and loving \\"Kane & Abel\\" it was a natural to continue the great story with this sequel. I was not disappointed. Now there is a another sequel \\"Shall We Tell The President\\" which I have read and enjoyed immensely."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"The life of Florentyna Rosenofski is well read out in the sequel to Kane &amp; Able.Life is good for this young heiress, privilage, a nanny, loving mother, college etc..., untill she is propositioned by an attractive man at Bloomingdales, where she works behind the counter, who keeps asking for gloves.Her relationship with her loving but overbearing father turns upside down when she reveals to him that her lover is Richard Kane, son of his most hated enemy.Suddenly out in the real world with the love of close college friends and mother, &quot;Jessie&quot; and Richard strike out on their own.Florentyna soon finds out her real calling is politics and she soon starts off down the road that will see her obtain the highest office in the land, albeit with tragedy and a few revelations along the way."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"This book is a little disappointing as a sequel to the excellent Kane and Abel. The plot of Prodigal Daughter was too predictable, the dialogues - especially the ones between the husband-and-wife - were so script-like that it spoiled the beautiful decription of Florentyna and Richard Kane in the earlier book."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"This book was a really interesting one. It is pretty much about the daughter of Abel and how she grew up. The first half of the book was pretty much Kane and Abel from his daughters eyes. But the second half gotten into her politcal life after her father died. If you enjoyed the first one it is a must that you continue onto the second book in the series."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"I enjoyed the book itself, but the prologue is one of the best pieces of writing I've ever encountered. Loved the punchline! If you want to read a satisfying and plausible account of how Florentyna becomes the first woman President, you'll enjoy this book, but be sure to read the prologue!"},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"This follow up and sequel to Kane and Abel shifts focus from the indomitable male characters of Kane and Abel to a witty female protaganists who captures our attention as she scales the heights to become the first woman president of the United States. Though equally engaging, the impact is not as lasting as that of Kane and Abel. A worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"Kane &amp; Abel was a 5 star book. I read The Prodigal Daughter in the hopes that it would come close to Kane &amp; Abel. For me the first about 200 hundred pages were good because it tied up some things from the first book. The rest of the book was very well written but just plain boring when it became all political. Jeffrey Archer tells a story like few others. So if you read the first book and like political issues this would be a 5 star book for you."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"Life is too short to read this ongoing , never ending rubbish. My problems is i actually finished the book."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"I didn't realize this book was a sequel to one I had read 20 years ago. It could have been better written."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"The Prodigal Daughter is one of the best books I've ever read.Jeffrey Archer included everything in this novel, suspense, romance, humor, despair.From now on every book i read will be compared to this on and i doubt any will come even close!"},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"I loved it."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"After reading &quot;Not a penny more, not a penny less&quot;, I was expecting a witty and sharp piece of work. Not so this time. Girl meets world, girls wants it, girl overcomes all kinds of obstacles, girl gets world. Yawn. &quot;Not a penny more...&quot; is a FANTASTIC book, if you've never read Archer before, start with that one. And pass on &quot;The Prodigal Daughter&quot;."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"This book caught my eye with it's title--having a different spelling of Kane than the Biblical spelling. I read the back cover, and it looked interesting. Once I started reading, I was spellbound--I couldn't put it down. It's the story of two men--one born rich, the other poor, in two different countries, whose lives later become intertwined. This author is a master at transporting the reader into the human feelings of his characters. When I finished this book, I immediately ordered five more of Archer's books, just because he writes so well."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"An ambitious woman who sacrifices her family to try to become President.

Family comes before ANY job."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"As an avid reader of politics I must disagree with popular belief, and say that this book thoroughly disappointed me. Personally, I expect a lot more of Archer and this juvenile, embarrassing excuse of good writing completely stuns me. I have one word for him - edit!"},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"This book picks up where Kane and Abel left off. It is the story of the daughter, Florentyna. She runs the hotel empire. Entertaining, fast paced, a good read."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"Before reaching the end of this novel, it had already moved into the position of being one of my favorite books of all time. It is engaging from the first page until the final sentence. I could not put it down. This is the type of book that makes you want to read everything else the author has written, because if any of his other books even come close to this they will be amazing. For anyone looking to read this I would definitely recommend reading Kane and Abel beforehand. The two novels complement each other very well, and you cannot have the complete story if you only read one."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"Well, first of all I have to tell you that I don't have anything against Jeffrey Archer, I read from him the eleventh commandment (an excellent book) I didn't read Kane & Abel but I saw the picture, I didn't like that picture because I am not agree to send away your son because you hate his father in law, of course there is a Spanish saying \\"Never say you will never drink of this water\\", so I hope not to do what Mr. Kane did in that book, other interesting book is The Fourth Estate, but is the same story of Kane & Abel but instead of an hotel owner and a bank owner they are two newspaper owners, but they don't send away their family because of their fight.Now, this book, half of it is the story of Kane & Abel, here I have a question: Mr. Archer doesn't have another stories to write that he has to write the same story in three books?The last part of The Prodigal Daughter, when her father and father in law, both died, is really good, how Richard and Jessie (Florentyna) help each other to have their own goals, and other thinks like that, that you can learn how to be a good husband or wife.This book has his own message, but is a waste of time reading the first part of the book if you know the story of Kane & Abel."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"The only reason I have rated this book four stars instead of five is that the second half of the book gets really extensively into politics, to the point where it bored me. If you enjoy politics you will certainly rate this book five stars. It follows the life of Abel Rosnofski's daughter from her birth until the epitome of her success, in her 60's. I don't want to give away the ending, but will say that the ending was EXTREMELY satisfying, in spite of my having gotten a bit bogged down in the politics."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"This books makes an excellent sequel to Kane and Abel but lacks some of the intensity and development that the former has."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"The Prodigal Daughter is the second book in the Kane and Abel trilogy. It goes back in time to the childhoods and lives of the daughter of Abel Rosnovski, Florentyna, and the son of William Kane, Richard. She is an intelligent young lady with high ambitions from the start. The Prodigal Daughter has a lot of politics involved in it, with Florentyna trying to become the president of the United States. Of course, her being a woman and extremely rich will make her face difficulties, but she fights against all odds.I like the book also because its protagonist is a woman. She was gifted with beauty and spirit but above all with an indomitable will. There's a lot of politics involved in this book but nonetheless a terrific book with a twist in the end. The rest of the story is filled with betrayals, political intrigues and suspense, some tragic incidents like Richard's death, follows the pursuit of Florentyna to reach the highest office of the country.Most people are of the opinion that this book was better than Kane and Abel but I would anytime choose the latter over this book. Even though I put the heavily detailed politics in the book as a minus point, it is that very portion which gives life to the book. I recommend this book to all those who have already read Kane and Abel or even otherwise. This book rightly proves that Mr. Archer is a great storyteller."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"I loved this book. I first read Kane and Abel and throughly enjoyed it. As a die hard political junkie, I found this book even more delightful. Some have complained that Archer found it necessary to at times copy straight out of Kane and Abel. Of course, he had to. What was he to do - invent new dialogue? I found it interesting that he showed us the other side of the story in the Prodigial Daughter, especially the scenes where Richard and Florentyna must confront their fathers with the news of their love. In Kane and Abel, we saw it from Florentyna and Abel's points of view. In Prodigal Daughter, we saw it from Richard and William's points of view. Prodigal Daughter is a throughly captivating book with a surprise ending."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"Is America ready for a female president? This sequel to the highly successful \\"Kane and Abel\\" explores that possibility as it follows the life of the only daughter of famous hotelier Abel Rosnovski. Florentyna Rosnovski, born into wealth and groomed to one day overtake a hotel empire, is a second generation American immigrant who has a falling out with her father after falling in love with the son of his fiercest enemy. Forced to make a fresh start on the West Coast, Florentyna combines her extreme intelligence and love of women's fashion to open her own chain of high class clothing boutiques. Upon Abel's death, she inherits a slew of hotels second-to-none in every corner of the globe and teams with husband Richard to ensure their continued success. Always possessing a vested interest in politics, it is only at the urging of a childhood friend that she enters into the spotlight as a public servant. Everything else, as they say, is American history. The book is insightful and entertaining but lacks the creativity and depth of its predecessor, with which it was sure to draw comparison. In fact, any \\"Kane and Abel\\" fan will be sorely disappointed and feel cheated during \\"Daughter\\", as Archer feels it necessary to repeat, in exact words, page after page, whole episodes and storylines previously penned in his original epic. It is only after Florentyna reaches adulthood and pushes the past behind that readers will become immersed in her struggle to be successful in both business and politics."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"I had just finished Kane & Abel and thought the continuing story line of this family would be great. I have gotten through 70% of the book and I'm bored solid and there's not one character in the book that I can say I even like (or don't like). They're all dull. I've read all of Nelson DeMille and David Baldacci and I thought I would try a new author. My search continues."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"I kept waiting for something exciting to happen. By the time I realized I had made a mistake starting this book I had so much time invested that I was determined to finish it. A very long book with little to keep you interested and every predicament had a predictable outcome."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"A riveting story with a very unusual theme. I totally enjoyed it on my Kindle. It illustrates what can happen in the politics of the United States."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"Even though it was written several years ago, it is still a pertinent today and an enjoyable read. One of Jeffrey Archers' best."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"I never expected that I would ever write a review for a book, but I enjoyed Prodigal Daughter so much I felt the need. Rather than deal in cliches, I would simply say that I recommend this book to 90% of the reading public. The other 10% well you can't please everybody. Thank you Jeffery Archer!"},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"Like always, this Jeffery Archer book held my total interest from the time I started it until the last page. If you're an Archer fan, this book is another one to add to your \\"read list\\". If you haven't read him before, its a good place to start."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"\\"The Prodigal Daughter\\" focuses on the life of Florentyna Rosnovski Kane, the daughter of a Polish immigrant who lived the American dream. The first half of this book is a retelling of events from \\"Kane and Abel\\". The reader gains a few new insights seeing things through Florentyna's eyes, but these were rare because so many passages were completely lifted from the original book and put into this sequel.One element that seemed to be missing in this book compared to \\"Kane and Abel\\" was the tension and plot twists that came about from the bitter feud between the Kane and Rosnovski patriarchs. These two strong wills really made the first book shine, whereas the summary retelling in this book was a bit disappointing.The latter half of the book deals with Florentyna's life in politics. I found this to be rather dry at times, and somewhat predictable as to where Florentyna would eventually end up. If I had read \\"The Prodigal Daughter\\" as a stand-alone book, my review would likely have been higher, but it seemed cheap and lazy to reuse so much material from the first book."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"I was happy to read this book because it was so hard to come to the end of its predecessor, Kane and Abel. The latter was a better book and in Daughter there seemed to be a lot of formulaic replays in presenting the characters and what they'll do next. When it was written, the idea of a female president thrilled the American imagination as we had had a real contender for that happening in our country. Now, with a black man in the White House and women's lib a bit of a banality (with Rupert Murdoch, the inspiration for a character in another Archer novel, The Fourth Estate, rapidly feminizing the Wall Street Journal as we speak) this story's innovative edge has been lost. Still, as with all Jeffery Archer's tales, it offers an entertaining escape by a writer who knows how to put together a decent read."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"Once again Jeffrey Archer has put out a great read. I love his books and always look forward to the next."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"Oddly, I read this on my kindle and now it is no longer available. :(I loved the first in this seriesKane and Abeland enjoyed \\"the rest of the story\\".

About the first 200 pages are a recap of \\"Kane and Abel\\" and is about the earlier life of Florentyna--not covered in the first of the series. It gets a bit too political as you get into the story, and it reveals the background maneuvers politicians make to get ahead, leaving Florentyna trying to be one step ahead. It's a \\"must\\" to read \\"Kane and Abel\\" first. I did not bother to read the third book in the series. About Florentyna: She's a strong woman with determination, not unlike her father and father-in-law. Enjoyed the ending."},{"Title":"The Prodigal Daughter","review":"If you ever want to know about politics on a level that you don't read in the headlines, this is an excellent book to read.Jeffrey Archer has captured so many details and such strong character development, that it is easy for you to believe in this storyAs for the title, though, I still wonder why this is titled &quot;The Prodigal Daughter,&quot; since prodigal means wastefully extravagant. Although the protagonist was born into wealth, and married someone who became a banker, her character was actually frugal.This is one of those books that you can't turn the page fast enough, because even if you read it years ago, you become so caught up in the drama."},{"Title":"The Healing Experience: Remarkable Cases from a Professional Healer","review":"Malcolm Southwood has saved my life.

That's not to say that the comic is without merit, but the cons outweigh the pros. The story is well composed, and the action is faced paced and fun, but eventually the whole thing runs out of steam and starts repeating itself. Roger Robinson tries hard to encapsulate the reader by reassuring them that the end will be spectacular, but it dosn't quite match the high expectations I had for this, in what was supposed to be more energetic.

Included are; photographs of the terrain from during and just after the war, various maps of the hill and surrounding area showing the disposition of troops during each of the major engagements and reproductions of paintings of various actions and individuals related to the Hill. One exceptionally interesting map shows the positions of all the allied tunnels in the area and the dates when various mines were exploded.I purchased this book in an attempt to find out what happened to a relative of mine who was in the 2nd Battalion, Duke of Wellington Regiment and died on Hill 60 on May 5th 1915. The book describes exactly what happened to the battalion on that day and it is fairly clear what happened to my relative.Much of the information in the book has been taken from various regimental histories and private memoirs. This leads to a very choppy style. The information about the one-day I was interested in is spread throughout the book. Furthermore it is inconsistent.This is my one criticism of the book I would like to have heard more from the author with regard to the inconsistencies between the various accounts. Some guidance on how to interpret these accounts would have been on great use."},{"Title":"Hill 60: Ypres (Battleground Europe)","review":"This Battleground Europe volume appealed to me because I have been fascinated by World War One battles, in particular the conflict in the Ypres salient, and also the tunneling and mining beneath the enemy lines. Hill 60 was an artificial prominence created from the spoil of a nearby railway line. It was bitterly contested and greatly prized high ground. I found particularly interesting chapter 3 dedicated to the tunneling/mining and the battle of Messines and chapter 4 dedicated to the German experience at Hill 60. SeeMessines Ridge: Ypres (Battleground Europe)for more details on that campaign and for tunneling/mining operationsUNDERGROUND WARFARE 1914-1918by Simon Jones.

Although, as Luc Sante states in his introduction, Riis' sole purpose for writing this book is to \\"call attention to the horrendous living conditions of the poor in New York City and insist on reform\\" (p ix), Riis also presents another underlying theme by unequivocally proving that the more people isolate themselves from the rest of the world, the better chance there is for gross victimization of those less fortunate: simplistically speaking, the rich get richer; the poor get poorer; the wider the gap grows in between (dispersion of our so-called middle class.)Riis' talent lies in his use of poetically descriptive language, saturated with metaphor and alliteration, alongside contrasting factual accounts of harsh reality. The reader is mesmerized by the rhythmic sound of lines such as \\"Down near the Battery the West Side emerald would be soiled by a dirty stain, spreading rapidly like a splash of ink on a sheet of blotting paper\\" (p 25), but then shocked by the stark conditions of tenement life as given in the form of personal stories, photographs, legislation, statistics, and blueprints. Riis writes about the windowless, airless rooms and the unbelievably filthy crowded living conditions. He recounts stories of bitter violence toward children and between the races, as well as degradation and oppression among women, the old, and the infirm. The reader is sickened with wretched stories of infanticide and mortality rates among the children.Riis unapologetically interjects his novel with stereotypical remarks and his own bigoted opinions of the people inhabiting the various ethnically divided \\"wards.\\" Some of his include those such as \\"between the dull gray of the Jew, his favorite color, and the Italian red, would be seen squeezed in on the map a sharp streak of yellow, marking the narrow boundaries of Chinatown\\" (p 24), and \\"poverty, abuse, and injustice alike the negro accepts with imperturbable cheerfulness...He loves fine clothes and good living a good deal more than he does a bank account\\" (p 117).Through the obviously prejudicial film that covers Riis' novel from beginning to end, the reader is able to perceive a sense of his true passion of wanting to make a positive difference in society. His previous stereotypical remarks about African Americans are somewhat softened when he later comments on the injustice towards them:\\"...when the account is made up between the races, it shall be claimed that he falls short of the result to be expected from twenty-five years of freedom, it may be well to turn to the other side of the ledger and see how much of the blame is borne by the prejudice and greed that have kept him from rising under a burden of responsibility to which he could hardly be equal\\" (p 119).Riis is an example of a pioneer whose work, sacrifice, and commitment have shaped our country and our world. By educating the public through his journalistic indictments, he provided the catalyst for the ensuing slow process of reform. What places Riis on a higher level than others who have written expos&eacute;s is the fact that he not only provided what he thought to be the main causes for the deplorable situation of tenement life, but also provided an outline of a well thought out plan for improvement that included detailed legislation, floor plans for remodeling, and sound economical postulations. Luc Sante states that Riis does not \\"inquire very deeply into the causes of the conditions he describes\\" (p xi), but one can logically infer very plainly many individual causes and effects that ultimately affect the whole, such as greed, gross lack of education of a whole segment of society, a government and society who chose not to care (or may have felt it did not have the time or resource to care,) growth of nation that was infinitely more vast than expected, depression, oppression, and inertia (on both ends of the class spectrum.)Riis' book is not only a ghost from the past, but also a ghost from the present that haunts our country and our world today. One can still see economically imbalanced conditions that contribute to the growing lower class. Insightful remarks made over one hundred years ago make one disgusted to realize that seemingly little has been learned:\\"Nothing is now better understood than that the rescue of the children is the key to the problem of city poverty, as presented for our solution to-day; that a character may be formed where to reform it would be a hopeless task\\" (p 139).This book should be read for the beauty of the prose, the horror of the content, and the insight to be gained from both. Riis succeeds in showing the reader that our world is a unit existing of one: indeed one world. Riis presents an inarguably complete and comprehensive exposition of \\"how the other half lives.\\""},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York (American century series, S-12)","review":"How the Other Half Lives, by Jacob Riis, with Introduction by Luc Sante, is a book that paints a picture of tenement neighborhoods in New York City in 1890. Riis, himself an immigrant, made his living as a journalist. It is his gift of words that brings the slums to life, and transports the reader to the very spot that he describes. Riis was the first to include photographs to vividly capture what his words portray. His writing and photographs were forerunners to investigative reporting and documentaries. Sante referred to Riis' agenda as being restricted to the mundane because he wanted immediate achievable results that would better the lives of the other half. Although his plans were simple; proper housing, sanitary conditions, parks, and schools; they were considered revolutionary. When he left the newspaper business in 1901 he became a lecturer speaking on this topic of reform that was so dear to his heart. He made headway and convinced influential people such as Theodore Roosevelt to join his cause.I think Riis was extremely successful in his mission to make people aware of the conditions in the tenements. Since this book was reprinted in 1997 and the introduction was added at that time, I think it would have increased the value of the book to include a section that briefly described the current condition of the tenements in today's light, and review, with a timeline, the reforms achieved since 1890. It would be interesting because Sante says \\"It [the book] haunts us because so much of it remains true\\" (p.xiii). This book created reforms, but if after 116 years, much of it is still true, we must be missing something. Then again, perhaps not, since Riis says the poor will always be with us, and we can never get rid of either the pauper or the tenement (p.xi).Riis was a firm believer that education alone could make \\"the other half's\\" lives better, but he also knew their need to work long hours to have a roof over their head and food to eat made the chance of education a far flung dream (pp.95, 105, 111, 136). Without the ability to speak English they are unable to change careers. Another solution he had was to focus on the children as a way to reduce city poverty (p.139). Riis preached that besides charitable donations there needed to be people willing to step into action (pp.145, 213).I think the book was well written and is very descriptive. At times I thought his words tended to be racial, blunt, and opinionated, but that was his true style, even in his journalistic works (p.xvi). Even though I didn't like to read the racist words, I believe he accurately presented the views of the slums. Just as Walter Isaacson fills his readers with awe at the accomplishments of Ben Franklin in his book Ben Franklin, An American Life, Riis fills us with an ache for the immigrants coming to America to make a better life for themselves and finding it hard to do. I think anyone interested in history or the life of an immigrant would find this an informative book. It isn't one I would find on an educational reading list in terms of contributions to education, but it does give insight into living conditions in the late nineteenth century and gives a plug for a connection between education (or lack of) and living conditions within the largest city in America."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York (American century series, S-12)","review":"Like books by Steinbeck, How the other half lives is a eye opening expose of life for the have-nots in the late 19th century.

RiisThis book is a \\"classic\\", most people have heard about it but few have read it. [The word \\"tenement\\" is a legal term for property holdings, usually housing that is not owner-occupied.] Riis was a newspaper reporter, this book was first published in 1890 to document housing in New York city. Riis came from Denmark at age 21. Arriving in NY he first worked as a carpenter, later he became a police reporter for newspapers. He walked down Mulberry Street in the early mornings. Slum housing was the result of \\"public neglect and private greed\\". [The big landowners of New York controlled politics since the 18th century.] Riis believed that education was most important for new immigrants. This book lacks the photographs that illustrated the original book. Riis' \`Introduction' says slum housing causes criminals. They are also a source of epidemics. Was this distress caused by drunkenness? The slums generated a 40% yearly return on the investment!The rapid expansion of NY after the War of 1812 saw the rise of rear houses, tenant-houses built to house the maximum number of people in the smallest area (Chapter 1). The threat of cholera led to a \\"Tenement-House Act\\" in 1867 (Chapter 2). Rooms had to have windows for light and air. Most tenement dwellers were immigrants (Chapter 3). Chapter 4 describes \\"The Down-Town Back Alleys\\" where large houses were subdivided into tiny rooms. Riis describes the living conditions. Chapter 5 tells about the Italians in New York. Chapter 6 tells about \\"The Bend\\" of Mulberry Street near the Five Points, the heart of the slum district. These vile properties are owned by \\"an honored family\\". Chapter 7 tells of a police raid on stale-beer dives (unpasteurized beer). Chapter 8 describes the cheap lodging-houses \\"nurseries of crime\\". Riis describes Chinatown in Chapter 9. Some houses are opium dens with \\"white slaves\\". The Chinaman is \\"as clean as a cat\\".Chapter 10 describes the Hebrew quarter, the most densely populated neighborhood. Most of the ready-made clothes sold in the big stores are sewn here. Chapter 11 tells of the \\"sweaters\\", the middleman or subcontractor, who hires people in the tenements for unregulated labor. They work hard and save to send for their families. Chapter 12 describes the Bohemian cigar-makers who live in tenements owned by their employers. Chapter 13 discusses the \\"Color Line\\", the segregated areas where Negroes are allowed to live at higher prices. Tenement houses do not have a locked front door (Chapter 14). A respectable tenement neighborhood has few saloons. Flowers improve tenements, so too small parks. The heat of July and August create hardship and death for children. Newer buildings with proper sanitation had lower mortality rates. Death from starvation was common. Poverty created madness. Chapter 15 describes \\"The Problem of the Children\\" and what needs to be done to save them.The abandoned children put in the Foundling Asylum do not last long (Chapter 16). The Sisters of Charity have a good record. Worst of all are the \\"baby farms\\". Chapter 17 tells of the \\"Street Arabs\\", homeless boys who live on the street due to poverty at home. The Children's Aid Society provide good housing and character. Trade schools educate the older boys. There are about ten saloons to every church (Chapter 18). Gangs are endemic to New York (Chapter 19). They can terrorize a neighborhood. People walking the street could be robbed, such as a stranger asking for directions. Their \\"social clubs\\" often use blackmail. Chapter 20 tells of the oppression experienced by working girls in NY from low wages. Chapter 21 is about \\"Pauperism\\", families and individuals who applied for relief. Riis suggested setting up a labor bureau to match workers to jobs. Chapter 22 tells about the \\"Wrecks\\" in the workhouse, the almshouse (some are old people abandoned by their children), and the lunatic asylum. The worst tenements do not look bad; they are not old enough (Chapter 23). Chapter 24 tells what has been done to solve tenement-house problems. Chapter 25 lists what can be done with modern tenement-houses. Riis suggested tax rebates or licensing to regulate tenements."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York (American century series, S-12)","review":"The overall presentation of the book is fine.

You can almost smell the stench and see the depravity of life in the black and white photographs. Even with light, there is darkness in those photographs. The residents are trying to have a better life in their new country but they soon realized how merciless and unforgiving life can be in a foreign land.While Riis's writings have some obvious prejudice and stereotypes, it is consistent to the times of the 1890s. Despite his own prejudices, he is obviously aware of the grim situation in the tenements.

The evidence that supports that conclusion is embedded in his book, now a classic of muck-raking and a key player in the history of social reform in America. The fascinating thing was the reformers were fought tooth and nail not only by the slum landlords but by the poor themselves. That is just one of many items that make this story compelling reading, especially in view of the official facts and figures displayed and the pictures that go with those facts and figures. Wow! 27 people living in a room with two beds. 28,000 babies abandoned to the Sisters of Charity crib in one year. Massive deaths of children from, of all things, measles. The most common diagnosis made by the Summer Doctors (a corps of physicians from the New York City Department of Health) was \\"improper nourishment\\", none other than our malnutrition, but translated to that place and time meaning starvation. And yet milk was 2 cents a quart, a meal of soup, meat stew, bread, vegetables, and a stein of beer cost 13 cents. Add a cigar and another beer and it's 15 cents. Hence, the poor could have survived on minimal amounts of money, which, unfortunately, they did not have. The past is a different country said LP Hartley. He was right. They did things differently there. A word of caution: Riis in his zeal does protest too much. Some of the pictures are doctored to look worse than the reality. Many pictures are posed and probably paid for. Look at the one on the cover. The boy on the left is awake and smirking. The ash on his right shoulder has been sprinkled there for effect. The boy in the middle is not sleeping either as it is impossible to sleep with your head balanced on your fist like that. Why would he do that anyway when he could rest his head normally like the rest of us? He is posed and in that position so that Riis can get all three boys in the picture. Another example of hyperbole: On page 54 we are told that the child's temperature is 115 F. That is medically impossible as human enzymes and cellular energy systems stop working at 110. By the time a temperature reaches 110, the patient is dead, has to be dead. 115 is possible if and only if they are on fire or heated by a source outside their body and then they still would be dead. As has been pointed out many times, Riis displays remarkable personal and cultural prejudices. His main fault is over generalization based on the assumption that every Jew is alike, every Irishman the same. Not every Italian is a gambler. Nor is every Irishman a drunk. Some Chinese do not smoke opium and at least some Jews are not misers. Because a person is not Christian doesn't automatically make them immoral as Riis would have us believe. Yes, the author has many faults. But most of them in this historical context are trivial. The results of his work are not trivial and speak for themselves: massive reform of wages, hours of work, living conditions, sanitation, social and personal hygiene, Public Health, and most importantly, public supervision of private greed and public modification of private greed by law."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York (American century series, S-12)","review":"Although this book, How the Other Half Lives, was originally published in 1890 the images created still haunt the reader today because we sense that much has not changed in the last one hundred years.The author, Jacob Riis was born in 1849 in Denmark, the third of fifteen children. His family was poor, but respectable. (Riis, xiv) For economic reasons, Riis decided to emigrate to the United States. Quickly running out of money, he was forced to take odd jobs, sleep in doorways and accept handouts for food. Eventually finding employment as a journalist, Riis developed his own style of writing. He violated traditional newspaper style by \\"inserting editorial commentary into his stories.\\" (Riis, xvi) This style became known as muckraking.In his writings, Riis focused on issues of housing reform. He found that merely describing the conditions with words was not convincing enough, so he began to use photography. In the Introduction to the book, Luc Sante reports that Riis' \\"flash awoke sleepers and momentarily blinded drinkers and workers and nursing mothers, pinning them in their surroundings and shocking them into submission to the lens.\\" (Riis, xvii)As an immigrant, Riis knew first hand what it was like to live in poverty. When he was younger, out of money and unable to find steady employment, he often spent the night in police station lodging houses to escape from the cold. This book explores the living conditions of the American immigrant in the tenements of New York City. Riis' writing is full of the sights and sounds of the forgotten or ignored people living in the Lower East Side.This writing is unique in that it takes you directly into the tenements. The reader's skin crawls from the thought of the filth, the nose wrinkles from the imagined smells and the feeling of darkness hangs like a cloud from the first page until the last. Rather than providing us with a list of impersonal statistics, Riis gives us a glimpse into the lives of human beings. The reader experiences the sights and sounds of even the most austere little room shared by what seems like multitudes of people. The pictures verify the human condition that Riis describes.Riis writes as if he were talking to the reader as they were walking down the streets and alleys of the tenements. \\"Take a look into this Roosevelt Street alley; just about one step wide, with a five-story house on one side that gets its air and light - God help us for pitiful mockery! - from this slit between the walls,\\" he writes. (Riis, 35)Throughout the book Riis mentions the lack of sunlight, lack of clean air and filth that are part of the everyday lives of those living in the tenements. But, \\"when the sun shines the entire population seeks the street, carrying on its household work, its bargaining, its lovemaking on street or sidewalk, or idling there when it has nothing better to do.\\" (Riis, 47) Unfortunately these rays of sunshine are not often found in Riis' description of life in the tenements.Riis blames the tenement problem on both the rich and the poor. He writes \\"...the vilest and worst tenement property to be found anywhere, stood associated...with the name of an honored family, one of the \`oldest and best', rich in possessions and in influence.\\" (Riis, 53) The rich oppressed the immigrants through high rents, preventing them from climbing the social ladder.But Riis also blames the poor for their plight. He was troubled by the fact that many did not make an effort to learn English and other skills necessary in America. Riis attempts to hold these immigrants to the standards he held for himself. He believed that it was important for immigrants to engage in business and to assimilate into their new surroundings. Riis did not appreciate immigrants who insisted on holding onto their traditional language and culture.Riis walks the reader through the different sections of the tenement, describing the various ethnic groups with his unique editorial commentary: the Italians, Chinese, Jews, Bohemians, Blacks and Arabs. The descriptions are not what the reader would consider politically correct in this day and age. According to Riis he is being candid and reporting what he observes, but these comments are no longer acceptable, regardless of the intent.Riis also describes the plight of children. According to him, many of the children have been put out on the streets by their families who are no longer able to support them. Riis takes the readers into the ten-cent lodging houses where the children often sleep and are introduced to a life of crime, prostitution and drugs as they fall victim to those ready to take advantage of their lack of funds and family support.This book was written and published to garner public support. It accomplished the goal. According to Luc Sante, in his introduction, Riis' book had an immediate impact and reform was undertaken to improve the conditions of the poor in New York City. How the Other Half Lives was instrumental in shining the light on the tenements so that the upper and middle class could no longer ignore the plight of the poor and pretend they did not exist. The book also brought to light the effects the tenement and sweatshop owners were having on these oppressed people.As Riis takes the reader on this journey, which covers a period of time, he tells the readers of the changes that are being made. He mentions the parks that have been built, buildings that have been torn down and replaced by new buildings that have better designs, and the enactment of child-labor laws. Specifically, during the time of Riis' writing the airshaft was introduced into the design of the tenement. This allowed for air to circulate in the buildings, lowering the spread of disease. Through this book the reader actually senses the evolution of the tenement.One can't help but wonder that if Riis were walking the streets of New York City or another major city in America today, if he wouldn't be just as discouraged with what he would still find to write about and photograph. Unfortunately even the sweatshop is still a deplorable condition for immigrants one hundred years later. Fortunately, we still have journalists who are concerned enough to shed light on these conditions and continue to bring the plight of the poor and homeless to the attention of the middle and upper class, lest they be forgotten again."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York (American century series, S-12)","review":"In How the Other Half Lives (originally published in 1890), Jacob Riis gives an astounding account of 19th century life in the tenements of New York City, where poverty, filth, disease, alcoholism, theft, and darkness prevail. Through his writing, statistics, and photography, Riis draws attention to unthinkable living conditions ignored too long by those better off than the tenants occupying New York's slums.In Luc Sante's introduction to the book, he summarizes Riis' view as, \\"the poor were victims rather than makers of their fate\\" (Riis, 1997). How this rings true as one reads through the pages. Riis gives the reader a better understanding of why generations of tenement occupants are trapped in a rut of constant strife and struggle, without education or means to rise above. The dense immigrant population of New York's tenements led to a very limited and low-paying job market, typically that of sweatshop labor. With the problems of the tenements came saloons, gangs, thieves, orphaned babies and other societal issues. The conditions of the tenements expanded the divide between New York's classes of citizens.Many of New York City's poor worked from dusk till midnight daily, only to earn starving wages which barely allowed them to feed and clothe their families or pay overpriced rent to wealthy landlords. Their circumstances did not afford them time for learning, particularly the English language. Without learning, financial savings, or often a job, these impoverished families could not escape the tenement properties and their resulting miserable way of life. Riis describes it best as \\"the poor are what the tenements have made them\\" (Riis, 1997).Riis provides several proven recommendations for improving New York's poverty situation caused by the tenements such as remodeling or building new tenements and instituting \\"fair play between landlord and tenant\\" (1997). He cites a few examples of landlords who reformed their properties and worked collaboratively with their tenants to successfully improve their lives.Riis' answer to the problems of the tenements is \\"all a matter of education,\\" education of landlords, of tenant families, of the public and elite, and of politicians (1997). In a more uplifting chapter, Riis describes a successful rescue program through the Children's Aid Society which instilled self-help and effectively educated young, troubled boys, the \\"Street Arabs.\\" Many of these young boys (and girls in other Children's Aid Society programs) learned trades and skills that would help them overcome the entrapping cycle of poverty.By writing this book, Riis played a major role in his plight for education about and of the tenements. According to Sante's introduction, Riis was successful in changing the status and structure of the tenements through publication of How the Other Half Lives. Riis concludes, \\"I know of but one bridge that will carry us over safe, a bridge founded upon justice and built of human hearts (1997).\\"Although this book was written during the industrialization period in the late 1890's to address issues faced by victims of New York's tenements, much of it is still applicable to the cycle of poverty still prevalent in America today, in the 21st century. As Riis believed, education plays an important part of breaking this cycle and closing the gap between the rich and poor. Benjamin Franklin, writing a century before Riis' time that education should not be a privilege only for the elite, would have agreed with his value of education as a resolution for tenement poverty (Isaacson, 2003).This book opened my eyes to just how cyclical poverty is. It can be a downward spiral for many generations. Any one interested in having a better understanding of poverty, especially of immigrants or the uneducated, should read How the Other Half Lives. I have a greater appreciation for the opportunities and fortune many of us have. Riis has inspired me to further my contributions toward education. In support of Franklin and Riis' values of education, I think the opportunity of education should be available for all to help break this cycle. I think Riis is right...until the bridge of justice built of human hearts he speaks of is fully constructed, situations of poverty will continue.ReferencesIsaacson, W. (2003).

Riis is a perfect candidate to write this novel because he knows what it is like to be an immigrant, and live in poverty. Riis was the third of Fifteen children and emigrated to the U.S. in 1870. According to his biography on http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAriis.htmRiis \\"was often forced to spend the night in police station lodging houses.\\" due to lack of money. It was not until three years later that Riis found work inside a news bureau.Prehaps because Riis was able to escape proverty, he was easy to critic those that give up with out putting up a fight. Riis clearly blames the slum tenement problem on both the rich and the poor through his harsh racial comments. The rich oppresses the immigrants through high rents to prevent them from moving up in the social ladder while most of the poor do no make an effort to learn English and other skills to survive in America.This is a good book to have but it's not a very relaxing book to read. Most of the pictures are not very high quality, considering the time period it was taken, but it really does not do justice to that era. I also find Riis's writing style very dull and lengthy. (I guess some call that poetic)."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York (American century series, S-12)","review":"I'm in agreement with other reviewers on the terrible quality of this edition!

The author speaks with a crusader's zeal and with so much detail that the reader can visualize these tenements, these streets, and these people as if they were living today. This is a grim and moving portrayal of the lives of the men, the women and the children that inhabit these loathsome neighborhoods of New York City in the late 1800s. He so graphically describes the filth, the sunless and airless rooms, the crowding, and the starvation that these places palpably exist for the reader and bring a chill to any heart. Riis has a genuine concern for the tenement situation and understands these people's plight. His pictures are touching and meant to vividly show their misery. He, for the most part, blames the money-hungry landlords for these crowded conditions: \\"How shall the love of God be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the greed of man.\\" (p. 266). He laments that the tenement is three quarters responsible for the misery of the poor. Then, after his extensive discourse, he offers three concrete cures for these dreadful conditions, something that many authors forget when they are enlightening readers.Riis states his purpose for writing this book himself on page 297 when he says, \\"If this book shall have borne ever so feeble a hand in garnering a harvest of justice, it has served its purpose.\\" The author apparently succeeded with his purpose, because in the flyleaf of this book the publisher tells us: \\"This book helped bring about new revisions in the housing codes of the major U. S. cities.\\"How does this book relate to adult education? By moving chronologically from the founding of America to the slums of NYC in the 1800s, are we to understand that education took a back seat to the accumulation of money during those hundred years? Certainly Riis posits that education is one of the solutions to this problem while at the same time implying that wealth accumulation and the lack of education has been the cause of this problem. \\"Thus the whole matter resolves itself once more into a question of education, all the more urgent because these people are poor, miserably poor almost to a man.\\" (p. 147). He does not forget that this \\"education\\" is not only for the poor people, but also for the wealthy landlords. \\"Clearly, it is a matter of education on the part of the landlord no less than the tenant.\\" (p. 270). Riis' almost missionary language exhorts us to never allow greed to override a compassion for humanity. \\"It is a fight in which eternal vigilance is truly the price of liberty and the preservation of society.\\" (p. 233). The relation of this book to the other units of study in this course could be explained as an example of how low mankind can descend if education is not considered one of the major cornerstones of a society.Although this book was exhaustive in its detail, it was easy to read while at the same time enlightening. I found myself enjoying the ranting tone and the fascinating lists of neighborhoods and the labels that Riis used for the different races. In a sense it reads like a Ginsberg poem; constantly hitting the reader with melodious lists of places and people from another era. Read these geographic names out loud and feel their rhythm:Jewtown, Bandit's Roost, Double Alley, The Bowery, The Bloody Sixth Ward, The Fourth, Fifth and Tenth Wards, Blindman's Alley, The Bend, The Battery, Little Italy, The French Quarter, Hell's Kitchen, The West Side, Bottle Alley, Frog Hollow, Poverty Gap, Murderer's Alley, Gotham Court, The Old Brewery, Old Africa, Potter's Field, Blackwell's Island Asylum, Rogues' Gallery, Penitentiary Row, Chinatown. The list goes on. To someone reared in rural America, this chant sounds like a song about another country.Riis also has something to say about all the races of people that live in the tenements of New York City:Chinaman (he can't be taught), (Chinese (coolie--laundry business), Polish Jew (coops himself up in his den with his thermometer at boiling), Russian Jew, Jew (money is their God), Bohemian (poor, but thrifty), Blacks (like to gamble, but they are clean), Greek, Hebrews (tailors, all of them), Dutchman, Irish (like to drink and have expensive funerals), German (order loving), Swiss, Pasquales, Russian, Italian (a born gambler; lighthearted and gay), Swamp Angel (thieves), Street Arabs (army of homeless boys), Tramps and Toughs (the world owes them a living),and the Celtics. I was enthralled by the street lingo and the colloquialisms and Riis' comments about every race.I noticed one interesting similarity between the late 1800s and the present day. Riis says that the gap between the social classes is widening everyday. I hear people talking about the growing differences between the rich and the poor often these days. Does every generation think that is happening in their time?Not only should this book be used by people researching New York City\`s tenements, but it should also be read by everyone seeking a blueprint for social change. It is a reminder to show us how hopeless the human circumstances can become when man's greed overrides his concern for human dignity."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York (American century series, S-12)","review":"I needed to buy this book for school, and decided to get the kindle edition because it was cheaper.

First, the life of immigrants to New York City in the late 1800s was deplorable while housing for others was splendid. \\"To-day three fourths of its people live in the tenements, and the nineteenth century drift of the population to the cities is sending ever-increasing multitudes to crowd them\\" (Riis, p. 6) Sections of tenement houses were divided by streets and alleys which divided the nationalities. \\"As emigration from east to west follows the latitude, so does the foreign influx in New York distribute itself along certain well-defined lines that waver and break only under the stronger pressure of a more gregarious race or the encroachments of inexorable business.\\" (Riis, p. 21) Each nationality had some very distinct characteristics but they also had some very great differences as well.The next theme to emerge was that of work. In some sections of the city, it was acceptable for everyone to work while in other sections, only the men did physical work while the women \\"kept house\\" or there was even mention of the men just standing in doorways, streets and alleys. \\"The men sit or stand in the streets, on trucks, or in the open doors of the saloons smoking black clay pipes, talking and gesticulating as if forever on the point of coming to blows.\\" (Riis, p. 49) Money was earned, at very small rates throughout the tenements, by someone in the family, if not multiple people. \\"Often there are two, sometimes three, sets of sweaters on the job. They work with the rest when they are not drumming up trade, driving their \`hands' as they drive their machine, for all they are worth, and making a profit on their work, of course, though in most cases not nearly as extravagant a percentage, probably, as is often supposed. If it resolves itself unto a margin of five or six cents, or even less, on a dozen pairs of boys' trousers, for instance, it is nevertheless enough to make the contractor with his thrifty instinct independent. The workman growls, not at the hard labor or poor pay, but over the pennies another is coining out of his sweat, and on the first opportunity turns sweater himself, and takes his revenge by driving an even closer bargain than his rival tyrant, t his reducing his profits.\\" (Riis, p 94)Finally, the third theme centered on bringing about change via real people, real stories and images of real life in the tenements. \\"Riis made maximum use of photographs, however, not only to illustrate six of his books, but also as lantern slides to illustrate lectures he began giving in 1888 and continued until his death.\\" (Riis, p. xvii) People are drawn to real life situations to which they can relate. The accounts, photographs and images of Riis bring real life accounts to the reader, sparking more interest, creating a deeper relationship between the characters in the story and the reader. And by doing so, Riis encourages others to take action to remedy the sad situation.As the previous themes are analyzed, connections can be made between them and education and society of today. It is important to first note that in today's society, there are still sections in certain towns and cities that are divided predominantly by ethnic diversity. Not only is housing situations but also in educational systems the divisions are found, although it is encouraged that the lines be broken down. \\"The many philanthropic efforts that have been made in the last few years to render less intolerable the lot of the tenants in the homes where many of them must continue to live, have undoubtedly had their effect in creating a disposition to accept better things, that will make plainer sailing for the future builders of model tenements., In many ways, as in the \`College Settlement' of courageous girls, the Neighborhood Guilds, through the efforts of The King's Daughters, and numerous other schemes of practical mission work, the poor and the well-to-do have been brought closer together, in an every-day companionship that cannot but be productive of the best results, to the one who gives no less than tto the one who receives.\\" (Riis, p. 207) Obviously different locales call for difference measures of tolerance and defend certain levels of intolerance but the lines exist nonetheless. \\"The experience of this landlord points directly to the remedy which the law failed to supply to the early reformers. It has since been fully demonstrated that a competent agent on the premises, a man of the best and the highest stamp, who knows how to instruct and guide with a firm hand, is a prerequisite to the success of any reform tenement scheme.\\" (Riis, p. 205)Secondly, work was important in this book. Riis did an excellent job of documenting the working conditions and who was responsible for certain jobs in the tenements in each section. Just as Benjamin Franklin valued an honest day's work, so did the people of the tenements. The biggest difference between those two accounts of work was who was actually responsible for the work. Depending upon the culture of the area sometimes it was the men, women or children, or all three, that completed work to earn money or keep house. \\"Men, women and children work together seven days in the week in these cheerless tenements to make a living for the family, from the break of day till far into the nights. Often the wide is the original cigarmaker from the old home, the husband having adopted her trade here as a matter of necessity, because, knowing no word of English, he could get no other work.\\" (Riis, p. 105) But how did people in this situation become educated to work? \\"The old question, what to do with the boy, assumes a new and serious phase in the tenements. Under the best conditions found there, it is not easily answered. In nine cases out of ten he would make an excellent mechanic, if trained early to work at a trade, for he is neither full nor slow, but the short-sighted despotism of the trades unions has practically closed that avenue to him. Trade-schools, however excellent, cannot supply the opportunity thus denied him. Home, the greatest factor of all in the training of the young, means nothing to him but a pigeon-hole in a coop along with so many other human animals. Its influence is scarcely of the elevating kind, if it have any....With no steady hand to guide him, the boy takes naturally to idle ways.\\" (Riis, p. 136)Finally, it is important to note the third theme of bringing reality into the lives of the reader. In education today, it is important to show real life application of concepts and ideas for learning to take place. Riis was a pioneer in bringing photographs, real images and valid data to people to create a felt need for change and response. Most photographs in the book are very dark and only add realism to the stories told. For example, the photographs on pages 93, 104 appear very dark and the subjects unhappy. The fact that Riis was probably standing, himself, in the darkest part of the room and photographing the lightest part of the room, near the windows, only tells the reader that even in the lightest part of the room, the darkness and dreariness ruled over the tenements. \\"Riis's use of photography to point his words and flesh out his anecdotes is no less important, endowing an entire legacy of its own.\\" (Riis, p. xiii)I believe the intent of the author was to simply bring a big picture view to narrow minded people. He very much accomplished his purpose. By using stories of families, shocking details and everyday photographs of real people, he was able to bring people to understand the reality of life in their own city and encourage them to help make changes. It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words, and Riis is a prime example of this. Not only are his accounts vivid and horrific, but also his images leave nothing to the imagination. The reader can not be left to imagining a rosier picture than was intended. The illustrations both verbal and nonverbal are graphic and moving.The appropriate audience for this book would have to be very broadly, mature, adult citizens of our world. The language used in this book can be, at times, a bit complicated to comprehend; this is why I believe it appropriate for mature adults. I also believe very firmly that adults are sometimes the most difficult to convince to take action to help those less fortunate or those in need. When we read real life accounts and see pictures of people just like us in deplorable conditions, it is difficult for us to sit back and take no action. I also believe it is important for citizens of our world to understand the underlying message of helping those less fortunate or those in need who may be right in our own back yard. This book is a stunning example of one man giving factual accounts of events to produce concerned citizens ready to take action to improve conditions for fellow human beings."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York (American century series, S-12)","review":"Yes, the stories in this book are depressing. Yes, they are still happening even today. However, Riis's writing style is quite sensantionalist, it had me rolling my eyes every paragraph or so.

Again, yes I know this was written in 1890, but the sheer volume of his judgement against other cultures, etc. really took me out of the core stories of the conditions of the people detailed in the book.A fair amount of the book had me interested, it's just the way the stories were told made me not be able to disgest their content very well."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York (American century series, S-12)","review":"How did our grandfathers and great-grandfathers (and great-great, I suppose) survive immigration and the slums? What was life like on the Lower East Side of New York? For those of us whose family has only been in the US for a few generations, this is a must-read. Whether Irish, Italian, Jewish, Chinese or Polish, German, Russian, hordes of refugees ended up in New York on the promise of a better life.Reading Riis' book reads like the newspaper in some ways; entrepreneurs lured poor people from Eastern Europe and contracted out their labor in sweat shops in the US. Sound familiar? But what is not so familiar are the living conditions in the tenements, dark, unventilated cages in blocks of buildings that rented for a surprising high rent to people who died by the thousands in the unsanitary conditions. Farm animals had it better. Why was rent so high? Supply and demand. Cheaper rent was to be had in Brooklyn and the outlying (as yet unincorporated) boroughs, but the WORK was in Manhattan, where you could get by as a tailor, a seamstress, a peddler or in some illegitimate activity.The conditions will make you cry; the story of foundling babies (abandoned newborns) is astonishing. A cradle was put outside a Catholic Church and instead of a baby each night, racks of babies appeared. The Church had to establish foundling hospitals run by nuns, who persuaded the unwed or impoverished mothers to nurse the baby they gave up, plus another baby (women can usually nurse two, though these malnourished women must have been hard-pressed.) The child mortality rate, especially in the \\"back tenements\\" or buildings built on to the back of others (dark and airless) was incredible.I wish the plates in the book were of better quality; Riis took many photographs, but the reproduction here is poor and they are hard to see. I recommend that if you are interested in this subject from seeing \\"The Gangs of New York\\" or for genealogical reasons, that you visit the Lower East Side Tenement Museum and see the buildings for yourself. Even cleaned up and no longer packed with unwashed people, they are heart-rending."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York (American century series, S-12)","review":"This edition of How the Other Half Lives is astoundingly bad.

And this new genre, like the first movies and radio programs, fascinated its audience. Riis' sharp essays are matched only by his sharp eye for photography. I don't know which made more of an impact on me: the text or the pictures of unspeakable misery. But I think it's a safe bet to say that Riis' contemporaries were fixated more on the photographs. (After all, Riis turned to photography AFTER his published essays seemed to have little effect.) In any event, the result, then as now, is a provocative, compassionate, and angry work that exposed to the middle and upper classes of his time the effects of their indifference, at best, or the effects of their roles as slumlords and sweatshop owners, at worst.The only jarring aspect of the book is Riis' use of ethnic stereotyping. He makes several not-nice remarks about Jews, Chinamen, Italians, etc. However, we must not impose our early 21st Century values on a late 19th Century man. These types of remarks were commonplace back in the pre-politically correct times. In any event, Riis' overall intention was to help these people get out of their horrid conditions and not to slur their heritages.One last note, Luc Sante's introduction is brilliant and serves the book very well.Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points Concluded, a Novel"},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York (American century series, S-12)","review":"This is an extremely important work that is often difficult to find at local libraries.

He used his writing and photography to publicize the lifestyles of the lower classes in New York City in the late nineteenth through early twentieth centuries. In How the Other Half Lives, Riis described the inherent injustices and terrible living conditions of New York City tenements. He exposed the public to the evils of tenement life, portraying New York City living conditions of the lower classes for what they truly were. He successfully accomplished his goal of attracting attention to a dire situation.Riis wrote How the Other Half Lives to evoke sympathy to awaken the masses to the poverty in their backyards. Through his writings and photographs Riis knew people would become aware and respond to the living conditions in New York slums. Tenements were large buildings that overflowed with families living under miserable conditions. People representing many different nationalities lived in New York City tenements, and the population of immigrants grew incredibly during this time of emigration. It quickly became the most heterogeneous city in the country, and the different Europeans lived together under terrible conditions. Some immigrant groups of the same nationality lived in small separate communities together. Most settled on the East Side of New York, where the New York aristocracy had lived. The contrast between the days when the aristocracy lived on the East Side and when the immigrants moved there is quite apparent.Jacob Riis stated, &quot;Homes had ceased to be sufficiently separate, decent, and desirable to afford what are regarded as ordinary wholesome influences of home and family.&quot; Tenements were overcrowded, dark, and unsanitary. Riis felt nobody should live in these conditions, and he called people to recognize the horrors of immigrant life. The homes of these immigrants were described in this way, &quot;Large rooms were partitioned into several smaller ones, without regard to light or ventilation, the rate of rent being lower in proportion to space or height from the street; and they soon became filled from cellar to garret with a class of tenantry living from hand to mouth, loose in morals, improvident in habits, degraded, and squalid as beggary itself.&quot; One of Riis's photographs, &quot;In Poverty Gap, West Twenty-Fourth Street An English Coal Heaver's Home&quot; depicts a typical poor immigrant family who obviously had very little materially and lived in a dilapidated tenement. The family seems very hardened in emotion, as if they are not even real. The combination of poignant quotes and photographs such as these led people to challenge the status quo.One of Riis's major tasks was to distinguish the difference between the &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have-nots&quot; of New York City by comparing the immigrants with the few rich. There was very little social mobility for tenement immigrants, who made up the majority of the population. He appealed to the consciousness of the rich by saying, &quot;As business increased, and the city grew with rapid strides, the necessities of the poor became the opportunity of their wealthier neighbors.&quot; This points out the exploitation of immigrants by the wealthy class that Riis felt existed. No matter how hard they worked, there seemed to be no way out for the immigrants. &quot;Knee Pants at Forty-Five Cents a Dozen - a Ludlow Street Sweater's Shop&quot; is a photograph that shows an entire family working diligently in their confined tenement. This illustrates that there was no hope for immigrant families; they kept working but reaped no benefits. Riis blamed the tenement living conditions for the crimes and unethical behavior he saw among the immigrants. He blamed their poor standard of living for the abundance of crime and other abuses in immigrant neighborhoods. &quot;A Downtown Morgue&quot; presents us with drinking, one of the vices of the immigrants, but implies that they had nothing to encourage them to stay away from it. The photograph also reinforces the poverty and hopelessness, suggesting the immigrants had nothing to live for so they wasted their lives away on alcohol. Riis took a special interest in children because he saw them as innocent people who had become so jaded by their surroundings that they became criminals. &quot;Prayer Time in the Nursery, Five Points House of Industry&quot; portrays young children praying, probably indicating Riis's dream that all children would be set on the right path and stay there throughout their lives.A major criticism to Riis's work is that he was prejudiced and writing from a biased point of view. Riis reflected the view of the upper classes toward the immigrants and poorer classes, and readers can pick up on this through the biases in his work. He could not fully understand the plight of the people he studied because he was not one of them. Riis used terms that were crude and unflattering to the nationalities of those whom he was describing. He describes the &quot;Chinaman&quot; in the following way, &quot;Ages of senseless idolatry, a mere grub-worship, have left him without the essential qualities for appreciating the gentle teachings of a faith whose motive and unselfish spirit are alike beyond his grasp.&quot; He also referred to the Chinese as a &quot;terrible menace to society&quot; because of their marijuana smoking. Riis wrote that &quot;lower class&quot; Italians were foreign, different, and therefore separate from others. Other examples of vivid language Riis used were, &quot;the tramps, peddlers, hags, rude swains, and the really pretty girls.&quot; Since he was an outsider due to his class, he could not possibly relate to the people he was describing."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York (American century series, S-12)","review":"\\"The business of housing the poor, if it is to amount to anything, must be business, as it was business with our fathers to put them where they are. As charity, pastime, or fad, it will miserably fail, always and everywhere\\" (p. 201). Jacob A. Riis, in his book, How the Other Half Lives, vividly describes the human condition of the tenements of New York during the late 1800's. The author provides not only a physical description of the tenement buildings but delves deeper into the people who live there and why they don't leave the pits of filth and despair.Jacob Riis, presents a compelling account of the intricate business of managing the slums of New York and maintaining the status quo among the hundreds of thousands of immigrants who came to America to seek a new and prosperous life. After arriving they found they were trapped in a life of high rents and low wages with little hope for improvement of their circumstances. What little help was available seemed to be in the form of charity that couldn't sustain the prideful immigrants desire to succeed in this country.The reader is taken on a tour of the slums and introduced to the groups of immigrants nationality by nationality and given a full account of the author's stereotypical ideas about their good and bad points. Of the Italian Riis says he only spends time indoors when it's raining or he is sick. When the sun shines the entire population seeks the streets carrying on all facets of life (p. 47). He further says the Italian is a born gambler (p 44) and learns slowly, if at all (p. 42) so that his job of working the ash carts is simply suited for him. On the positive side Riis says the Italian is as honest as he is hot-headed (p. 45).The Chinese are a stealth and secretive group with all activities going on behind closed doors (p75). They are also attributed with stealing the women of the white man and leading them into the grip of opium giving them up only to the Charity Hospital or the Potter's Field (p76). On the positive side the Chinese are noted for their scrupulous neatness (p 78).The Bohemians are an honest group but rumored as being anarchists. They are fond of beer and will live at the highest means available thus they have nothing saved for a rainy day (105). He is caught in a tough position of working for poor wages and facing rising rents with no way out. For if he rebels against low wages and high rent he loses his home and job; the two are connected as cigar making takes place in the home utilizing supplies provided by the landlords.To the Jews money is their God and they work in the tenements crowding the area of Ludlow Street more densely than the crowding of Old London (p 83). They are suited to baking as bread is cheap and their love of money and the saving of it is suited to eating bread. They are also known for their work in the clothing industry. Of the Blacks, Riis stereotypes them as cleaner and better tenants but none-the-less they pay higher rents for no one else will live in a tenement after the black man has. While much of the reading is based on the stereotypes formed by the author it still provides a vivid picture of the human condition including the live's of tramps in stale beer dives and the thugs who cause fear and trouble in the streets. Both tramps and toughs profess that the world owes them a living (p64). The author also relates the degree to which the upper class try to distort the reality of life in the tenements, classifying starvation as \\"improper nourishment\\". In one case starvation led one poor man to thoughts of murdering his own children. In his madness he had only one conscious thought: that the town should not take the children. \\"Better that I take care of them myself ,\\" he repeated to himself as he ground the axe to an edge.(p 127).Due to this book, Riis was able to draw public attention to the horrendous living conditions of the poor in New York City, and to insist on reform. The reforms he recommended were largely undertaken, although it was a very gradual process (p. ix). This may be partially attributed to political factors relating to the fact that political contests were won in the areas with the fully packed lodging houses (p 71). With this writing Riis does not allow the world to forget easily, what it does not like to remember (p196)."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York (American century series, S-12)","review":"Riis's work is an amazing picture of life in the New York slums. While the text in itself is quite interesting, the photos are perhaps the most gripping aspect of the book. To see the tiny, crowded rooms populated by unreal numbers of people and the eyes of hungry children that stare out of the picture and are still imploring a century later is a powerful experience; Riis's book allows one to get very close to the misery these people felt.

His expose was highly influential and brought about a number of reforms within the City, yet the tome is filled with almost comical stereotypes and prejudices about the various races and cultures found within the domain of the tenements, sidestreets and alleyways that the poor called, for lack of a better word, home. Despite this massive shortcoming (a sign of the times Riis lived in), Other Half is an engaging read and showcases the severe plight too many endured during this period in history, moreso than the most depressingly dour of Dickensian prose."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York (American century series, S-12)","review":"Few books in American history have had the social impact that Jacob A.

He hoped, through the evolving technological advances of photography and his published, emotional plea, to rouse the well-to-do citizens of New York into helping the millions of poor and impoverished, native and immigrant alike, which continued to swell the city's population. In order for them to have had the chance of becoming productive American citizens, they must first have been given the opportunity at a fair start, which the abject state of the tenement buildings were unable to provide.The first problem was the tenement itself. Usually a building, four to six stories high, intended for the occupancy of just a few families, soon had over a hundred people packed into every nook that could fill a human body. Most interior rooms never saw the light of day. Fresh air was a rare commodity, leaving most residents to breathe the same stale air day and night. The maze of tight, blind passageways created to fit each family made it impossible for firemen to reach helpless victims trapped on the upper floors, compounded by the fact that most fire escapes were blocked with residents' furniture, trapping more even still. Overall, the filth of the structures proved most offensive to the senses. One such building was so dubbed the \\"Dirty Spoon\\" because the grime on the walls had effectively made it fire proof (Riis 30). Rear tenements, built in empty courts behind the street buildings, were usually worse, little more than dilapidated hovels cut off from light by the surrounding structures.Despite this vision of abject poverty, and indeed starvation was prevalent, many in the tenements were not what would have been considered poor. Some, in fact, earned a decently living for the era. So why didn't they move? The real question to be asked is, to where would they move? Tenement houses were the norm in New York, each as good (or lousy) as the next. Additionally, the rents paid by most of these residents (especially blacks) were very high, often amounting to more than a week's wage. Only the abundantly wealthy could afford better, while the middle and lower classes were left to the stink of places like \\"The Bend\\" on Mulberry Street, which Riis considers the heart of slum depravity.Predictably, these conditions bred all types of criminal activity. Faced with constant hunger and only the streets to call home, many resorted to gang violence or controlled substance dependency. Children, who sometimes never saw beyond their squalid block, with a family that could not provide for their basic needs, soon created gangs of their own, making their way as they could. Other children toiled with their families in the sweatshops, for which the tenements were the main housing. Perhaps the most regrettable victims of the tenements were the infants, who were regularly victims of abandonment, left on wealthy doorsteps with vain hopes by desperate parents, or given up to \\"Baby-farms\\" where they were left to starve to death (Riis 148). These conditions Riis blames squarely on tenements: \\"The product is our own\\" (Riis 171).However, all hope was not lost to Riis. Already airshafts had been implemented in new building designs to allow ventilation (to what effect can be debated) and new windows punched into walls, so that \\"air and sunlight\\" could \\"have a legal claim\\" (Riis 211). Rear tenements, too, were quickly disappearing. He felt that by writing How the Other Half Lives, the wealthy and influential of the city would come to the aid (Riis 131). In this respect he was correct, when through his book he found an ally in Theodore Roosevelt, who began implementing many of the suggestions that Riis proposed. He urged people to look beyond the building facades (which were admittedly nice on some buildings) to the teeming filth that they masked (Riis 209). Perhaps the most intimidating argument for his more fortunate peers was the possibility of spreading disease, for to him public sentiment had \\"slumbered peacefully until... a dreaded epidemic knocked at our door\\" (Riis 212). He called for laws to be imposed against the current tenement conditions, for the buildings to be renovated or new \\"model tenements\\" built in their place (Riis 223). Likewise, tenants should have received the quality accommodations their high rents were entitling them to. Riis endorsed the park system (City-Beautiful influence?) as a way of relieving crime in congested districts, for reasons such as this elegant observation: \\"I have seen an armful of daisies keep the peace of a block better than a policeman and his club, seen instincts awaken under their gentle appeal\\" (Riis 138). Children, Riis felt, were the \\"key\\" to rescuing the city from poverty and corruption (Riis 143).The other contribution for which Riis has been immortalized, and no doubt thanked repeatedly by modern historians, is the treasure trove of photos he took while on his outings, one hundred of which are found in the Dover edition. (His original publication did not include the photos for technological reasons). The impact of the strikingly bleak images caught on film far outweighs any of the emotional condemnations he wrote. The reader, thankfully, is also treated to many of the stories behind these images, adding yet another dimension, such as the young paupers on page 157 who claimed that they \\"Didn't live nowhere.\\" Another, probably unintentional, effective element to the photos is the pained grimace on many faces (like the \\"Street Arab\\" on page 152), as though they are writhing in agony from hunger, although it is no doubt just a reaction from the camera's blinding flash in dark quarters. The street dwellers and criminals, even those presumably embarrassed by their situations, seem willing to have their pictures taken. Perhaps it is the only such opportunity many had.Despite Riis's commendable crusading and fight for the underprivileged, he was still in many ways a man of his time. The modern reader cannot help but be struck by the prejudices running through his commentary. The groups that receive the most of the brunt are the Italians and Polish Jews. The Chinese also pay a price for their differences, and Riis tells us that his \\"senseless idolatry, a mere grub-worship\\" have made nothing strong about him, except his passions when aroused\\" (Riis 77) and speaks of opium addiction as a form of white slavery (Riis 80). At least he commends them for being clean. Surprisingly, however, he looks fondly on African-Americans (along with Bohemians), who he treats with sympathetic respect. He sees their hardships, and the causes (ironically), that \\"the blame is born by prejudice and greed that have kept him from rising under a burden of responsibility to which he could hardly be equal\\" under those circumstances. That after only twenty-five years of freedom, he \\"may be seen to advance much farther and faster than before suspected, and to promise, with fair treatment, quite as well as the rest of us, his white-skinned fellow-citizens\\" (Riis 119). When he wished, it seems, Riis was quite able to see beyond differences.Riis, through How the Other Half Lives, awakened a society that had once turned a blind eye to the hardships prevalent in the tenements. He showed them effectively that the struggle was not theirs alone, but that its reach was felt for many miles in ways not readily apparent. His photographic images, forever capturing the lowest moments in people's lives, begged for intervention. Whatever Riis's shortcomings, future generations in New York and cities around the country would be better off because of what he did, and benefit from the experiences of those who did not live long enough to see those changes occur. Unfortunately, the images in Riis's work are still a common sight in many developing countries, making his century-old ideas of relevant, present power."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York (American century series, S-12)","review":"I used this book along with another Riis book for a U.S. History project at school.

(1997). How the Other Half Lives. New York: PenguinIn the distance, the Statue of Liberty echoes the refrain--Give me your poor, your tired, your huddled masses. This invitation was extended to millions of immigrants in the 19th and 20th centuries. Men, women, and children of varying nationalities and ethnicities made the journey to America. Consequently, they sought freedom from oppression and new opportunity in the land of plenty. However, the promises of a better life often proved unrealistic. In the late 19th century, a news writer, Jacob Riis investigated and exposed the slums of New York City. In his book, How the Other Half Lives, author Jacob Riis explores New York City's underclass. Furthermore, the graphic portrayal of the worst that life offers begins and ends with a shocking tour of the slums of New York City.Consequently, before starting on a journey through the slums of the Lower East Side of New York City, Riis reminds the reader of the cold, hard truth; the poor will always be with us (Intro-xi). However, the express intention of the author is to reveal the horrendous living conditions of the poor to public attention. The journey begins with visits to tenements. Multi-story, poorly constructed buildings crowd lots. Ethnic groups, with their idiosyncratic characteristics, specifically the Jews, Italians, Irish, Bohemians, Blacks, and Chinese, exist in the squalid, intensely overcrowded, disease ridden, poorly ventilated firetraps. Examples of the living conditions include statistics citing the world's greatest concentration of humans per square mile, an alarming death rate among young children, and the frequent deaths of men and specifically women and children in fires, where there is little chance for escape.Additionally, further trepidations are evident in the lives of the masses of humanity. In the street and alleys of the Bend, the tramps; the skulks of the slums, unclean beasts of dishonest idleness, certify their presence as the dregs of society (46). Moral depravity becomes evident as opium is constantly abused, the evils of rum disenfranchise the slum dweller, and stale beer dives appeal to the prurient interests of the frugally immoral.In addition, the color line in New York City is highlighted by the prejudice of landlords as they bilk the black man out of his hard earned wages. Furthermore, the criminality perpetrated by the gangs infects the slum with fear and lawlessness. Other crimes tear at the heart, specifically, the heinous starving to death of babies. Also, women are disadvantaged at a young age for their propensity to work for the family. They walk a fine line between the rigors of work and the temptations of selling their very body for gain. In all, the journey through the desolation of the slums is not for the faint of heart.At the close of the book, Riis offers his assessment of steps performed to alleviate the problems in the slums. These include tentative solutions involving the wealthy classes, the landlords, and the tenants. Living conditions must be improved, despite the apathy of the wealthy classes, the exorbitant greed of the landlords or the lack of resolve and interest by the tenants. Some improvements have been made, however significant strides need accomplished. The words of Riis literally plead for a call to action and progress, the reform of a city beset with human degradation and suffering.Moreover, How the Other Half Lives, fulfills the purposes of the author. It brings to the light of the public eye, an awareness of life in the slums. By means of his vigilant journey through lives of the poor and forgotten, the stories of thousands are revealed. Additionally, the book achieved a supplementary purpose. It's achievements of muckraking, caused the book to be a forerunner of investigative journalism. Furthermore, the intent of the book is not only to expose the degradation of the slums, but to provide an impetus to appropriate action. The author excelled in touching both the heart and soul of the reader.Furthermore, Jacob Riis, in How the Other Half Lives, transmits a message of Social Reformation. This message seeks relief for the disparaging poor of the slums. Additionally, the book illustrates the disparity of value systems and a defeated spirit of self consciousness. In an 1897 paper, John Dewey, states \\"education is a regulation of a process of coming to share in the social consciousness: and that the adjustment of individual activity on the basis of this social consciousness is the only sure method of reconstruction\\" (Dewey, 1897). The people of the slums: men, women, and children needed the advantages of educational opportunities. Jacob Riis documents the misery of the slums of New York City. Coincidentally, the poor, along with drug dealers, crack whores, the homeless, and gangs still live in the crowded slums of New York City. How do we raise the social consciousness and provide educational initiatives for the slum dwellers of today?Subsequently, the book is a must read for all manners of people. The eye opening, jaw dropping revelations of the New York City slums provoke both anguish and compassion. Yes, as we students sit sipping our second cup of cappuccino, relaxing upon a plush couch, watching our big screen television, we may enjoy reading How the Other Half Lives.ReferencesDewey, J.

Riis gives the reader a front row view of life in the tenements of New York City at the end of the 19th century. Please consider the time period in which Riis wrote his book to put the ethnic, racial, class, and gender biases inherent in his work into the proper historical context. Personally, I found this offensive, but I aimed to not condemn the messenger without hearing the message first.Riis tells the story of millions of lives marked by never-ending hard labor, lack of adequate nourishment and housing, violence, abuse, addiction, and disease. Many of these people living in the tenements were first-generation immigrants from Ireland, Russia, Eastern Europe, and Italy. The push/pull of migration to the United States ends in the New York tenements in a million shattered dreams. Rather than finding the land of opportunity, immigrants were exploited for their cheap labor.Despite Riis' biases as a journalist and observer, he was motivated by charity and goodwill to investigate the living conditions of the poor and expose the harsh reality to the world. By doing so, Riis intended to bring about social change. The reality of his expose is heart wrenching more than a century after its writing. Riis main thesis is an argument for changing the living conditions of the poor. He calls for improved housing and renovated neighborhoods as a means to improve the lives of the tenement dwellers. However, Riis does not directly make a call for educating the poor, but his writing brings the salient absence of education to bear and he does make note of attempts by church groups to educate the poor.Down in the Tenth Ward on Ludlow Street, Riis meets Polish and Russian Jews who manufacture clothing is sweltering, cramped tenements that serve both as home and factory to its inhabitants. In the chapter, entitled The Sweaters of Jewtown, an entire family works eighteen hours a day, in unhealthy, dangerous conditions to produce 1,440 pairs of knickerbockers for a mere $8.40 a week. Sweaters are to clothing manufacturing what slumlords are to housing. These migrants are exploited in many ways. The sweater gets a shocking low price for production because the workers, who rarely speak English, must underbid unions and other immigrant workers just to have work. The landlord, sometimes also the sweater, takes the exploitation one step further down toward hell and charges the highest rent he can, and requires the workers to purchase raw materials and tools. This is textbook exploitation of the disadvantaged. After all that, workers barely earn enough money to keep starvation at bay. The working and living conditions for families who are supported by the work of women fair far worse than families who have a male head of household due to the grotesque inequity in pay between males and females.Riis' story of the family living on Mott Street was far too common and representative of Riis' overall description of life in the tenements. The Mott Street family was worse off than the Jewish family he met on Ludlow Street mostly because they could not work. Without social welfare programs and medical care, they had no alternative but to suffer through their cruel fate. The doctor had been called because the baby was gravely ill. The diagnosis was \\"improper nourishment\\" (Riis, p. 126). In other words, the baby was dying from starvation. The father could no longer work because his hands were deformed from lead poisoning and because the family did not have medical care, an infectious eye condition had nearly blinded the children and the mother.If one is not moved by an ethical responsibility to alleviate the suffering of the poor and work to eradicate poverty, the Mott Street family demonstrates that poverty kills and is contagious; therefore, poverty is a public health issue. In a Jewish community, Riis notes that: \\"Typhus fever and small-pox are bread here, and help solve the question what to do with him.\\" (Riis, p. 85) This statement could be viewed as a rather anti-Semitic notion, but what Riis is really saying is that poverty is a matter of public health and infectious diseases pose a serious health threat. These two examples show how Riis wanted to shock the nation with the truth.While middle class boys were off to school, children in the tenements lived a hard life. Riis also tells us how poor children were exploited and abused. The story of \\"Edward Mulhearn, fourteen years old, had run away from his home in Jersey City\\" (Riis, p. 68) was not an isolated case. Edward was \\"employed\\" by a hustler who forced him to beg for money. To insure that Edward would solicit the most sympathy, thus bring in more money, he was burned with a hot iron and then acid was poured into the open wound.An entire essay could be written on the conditions of women and girls living in the tenements, but there is not time for that here. Let it suffice to say that females were at the very bottom of the social hierarchy and made the perfect victims. So were African Americans. Despite Riis' obvious racism and gender biases, he seems to have a special affinity and genuine fondness for women and African Americans. Riis recognized that the working skills that African Americans had used in the South became obsolete once they migrated to Northern urban areas and that employable skills were needed to promote the advancement of Blacks in society. He blamed bigotry and lack of education for their place in society. Riis recognizes that African Americans needed new job skills in order to gain employment. Today, call that workforce development and community education. At a time when African Americas were the receivers of a lot of racial animosity in the urbanized North, Riis points the finger at those who put the Black man and woman out of work by taking over his and her jobs and preventing entry into other jobs. \\"Even the colored barber is rapidly getting to be a thing of the past.\\" (Riis, p. 114)In the chapter entitled \\"The Street Arab,\\" Riis demonstrates the non-formal education that homeless boys received from the Children's Aid Society. The boys were allowed to help themselves and as long as they followed the rules, they could stay at the Society lodging house. This \\"God helps those who help themselves\\" attitude is evident in the largess bestowed on the street boys. A boy could be outfitted with a black boot kit to work the city streets shining shoes, but the boy has to purchase his trade tools on an installment plan. There were not any formal trades open to these poor kids or to their parents. The tenements of New York needed one of Franklin's free libraries and Junto organizations, but they first would need to be fed and taught to read and write.What ever formal or non-formal education the Society was able to offer these boys was contingent on first convincing the boys that their charity was not a \\"Sunday-school racket,\\" which is a reference to the missionary attempts to teach people to read to better serve God. This long-standing Protestant tradition was the hallmark of early American educational movements and the theoretical basis for literacy. The debate between the religious and secular virtues of education was an inheritance from Colonial times. Riis, like Benjamin Franklin over a century earlier, thought education was important to civil society, rather than a means to glorify God. Walter Isaacson notes in his masterful autobiography Benjamin Franklin: An American Life that the...\\"Great Awakeners sought to recommit America to the anguished spirituality Puritanism, whereas Franklin sought to bring it into an Enlightenment era that exalted tolerance, individual merit, civic virtue, good deeds, and rationality. (Isaacson, p. 109)Riis recognizes the futility in trying to convert people who are starving, homeless, and suffering when he writes: \\"How shall the love of god be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the greed of man?\\" (Riis, p.198) Riis calls for civil reformation that involves fair play in everything from controlled housing prices, opening trades and unions to the marginalized, ethical business practices, and laws that promote equal opportunities.Riis shows us that poverty and lack of education go hand in hand: it's a reciprocal process and one influences the other. This book was a hard read for me on several levels, but it is a lesson in compassion and a salient reminder of how lucky most of us truly are. Riis book show us that education was at a crisis stage in the urban U.S. in the late 19th century, and something had to give, or the nation would not survive in a changing world. I am grateful to of had the opportunity to read this book, and I would recommend it for reading to anyone interested in issues of race, class, and gender. Riis' book is a dark window into what life in an American city can be like when education is not an option. This book is of utmost importance to the social historian, child advocate, and social worker."},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York (American century series, S-12)","review":"This book is a MUST for everybody who is interested in New York City and its history!It is the perfect preparation before a tour of the tenement museum!Read it!"},{"Title":"How the other half lives;: Studies among the tenements of New York (American century series, S-12)","review":"If you read this you'll be done and what's really sad the same game is going on today.

There must be thousands--perhaps tens of thousands--of Civil War memoirs, with few of them being worth more than a cursory skimming. Wilkeson's book goes far beyond this, and deserves to rank as literature. Perhaps its vituperative tone is what has stood in the way of its wider recognition. Frank Wilkeson's father was the noted war corespondent Samuel Wilkeson. His brother Bayard was a 19-year-old artillery lieutenant whose death on the first day of the Battle of Gettysburg provided him with the cloak of immortality that often is the reward of young lives wasted in battle. Frank, Bayard's younger brother, never says what effect his brother's heroic death had on his decision to join the Army, too; but at 16 he ran away to enlist. He found himself part of a group of a thousand professional bounty-jumpers, a low and besotted crew with whom he was forced to travel into action. Coming from a dutiful and relatively refined family, the discovery that such men existed--and in enormous numbers--must have come as an overwhelming shock to him. Much of the book deals with Wilkeson's service as an artilleryman during some of the fiercest fighting of the war--the Wilderness, Spottsylvania, Petersburg. His descriptions of camp life and of battle, wounds, and death, are graphic and unforgettable."},{"Title":"Turned Inside Out: Recollections of a Private Soldier in the Army of the Potomac","review":"Frank Wilkeson's memoirs make compelling reading.

Editor James M. McPherson glowingly sings the praises of Frank Wilkerson's manuscript, but he provides no additional details about the life of Wilkerson, something Civil War readers have come to expect when a veteran's manuscript is reprinted. The book is an incredible read, but the reader can't help but ask the question: who was Frank Wilkerson? Where is he buried? What additional details are known about the artillery battery he served in? What was the reaction of readers and veterans when Wilkerson's book was first published? McPherson answers none of these questions in his brief introduction. He only points out that Wilkerson made some mistakes and a few exaggerations in the book, and that historians often quote heavily from it, but that's all.The title of the book was originally: &quot;Recollections of a Private Soldier in the Army of the Potomac,&quot; but the publishers, or McPherson himself, have lamely retitled it &quot;Turned Inside Out&quot; - an obscure reference to the pockets of the battlefield dead after they had been looted. I can understand their reasoning for giving the book a shorter and catchier title, but one wonders why they simply didn't shorten Wilkerson's original title to just &quot;A Private Soldier.&quot; That would still describe the book in a nutshell. Unfortunaley, the new and enigmatic title will doom this edition to obscurity on the bookstore rack.Wilkerson's narrative is wonderful and I highly recommend it for all types of readers. But the definative edition of his narrative is yet to be published. I give Wilkerson's narrative 5 stars.

Each story is less than a page and recounts a tale that has been told enough times that some people believe it to be true (i.e. alligators in the sewers).While the topic is an interesting one, the writer's delivery is dry and sporadic. There seem to be more details in stories set in England than elsewhere. Overall there seems to be a strong English slant to the tales.The stories are roughly grouped into categories such as Accidents, Medical, Criminal, Miscellaneous, and Sex. Many of these seem to have been randomly place and would fit better in a different category.Are they really legends? No. While some of the tales are classic urban legends (although in variations I have never heard before), some of the stories have other origins. At least on tale is true and can be verified in the local papers (I won't tell you which one). Others have been lifted straight from old movies and television shows (many decades old that is).

The laws of cities, states, and nations are typically accompanied by a monopoly on how to enforce these laws. Their citizens have agreed to conform to these laws and their legitimacy as cities, states, and nations arises from this agreement. If citizens choose to violate these laws they are punished accordingly. But what entity oversees the punishment when laws between nations are violated? Such laws come under the umbrella of international law, the subject of this book, and their enforcement is only possible if the nations agree to this enforcement.The question of enforcement usually arises in the context of the legitimacy of the use of force or acts of war between nations, and is dealt with in some detail in this book. But there are many other aspects of international law that are discussed, and some readers may want to deal with the sheer size of the book by selecting those areas they are most interested in. A study of international law has become essential in today's world, due in part to the many wars that have broken out, some of them definitely bearing the mark of aggression and \\"war crimes\\", but also because of trade and patent disputes, along with the availability of complex financial products that need to operate across borders.The book is heavily referenced, satisfying those skeptical readers who need to delve into even more of the details. The author presents international law as a \`separate system' of law, as one that is not merely an adjunct to the laws of two or more countries. There is no legislature, no system of courts, and no institution to establish legal rules. Thus enforcement becomes an issue, at least if one insists on comparing international law with domestic law, and thus the author raises the question early on as to the status of international law as actually being a legitimate subfield of legal thought. It seems that the concept of coercion and its use is essential for qualify a system of statements as being a legal system. The author addresses these issues early on in the book, and as expected he concludes that one cannot ascertain the character or nature of international law solely with respect to a definition of law based on sanctions. His goal then is to find out why states feel compelled to follow the statutes of international law. If they do not, then he believes no system of international law can exist. It follows immediately that compliance among nations is a necessary condition for international law. As a system of legal thought, international law governs \`patterns of conduct' that nations are to comply with. A search for \\"stability\\" and \\"predictability\\" compels different nations to respect the system of international law. \`Reciprocity' and risk aversion may dissuade states from violating these agreements, since there is no international police force to punish violations.The author also traces the history of international law, which as a legal body of thought primarily has its roots in the last four centuries, but whose underpinnings can be trace backed for thousands of years. Very interesting in his treatment of this history is the origin of \`natural law' which he traces back to the ancient Greeks and taken up (oddly enough) by the Romans. The doctrine of natural law has a few noted adherents of late, including a few who sit on the United States Supreme Court. But as can easily be ascertained by perusing the author's history, international law is well represented geographically and culturally, a fact that is sometimes forgotten in Western culture. This \\"Eurocentric\\" view however has been weakened for the last several decades according to the author. Philosophical speculations, theology, and political science of course have played a role in the content of international law, and in this regard the author discuss the impact of positivism. Marxist-Leninist doctrine of course played a huge role especially in the late nineteenth century and all through the twentieth century. Modern developments in the legal theory of international law have been very influenced, as has every other realm of human activity, by mathematics, particularly in the use of game theory and decision theory. The author discusses this briefly, along with \\"feminist\\" approaches to legal reasoning.But if international law has not formal body of courts or presiding legislature, how is one to judge objectively cases or grievances that interested parties classify as being under the umbrella of international law? One needs test cases, precedents, documentation, or \\"sources\\" as the author calls them to give some sort of degree of certainty to the legal process. He devotes an entire chapter to this topic, and states early on that he believes international law does exist and has sources from which one can extract rules and perform useful analysis. What might be called \\"grassroot\\" behaviors and rules or \\"customs\\" which at first glance may be dismissed as irrelevant play a very important and dynamic role in international law the author argues, and he gives extensive discussion on why he thinks this is the case. And interestingly, he characterizes treaties as being a modernized version of creating law through custom. Of course the United Nations and other institutions have acted as sources, provoking sometimes much skepticism as to their efficacy in this regard.If countries or states had laws on their books that directly conflict with international law or are at odds with it to some noticeable degree then a resolution or compromise must be found. Thus the \`municipal laws' of a state must be related to the legal frameworks of international law, and the author devotes an entire chapter of the book to this topic. He outlines briefly the different schools of thought on this relationship, before he decides on a \\"realist\\" approach to this issue, and he clearly supports the notion that international law cannot be evaded by a state by applying its internal legal rules. He then discusses historical evidence that shed light on the complexity of this assertion, including real court cases from Great Britain and the United States.Note: This review is based on a reading of the first four chapters of the book."},{"Title":"International Law","review":"Very good book, with excellent insights and thourough explanations.

In my Junior year at University, I was required to purchase this book for a 300 level International Law class (which was considered introductory). My entire class dreaded this book, as did every student I spoke with who had taken this class prior to me. The form is absolutely awful, its drier than the Sahara, and sloppy at that. The fact that this is considered an introductory book to International Law frightens me.II. Shaw's writing style seems to be contradictory with what every Writing 101 teacher would instruct you to do, \\"When possible, use simple words, and try to keep sentences short and concise\\". Shaw does not only abuse semicolons, he militantly does so. He often uses legal terminology as if it were common sense without explanation, and his use of obscure words to explain otherwise common ideas is aggravating.Example: (This is a \\"full sentence\\" taken directly out of the book, what it means is still quite a mystery to me, but the book is rife with this type of language.)\\"The traditional exposition of the criterion concentrated upon the stability and effectiveness needed for this factor to be satisfied, while the representative and democratic nature of the government has also been put forward as a requirement.\\"The statement in the Preface of the book actually made me laugh...\\"The hallmark writing style provides a stimulating account, motivating students to explore the subject more fully, while maintaining detail and academic rigour.\\" ( What a great excuse for not paying attention to your audience.)III. I am wholeheartedly convinced that this entire book could be reduced a quarter of its weight if Shaw were to revise his sentence structure and cut out the bloat. Dividing the main body of text from the footnotes with a simple line, would alone, significantly increase readability. Putting a space between paragraphs would do wonders as well. As far as the pathological use of semicolons, when listing something, bullet points are very useful.IV. I would like to end on a decent note by saying that this book is probably without parallel as it does very thoroughly cover nearly everything pertaining to the subject matter, and I have no arguments pertaining to its usefulness as a legal resource. As a student however, it would have been much easier to absorbed the same relevant information if the information were presented in a clearer manner."},{"Title":"The It's Just Lunch Guide to Dating in New York City","review":"There is nothing new to learn in this flimsy \\"dating guide\\".

I also found some of the facts insightful, such as 30% of online daters are married, and 79% of men on a first date take 15 minutes to decide if they want to see you again. Most dating books don't have access to this type of data, but as this was written by a national dating agency, they're able to get some good facts from their customers. The surveys they did on what men and women look for on a first date were good too, and the Holidating protocol helped me figure out a Valentine dilemma. The listings at the end weren't that ingenious, but it's a neat idea to have that in a book so you can figure out some last minute date venues. Best of all, I thought the book didn't overpromise like so many dating books do, it was practical, easy advice that was optimistic but not over preachy. It seems like the author has tried to straddle middle ground, trying to appeal to both men and women, which I think is a mistake as we are so different in our approaches. I'm sure she could have gotten meatier if she was just writing for women. Overall, this book won't change your life, but it might give you some encouragement to get out there and start meeting people."},{"Title":"The higher learning in America; (American century series, S-7)","review":"Veblen never fails to make me laugh. In this case his argument is substantially the same one I made myself (in The Bubble Boys: How Mistaken Educational Ideals and Practices are Causing a Warped Social Fabric), but the approach is from a different angle. He sets the goal of business as separate from the goal of disinterested scholarship and goes from there to explain how the university system, in his time starting to be controlled by businessmen, has shifted its focus to ostentatious display (conspicuous consumption) and advertising rather than actually educating. Well worth the read, though Veblen's use of language remains extraordinarily difficult."},{"Title":"The higher learning in America; (American century series, S-7)","review":"The book is great, but don't buy the kindle edition.

Thoroughly researched, drawing heavily on original sources as well as directly from scripture, Discovering Saint Patrick approaches the life and times of the famous saint with a scholarly eye for detail and as much corroboration and verification as reasonably possible. A welcome contribution to church libraries and biographical collections of holy figures, and a \\"must-read\\" for anyone who is curious to understand what St. Patrick's Day is really all about."},{"Title":"Discovering Saint Patrick","review":"Thomas O'Loughlin is a professor of Historical Theology at the University of Wales Lampeter. His review of St. Patrick is traditional in many regards so it is a great opener for someone who is not as well-read about the Life of Patricius. He provides a translated version of Patrick's own account of his life known as the \\"Confessio\\" and Patrick's scathing \\"Letter to Coroticius.\\"O'Loughlin's contribution to the wealth of Patrician texts is that he examines some of the statements made by Patrick to try and understand how Patrick saw himself in space and time. He concludes that a number of passages in the \\"Confessio\\" indicate that Patrick saw himself on the edge of the World and on the precipe of Judgment Day. In fact, he suggests that one of the primary reasons for writing this piece was for Patrick to convey his own theology to those who might be concerned about what he was teaching.Like most biographers before him, Dr. O'Loughlin either consciously or unconciously seems to compare Patrick with a biblical motif by alluding to St. Paul in the context of discussing Patrick's life. This is not uncommon for modern historians of Late Antiquity to do this. Peter Brown very blatantly and pointedly makes sure that his readers know that in his opinion Patrick is the \\"Irish Paul.\\"The writing is accessible and is quite dynamic though not as alluring as the writing of Philip Freeman. However, while I am sure that Freeman was well researched in his book \\"St. Patrick of Ireland\\" he includes no sources or citations. O'Loughlin handles this professionally and includes the voluminous material that he poured over to learn about Patrick which provides a student with a wealth of material. It seems that due to some of the opening of statements that O'Loughlin is a proponent of Peter Brown's interpretation of the early medieval period and his section on the dossier of a saint really sat the stage for his book.All in all, it is difficult to criticize this book and his original thought and excellence of research shines through very clearly. He makes no speculation as to what the sin of \\"Patrick's youth\\" might have been as Freeman does. He does not paint an unrealistic picture of Patrick and neither does he diminish Patrick's acheivements. One thing that I really liked about O'Loughlin the most is his overall approach to Late Antiquity. In the beginning of the book he states that studying the past is like a trip to foreign country where people do things differently there. All in all this work is well done."},{"Title":"Discovering Saint Patrick","review":"The author does a nice job of sorting thru the eveidence to reach what he thinks are the correct conclusions of Patrick's life, based on a very limited amount of evidence. he is judicious and fair. easy to read."},{"Title":"Discovering Saint Patrick","review":"O'Loughlin has produced a remarkable book upon St Patrick, included are the two authentic writings of St Patrick.

She had spent the four years with her friend and lover, Natalia Danesi Murray, in New York City while summering at Cherry Grove, Fire Island. When she returns to Paris, France, she is astonished by what she sees, learns, and knows about the war especially the trials at Nuremberg which she covered as a journalist. She writes about the horrors of the concentration camp; the life in fear that many Parisians and Europeans had to live with during the war. As good as life was before the war in beloved Paris, nothing was ever the same again after the war whether in Paris or throughout Europe. The Paris between the wars no longer exists and the American expatriates who left their native country from the Great Depression returned to their native country. Paris had to recover and it was lucky since it was not damaged as much as other parts of Europe. The devastation is unforgettable and unfathomable with death and destruction all around Europe. Janet writes about the recovery that Paris must make which is more psychological and social than anything else. By now, Janet is 52 years old upon her return and many of her friends are growing old and dying out as well. Still, Janet returns to her beloved Paris with SOlita, her longtime companion, lover and unpaid secretary in tow to continue their partnership which inspired Djuna Barnes to write them as Nip and Tuck."},{"Title":"Paris journal,","review":"Flanner (nom de plume: Gent), a former New Yorker essayist and who lived in Paris for many years, describes the cultural and social life of Paris in the 40s and 50s.

It is Sinclair Lewis' nineteenth novel (some of which have bled very little), and it is one of his best. Also, in spite of being his nineteenth, it is technically advanced, and fresh in its subject matter, wise, and sincere. The old master has learned how to use words with the minimum of wastage. Gone now are the descriptive catalogues of the paraphernalia of American life, which, after the first years, grew as tiresome as Whitman's lists of occupations. Dropped now (and sometimes we miss them) are the incredibly realistic conversations, rambling on for the sake of sarcasm. So sure is the hold on the theme that the author can insert incisive narratives (a lifetime in two pages) of marital relationships which never enter into the story, but are like the symbolic paintings on the walls of palaces where Chaucer stages his stories. Yet these brief narratives are not symbolic but bitterly real, and supply without changing the focus of the novel many other tragedies and comedies of marriage being acted in Grand Republic, Minnesota, where Judge Timberlane and his Jinny played theirs with the egotism of self-centered experience. You will find in Cass Timberlane [italics] most of Sinclair Lewis' faults as an observer of life. If you go with him, you must share experience as he sees it. To certain aspects of any society he has always been, and is, insensitive. Thin-skinned himself, it is the coarse, the rough, the lacquered with insincerity that set his imagination sparking. It is reconciliation with the man at home as God chose to make him, which is his only solution--but a reconciliation not in principle but by bitter-won personal experience. No one can doubt that his America is in three dimensions, and each angle a deep one, but it is often a shocking America, healthily shocking to those who draw their judgments more from the New Testament and less from the Old than does Lewis. But you will find also a double charge of Lewis' outstanding virtues in Cass Timberlane [italics]. He is a fierce and fearless writer, who has not been afraid to make this novel of marriage an unsparing search into the sexual where it is relevant, thus writing one of the frankest books of our generation, yet without a trace of the sickly pornography of some modern realistic fiction. And he is a humorous writer, whose humor makes up for its lack of amiability by a brilliant wit for which, so it seems to me, Lewis has never had enough praise. And he is a tender writer, when the scene deserves it, which makes him deeply moving at climactic moments, because he holds tight to his sympathies until his characters have as much as they can bear. Finally, like all novelists of the first rank, he never forgets, at least in this book, that his first job is to tell a story. So much about the novel in general. The theme of the story itself is as old as the hills (like most stories). It is the tale of middle-aged Judge Timberlane, stiff, very human, incorruptible, with a zest for life, and of his love at first sight for Jinny, the light-footed girl, with black hair, and a sprightly eye, and a quick intelligence. But it is still more a story of the adjustment of experience to inexperience. For the judge has had one marriage, with a selfish waster, and his heart is full of romantic ideals suppressed by a disillusioning experience. And his girl, Jinny, is like a child asked to go on a diet before she has tasted the foods on a normal table. This oversimplifies, but it is the center of the story. The older man puts everything he has into his marriage, and his unswerving and uncritical love for his wife makes her (which is not usually true of Lewis' women) as charming and as companionable and as desirable as he thinks. But he is daily, hourly afraid that he cannot give enough, that there are experiences he is making impossible for her. He is afraid of her, and he is right. It is a 'heel,' a professional seducer of women needing relief from their husbands--and Cass' best friend--who is the serpent in this near-tragedy. He is a man who could feel like a woman, give her what she really wanted which was a chance to give all herself, not to be protected, or too much loved. And it was not until the selfish Jinny (as a man would write) had given to the wrong man that he became wrong for her, and she could come back to an equality of love. In spite of Jinny's charm and the likable qualities of two other women (and one female cat) in this narrative, Cass Timberlane [italics] is one of the most devastating attacks on women in American society that I have ever read. The men range all the way from scabrous immortality to vulgar coarseness, pitiable weakness, or sins and virtues so dull and commonplace as to take them out of sympathy. But the women--drunkards, lecherous, avaricious, unscrupulous parasites upon their men whom they ruin, spiritual murderers, loud vulgarians--if they were not so specialized they would be terrifying. And indeed, the verdict of this book and the knife of its satire, is that American men, excepting the 'wolves,' the scoundrels, the 'heels,' and the perverted, are afraid of their wives, and that is the chief trouble with what we call typical American society. Nevertheless, if often horrifying and sometimes painful, and certainly not always fair, this is not a cynical story, if only because Cass and Jinny, for whom after all it was written, are rare human beings that any discriminating person would wish to have as friends.--Henry Seidel Canby\\""},{"Title":"The Good Corporate Citizen: A Practical Guide","review":"Every executive and business owner should read this book!

In his research he cleverly discovered that V.I. Lenin, James Joyce (then young and in the midst of writing Ulysses), and Tristan Tzara, one of the leaders of the dadist movement, were living in Zurich simultaneously. Teamed up with Gwendolen and Cecily, two characters from Oscar Wilde's &quot;The Importance of Being Ernest&quot;, and Henry Carr, a former member of the British Counsular Service, Stoppard wrote a theoretical account of their interactions in 1917. The result is &quot;Travasties&quot;, a wildly intelligent and humorous play.The play is set in the faulty memory of Henry Carr as he reminices about his experiences in Zurich (yes, he was there too) during &quot;The Great War&quot;. As it was, Henry Carr, a non-fictional historical figure, played the role of Algernon in &quot;The Importance of Being Ernest&quot; in a play company owned by James Joyce. When James Joyce refused to reimburse Carr for the few hundred pounds he spent on his trousers in his overzealous attempt to &quot;become&quot; Algernon, a lawsuit ensued, which Joyce ultimately won. Indeed, Joyce indeed attained total victory by writing Carr into Ulysses as a drunken soldier. So, as one might imagine, the play is full of small stabs at James Joyce, namely by the elder Carr (at present during the play it is 1972).The integration of Lenin and his wife, as well as Cecily, Gwendolen and Tzara, is fantastic and extremely immaginative, and the experience would, no doubt, be enhanced by first reading all of the works alluded to in the play.Despite Tom Stoppard's obvious attempt to promote his own genius in &quot;Travasties&quot;, the outcome is so fantastic, so interesting, and so, honestly, funny, that all is forgiven. Travasties is 71 pages long, and a reasonably quick read... spend one afternoon curled up with it, see it if you can, and muse over the connections (but not too loudly with the &quot;aha!&quot;s) you find... and I hate to end a review so blandly, but enjoy."},{"Title":"Travesties","review":"A witty and comic two-act play involving characters from history: Lenin, the leader of the Russian Communist Revolution; James Joyce, an Irish poet; Tristan Tzara, the Romanian founder of Dada; and Henry Carr, a man who had associations with Joyce. The play is told from Carr's point of view when he is an old man, and because memory often fails him in his old age, he has to retell certain parts, meaning that we get to see different reenactments of the same scene. Although it may sound repetitive, it not in the least dull, as each retelling is a little bit different. We see Carr's confusion as he struggles to retell the past correctly. Highly amusing. It helps to have some historical knowledge of Stoppard's characters in order to find the humor in the play."},{"Title":"Travesties","review":"This is probably my favorite Stoppard play. Everything about it is raised to such a level of excellence that it's difficult to imagine how it can be surpassed.Stoppard showcases his linguistic talents at their most dazzling and expects the reader to keep up intellectually. Not to sound daunting, but in order to enjoy &quot;Travesties&quot; properly, it helps to know some rudimentary German, French, and Russian; be well familiar with Wilde's &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; and James Joyce's &quot;Ulysses&quot;; and also to have a good factual knowledge of the Great War and the Great October Revolution. If you do not have this background knowledge, you risk missing out on most of Stoppard's witty insight and leaving the theatre/closing the book confused and disappointed.The most important thing to remember about Travesties is that it is essentially Stoppard arguing with himself. This really shines through in his &quot;derailed&quot; scenes, where the characters have to abort a scene half-way through because it's obviously going in a wrong direction. Basically, it starts out with the characters being themselves, but as it progresses, one can see that they are simply two sides of Stoppard's own mind speaking to the audience through masks. And then it's as if the author remembers to keep his distance from the audience and steps back into the shadows. The effect is rather mystical; it's as if we are granted a brief glimpse beyond the fabric of what we take to be reality. What remains unclear is whether we are now looking into the &quot;true&quot; reality or yet another scene setting.In short, buy the book, read it outloud, amuse yourself, alarm your neighbors."},{"Title":"Travesties","review":"Zurich 1917, a marvellous subject. The meeting point of the Bolsheviks and other revolutionaries on one side, and of the new revolutionary artists, be they James Joyce and the stream of consciousness writers, or Tristan Tzara and the Dada movement.The first interest of the play is to situate the dynamic of each revolutionary movement very well. Lenin is the figurehead of the revolutionary politicians, James Joyce and Tzara of the modern literature movements.Then Stoppard makes them meet. In Zurich it is more or less an artificial meeting though they share most of their ideas (the files that are unknowingly exchanged at the beginning and exchanged back at the end show how identical their ideas are) and yet they have styles, general postures that make them unable to have a real dialogue.Tom Stoppard goes even further by tracing along Lenin's positions on art. He shows the perfect contradiction contained - as Walt Whitman would say - by the man. On one side (Tolstoy), he understands that a work of art is a reflection (hence not a purely identical image) of social contradictions and therefore of society, and also a reflection of the contradictory artist (all artists contain contradictions) and his contradictory position in society (hence in the social contradictions of this society). On the other side, once in power, he condemns, at first, then wavers on the subject, Mayakovsky and the Futurist mocement, and definitely considers intellectuals as bourgeois individualists. But the artists of 1917 represent exactly a similar contradiction between the absolutely nihilistic approach of the Dada movement, and the mentally realistic movement represented by James Joyce. The former rejects all heritage. The latter rearranges the full heritage within a modern man's consciousness, hence within a revolutionary or disturbing consciousness.The play is at times funny, at times realistic, at times dramatic, according to the points of view, but the essential one of these is the recollections two (minor) characters have of the period sixty years later. We are forced to accept that historical perspective : what it was then and what we can do of it now.The conclusion of the play is typical perpetual movement, here perpetual syllogism : Firstly, you're either a revolutionary or you're not, and if you're not you might as well be an artist as anything else. Secondly, if you can't be an artist, you might as well be a revolutionary... I forget the third thing. Unfinished of course, like any historical achievement. History is always unfinished, in spite of Marx's dream of a contradiction-free communist society. This is the biggest sham of western philosophy ever dreamed of by a man of the amplitude and intensity of Karl Marx. You can be a genius but reality is more real than philosophy. The proof, as Marx liked to say, of the pudding is in my eating it. Full stop. Period.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Travesties","review":"Stoppard has a talent for the madcap, but we don't get too much of it these days. Why, I can't say. \\"Travesties\\" blew people away when it appeared more than twenty years ago. It is one of the fastest plays of the century, simply flying by as a sit-down read or in production. He has slowed considerably, in more ways than one. There was a time there when every single play of his was declared a work of genius, but now we can see more objectively that this is probably his best. His singular use of language is on display here as is his electrifying wit. Wilde comes to mind, but Stoppard lacks his anger and therefore his capacity for delivering fatal blows. Stoppard is, in essence, a 'happy' playwright, so one doesn't get that Wildean archness. We see traces of Wilde in Coward and Pinter, perhaps even in the American Albee. Stoppard, however, is not by birth an Englishman and therefore brings ideas to his work that our Anglo-culture often avoids. A conservative, Stoppard knows first-hand the terrors of Eastern European tyranny and has not shopped in the fashionably Marxist side of town that David Hare, for example, prefers. He's not out to denounce anything other than the commonplace."},{"Title":"Travesties","review":"i spent over 2 months working as assistant director of this play and it took my the entire course of which to believe that i had understood all of the jokes. Of course i then went on to read more of Joyce and Wilde and the play took on whole new volumes of meaning. Its that complex. Another review advised to curl up with it for an afternoon...fun, perhaps, but not nearly as rewarding as it could be having done the background needed to get this play. &quot;Halfway to Finland Station with V.I. Lenin&quot; seriosly folks, how many of us would get that reference off the bat? still, diffilculty aside, this play is so amazing and funny that one can spend the entire time chuckling with only the most cursorary of readings/viewings. There is an absolutly fantastic scene done entirely in limerick form where Stoppard stretches his poetic legs (which prove to be quite well muscled). Acadamians and ignoramouses alike, READ IT! IT WILL BLOW YOU AWAY!"},{"Title":"Travesties","review":"TRAVESTIES, by Tom Stoppard is witty, funny, moving, and thought provoking. Stoppard has taken an historical coincidence - in 1917 James Joyce, Tristan Zara, Lenin, and several Brits were living in Zurich, while WW I ragedaround them - and has imagined an engaging collision, indeed intense explosion, of these characters and their vivid and opposing ideas of what art should be, while extrapolating and interweaving ideas and characters from Oscar Wilde's THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST, that Joyce in fact produced during that time in Zurich. The production I saw, directed enthrallingly by Sam Buntrock, delivered as intense and energetic a first act as I have ever seen. But merely reading the play is amusingly rich with the characters and ideas they voice, and reading it allows a review of those ideas that a production as alive and kinetic as Buntrock's is almost too fast and tightly packed to fully absorb. Although copyrighted in 1975, the play and its historically based characters feel as alive and relevant as any today; that is to say the themes are timeless."},{"Title":"Travesties","review":"Stoppard's comedy for intellectuals featuring War Time Zurich to where heavy-weight intellectuals in Europe fled and incubated their respective ideals and beliefs. The play featured personal conflict between a minor figure, player Henry Carr and prominent writer and businessman James Joyce. With the Oscar Wilde's play \\"The importance of Being Ernest\\" played both on stage and in real life Zurich, thus involving the Bolshevik revolutionary Lenin and painter/artist Tzara. The former's manifesto was presented with rather lengthy soliloquy, a bit didactic at times, but not without its comic elements. The latter's anti-rationalist Dadaism was portrayed in a most funny way with mistaken identity directly from Wilde's play. It would be interesting to note that Wilde's Importance was actually inspired by Shakespeare's play the Comedy of Errors.Stoppard however has not exhausted most prominent intellectuals then in Zurich. In particular Carl Jung. Joyce was familiar with Jung who later treated, unsuccessful, the schizophrenia of Joyce's daughter (later institutionalized for life). Jung had earlier written a hostile analysis of Ulysses, and Joyce was left bitter at Jung's analysis of his daughter. He paid back in Finnegans Wake, joking with Jung's concepts of Animus and Anima. Incidentally Joyce wrote Carr as a drunken soldier in Ulysses, a warning for common folks who might be tempted to argue with great writers!A highly readable comedy of Stoppard."},{"Title":"Count on Golf","review":"I bought this book a few years ago for my daughter and it has become a family favorite.

It has a lot of precise, exacting descriptions of 100 historically important Greek coins. 100 coins are described in 170 pages of text and there are 13 pages of B&amp;W plates in the back that illustrate them. The book does contain a fair number of references to older books that are long out of print and I'm sure collectible in their own right and the book does sort of presume the reader can read Greek alphabet characters. But it must be remembered that this book was written at the beginning of the 20th century and it had a limited and scholarly audience in mind.All that said, this book is a nice inexpensive overview to a nice selection of 100 significant coins. The beginner may find the references to now unknown works and quotes in dead languages a bit cumbersome at the outset but may find it gratifying that there is a lot of technical info about size and weight of the coins in it. With the current concern about modern fakes, this is good information to have. This is the kind of book that proves to be more valuable in the rereading than in the initial reading as all the data sinks in and assimilates in the collector's head and begins to work like a subconscious database as time goes on.I recommend this book to the advanced beginner or beyond who has at least a little working knowledge of the technical jargon of the hobby and who wants to go a little deeper now. What will also make this book rewarding is that Sir Hill was not afraid to think out loud in print and raises some interesting questions from time to time. Since Sir Hill did this and time has passed, it gives the reader the chance to try to play detective and answer some of Hill's questions. For example - did Gelon pay for the building of the temples of Demeter and Kore by melting down the loot from Carthage and turning it into coined money? Sir Hill could have worked for Scotland Yard!This book is valuable too for while it is not a history of how the various standard weights evolved, it covers much of that ground. I know for many this alone may make the book interesting and recommend it for the reading and rereading."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I bought this book when I was 17 in the mid 1990 when I was looking for some change, thankfully I received a major turnaround. At that time I was struggling through college, repeating accounting to improve my GPA. My college at that time didn't allow me to take other subjects because of low GPA. I read this book to learn about relationship, then read other books he authored. The change made me shift to postive thinking as a way of life.Let me summarize what happened since then:I was able to score A's in almost all accounting, management and finance subjects. Made my GPA from below 3 to more than 3.5 out of 4 and was awarded for this achievement. ALso, was able to secure a great job.Applying the same principles I even succeeded in my career path, where I was able to be a Certified Public Accountant(CPA)(scoring 90 in accounting part that I used to struggle with in college), and Certfied Information Systems Auditor(CISA). Both qualification passed from first attempt!In my career I was able to more than trippled my income in five years. Mostly from applying principles of how to deal with people positively and sincerely.The above are the results from the author's excellent advice that if followed sincerely would most probably achieve excellent results. The earlier the change the better.One main thing I learned, if you want to change things around you, you must start with yourself.His work has inspired me, and I wish it does the same(if not more) to each reader's life. Thank you Dale Carnegie, your memories still live in many people's heart because of your timeless work."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This book is a timeless classic that teaches people how to get along in both social and business environments. One of Carnegie's messages I will never forget was his answer to the question: How do you buy a gift for the man who has everything? According to Carnegie, forget the gift for the man and buy a gift for his wife. The first time I used this technique I convinced the office staff to purchase flowers for the boss's wife instead of the tired old plaque for his over crowded wall. The next day the boss sent thank you letters to every one, expressing how surprised and elated his wife was. That simple gesture paid dividends. Before you write Carnegie's ideas off as schmoozing and patronizing, please read him for yourself. This book has survived the test of time because the author teaches sincerity and high ethical standards as the bedrock to success.Also, don't be distracted by the 1931 copyright on this book. Sharing the credit for a job well done and accepting blame where you are at fault is as valuable today as it was 73 years ago. Buy and read this book, it is a part of our cultural literacy and you don't want to be left behind."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This book really stresses mainly on the psychology of people and how we interact and respond to each other. This will give you the knowledge how to improve in business relationships, improve yourself as a whole person or to manage people in general.Some of the theory described is how we should remember others' names, talk in terms of their interests, let the other person think the idea is his, and most importantly always allow the other person to save face. Promoting understanding other peoples behavior and this may have very positive effect of reducing day-to-day conflict.Some of the book may come off as Phony, but I think it is how you read it. You are not being phony if you apply this in your life if you truly do care about other people. I have heard a lot about this book and read all the reviews. This is certainly a book that you cannot take what other people have to say, you need to read it and then judge for yourself."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"In business, those who are the most &quot;emotionally&quot; intelligent always rise to the top. Why is that?As a management consultant, I am always asking our clients and potential clients what their major issues are. It almost always boils down to persuading someone else to change. In many situations, the person describes the situation as getting worse rather than better.As I ask more questions, I soon learn that the person I am talking to is totally thinking about the issue from her or his perspective, not the perspective of the person they want to influence. Carnegie describes a situation where he and his son couldn't get a calf into the barn. They pushed and pulled, and nothing worked. A maid came out, stuck her finger into the calf's mouth to simulate feeding and the calf followed her right into the barn.As you can tell from that example, Carnegie is a student of the stimulus-response school of human behavior. The book is divided into four sections: Handling People; Getting People to Like You; Getting People to Agree with You; and Being a Leader. Each section is comprised of a few principles, which are each exemplified in a short chapter with a number of examples. Handling people has to do with avoiding the negative and unpleasant, appreciating the other person, and making the other person eager to accomplish some goal of their own.Each section follows the same format. Basically, it's the same way that you train any living being. You provide positive feedback to the person which makes them feel better, the person responds positively to you making you feel better, you then help the other person to link what you want to share with them with something they want.Many people will be offended by this idea. I have long studied that reaction and find that it relates to one of two basic assumptions: (1) the decision to act should be based on the objective merits (if I deal with emotions, I am being manipulative) or (2) I want you to acknowledge that I am right, that you are wrong, and that I am superior to you because I am right. Both of those perspectives get in the way of establishing warm human relationships. If you would rather do things without emotion, your life will be very dull. If you would always like to be right, you will be very lonely (even if you really are right).Let's look at a more fundamental question. Can these techniques be used for questionable purpoes? Probably, is my answer. However, at some point, the person's manipulative game will be found out. See Robert Cialdini's book, Influence, on what happens to smugglers of influence over time.The best results will come from those who have integrity and are principled. They and everyone else can see that they are pursuing something with another person that is in the best interests of that person, and that there are no hidden agendas. Here is where I think Carnegie is a little weak. You get the impression from the book that hidden agendas are okay. My experience is that all agendas should be totally upfront. Don't pretend you are trying to help someone, when all you are trying to do is sell them something they don't need. Do encourage them to get the information they need to make a good decision for themselves about your idea, product, or service. Leave the whole circumstance with a stronger, more trustworthy relationship than you started with. That's how I interpret the Dale Carnegie principles.If you really would like to get better results in your human relationships, this book is essential reading. To skip this book would be like skipping reading and arithmetic in grade school. It contains essential tools that everyone needs to understand. Since these things are seldom taught in schools, this is a good place to start.Modern gurus of human relationships and effectiveness like Stephen Covey and Tony Robbins have a substantial debt to Dale Carnegie. If you read all of them, you will tend to reinforce your new habits. I like the Covey and Robbins approaches as a complement to Carnegie, because both authors focus on having principles at the center of what you do. That will help reduce the risk of turning Carnegie into techniques that lead to suboptimal results, instead of a mutually reinforcing virtuous cycle for everyone.Researchers consistently show that success in many fields (such as business, politics, and teaching) is very closely related to one's social skills. Many people will work very hard to be more successful, but skimp on the relationship aspects. That's a mistake. Work on the relationships first.I also recommend Daniel Goleman's &quot;Working with Emotional Intelligence&quot; to understand these concepts and the new book, &quot;NLP Masterclass,&quot; to help you extend these lessons with specific skills.Enjoy having easier interactions with others, having more friends, being more influential on important subjects, being more open to being influenced by others, and leading where it needs doing!After you finish reading this book, think about where you are trying to pull a calf where you want the calf to go."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"It is amazing how long \\"How to Win Friends & Influence People\\" has been around. Originally written in the 30's, the ideas in this book spans decades. The author, Dale Carnegie, speaks about truly listening to people and to listen to what they have to say from their point of view. This alone may easily prove to be one of the stepping stones of someone's career.The key to success in relationships which is what this books is about is to take the attention off yourself and be sincerely interested in the people you are communicating with. This pulls you into the current moment so you can be of service to whomever you are with and be available to what needs to get done. I recommend this book.Two additional books that flow in the same stream as this book are from the authors Ariel and Shya Kane. \\"Working on Yourself Doesn't Work\\" and \\"How to Create A Magical Relationship.\\" These books are about living in the moment, taking the attention off of yourself, off of your imperfections and turn your attention to what is in front of you. To put your attention on who is in front of you, so that you can take care of and be of service to the people around you. This world consists of people rushing around living their lives always trying to get ahead.

I can't help but be struck by how simple minded many of the negative comments about the book are. What they don't understand is that the vast majority of people are motivated by the desire to be appreciated. Because we are all so consumed with our own desire to be appreciated we often miss that elementry fact. The principles of this book are simple, but their implications are complex. Therefore, its occasional simplicity could never deminish its greatness. It seems to me that those who hold negative comments about this book felt as though they were being tricked. Remember, Dale teaches that we should communicate &quot;honest, sincere&quot; appreciation and admiration of others. Phoney is phoney whether it is in 1937 or 1997. Dale would never advocate the use of untruths in winning friends. People are not stupid, simply naturally motivated a few common factors. Some readers became defensive believing that they are to smart to fall for these techniques. But, you see, they are caught up in their own sense of selfworth, their own sense of importance. What a shame that the brilliance of the book was lost on them. Other readers had the ability to recognize that they were also motivated by a desire to be appreciated. Those are the readers who have changed the way they see human interaction. Man is a complex animal filled with instinct and the ability to reason. There are certain situations that cause the vast majority of people to react in the same manner- this is instinct. A perfect example is a smile from another. Your first impression of that person is that he is friendly. This thought is involuntary. That fact that we all respond positively to a smile does not mean that we are being tricked. We are simply receiving the nourishment that we crave. Still don't believe me. Imagine this situation honestly. You have always believed that Tom from work is an ass. But yesterday you had a conversation with you best friend from work when the subject of Tom came up. Your friend says to you, &quot;Well, I don't know what you've done to Tom to make him think you are so great, but earlier today he told me that you are the most valuable employee in the company and that your integrity as a human being is unmatched&quot;. What do you think about Tom now? You can't help but to like him can you? I would like him. Why? My new openion of him is involuntary. I think I am important and deserving of recognition just like every other human being on the planet, and he gave me what I craved just like every other human being, honest sincere appreciation. If you liked the book, read it again. If you didn't like it, read it again. Otherwise, you will be doomed to wallow in your own ignorance of human relations forever.Aaron J. Ruckman"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"TWO SIDES TO THE COIN:The book says to see things from other people's point of view, and to find out more about them. I tried this, and I did feel closer to people who talked to me about their personal history, but then logically this must go both ways. If you have said nothing about your own interests to the other person, then how can they feel also close to you? If you have said nothing about yourself then, then you are still just a stranger to them.IT PORTRAYS AN IDEAL WORLD:In real life, I have never met one person who displays all the characteristics mentioned in the book. In the real world, nobody is capable of dealing with humans perfectly all the time.The world is full of brash, assertive people who state their opinions, who do not try to be everybody's friend and do not always sugar-coat the truth. (Hint, they're probably your managers ;-) ). Contrary to what this book says, such people usually have plenty of friends and are very influential and respected.The truth about life, is that you can't avoid unintentionally offending people, as people are affected by so many different things. Some people will never like you, no matter how hard you try. If you doubt this, try sucking up to everyone you meet for the next week, and watch what happens.LYING TO OTHERS:There's a bit in the book about a conversation at a party where a quotation from a book was questioned on its authenticity. Rather than simply tell the truth and actually let the facts be known, it is stated that it is better to keep quiet (passive lying) so as not to let the other person be seen to be wrong!! But what will happen when the other person finds out that they were wrong, and that you had the knowledge to give them the correct answer?Not speaking up about what you know to be the truth is abhorrent, especially on critically important matters. If it offends the other person then that's just the way it has to be. Imagine a doctor not telling a patient he has cancer, because the patient might not like it. Look at what happened with Enron, only when the truth was told were matters finally bought to justice. Hiding other people's critical mistakes is not good, or clever in the long run.ADVOCATES BEING A DOORMAT:Carnegie says, be nice to everyone. In reality there are many times when you need to stand up for your rights because being nice will not solve all matters. For example, if you are being bullied at school or at the workplace you have to assert your rights in every way you can. There are many recent cases of people winning compensation for suffering acts of discrimination at the workplace. These are people who went against Carnegies advice, who would not accept abusive treatment, and stood up for themselves, to a positive result.Many people will blatantly abuse niceness. The truth is, that in the real world of today, too much kindness is taken as a sign of weakness and those who try to win friends and influence people in the way Carnegie recommends, all too often end up used and abused.Carnegies advice has the potential to turn people into passive \\"doormats\\" who think everyone else is always right, and that they themselves are always wrong. The reality is, that to be effective in human interactions, people need to give their own opinions, and state their own truth, even if it offends others. Effective communicators accept that they will never be friends with everyone. People who behave assertively, who speak up for what they believe in, and do not quietly sit back and let other people walk all over them, blatantly rise to the top in most social situations and ironically have many friends and influence many people. Doormats are notoriously ineffective in winning friends and influencing people.A valuable social skill is asserting yourself. People want to know what you think. They don't want their own words regurgitated and spat back at them by a shallow, sycophantic liar.Think of all the people you know who are assertive and who speak up for their beliefs and their rights. Such people usually have more than enough friends. Ironically, it is the nice person who wants to be everyone's friend, who never seems to have many. The truth is, that people will not automatically hate you just because you state your own opinions, or because you say something contrary to what they are saying.CONCLUSION:There are good things about the book, specifically that people like it when others take time to listen and respect their opinions, but this obviously has to work both ways. This book was probably more useful in the good old days, when it was first published.If you spend your whole life being nice to people and suppressing your own opinions, even when you know full well at times, that it is unjustified, you will regret it. Life does not work that way. There are many, many circumstances in dealing with people, where niceness is not an option. Speak up for yourself and for what you believe in, even if it has the potential to offend others.

It has the charm of an old-fashioned expos&eacute; complete with introductions, examples that illustrate the ideas and boxed-in conclusions. The teacher in me loves it.The book is about developing skills to become an effective communicator. Dale Carnegie obviously has a very deep understanding of human psychology and although the tips sound simple, they are essential. Two recommendations stood out for me. One says that in order to be effective dealing with people, it is important to get interested in others and listen to them from their point of view . The other says it is more effective to praise others for what they do well than to criticize them for what they do poorly or in other words making people wrong and working on them does not work .These two ideas are central to the book Working on Yourself doesn't Work by Ariel and Shya Kane. In this book the authors also show that there is nothing to gain in judging and berating others and ourselves. They suggest that as we develop awareness of how we automatically judge and criticize, an opportunity opens up to transform and access personal power and enlightenment. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to increase personal effectiveness and discover enlightenment."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I originally read this book in my teenage years. I had forgotten what a gem it was until a ordered a new copy for our teen. I started leafing through it and was reminded what a useful and formative book it is. The major message of this book is \\"it's not all about you.\\" This classic continues to stand the test of time and should be on every young person's reading list. Less \\"me\\" and more \\"we\\" would be a good thing in our society.

Mr. Buffett had countless friends and influenced as many people as anyone in his lifetime, so I had to read it. I was not disappointed, this book has the eloquent writing style that was prominent in the 1930's (the first edition was written in 1936)very charming and well written, it is a delight to read. I really wished I would have read this book twenty years ago. I would have had a much smoother journey through my business career and personal relationships, but alas later is better than never and I look forward to putting what I learned in place for the next fifty years.Hear is how you win people to your way of thinking in a nutshell. How do you get the best of an argument? Avoid them at all costs, they are not worth the price. Always show respect for others opinions. Never, ever, say \\"You are wrong.\\" This gains you nothing. If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically. This is biblical from the mouth of Jesus, no less. Begin all encounters with people in a friendly way. Always get the other person saying yes, by finding common ground. Let the other person do a great deal of the talking, this is perceived as having great listening skills. Let the other person feel that the idea that you are presenting is his or hers. This is a skill. It is crucial to honestly see things from the other person's point of view. Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires. Appeal to the nobler motives. Dramatize your ideas to make them unforgettable and convincing. Throw down a challenge, something for the other person to live up to. This appeals to the ego and desire to be important.A leader's job includes changing people's attitudes and behavior. Here is how to be a leader in a nutshell. Always begin with praise and honest appreciation. Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly and very discreetly. Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person. Ask questions instead of giving direct orders. Let the other person save face, give them a way out. Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise. Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to. Use encouragement to get results. Make any fault seem easy to correct. Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.This is an excellent book within the realm of learning, developing, and using people skills. So many of us lack this level of tact and finesse, most of us would do well to read this book and put its principles into action. I believe all readers will get the money spent on this book back a thousand times over in the value it adds to your life if you put these principles in action and refer back to it before important conversations take place in your life. I give this book five stars and two thumbs up."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"The book arrived quickly.

I have the CD's for &quot;How to Stop Worrying and Start Living&quot;. I've read this book three times. I just can't do it anymore. It's dishonest. Carnegie would tell me that praise IS honest if you just focus your compliment on something true. Like telling a woman that she has beautiful eyes when she is also nasty and mean. Or telling your friend that he has a great sense of humor when he is demonical and selfish. The Tibetan Buddhists state that &quot;Praise Kills&quot;. This means that you will create massive &quot;attachments&quot; to people. This may be good in sales or politics. But it is very subtlely manipulative. I know that the person who is reading this is highly intelligent. Otherwise, why would they be reading a review on Amazon.com?

The problem here is: the main argument of this book is absolutely false, wrong and incorrect!Carnegie noticed that many people didn't like to be criticized. And erroneously concluded that all we have to do is:stop criticizing, and he thought that he made the greatest discovery of all time. So he wrote this book and saw himself get rich and famous all around the world. Ok, it wasn't his fault, he didn't have any idea that those people he uses as example were all \\"psychopaths\\", the worst class of humans. They didn't like to be criticized just because they coudn't discern they were guilt, they didn't feel anything, they didn't have feelings, they coudn't feel because they had, like all psychopaths have, a malfunction (a damage) on their brain's frontal cortex. They have never admited guilt. They have never felt any remorse, simply because they can't!So this book is a complete apology of psychopaths!Nowadays, with specific knowledge modern medicine developed about psychopaths, specialists like Dr. Robert Hare have written that if you have never criticized your son, you can induce a quasi-psychopath behaviour on him, and terrible consequences will be felt by you, and by people with bad luck of crossing his path in this life. Even in professional environment, specialists changed their vision completely, What they considered wrong like criticizing management policies for example , nowadays they've said that criticizing is important to correct wrong decisions on time.I have this book as a relic of the past, but I know that it is completely dated, the main argument is completely wrong and is dangerous to society in general.Obviously we should avoid excesses like criticizing all the time for example, but remember that, all excesses are wrong from the beginning."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I didn't find the book useful because the info is nothing new, it is just written in a grand style using famous people and much embellishment.

But I'd recommend a modern day book by Ben Stein or others that is lighter and more fun to read.Whoever criticized the book for being manipulative -- you didn't read the book. The author states the points must come from the heart (an attitude adjustment) and not superficial comments to accomplish what you want.Whoever called the book a classic, give me a break.p.s.

Our modern society is suspicious of transparent persuasion. The environment of sales and matters of business rewards experienced suspicion.

They are not black and white. They are complex. Most of all, maneuvering your intensions against all-too-often misjudged motivations will show a grave misunderstanding of human behavior, much less be successful. SUGGESTION: Recognize that individuals are more complex.3. I can respect that this may be outside the scope of this book, but there are no cultural considerations. We live in larger, more diverse world with vast levels of communication. Social, political, business, and racial cultural considerations (motivations) must govern over the form, content, and context of human relations. SUGGESTION: Recognize cultural considerations.4. The narrative style of this book is counter productive. Spoon feeding tailor made anecdotes and cute stories is insulting. A more mature and sophisticated format would be more effective.

With over 400 reviews on Amazon, with over 15 million copies sold, and with a very self-explanatory title, I think you all get it. For the rare person who may not know what this book is about, here's a succinct description: in 1930s vernacular prose, Dale Carnegie explains that by appealing to the other person's highest ideals, remembering the other person's name, letting the other person do most of the talking, speaking in terms of the other person's interests, allowing the other to save face, by \\"throwing down a challenge,\\" etc., you can make a friend out of just about anyone.The advice is largely sound, but I think the reader should keep in mind the context within which this book was written. \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" was written in the 1930's and intended primarily as a companion book to Dale Carnegie's classes on how to be a good salesman. In other words, these techniques work very well in the context of sales and public relations, i.e., in relationships that are not expected to be deep and/or long-lasting. I wouldn't recommend using these techniques on close personal friends. Doing so may make a person come across as a bit \\"plastic.\\"Also, there is one major point that I think needs to be remembered, but unfortunately is nowhere to be found in \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People.\\" During my research of Dale Carnegie's techniques, I came across what I believe may be the only biography available about him:Dale Carnegie: The Man Who Influenced Millionsby Giles Kemp and Edward Claflin. This book reveals many interesting things, such as the fact that Dale Carnegie grew up poor; he lost part of his left index finger when he was a child; he often broke many of the tenets set forth in this book, often forgetting others' names, often arguing with others, etc. But what I found most interesting was that the last chapter of \\"How to Win Friends\\" was to describe those individuals with whom none of Dale Carnegie's techniques work. In this unpublished chapter, Carnegie wrote that there were some people with whom it was impossible to get along. You either needed to divorce such people, \\"knock them down,\\" or sue them in court.Why is that chapter absent from this book, you ask? Well, Dale Carnegie was in the middle of writing this chapter when he was offered a trip to Europe, and rather than complete this last chapter he decided to take the trip. The uncompleted book was sent off to publishers, and Carnegie shipped off to Europe.Giles Kemp and Edward Claflin say that given the optimistic tone of the rest of \\"How to Win Friends,\\" the European trip was perhaps the better choice. Reconciling the the unwritten chapter with the rest of this optimistic book would've been nearly impossible, they say.Anyway, I think that this unpublished chapter is important to keep in mind. I had to learn the hard way that the unpublished chapter is very true. There are some people with whom it is impossible to get along. When you meet up with such people, and believe me you will, don't think that you've failed the Carnegie techniques. Instead, remind yourself that you are experiencing exactly what Carnegie describes in that pragmatic, unpublished chapter. And then quickly move on to the nicer people!"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"His advice is so obvious and so easy, so how come it's so difficult to do yourself and so rarely found in others?

By the way, I also overcame my fear of public speaking and am conducting both business presentations and trainings for my reps.The book is great. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"When I was 12 years old my best friend gave me a copy of this book and told me that I might find it interesting. He could not have been more right, for I delved deep into the book and I finished it in a matter of 2 weeks (to me it was a record to finish a book so quickly at that age!) I found the book to be very informative and entertaining at the same time. The author, Mr. Dale Carnegie, will not introduce a principle or a notion without supporting it with at least one real life story where the principle introduced was proven effective. After that point I noticed a great, almost immediate, effect on my behavior as I was growing up. I noticed that I have become a very good negotiator with my parents and teachers, more popular at school, and I even began to understand people much better than I used to prior to reading the book. I grew up believing that this book was one of the greatest factors involved in shaping my character.Recently though, I noticed some growing criticism of the book and its teaching, and I thought that this would be a good time for me to refresh what I learned from the book and assess its quality based on the experience I've gained since the first time I read the book. So I bought the unabridged audiotapes of the book and listened to it whenever I was in the car.Mr. Carnegie said somewhere in the book that if one thing you learn from the book, which is the ability to understand the different views of other people in different situations, then that would be enough. And I agree wholeheartedly.My judgment is that this book will indeed teach you how to understand the motives and the different forces playing in the different people you meet. Humans all across the globe share basic needs and characteristics that play a major role in forming their attitudes and decisions. Understanding those factors and satisfying them will be the most effective method of influence you'll ever need.Mr. Carnegie begins the book with the foundations of developing this skill of understanding others. He extends three principles that if applied will help you identify what other people want and how you can satisfy them. After that he introduces six ways to make people like you. These methods hover around the same three principles mentioned in the beginning of the book. After that the author discusses in two parts methods and principles that help you influence people to your way of thinking.All of this seems interesting but why are people criticizing this book, you wonder. The first issue with this book is the title. It says &quot;How to win friends and influence people.&quot; I would have called it &quot;How to make people like you and influence their behavior.&quot; The methods Dale introduces aren't for winning friends. You don't win friends by avoiding arguments and by projecting enthusiasm that is not honest. You'll only have them like you, but they are not won as friends, yet at least. Honesty is absent in Carnegie's teachings, and sometimes even unadvised! In one story he tells of a manager of a singer who would lie to the singer just to get him on stage!Another observation I had on the book was the relevance of some of the stories to the principle being introduced. Some of those principles would not have worked in the stories he mentioned have the circumstances been even little different! Yet Dale would acclaim the introduced principle as the reason that the story reached the happy ending it did. But, to the benefit of the author, this happened only a few times overall and it doesn't degrade the whole quality of the book.Nevertheless, the lack of emphasis on honesty is a serious issue. This has caused many reviewers to warn readers from reading this book. But here is where I disagree.You'll need to read this book to learn the methods, not just to be able to understand other people, but also to be ready when others are applying them to influence you. I'll have to agree that some of these methods are extremely powerful especially if the receiver isn't ready for them. Reading this book will make you resilient to the weapons of many unwanted salesmen and negotiators.My advice is to read but with caution. Learn the methods but always remember that honesty should always be present when these methods are being applied."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"In discussions with clients, I am becoming increasingly aware that many scientific and technical folks are being placed in leadership positions for the first time with little or no training and the most popular topic of discussion is &quot;How do I motivate people?&quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People is a great place to start. Although its title provokes images of snake oil salesmen, or Chris Farley's Saturday Night Live bit as Matt Foley, motivational speaker, the book is filled with timeless instruction written in plain language. For example, in his chapter on listening skills, Carnegie explains why listening is so important:\\"Remember that the people you are talking to are 100 times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems. Remember that a person's toothache means more to that person than a famine in China which kills a million people.\\"Although the book was originally penned in 1936, it has been updated over the years and its popularity has not diminished. It contains thirty principles of human behavior that are illustrated with copious examples. Quotations and anecdotes are included from scores of historical figures including Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, Sigmund Freud, Charles Schwab, and Confucius. I found the top ten principles to include the following:* Don't criticize, condemn, or complain.* Give honest and sincere appreciation.* Become genuinely interested in other people.* If you are wrong, admit it quickly andemphatically.* Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.* Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view* Dramatize your ideas.* Let the other person save face.* Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.* Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.If you can get past the title, I highly recommend How to Win Friends and Influence People as guidebook for motivating people."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"For those of us who work in psychology, there is often a tendency to look down on works that were created for the mainstream population.

I could not have been more wrong about a book. Although Carnegie's title is often the target of derision, it is a deceptively deep and important work. There's a very good reason why How to Win Friends... has been a bestseller for seventy years as the man shares essential truths with us about human behavior. Every single one of us can profit from his advice. His central ideas, such as that one should avoid arguments whenever possible, cannot be questioned. The command that one should listen to others and let them talk about themselves is crucial to being liked. A \\"simple\\" idea like that one is one that actually works. I'm considering putting his nine rules for effective leadership on my wall so I can remember to generate enthusiasm in others and lead by example.I was really surprised as to how much this book matters and how much I learned by reading it.

It teaches one lessons in life that are not taught at any school or university. He focuses purely on the psychology of people and how we interact and respond to one another. He has studied people such as Lincoln, Roosevelt and Charles Schwab in great depth and draws from them the very essence of what made them legendary leaders of our time. You will learn how to make people respond to you in an extremely positive and enthusiastic way. You will learn how to give praise, curb critizism and avoid arguments with your fellow man. You will learn how to influence people to your way of thinking without them realizing it. He uses numerous examples of social interactions that have occured in his and other's lives and instructs you on how you could apply them to your life. The lessons are timeless and have been in practice well before Christ.

It's about opening your eyes to reality and understanding why we make friends and have influence. When you understand this, it certainly makes making friends and having influence easier. It does not guarantee, however, that you eventually have friends and influence.Dale Carnegie's writings are fun and learnsome to read and are a really good help to anyone who wants to improve himself in having friends and influence. Let's hope I make you my friend when you read the book because of this review!"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"When building a professional reference library, you have to start from the ground up. How to Win Friends and Influence people is the definitive work on forming beneficial business relationships - and treating people with respect in the process. I own the paperback and audio version. Audio is a better format for those of us with time management issues because it allows for listening in the car or plane. No matter your profession, if you work in a professional setting, you should own this book.The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Peopleis another essential and should be in every professional's library along with a good business and social etiquette book likeBusiness Class: Etiquette Essentials for Success at Work,Essential Etiquette Fundamentals, Vol. 1: Dining Etiquette, andEssential Etiquette Fundamentals, Vol. 2: Wine Selection & Etiquette. These cover well the fundamentals of social and professional interaction."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Yes, yes, I know. The title may make Dale Carnegie's renowned self-help book on success and leadership seem a wee bit like a manual for those who hope to master the art of manipulation. Admittedly, the book is exactly that. However, the skill of manipulation Carnegie hopes to impart is not the sort of negative exploitation you may be thinking of. The ability to win friends and influence people is not a tactic used to achieve temporary personal desires or whims. Rather, Carnegie presents the ability to influence people as a positive and productive way of life: an alternative to the sort of conditioned manipulation tactics most of employ without thought or consideration. Carnegie believes that when you work with people (whether they are your boss, coworker, best friend, spouse, parent or child) there will always, eventually, be a conflict of interests and, when that conflict of interests arises, if you are to come out on top, you must make a conscious effort to act in a way that both pleases others and accomplishes your goals.Before reading the book I thought I knew the basic tactics one could adopt to persuade others and make friends easily. I doubted Carnegie would have much to say. But while Carnegie's methods for winning people over did indeed prove to be basic and common sense, they were also incredibly insightful, well researched, and helpful. By providing specific and direct solutions, Carnegie has written a book that successfully takes a broad and somewhat daunting task seem organized and achievable, though not always easy.Carnegie believes that the most basic, fundamental way to win people over is simply to consider their perspective. In Carnegie's view, man's first priority and interest is himself. Therefore, in order to make friends one needs to, at least initially, appeal to people's personal interests. Everybody wants to feel important, and the best way to make friends and influence people is, in the broadest sense, to make them feel important. This may sound like a recipe for imparting fakeness and flattery, but Carnegie is a staunch opponent of both of these. If you act out of artificial admiration or interest you will surely lose friends quicker than ever. This is what makes his basic instructions difficult to execute. Carnegie teaches that in order to make friends or lead people you must be or become genuinely interested in others. You must completely reshape your outlook and ignore reactions and responses based in your immediate emotion.Carnegie conveys these basic philosophical concepts by dividing the book into four separate sections that focus (respectively) on handling people, making people like you, winning people to your way of thinking, and being an effective leader. Rather than using philosophical fluffy talk or academic lingo to impart his wisdom, Carnegie uses solid examples to illustrate his point. As a professor who first taught these principles as a class, Carnegie has a vault full of success stories and narratives provided by his students' firsthand applications of his methods. Along with these examples, Carnegie also uses historical figures like Abraham Lincoln, John D. Rockefeller, and Napoleon to show how far a little consideration and restraint can go. The examples make up the majority of the book, with Carnegie simply giving an interpretive commentary along the way. This keeps the book interesting and keeps the principles fresh. Plus, you begin to understand Carnegie isn't just making up this stuff. You trust him and his principles.Carnegie has written a book that is easy to read and understand. Its principles apply to anyone from any sort of background with any sort of goals and aspirations. And while they are universally applicable, they are also universally necessary for a positive and productive society. If everyone was to both read this book and actually follow what it says, we'd all be happier as a whole because while Carnegie's principles teach to consider others, in doing that we are improving and enhancing our own situation and experience."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Dale Carnegie is the great-granddaddy of the sales and self-help books. This classic is still worth reading. I read somewhere that the copies of this book in the Library of Congress can only circulate for a short time because of the Representatives and Senators waiting to take it out (although I find it hard to believe that a member of Congress who desired the book would be deterred from spending less than $8.00 for his/her own copy). This book should be read, plain and simple!"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Some cynics might suggest that the world has changed too much since the 1930s for this book to still be relevant. Certainly, we live in a faster-paced, harder-edged time. But human nature hasn't really changed much in thousands of years. Many of the basic truths Carnegie offers concerning human interaction are still valid.Truth be told, a little \\"old-fashioned\\" courtesy, consideration, diligence, honesty, trustworthiness, neatness, and fairness are not just \\"Gomer Pyle\\" values, but values that would be a breath of fresh air in most corporate offices. These values--rooted out of a sincere desire to successfully serve others--will also catapult the practitioner to a level of success and prosperity. Not to mention the satisfaction and joy of a job well-done.Working with people successfully is a skill--it can be taught and mastered. In every office or work situation, we will encounter difficult or uncooperative people. (And even good people have bad days.) Carnegie's principles can help you not only win an argument, but win a person. In other words, not just the short-term fix of bullying, but the long-term fix of friendship and teamwork.Even if you disagree with some of the conclusions of the book, or with what I've written here, you owe it to yourself to read this book simply because of the amazing impact that it has made since its publication. I'm betting you won't be sorry for the time you invest in reading it."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"If you really want to learn the methodology for interacting with people, you should definetely read this book;it is the best first step along this path. I was fascinated when I first read it(half of the book was underlined:)Eventhough some people think that the techniques were outdated, I think that the concept in the book is timeless. Carnegie's sincerity and emotional intelligence are worth rereading."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"There is another reviewer here who claims that since Dale Carnegie was born with everything handed to him, his methods cannot hold much weight. This is a misunderstanding I believe based on the name \\"Carnegie.\\" I don't know if Dale is related to the famous rich family, but the biography at the end of the book clearly states that Dale Carnegie came from a poor family. His family's farming attempts was disastrous, and he grew up milking cows and feeding hogs. He had to travel to college 3 miles a day because he was one of the few who couldn't afford the $1 per day room and board. He made his way to fame purely by his own efforts and determination.I find the book full of wonderful advice that makes it a worthwhile and delightful read, and I plan on making my kids read it once a year for three years during their homeschooling. Not everyone will agree with the diplomatic approach the book advocates; I for one think that criticism I have received in the past has done lots of good overall, even though I never enjoyed it at the time. There were also many times when I received praise (sometimes undeserved), when I fell into self-satisfaction and carelessness and took a turn for the worse.Nevertheless, as long as the book is read with good sense and understanding, it is likely more effective a way of conducting one's life than the common way of criticism, condemnation, and casting blame. If read in the wrong way, however, I think it might make idiots out of people. I have heard people trying to preface their criticism of me by buttering a layer of praise on first, and I only wish that they would cut the trash and just get to the point - I can take it! And I think less of them because of it.What Dale Carnegie is pushing in his book is not just a set of instructions - it's an art form. I believe few people will be able to master it, but those who can will come out way ahead. For the rest of us, we can do well by allowing it to influence our ways rather then following it blindly and sounding like spineless, sugar-mouthed idiots."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This book, while IMHO the title can use a bit of revising, is a classic nonetheless in sharing how important it is to genuinely appreciate the other person. NOT to use or manipulate them as a means to your own selfish end, but rather to genuinely care about their interests, care about them, be a REAL friend, and what you put out will come back to you. The Key here is that your motive needs to be genuine. Carnegie stresses this in the book, which some negative reviewers seem to have glossed over.This is human nature in one of the greatest books ever written in the last century about this topic. The concepts are timeless, and they just might take you more out of self focus, to appreciate others authentically, and then you receive authentic results in return."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I am writing this review of How to Win Friends and Influence People, because I want to encourage everyone to read it. If you've already read it in the past, I would encourage you to read it over once again, as I just recently did myself.Few books that I've ever read have been of as much help to me as this one. Dale Carnegie was both an unusually intelligent, observant man and a terrific writer. Although this book is now quite old, it has easily passed the test of time and it's sage advice on how to succeed and enjoy life, is as good as ever.All of Carnegie's methods for success are built on truth, compassion, respect, reasoning, and common sense.

Do the action, but remember the principle behind it.Smiling, getting to know people, do not criticise or judge, is the &quot;how&quot;. But the &quot;why&quot; is because you love them.This book is what Stephen Covey calls the personality ethic. However, it shouldn't be discounted away. The personality &amp; character ethic go hand in hand.Character must come first; change must be internal, then change your personality on the outside to show others what is happening inside.

How to Win Friends and Influence People, gives excellent insight into what makes other people tick, and more importantly it reminds us why we tick. The advice is not complicated, but it does require practice and review. The best thing about the book is that it is full of advice that we already know, but just don't practice. A good portion of the book centers on putting yourself in someone else's shoes and seeing it from their perspective. It talks about how must people consider themselves to be honest hard working people no matter how bad or negatively society views them.It speaks about how important it is to allow people to save face in confrontations, what it means to have good manners, and a no nonsense approach to what motivates people.The information in the book is timeless and tested. It is useful not only for business, but even in your personal relationships, because it focuses on improving the communication channels between people.Arguments: Of all of the aspects of the book, the section on arguments and confrontation holds the most value. Essential the books says that you never really when an argument, because even if you are right, the other party is going to be injured, always allow the other party to save face says the book. One of the most important single paragraphs in the book is when confronted with an argument or confrontation say, \\"I maybe be wrong because I frequently am, let's exam the facts.\\" I cannot count the times this has cooled a heated discussion, chiefly because it removes any hostile edge the other party may have about you.You can't go wrong with this book.http://gaskin.dyndns.org"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This book changed my life.

My father is the landlord of an apartment in China and has a very difficult time getting his tenant to pay rental on time. He asked me to say some harsh things in a letter which will be handed to the tenant, including:1. Many Filipinos (his tenant is Filipino) are Catholics and they are honest people.2. The tenant is the only Filipino he encountered in China. (Suggesting that he is ruining his nation's reputation)3. Tell him that he breached the contract.4. Tell him that he will not have the tenancy renewed.5. Tell him that he would inform the real estate agencies about his deeds, so that he will not be able to rent a place in the neighborhood in the future.For a moment, my mind went blank. I remember how I used to shun this type of writings in the numerous English composition examinations I took. To make things worse, this is not a composition for God's sake, this is FOR REAL. It involves the tough issue of human relations. I am so lucky to have read Dale's book. I dug out some relevant principles and tried my best to apply them:1. If you really have to blame, begin with praises.2. Let the other person save face.3. Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.So I followed these principles and this is what I wrote (after doing some research in a website promoting tourism in the Philippines):Dear Sir,The Philippines is a beautiful country. It is surrounded by picturesque islands and is home to over 76 million wonderful people. Predominantly Catholics, Filipinos always impress people with their honesty, truthfulness and integrity.You are the only Filipino I encountered in China and I have no doubt that you are equally wonderful like your countrymen. Therefore, I do not blame you for occasionally overlooking the exact rental amount or its due date. I believe a little clarification on my part would suffice to clear any misunderstanding leading to the aforementioned situation.May I kindly refer you to the tenancy agreement we signed for the lease. In the contract, it is clearly stated that ...........I believe you would agree with me that Sing Ho Bay is a very nice neighbourhood perfect for decent residents like you. People in this community have close connections and rely on each other to maintain its harmony. Therefore, it is my duty, as a landlord, to invite quality tenants to join our community. I also have the responsibility to communicate effectively with my tenants to avoid any contractual disputes that would potentially disrupt the harmony we all treasured.I am sure it is only an accidental oversight on your part and I am equally sure that with this clarification, you will become the best tenant and the most wonderful Filipino I have ever met in my life.Yours faithfully,-------------------------------------------------If you find what I wrote make sense, you might want to check out my blog, which is primarily about marketing and business ideas: [...]."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Timeless truths being shared.

Enough said.Second, some people get hung up with the phrase, \\"Fundamental techniques in handling people,\\" with emphasis on the \\"technique\\" and the \\"handling.\\" to our 21st Century ear, it sounds manipulative, dehumanizing, or even Machiavellian (The Prince (Dover Thrift Editions)).Reread the story found in chapter 9. Dale complimented a man on his head of hair, who took a shine to the compliment.Dale continues:\\"I told this story once in public and a man asked me afterwards, 'What did you want to get out of him?'\\"What was I trying to get out of him!!! What was I trying to get out of him!!!\\"If we are so contemptibly selfish that we can't radiate a little happiness and pass on a bit of honest appreciation without trying to get something out of the other person in return--if our souls are no bigger than sour crab apples, we shall meet with the failure we so richly deserve. Oh yes, I did want something out of that chap. I wanted something priceless. And I got it. I got the feeling that I had done something for him without his being able to do anything whatever in return for me. That is a feeling that flows and sings in your memory lung after the incident is past.\\"This book clearly falls under what Stephen R. Covey calls the character Ethic, as opposed to the Personality Ethic in success literature (The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change). It also explains this books enduring power. It is about simple, home-town, Mayberry goodness and kindness.And it is also about managing egos, which is my third point.We all have egos,prideful egos, and it is our egos that get us in the way. We always have to be right. We always have to get our way. We always have to have the last word.And it is our egos that get in the way of dealing with people, because every other person also has an ego.And that is the rub. How does one control another person's ego all the managing ones own pushy ego. This book offers techniques--that is, patterns, skills, and, yes, habits--of human interaction. Which techniques are, in reality, swallowing one's own ego, and working with the ego-inertia of other people.Case in point--does Dale advocate lying? In chapter 10, Dale tells of a party he attended. A person said that a quote from Shakespeare was, in reality, from the Bible. It was a small error. But Dale, with a solid Hermione Granger Complex, corrected the speaker.It didn't go well, and another person at the part affirmed that the quote from the Bard was really from the Bible. As the party was breaking up, Dale asked about why the person lied about the quote.He replied, \\"' ... we were guests at a festive occasion, my dear Dale. Why prove to a man he is wrong? Is that going to make him like you? Why not let him save his face? He didn't ask for your opinion. He didn't want it. Why argue with him? Always avoid the acute angle.'\\"Again, this book is about managing egos--yours and others.\\"The man who said that taught me a lesson I'll never forget. I not only had made the storyteller uncomfortable, but had put my friend in an embarrassing situation. How much better it would have been had I not become argumentative.\\"Dale didn't lie; the guest guest did. And his point was not to lie--the mollycoddle/doormat/Wormtongue approach--but not to be argumentative. In the cosmic scheme of things, the misattribution of the quote was of no import. But taming, and eventually slaying Dales ego was the most needful thing.And that is why we should read this book. Our egos are harming, even damaging, our human relations. Not just in the workplace, where we are hurting our careers, but also in the home. Our greatest area of influence should be with our families.And our spouses should be our greatest friend."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This is one of those books that I've been meaning to read for ages, but never really got around to (until recently). Over the past several years I've seen the book mentioned countless times on a variety of websites, blogs, and even engineering forums. The overall consensus is that everyone (especially socially awkward people like me) need to read this book to help understand your fellow humans.After reading the book, I can safely say that all the praise I've heard about it is justified. Carnegie's book is definitely worth purchasing and reading at least once in your lifetime (the sooner, the better). If you're considering purchasing this book--do so immediately, and bump it to the top of your reading list. The book is immediately actionable, and creates immense value within the first few pages.I won't go into the specifics of the book here, as numerous other reviewers have already done so--instead, I'd like to comment on what the book talks about, and why it is so useful and effective.What It's All About===================\\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" discusses (through numerous examples) a series of short, memorable principles for dealing with other people. The principles are nothing complex, rather they are extremely simple. For example--one principle suggests that you listen to other people and try to understand things from their perspective. This concept sounds basic and intuitive in my text, but through Carnegie's well written examples, you learn how to truly take advantage of these principles to your benefit.The overall idea is that if you follow some (or all) of the principles outlined in the book, you'll be infinitely better at dealing with people in everyday situations--work relationships, friendships, personal relationships, etc.Are These Social \\"Hacks\\"?=========================No!I noticed when reading other reviews that lots of people say the principles outlined in the book are not genuine, and are merely creative ways to trick others into getting your way--this is completely false.The principles defined in this book are not so much conversational hacks as they are personality traits. What Carnegie is leading towards through his examples and principles is that in order to be a likable, strong, and respected person, you need to establish certain personality traits so that your conversation simply reflects your inner character.The concept is that most people respect others who:- Are humble.- Are good listeners.- Have strong conviction and purpose.- Understand pride.- Are friendly and trusting.- Use positive reinforcement to build positive actions.So in essence, by establishing these personality traits in yourself (it's not as hard as you think), you can generally leave a favorable impression of yourself with others, and build strong, lasting relationships.How to Use This Book====================In order to get the most out of the book, I suggest you read it all the way through, and write down the principles as you read. As you read through the examples, you'll come to fully understand the principles being discussed, and see how and why these things work the way the do, and why they are such powerful traits to have.To start implementing these changes in your daily life--just take it one step at a time. More important than anything else: keep an open mind when talking with others, and remain calm at all times. Carefully think about the conversations you have with others, and try to listen before speaking. If you do that, you'll be able to gradually build up your social skills and build the personality traits in yourself that will make you a person of character and integrity.Remember that the principles in the book should be implemented as personality changes--not simply conversational hacks--they will not work in that regard.Final Thoughts==============This is an excellent book which really explains in great detail how to get along with other people. The principles discussed are simple, effective, and valuable in any situation."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"' Fundamental Techniques in Handling People1.

Every technique is dependent on the type of situation that confronts the individual. Bear in mind that whenever a situation arises we must be rational and critical analysts of ourselves and of others. A sound and focused mind must always be present when conducting or applying the following techniques in handling other people. These three techniques are:1. Don't criticize, condemn or complain.2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.3.Arouse in the other person an eager want.There are six, very simple ways to make people like you. Most of these principles are often overlooked in our everyday dealings with others. When people begin to like you, having conversations and making favors will be much easier to deal with. By applying and mastering these six ways, you will be astonished by the excellent results.1. Become genuinely interested in other people.2. Smile.3. Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.4. Be a good listener.5. Talk in terms of the other person's interests.6. Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely.It is a fact: people like to get things their way. Being insensitive as to how messages are delivered always gets negative results. No matter how well people feel about themselves, they still can't get away with the fact that others may feel hurt or depressed due to their lack of concern regarding other's feelings. Avoid being self-centered during discussions or dialogues to safely cross the boundary of expression. Exaggerate your ideas and make people believe that it is for the good of all. It is the stepping stone in making these twelve principles effective and successful.1. The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.2. Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, \\"You're wrong\\".3. If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.4. Begin in a friendly way.5. Get the other person saying, \\"yes, yes\\" immediately.6. Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.7. Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.8. Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view.9. Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires.10. Appeal to the nobler motives.11. Dramatize your ideas.12. Throw down a challenge.The leader is a major pillar in a successful company. Part of his job is to make sure everybody does their job well. Another responsibility a leader has is to change work attitudes to everyone's advantage. The author stated nine principles to aid the leader in becoming effective and successful in these endeavors.1. Begin with praise and honest appreciation.2. Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly.3. Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.4. Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.5. Let the other person save face.6. Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be \\"hearty in yourapprobation; and lavish in your praise.\\"7. Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.8. Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.9. Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.A timeless classic for everyone. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I purchased this book the other day, I haven't finished reading it yet, but I wanted to warn future purchasers.

If understood and applied, it will improve any human relationship one has. It is really that simple. I don't care who you are, or how successful you may be, you will benefit. It is that good. READ IT! More on my review: This book is definitely, and certainly one, of the best books ever written. Why it doesn't get more coverage? Most likely is due to the fact that it is just too useful. Mordern trains of thought, promoted by the mental health industry and the public school system, insists that you never take responsibility for your life and communication. This book teaches the opposit and does not sit well with the, \\"Blame anyone but yourself\\" crowd. It is the best interpersonal relations book you will ever read, or need. All the others are \\"want to be after thoughts.\\" After decades it is still completely useful advice. Keep in mind that it was first published in 1936 so some of the stories are dated, but still very instructional. VERY! This edition combines another Dale book about \\"worry.\\" Several of my staffs and friends fond it extremely useful. I recommend this edition because you get both books. YOU WILL MAKE MORE MONEY, HAVE MORE FRIENDS, HAVE A BETTER REALTIONSHIP W/ SPOUSE AND CHILDREN, if you read and use this book. I own a successful retail store and considered myself a master of communication, but after hearing about this book my entire life, I decided to read it last year. I have read it once and listened to it on CD three times since. I recommend 2-3 readings or \\"listenings\\" as you wont get it all the first time. Easy and enjoyable. The CD is also great!

As other reviews have stated, he provides a wealth of tips on how to live your life and influence others. I especially like the tip on criticizing others. He succinctly describes how it is futile to criticize people and expect them to do something for you and continue to behave in a highly productive manner. He uses anecdotes of Lincoln making this mistake. I could go on about other great tips such as how people yearn to feel important and the managers should assign tasks with that in mind. Great book.

I'm glad I did. Although this book was first published over seventy years ago, the advice and principles remain just as relevant today. Carnegie was a visionary and a people person who understood that making other people feel important and appreciated should be a priority for anyone who wanted to win friends or influence people. The principles in this book are not groundbreaking (although they may have been at the time), but are rather simple reminders of how any leader, professional, friend or person should act. Wouldn't it be great if we all lived in a world where Carnegie's principles were incorporated into everyone's daily life.

It seems to have something in common with a more recently published popular book ' Emotional Intelligence' by Daniel Goleman in that it focuses on understanding the other, empathizing with them and cooperating with them. It connects too in my mind very strongly with the Jewish Ethical Work 'Pirke Avot' which speaks about greeting every person with a pleasant countenance, and in another of learning from each person we meet. I think the underlying message connects with that fundamental religious teaching of loving our neighbor as ourselves, of really giving the other such respect and such understanding that they come in time to honor us also. I understand the Dale Carnegie work goes into much more detail in regard to using this kind of connection to achieve personal success, primarily financial. But I would suggest that the very act of understanding and respecting and listening to another is in itself of tremendous good .For ideally it means that we can make if not a close friend, then a kind of friend of each and every person we meet and speak with."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"What you should have learned in School but was never taught.

Well, the book is intended for those who have the will but not the tool. No quick fix nor magical spell enclosed."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"It is hard for me to describe this book fairly. I think that how you receive it, will depend on who you are and what you want from life. But, for me, Mr. Carnegie's book was well written, in that the writing style is very easy to read.More importantly, it was well done. Mr. Carengie describes how to get more out of life and, if you listen and practice what he advises here, you will probably have a happier and much more enjoyable life. This is a bold claim, but it it true. I return to this book, again and again, trying to make sure I am doing what this book says or for ideas on how I can do things better.The basic gist of this book is that, if you want to suceed and be happy, you need to think what other people want, not you. By serving others, ultimately, you will be happier and more successful yourself. Thus, if you want to be greedy, be selfless. It sounds like a contradiction, but it often seems true. People will be more willing to help you, after you have helped them.I actually bought a copy of this book for a few people. My sister didn't read it, because the beginning of the book tells you to &quot;take notes&quot;. Skip the introduction, if that type of advise distracts you. Read this book, implement its advise, and have a happier and better life. How many other books can make that claim?"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"What a wonderful book it is! By practicing Dale's principles, I changed my life completely. My personal life becomes very happy, because I learned to appreciate, respect, and help my love ones. My job becomes more enjoyable because I learned to get along with my colleagues very well. My life is full, active and happy. I am going up in this society.I am not surprised that some people despise this book. Human relationship is so complicated that we can look at it at so many different angles. Friendship has so many definitions. Yet I believe friendship has no boundaries. People choose friends based on different purpose. So-called \\"true friend\\" changes its meaning under various circumstances. Why do we have to be so narrow-minded and angry at Dale's way of picking friends? There is no right or wrong way of thinking, but human minds make it so.It is true that this book was written in the 1930s. So what? How much do humans change? Perhaps very little regarding our nature. I call this book a classic. It lives a truth beyond time, change or caricature.I am sorry to say that when those angry readers wrote their severe criticisms, they violated \\"principle 1\\" in Dale's book: Don't criticize, condemn or complain. They are not going to convince Dale, or anyone who loves Dale's book, to think ill of \\"How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People\\".This is only my opinion. I welcome any opposite ideas.Thank you so much for reading."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Having noticed that this work is once again popular, I could not resist commenting.Dale Carnegie's work has nothing whatever to do with cultivating genuine friendship. It is based mainly on giving the appearance of being interested in others, solely in order to use them to attain some personal goal. There is some valuable advice (for example, how one gains nothing from contradicting others), but the general tone is completely self-centered.I suppose my many years in purchasing management flavour my assessment here, because the techniques Dale Carnegie recommends still are widely used in sales (though long-term customers are seldom deceived, it is an understood game). This book may be useful to those who have only business gain in mind. However, its total emphasis on furthering one's own interests, and basically insincere approach, rules out any value for those who have true friendship in mind."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I wrote this review some two years ago, perhaps a little more. Since then, it has attracted the unbelievable number of soi-disant negative or unhelpful votes of 152 (June 2004)(and now, in November 2007, the count is 10 Useful and only 102 Not Useful - stranger and stranger!). I suppose it is the work of one person, as one scarcely imagines there are so many people out there who would care enough about this particular work (or about this particular writer - me). Nevertheless it is a fascinating statistic and it adds a little more colour to our understanding of a world which is already malfunctioning in numerous other ways.Here's the original review:I guess if Dale Carnegie was writing today, he would be quite a star author, since the subject which he helped to develop has become one of the most popular of all those to be found on bookshop shelves. How surprising is it then, to consider that Carnegie had such tremendous success in an epoch where a great many people would have had difficulty just coming to terms with his ideas, let alone embracing them. It seems simplistic to say that most of Carnegie's text is just plain common sense: it certainly is that. His prose is also delivered in an unequivocal fashion, but with humour. He knows what he's talking about, and he knows probably, that you or me or the next guy is going to be sceptical anyway. So he just tells it like he sees it and hopes the reader will catch the vision. Since he really hasn't got a hobbyhorse to ride, we do catch the drift (at least the millions of copies sold suggest that we do). I believe if you read this book and don't have a thoroughly enjoyable time (as you straighten out a lot of your own thinking), then it will only be because you need to come back to it in two or perhaps five years time. In addition to the above, let me say that Carnegie is also a fine writer, which helps."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I have read the book and taken the class, twice.In my opinion, Dale Carnegie's advice does apply most to a business relationship, and less so to a meaningful, deep, personal relationship. Being nice to others is a good thing, yet Mr. Carnegie is essentially teaching, for better or worse, how to manipulate people by focusing on what they want to hear, by focusing on what is pleasing, or flattering, to another person. I agree with Mr. Carnegie, using the techniques will certainly &#34;win friends and influence people&#34;. Yet at what cost? Honest and direct communication takes a heavy hit from Dale Carnegie. How would you prefer your deep relationships to be? Based upon honesty, even if that honesty is not always easy to accept in the moment? Or do you want your close relationships to only flatter you, appeal to your vanity, tell you only what you want to hear, never offer constructive criticism out of concern you will be offended? Granted, in business, in sales, there is a certain societally agreed upon dishonesty that greases the wheels. If you want to be a good salesperson, you may very well need to be &#34;selective&#34; in your use of honesty for the very reasons Dale Carnegie outlines. Yet for a deep, real, meaningful relationship, shouldn't honesty take priority over vanity, over being pleased, over being told what you want to hear.At higher levels of business, being a &#34;yes man&#34; will not get you very far. Yet that is what Dale Carnegie teaches, how to be a yes man. Selling stuff, sure, being a yes man is very effective. Being a leader, or for deepening a valuable personal relationship, being a yes person will lead to a superficial, even punch drunk, level of intimacy. In short, very shallow. The value of what Dale Carnegie taught varies greatly depending upon the context in which his principles are used.How would the Dale Carnegie principles apply to the abolition of slavery, Gandhi's line in the sand with imperialism, The Allies' stance against Hitler, or the civil rights act? What if Abraham Lincoln chose not to argue with the south, or the USA decided to focus on the positive side of Hitler and not get involved? With if Rosa Parks simply moved to the back of the bus because sitting upfront wouldn't change the cracker's mind anyway? The Dale Carnegie principles are simply the outright enemy of social change. Thus please take the Dale Carnegie principles with a grain of salt and apply them to the forum in which they are most appropriate, sales. For instance, if you are selling shoes to feed your family, pour on the Carnegie charm, there's nothing wrong with that. If you are looking for deep relationship, or powerful leadership willing to change the status quo, look elsewhere, look far far far elsewhere."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"If you haven't read this book, you definitely should!

This book is key to becoming a respected and honorable person."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I actually purchased this book many years ago and started reading it, got about half-way and then stopped reading it. Eventually, I misplaced the book. Flash forward a few years later. I was at a success seminar and the speaker was telling the audience how she was homeless at one time, she had enough money to buy either food or this book. She made the decision to buy the book and read it, and that was one of the most important decisions in her life. I decided right there that I need the information in this book.I was unable to find my old book, so I went and purchased a new one. I read this book twice, and I still refer to it. I'm sorry... not read... studied it, highlighting and making notes throughout.Let me first say that if you're the type of person who is more concerned about being right, winning an argument or being smarter or \\"better\\" (whatever that means) than everybody, then you may have problems with alot (and I do mean ALOT) of the things mentioned in this book, especially the chapter on \\"You Can't Win An Argument\\". After all... this book is called \\"How To Win Friends and Influence People\\", NOT \\"How To Win Every Argument\\" and certainly not \\"How To Show People How Smart You Are(n't)\\".Personally, in my line of work, and in my regular dealings with people, I've actually used and applied the methods in this book with success. At least one occassion I remember, I've calmed down an angry customer, and I've actually seen other people use the methods in this book with success (hmmm... I wonder if they've read the same book I have). Of course, there were times where I've forgotten to use the principles in this book. Hence, the reason why I still refer to this book (along with other books). Even the author himself (Dale Carnegie) mentioned in the introduction that, even HE doesn't always apply the techniques in this book.OK, so with all that being said, do these techniques work 100% of the time? OF COURSE NOT! That being said, I don't know of ANY book whose techniques work all the time. To be honest, there were times when these techniques kind of \\"backfired\\" (then again, maybe I didn't apply it correctly). That's why there's a difference between what you read in books and listen in lectures and what you apply in the REAL WORLD. Books, lectures and seminars arm you with the BASICS and a FOUNDATION so you will at least have something when you go out in the real world, where you find out what works and what doesn't in your particular situation, and make adjustments.On a side note, I personally feel that's why we have so many books on business, self-help and relationships. It's because these people might have read a book (or books) from some famous guru or expert that pertained to their situation and/or business. Then they go out and apply these techniques (getting \\"real world experience\\"). Often-times, alot of these techniques work for most of them. Sometimes, these techniques totally backfire and they find something else to replace it. The result? That person writes a book on what works (and makes sense) from his point of view and next thing you know it, another expert is born! Overall, nothing wrong with that. I mean if you have something good, why not share it with the rest of the world :-)?Getting back to the book: This does serve as a very solid foundation in dealing with people, both in your business and personal life. The one thing I would like addressed (or addressed more) in this book is this: How do you deal with situations where the other person is clearly violent? Such is the case in law enforcement (or a bouncer in a bar) or even domestic violence can quickly escalate into something physical? Perhaps that is something beyond the scope of this book.On a final note: After I finished reading this book, I really can't help but think that the principles mentioned in this book would go great and really complement some of the other books I've read, namely:(1)NLP: The New Technology of Achievement.(2)Wooden on Leadership: How to Create a Winning Organization(By the way... I just finished reading this book and I have to say it is AMAZING. More on this in my upcoming review).(3)The Success Principles(TM): How to Get from Where You Are to Where You Want to Be(recommended to me).(4)Become a Better You: 7 Keys to Improving Your Life Every Day.By the way... Yes... I do read alot of personal development books and try to apply the principles in these books as best as I can."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This book mostly deserves its fame. It gives simple descriptions of basic techniques that should make most people who follow the advice more likable than average, without requiring prohibitive effort.I have two modest complaints.He focuses more than I would like on how to befriend people who like to talk at length, which leaves me wondering what to do with the potentially nicer friend who is too modest to say interesting things about himself.The chapter called Make the Fault Seem Easy to Correct encourages misleading people into thinking something is easier than it actually is. Even if this works 75 percent of the time, I expect that the resentment caused by a few rare cases where it turns out to be more misleading than intended outweigh the benefits produced by its successes. The book Switch describes a better version of this strategy (incorporating an important part of what Carnegie advises): focus on breaking down the task into small steps."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Dale Carneigie, in my opinion, is one of the best human relations expert ever lived. The title of the book may signal you as a \\"manupilative handbook\\". However, that is not the case. After critically reading this book, I have come to realize that there are two things in life no human on this planet can avoid and that is, human relations and death. Everything a person can achieve in this life has to be assisted by another human. This book helps you with basic vital tips in how to enable you to work with conformist and non-conformist individuals that would come in your way. He gives extensive examples to each point he makes. You may think this book is only for \\"business oriented people\\" but that is not true. This book would help you in each aspect of your life, marriage, children, work. etc. I have read \\"the 48 laws of power\\" by Robert Greene in which there are main parallels that can be perceived if you have read both books. But, it should be noted that this book \\"How to win friends and influence people\\" by Carneigie heavily bases its tips on a positive note. This book would not tell you to \\"crush your enemies\\" as the book \\"48 laws of power\\" would suggest. Instead, it helps you how to forge a positive relationship with people who may not like you. Great book!

I can't say that I mastered everything but will continually work towards bettering myself at it."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I am writing a positive review. I agree with most of the other positive reviews and I want to add a few things.If you are generally a nice person with great values and some self-control, you are probably already employing most of the concepts in this book. I'm a nice guy and after every chapter I kept saying \\"I do that.\\" Even though I feel like I already have been using most of these concepts, there were a few that this book helped to reinforce.This book was written a while back, in the 1930's I believe, and I think people were different back then and the world was simply a different place. I don't think the world has done a complete 180 necessarily but I do believe only the tough survive in this world today. The premise of the book basically says that you should be nice, pleasant, control your anger, keep an open mind and see things from the other persons perspective, and give praise and encouragement at all times. It says to do all this SINCERELY and not to be phony or lay it on real thick. It is essentially telling you to be the bigger person in any given situation. The idea is to approach any given situation so that in a way everybody comes out the winner. Some people say that the idea is that you should be a doormat to others. I don't think that's true. The book, for example, tells you to criticize people but to criticize indirectly because criticizing indirectly is still effective but it avoids conflict. There is a section that tells you to avoid arguments if you can. I agree with that on the basis that you shouldn't make a big deal out of something trivial. That doesn't make you a doormat though. I think that makes you smart. If something is trivial, it is not important and letting it go by is worth more than the conflict itself. Now if you encounter a conflict that needs to be addressed, by all means, address it. You just have to know how to handle yourself and I think this book will help equip you for that.This book would be nicer if it did have a section on confrontation. You will always encounter confrontation in this world and I don't believe avoiding it is the answer. I recommend reading THE POWER OF POSITIVE CONFRONTATION or some other similar book on the subject. You need to know how to balance being pleasant and charming with being firm. I believe you earn respect and influcence when you have both of those qualities and not either one alone.I want to say that this book is not fluff and is not simply filled with platitudes. There is plenty of substance and this stuff does work. It's an easy to read book. It flows very easy and the language is easy to understand. No big words, terms, or concepts.I'll admit that even though the book is around 270 pages, the message could be easily condensed to about 30. Each chapter makes it's point but is filled with many different stories to illustrate said point. If you get the first story, you really don't even need to read the others. Personally, I don't need to learn how to win friends. I used the book for tips on how to influence people. I would say part III and part IV, which are titled \\"How to win people to your way of thinking\\" and \\"Be a Leader...\\" are the real meat of the book and I learned some great things from those chapters. Regarding winning friends, friends are weird. Some people are turned off by nice people altogether, others like brash and straightforward people who speak their mind. You can't read a book on winning friends as we all look for different qualities in our friends. When you are influencing people, you are not necessarily trying to influence them to become your friend.I highly recommend this book. It can only help you. There is no bad advice here. The next time you have to talk to you spouse or your kid, a friend, a room mate or whomever regarding resolving a conflict, employ the concepts in this book and I promise you will come out on top."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Ouch!

He encapsulated the formula to \\"pull yourself up by your bootstraps\\" in the midst of a market downturn, to put it mildly. His title, How to Win Friends and Influence People, was probably used to win and influence book sales rather than cleverly and accurately describe the content of his book. Simply, it is a misnomer. With chapters on considerate social intercourse and sincerely understanding the opponent's point of view, he is a herald of the golden rule. But Carnegie gives you a 10 step program to follow (the Ten Commandments must have been too vague).I guess the whole idea is that when you are agreeable, intellectual, considerate, proper, quick, thoughtful and strong, people will go out of their way to be nice to you and do you favors. That social axiom is my particular beef with self-help books in general. But of all self-help authors, Carnegie outlines it fairly and motivationally. He must have been a courageously dynamic speaker-he sold his seminars for a thousand a pop, back then! But with uninterrupted sales since the late 30s and over 15 million copies sold worldwide, Carnegie's book is well worth the read...or the skim."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I have just read the book and many of the amazon reviews of it and I must say that it is most certainly one of the most powerful books ever written. It can, and has, changed the lives and the social habits of many people out there. Read all of the below reviews and you can see testament to that. Most love it and the few that don't, absolutely hate it. Why is this the case?Here is, in my opinion, my review of the reviews.I don't think anyone, whether they hated it or not, will say that this book is a weak and trivial book. By the sheer magnitude of the effect it has had on people and lives, it is most certainly something to contend with. And let me tell you, if I may, this book has certainly made an immeasurable splash on how I understand human nature.In any case, those who vehemently hate the book seem to hate it, not because it is impotent, but because it is SO POTENT. In other words, they seem to write that they must stand on principles of truth and attack a book that can be used for evil purposes. And, indeed, a truly evil person can indeed use this book for such ends. And I wouldn't doubt if some cult leaders have read this book as primers.But the fact is that the book is not evil. Giving immense power to human begins (like nuclear power) is not inherently evil so you cannot denounce a book like this for spreading evil. It is simply a vehicle of power.So it's really up to who the reader is. I believe that although a lot of harm can possibly come from use of these principles, I also believe that a greater amount of human good can come through these principles. Because utlimately, what Dale Carnegie is preaching is a way for people to have peace with one another. And more and more, peace is becoming an important thing to all people.And I must say that it even if it can be used for evil, the tone and content of Mr. Carnegie's writing constantly seems to say this: Understand one another, put down your arms first if you want the other to put down theirs, understand first if you want to be understood, trust one another, and love one another's frailties. And he says that these are the keys to winning people's heart's and minds. Is winning people's heart's and minds wrong if your ultimate purpose is to seek peaceful understanding? That is, afterall, what Ghandhi preached. And while he was alive, it worked. I personally think if world leaders read this book, we would have greater global peace.So if you are a person of integrity who seeks truth and goodness and betterment, read this book."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"&quot;Today we come across an individual who behaves like an automation, who does not know or understand himself, and the only person that he knows is the person that he is supposed to be, whose meaningless chatter has replaced communicative speech, whose synthetic smile has replaced genuine laughter, and whose sense of dull despair has taken the place of genuine pain...he suffers from defects of spontaneity and individuality...&quot; As I can validate with the man who recommended this book to me, this observation by Erich Fromm is 100% on target with &quot;Win Friends and Influence People&quot;.This man, who practiced this book, presented himself as superficial, artificial, irregular, and consequently very annoying. He proved to me that these techniques do not facilitate communication- they stifle it. Instead of being direct, this man would only have the courage to give hints or make indirect statements in the form of questions. If I would attempt to explain something to him he didn't understand, he would immediately light up and go, &quot;Oh! I see what you mean buddy.&quot; In my head I would think 'You couldn't possibly understand- I didn't even start explaining!' But that's how this &quot;Win Friends&quot; philosphy made him- he's not willing to go through any difficulty at all to understand and communicate with others.The techniques in this book basically converted this man into a robot. Nobody really knows what kinds of things he's interested in - although at first you think his interests have a lot in common with yours. The man has no sincerity or credibility. When I see him smiling I don't know if he is genuinly happy or just trying to appear pleasant. When he says he agrees with me, it means nothing because he always seems to agree with everyone. I've come to take his liberal and exaggerated complements of me as insults because in doing this, he ignores what is truly worth praise and I know that anything he does for me is really only for his image.I'll sum up this book for you:1. Fake interest in other people's hobbies to get what you want out of them.2. Pretend to agree with whatever people tell you so you'll be more popular.3. Only express positive feelings ; do away with sincerity.4. Make false excuses for your actions that people would be embarrased to turn down, called &quot;Appealing to the Nobler Motives.&quot;5. Talk your way out of what you behave yourself into (as if this was possible).I witnessed the ineffectiveness of a man who devoted himself to this book; I tried this book myself for a while. My conclusions: It contains nothing more than deceptive, manipulative, superficial techniques that have no use and will lead to the detriment of yourself and your relationships. Instead, I recommend reading the book that made this one obsolete: &quot;The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People&quot; by Dr. Stephen R. Covey."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"It is too bad this book is largely read by sales and business types, and not the average joe.Since the fact is, that even now, whenever one is engaged in a sales or business situation, in a store or at work, one can be 95% confident that the salesman/manager is operating according to the principles in this book, and if one, as a consumer or employee, is ignorant of these principles, one is literally a puppet in their hands.No doubt Mr. Carnegie was a nice person, and sincerely meant well, and no doubt his book has actually helped millions.Yet, I feel that the principles in this book can just as easily serve the sociopathic predator/hustler, as much as the ordinary business person. There seems to be a subtle form of hypocrisy involved in acting according to these principles that may be quite natural for sociopaths.But if one is aware of these techniques of subtle manipulation, one can at least know when one is being manipulated. Since, of course, they DO work!Hyperbolically speaking, it wouldnt surprise me in the least if even Hitler hadnt borrowed a few tips from Mr. Carnegie as he polished his techniques of persuasion in the early 1940's. I wonder ... ?"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Throughout and after my first read of Dale Carnegie's \\"How to Win friends...\\" I had made up my mind to rate this work \\"its ok\\" which is about a two or three on the rating scale. To be honest with you, throughout my first read I found the book rather boring. The underlying tone felt kind of hippyish. I expected better.Its actually after reading through the 400+ reviews I became overwhelmingly influenced by the many positive reviews. I could not muster to overlook the many accolades professed of lives changed that many has claimed to have experienced from the reading of this book. Surprisingly, I noticed my thoughts started gelling together to enable me to write my review. I was saying to myself \\"It can't be a marketing scheme behind this, this man has been dead over 50 years so it has to be purely the content taking root in these people's lives\\". I started to feel like an odd ball. I realized this book received five stars galore from so many people, I kept saying to myself \\"Unbelievable, I've never seen a book receive as many back to back five stars before. So the thought, \\"I may have to read it again to say anything intelligent \\" kept echoing in my mind, just to be sure that what these people read is what I had read. I immediately gave this book a second read just to find out why? because I surely didn't get it the first time, grant you I was still writing my review throughout me being astonished.The book is divided into short sections therefore allowing you to not lose momentum. The nucleus of this book is all about change. It presents you with different options that will tempt you to take action. The concepts are easy to understand, for the most part, all of his principles can be found under, \\"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\\", however just as the title leads you to believe, you will not become a human relations expert just from one read of this work.If you read the book and try to adhere to it, [Although in Part Three: \\"How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking\\", I must say, Principle Seven: \\"Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers\\" does not set well with my gutt feelings] there is no way that you can write a negative review about the book because you've now become a yes man. His spoon feeding style of writing doesn't challenge you to think. Carnegie's format is based on memorization. In other words, for those who want something to happen over night. The late Shepherd Mead's classic novel \\"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\\" demonstrates Carnegie's menu of principles in action such as when J. Pierpont Finch ascents to the top in this famous novel turned movie.I can't see how a sane person can possibly continue to re-read this book front to back and not skip over some of the dated stories. It will eventually disrupt your flow. This book would make an even better book if these dated stories were taken out completely or updated with modern day anecdotes.However, after the incantations that the content of this book moves you to exercise, you will realize that some of Dale Carnegie's timeless observations has found a place to lay alert in your subconscious, curiously waiting to apply his techniques if and when the moment requires it.In my opinion, this one is up for grabs.

I had long heard of it, and long had a vaguely negative impression. I think I presumed the book was to help insincere salespeople and glad-handlers manipulate folks. Since I was sincere, it didn't apply to me.Reading the book itself, however, I find that it is well-written, and quite valid, general, and sincere. It gives sound advice on how to actually make people really like you. Furthermore I notice: there is little in the book that most people don't already know. Winning friends is obvious: be nice, pay attention, figure out what they want and get it for them. People are pretty self-centered, so you mostly win them by making them feel important and good about themselves.I'll also bet that reading the book actually helps people win more friends, even when they already know it all. Because we usually make up comforting excuses about why people don't like us. Others feel jealous of us, are rivals to us for something, have been biased by slander from rivals, etc. And it is comforting to assume that folks who succeed must be insincere manipulators. Reading the book reminds us that winning friends is straightforward, but takes a lot of work, work that we just don't usually put in.One story in the book was about a US president who won over someone by spending lots of time on them, in part by making the Federal Reserve Board wait an extra thirty minutes. Which makes clear that there is a budget constraint: you can't lavish all that attention on everyone.The book gives lots of examples of folks who succeeded by using his principles to make particular others like them. But a bigger key to their success, I suspect, is knowing who exactly to woo when. Invest a lot in winning the wrong friends and you won't have much to show for it. And since part of what people want from friends is status, if you don't have enough to offer, you might just be out of luck."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This book is easily the easiest read and most common sense book about gaining influence into another person's life.

I would recommend this book to anyone who sincerely wants to know how to connect with the people around them.

It is full of helpful insights about how to get along with others and make friends (avoiding arguments, smiling, making others feel important, learning what interest others, actively listening, not criticizing others, allowing others to believe they are correct when they aren't, etc). It basically covers all of the basic skills that you learned as a child, and that your parents taught you, but over the years have chosen not to follow for whatever reason.

The remaining 85% is due to personality and the ability to lead people. As a young professional in the early stage of my career, I picked up a copy of How to Win Friends & Influence People in order to hone my human relations.The book, first published in the 1930s, is certainly dated in the anecdotes it relates about high-powered business executives and politicians. However, the advice is written in a conversational manner that is very easy to read and still relevant to these modern times.The book distills its wisdom in short chapters focused around specific advice. As you progress through the book, many of the suggestions become recurring themes, reinforcing their emphasis. Much of the advice is simple common sense and common courtesy, but reminders are welcome, as it is all too easy to take these skills for granted.After reading the book, I recommend printing out a list of the main headings, to be reviewed on a daily or weekly basis. I also suggeste occasionally re-reading the chapters that pertain to specific weaknesses you may exhibit, so you can have an increased awareness of them as you seek to improve.Human relations, in both professional and personal matters, is an essential skill.

A condensation is best because lecturing, as I've found, gives you pause to think about what your words (printed or spoken) mean and whether they have the desired impact on your audience.Carnegie breaks down his course into bite-size lessons:Part One - Fundamentals(Working with and understanding egos)Part Two Six ways to make people like you(Become a good conversationalist)Part Three How to win people to your way of thinkingPart Four Be a leaderI suggest buying an audio version of the book to accompany the paperback version.

Overall I enjoyed the points Mr. Carnegie makes about interpersonal skills, even if some of them are extremely shallow and insincere. Mr. Carnegie seems to repeat himself a lot and rewords principles in a slightly different form, perhaps to get a higher page count. However, I have one BIG problem with this book. In one chapter, Mr. Carnegie writes how he spoke to western outlaw Jesse James' wife who told him that James often gave away the loot to farmers so they could pay their mortgage. I was intrigued by this in and of itself so I did a little further research on the topic. First of all, there is little to no evidence that James ever acted as a western Robin Hood and secondly, James' wife died in 1900. Carnegie was born in 1888 which would make him around 12 years old at the time of this interview. What kind of nonsense is this? How could such a blatant lie be published? Either I'm missing something and have my facts wrong, or Mr. Carnegie isn't as virtuous as it seems. At any rate, Mr. Carnegie presents time-tested practices that would help anyone successfully communicate with someone, even at the expense of truth and sincerity."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I read this book a long time ago but then recently revisited it.

Sometimes it can be quite simple to effect self-improvement and change given a personal desire to do so. This very simple read has literally done that for millions of us over generations. The basic premise of the book is simple; one must demonstrate a sincere interest and common ideals with other people in order to have the greatest influence on them. Its a sort of \\"how-to\\" or textbook of the art of projecting effective focused sincerity for personal gain without appearing to have a hidden agenda. The book reads so easily and quickly that I truly regretted coming to the last page. Fortunately, I found that a sequel exists, \\"How To Stop Worrying and Start Living\\". Clearly, there is some reiteration from the original but I found the sequel interesting and like the original quite a page turner. In the end, \\"How To Win Friends And Influence People\\" is so simple to grasp that one may not even realize how powerful and sustainable the message of the book really is and on many levels. I read this book and the sequel three times, all in 1968 and the message has stayed with me to my benefit ever since. Some readers wanted to be better salesmen, or sought political office, while other readers were just plain curious about what the big fuss was about. Regardless of the readers motive, we all got something from the book and probably more than we expected.

Bear in mind it was written a long time ago, however, the messages in this book will genuinely help you in the most positive ways.People notice when you take a sincere interest in them, just as you do when others take a sincere interest in you.

After reading the book, you will better understand the beauty of listening and this where the book makes its mark. It's amazing how poorly we listen to one another. If you stop and listen to two people having a conversation, pay attention to the responses made by the second person in the conversation. Often times, you'll notice that instead of responding to what was said, listeners often try to establish their prior points. It's as if the conversation goes in circles for longer than necessary.

No education would be complete without reading Dale Carnegie. Lisa Shea said it so well, I have placed her review below. Anything I could say would only be repetitous. Lisa, I hope you don't mind. This is only out of respect for your review.\\"This classic book by Dale Carnegie was originally written back in 1937. You might ask yourself, \\"how could a book from the 30s possibly help me with my current modern problems?\\" This is probably the same question asked by the other 15 million plus people who have bought the book. The answer is simple. This book is NOT about how to run your business, how to choose a cell phone or laptop. It is about interpersonal dynamics. It is about how to talk to that employee of yours in order to get them to perform well. It is about how to discuss issues with the person you are selling to, in order to get them to agree to the sale. If you read historical books, you'll find that humans had the exact same emotions back in the days of the Greeks and Romans - love, envy, jealousy, self pity, pride, hope. It is these basic human needs you need to understand. Once you do, your daily business problems become MUCH easier.There are a ton of thoughts in this book that are clearly important. Dale will first explain the issue, and then often will give a real life example of how handling the issue properly helped a real person in a real world situation. It really helps to make the image stick in your mind. None of these are complex, algebraic formulas. They are all straightforward, simple tasks - but once you practice and master them, they can make a huge difference in how others interact with you.For example, if you have an employee or contractor that simply isn't doing their job properly, you have many options available to you. You can scold them or hound them. Those of us in business who have tried this approach find that it rarely works, especially in the long term. Dale explains what techniques DO work - and work reliably - in these situations. It's a matter of expanding your roster of options, so that when you hit a problem, you have a group of ideas to work with in order to solve it.If I were to have a criticism about this book, it would be that everything is portrayed as being \\"solvable\\". It is put forward as if one of these solutions to a given problem will surely work. In the real world, that just isn't true. You could hit a cranky employee who already is looking for another job and who could honestly not care less about fixing his current job's problems. I really wish there was a section of the book that helped you know when it was just time to cut your losses. That being said, for the other 99% of the issues you face in your daily work life, this book is truly invaluable.\\""},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"It is the best book ever written! It is interesting to read, it is filled with funny and clever examples from the lives of famous and ordinary people. It actually makes you a better person if you at least try to follow his advise.Basically it is summary of all ten commandments, but they are written in a modern language and related to every day life (no mentioning of God).

Dale Carnegie, author of \\"How to win friends and influence people\\" is one of the best known of the self help book authors. The information is still relevant today, as it's about developing interpersonal skills which relate directly into business success for many people. There's also many different places offering Dale Carnegie courses which expand on the basic theme of the book. Carnegie believed, is due 15 percent to professional knowledge and 85 percent to \\"the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership and to arouse enthusiasm among people.This is a timeless classic that will allow us to see other people from their point of view, rather than from our own, which is priceless in the area of human relationships.

Don't have a lot of time to spare? Don't worry. The book is divided into short sections, each one devoted to a particular principle that is well illustrated with many practical examples.

It's a great possession and an asset - Get updated before you are Outdated! The book has remained the best in series of understanding human nature with the tips n tricks of the winning edge. I recommend this book to all who live with the hopes to reach the skies and shine with success. Money alone does not matter but its the very essence of human relations that bridges the gaps. The book provides not only information but is an attempt to form new habits to stay tuned with life. Carnegie believed that financial success is 15 percent due to professional knowledge and 85 percent to the ability to express ideas, to assume leadership, and to arouse enthusiasm among people. The book teaches the very skills to follow the principles and be a leader without a wee bit of resentment. Co-operation and how to deal with people, being a good conversationalist with the power of voice and interest people is jotted down by Dale Carneige in an amazing way. People apt to make mistakes but how to admit it and stop criticizing is a way to win friends. Nobody likes others to be bossy or take orders but in situations that arise, Dale figures out ways to tackle with techniques. How to win friends is a handy guide for every person, especially business people and should be on top charts in home library or work place. A wisdom book for healthy human relationships you can't ignore to read, after all.

Moreover, looking back, I could remember very polished people feeding lines I knew they didn't believe and I reflected wondering if they knew that I knew that they were full of it.In the Marine Corps, my Vietnam-era senior leaders (I came in the Corps in 1985, but the leadership at the time were mostly veterans from the previous conflict) stressed to us corporals that recruit and boot Marines might be uneducated, but they were not stupid. Leadership stressed that to lose their confidence, to jeopardize my credibility in their eyes, would destroy any future I had or anyone had as a leader.I've noted this particularly in foreign countries where Americans are fond of boasting, but I see reflected in the eyes of the locals that they can see through it.Even if the statement is unkind, if you must say it, say it straight. Of course, if it needn't be said, like you're fat or ugly or both, then don't say it. But please don't take Dale Carnegie's advice and say something disingenuous.All this to say, don't waste your time on this book.

I had an older edition years ago but lost it before I got to read it. So I requested this for Christmas last year and got it. Let's say I wished I had requested something else.I realize it's the first so-called self-help book, and I'm amazed at Mr. Carnegie's rise from poor farm boy in Missouri to much sought after motivational speaker. I also enjoyed the then current, now historical, examples he uses to illustrate his points. I'm writing a book set in that particular time period, so it did give me some insight on the news makers of the day. But unfortunately, it is not a autobiography or a history book--it's a self-help book and it totally failed to help me in any way. I think the reason why is what worked in 1937 will not work today. People are way more distrustful and cynical now--most people can spot someone who wants to sweet talk them into something from about a mile away. Also, I think people can sense desperation more keenly now, and let me tell you, you will NOT make any friends if you are too heavy on the compliments and if you go out of your way to get approval. This will get you ignored or even hated very quickly.Let me save you some money and time and tell you the main theme of this book. And this is it--if you're super nice to everybody, everybody will instantly like you. Now, from my own life experience, I know this isn't true. I'm a very nice person, I did everything in this book when socializing with people before I even read it (I wasn't being fake or desperate, it was just naturally part of my personality) and I have a very hard time making friends. And forget about influencing people. I'm lucky if people will even listen to me for thirty seconds before looking at their watch and saying 'I have to go'. The people I've known in my life who are extremely popular (in school and in adult life) are all stuck-up jerks. The majority of them treat their friends like garbage. They regularly make it known they are better than everybody else every thirty seconds or so. If any of those people read this book, they'd laugh and toss it in the trash. Yet, despite their behavior their many BFF's flock to them and are ever faithful. I was hoping this book would tell me why people think these individuals are so fascinating. Well, let's say it didn't and instead told me something that my mother taught me when I was two years old. And sorry to say, but it did not apply to life in the late twentieth century and applies even less now.The book, while not hard to read, is written in what could be called an 'old-timey' tone. It felt like my great-great grandfather was talking to me. If the advice was useful, I suppose it wouldn't have been as bad, but I found the tone off-putting. I realize it was written in 1937, but I think the language should have been updated since then.Also, since so many people have read the book, including me, I can now tell when others are trying to apply it to their life. My husband introduced me to a co-worker a few months ago and within about a minute of talking to him, I knew he had read this book. He had bought it ten years ago with the intent of finding a significant other. I felt extremely sorry for him because in all that time he couldn't even get a girl to yes to a date. Even though he is a good looking guy, I even felt turned off by his behavior and if I was single myself, I would say no to him if he asked me out too, even though he was following this book's advice to a tee. My husband told me that all the women in his workplace refer to him as 'sort of creepy' and go out of their way to avoid him.Well, I don't what else to recommend (I'll tell you when I find it) but this book doesn't work. It should be called 'How To Turn Off Friends & Get People To Ignore You'.Oct. 2011: I think I've found a fairly good alternative. I've recently read 'The Power Of Positive Thinking' which was first published in 1952, and thought it was miles better than this book. It's a little dated, but not as much as this book, and I found it both helpful and inspiring."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This review pertains to the following Kindle book: How to Win Friends and Influence People (With easy click Table of Contents) - ASIN: B001E37F96.

However, most of the techniques tought are much too simple and ineffective.When I was reading the book, I was surprised to recognize many little tricks people were using in order to have their way with me. These tricks were so obvious that I always wanted to ask the people: &quot;Just how stupid you think I am? Do you really think I'm not seeing what you're really up to?&quot; Most of the techniques Mr. Carnegie suggested were very easy to recognize and there was no chance anybody could make me like him by using'em.At that time, I was everything but advanced in psychology. What I'm saying is that when you use Mr. Carnegie's tricks, there's a great chance that people you're dealing with will recognize them and react negatively. The book is easy to read and can certainly give you some good basics on human psychology, but if you want to be really successful in your communication, you'll need much more than Mr. Carnegie's ancient wisdom. (Besides - I can't let it be unmentioned - on a few occasions, the good old Dale Carnegie is simply wrong.)There is one more thing you should know. When Mr. Carnegie talks about &quot;friends&quot;, he means &quot;customers&quot;. You might make customers with his techniques, but you probably won't make any friends. In fact, you should be careful with using some of Mr. Carnegies tricks on your friends if you don't want to lose them.I'm not saying the book is bad. I'm not saying it's good either.

If you work with people in any capacity, this book is a must. We tend to interact with people and at the first sign of conflict, we either fight or flee, totally making our efforts almost powerless. Though this book you'll learn 1) How To Make People Like You. This is an invaluable tactic that we sometimes forget and more don't know how to do. In our jobs, we are stricken with the task of working with people we don't like, even if they like us (see point number 1). Carnegie teaches you 2) Fundamental Techniques for Handling People. I have used these tactics with great success. If you are as good as you think you are, you'll need to 3) Get People To Your Way of Thinking, this third point will make you a formidable figure in your interactions. 4) Be A Leader is the fourth point that many have difficulty with.

Also very good for sales people."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"There are reasons that some books continue to sell millions of copies over several decades. Many people have heard of Dale Carnegie's most famous book - How to win friends and influence people. I read it many years ago and have just finished it for the second time; along the way I've been reminded of things forgotten or learnt things that now seem more relevant than when I ignored the principles in the first reading.Ultimately this book is about how to be nice - and to still obtain the results you want. Some people are under the impression that being too nice can encourage the door mat feeling. Not so. This book, along with any other books on etiquette and manners, shows that thinking of the other's person point of view/feelings/loss of face, etc before leaping to conclusions/criticism/complaining is a much better course of action with a much better outcome for all. In the words of Mr Carnegie, \\"...the only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.\\" It may take a little bit of practice and effort but it surely does work."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I haven't read the book yet, but after reading all these praising reviews, you can bet that I'll be at my library renting it to read over. Life is, indeed: short. Sometimes your ahead, sometimes your behind, in the end: the only competition is yourself. I just graduated from High School last year, and I'm 18 yrs old. So many thoughts are passing through my mind, I've also bought Napoleon Hill's: Think and Grow Rich. I have a door 2 door job which allows me to interact with my city, and hopefully I can put Carnegie's principles to work. The world would be a better place to live in, raise kids in, if the ideas of this book could be implemented. Financially, I am free at the age of 18, believe it or not. But I still continue to read, develop the mind, and actively pursue what life has to offer. The more you give, the more you receive back, whether in money, love, and in relations. With a full life ahead of me, I plan to put my life to good use by reaching down and touching the Souls of people. (Man,Woman, or child) There's a saying that: &quot;To know a person is not to know that person's face, but to know that person's heart'. So very true. Though we put on masks and do some pretending, each of us are humans with the same basic emotions, feelings, wanting to be loved and appreciated. So 'GIVE' of yourself, you'll find that you'll receive back plenty in return. Currently, studying up on Business Systems, and the demographics of society, one day I'd love to meet visionary's like Bill Gates or Micheal Dell, who had the vision to better society's lives through Technology. So many unsung hero's in this world today. So next time you pass a weary face in the back of the bus.

Basically, treat other people the way you want to be treated.There are no deep psychological theories, no mysterious tricks, and no secrets revealed in this book that make it worth reading."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"It's tough to decide where to begin, it was hard enough to find the time to even write this, what with all the friends and other people constantly calling my phone these days. Firstly let's discuss all the negative reviews stating the information in this book is old and outdated, these are the same people that can't see the value in a good sling with a rock in a war zone(rifles jam people, hell if I had my way we'd all be carrying muzzle loaders). In order for the advice given throughout this fabulous book to be efective it is imperrative that you find the right audience, let's look at this logically, the book was written back in the 1930's, the people that will be influenced most by the tactics discussed are going to be located at the local nursing home. I head over to Pleasant Acres(the local retirment community) at least 4 times a week and I am the absolute life of the party, and I'm not just saying that because there have been no less than 6 deaths since I've started visiting. Whether it's my charismatic nature or the fact that the majority of my friends have alzheimers, I can guarantee that when I show my face in the dining hall I am guaranteed to be offered a smile and a seat with the popular ladies(you know the ones, they are always winning at bingo). The only reason I am giving this book 4 stars is that it works too good if properly used, older women, while more experienced than their younger counterparts, are much more dry and thus require a good amount of lubricant(this stuff can get expensive). For an even better result, try reading this book and then visiting the local retirement home while wearing a three wolfs moon t-shirt, I suggest you bring a stick or just steal an old man's cane to help keep the women back(those electric wheel chairs move fast)."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I learned a lot from this book, and it's one of the few that taught me more about learning about what matters to other people, and how to be a better person in dealing with others.Anyone who is involved with people in any part of life will get great answers and understanding in this book."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Many people I've become acquainted with are good - and some are great - salesmen (and saleswomen). However, the one that is consistantly number one in the USA in sales for her mutual fund company swears by this book. She comes from a long line of top sales people - her father could sell ice makers to eskimoes, even prior to global warming - and pointed me in the direction of this book.I now own both the printed and audio versions, and swear by the truths therein which every salesman (actually, everyone) should live by lest they have few people happy to call upon them (call them their friend).Although you should have already heard of Dale Carnegie's legendary principles and prose, it never hurts to add yet one more testimonial.

It's one book you need on your shelf and in your brain."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Let me just say that as an 18 year old girl, when I was first introduced to this book, I thought it was a joke. My mom told me that it had been her favorite book when she was my age. I started laughing hysterically. \\"Your favorite book was some stupid self-help book? That bore? You have to be kidding me\\" I said. I couldn't help but think my mom must have been a loser.But for some reason or another- I must have been pretty bored- I decided to give the book a try. I figured I would read the first page, immedietley find it horrible and put it down. But from the minute I started reading the book, I knew it was no normal self-help book. I was enraptured! Dale Carnegie didn't just explain human thought and ambition truley; he also did it with fascinating anecdotes and historical stories that I just ate up.When I started telling my friends about it, they were pretty sceptical as well. I was so in love with the book that I would try to explain my favorite lessons to anyone that would listen.They became pretty interested as well, and I hope to buy each of them this book as a graduation gift.How to Win Friends and Influence People is a book that is so wonderful because it really does contain amazing advice and insight into human behavior- helping one deal better not only with other people, but also helping one understand themselves and the human mind better.What a great book!

Although the examples are outdated, the techniques are not. Further, the examples provide a slight glimpse into history-- so they are fun to read too.I believe in these principles and know for certain that they are correct. The techniques discussed are simple social and communicative basics and, if mastered, will allow the reader to converse on hieghts and new abilities unheard of.The writting style is slightly old but still simple and direct.

I've avoided some conflicts and gotten my way in my personal life as a result of things gleaned from this book. There is nothing profound in this book that I didn't already know, but the examples used in making the authors points are very easy to understand.

Immediately after reading this book I started putting the principles into action. I am amazed at not only the positive changes I am seeing coming from people I am coming into contact with, but also the positive attitude it has brought me about being around and communicating with other people every day of my life.

Once you start to apply these principles it will cause you to take a look at YOURSELF, take control of your actions, choose who you want to be and how you treat others around you to get the most out of yourself, and encourage others to do the same.The brilliance......is that there is nothing in this book we haven't been taught since grade school.

And they'd be right. The power of the book lays in its simplicity, truth, and effectiveness. To know that all of these principles & tools exist and work is not the issue. The issue is that most people don't realize how powerful and effective these principles & tools are. Most people just don't use these tools enough.Put another way, this book is not going to present you with new information, but it will show you with clarity and logic how to approach human interactions with class and a sensitivity to all parties.Then Carnegie takes it a step further by explaining how to get your way without sacrificing the aforementioned principles and without being manipulative.The examples used to illustrate each point are updated (so not all examples are from the 1936, when it was first printed) but suprisingly some of the oldest examples are the most powerful. Carnegie draws his examples from legendary people such as Lincoln, Charles Schwab and JD Rockefeller. His writing style is simple and straight-forward. He is also quite humble, although it is obvious that he is well learned, citing a variety of eastern and western literary, philosophical, and religious giants.To me the only downfall of the book is the title, which makes it sound like it may be a book on how to manipulate people. However, it is more accurately a book on positive interaction based on a well developed understanding of human nature.The audio-book version is also excellent, the narrator is fantastic and I found it easy to listen to several times."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This book presents a new philosophy of life, so you make the people around you feel happy and feel happy yourself. His ideas are extremely convincing, as proven by quotes from the brightest people of this century, quotes that one could not find after reading 10 books of philosophy or psychology. This book is very well-written, very comprehensible, deep in meaning and shows you how to live. Again, this book is a must to read.

At least it can make you laugh now and then, as some advice is so blatantly phony. This is a book about manipulating people while doing your best to make them feel they are not being manipulated. (So, the words \\"influence people\\" in the title are quite apt.) It confuses appearances with substance, and it constantly misuses the term \\"genuine\\". \\"Be genuinely interested in people's problems\\" is meaningless advice. \\"Genuine\\" cannot be taught. You either are genuine or are not. The only thing you can teach is to *pretend* to be \\"genuinely\\" interested in people.The one point I'd give this book is that if you utterly lack any kind of basic social skills, it will at least teach you one or two."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"How reading a single book can change your life!It's true, when I was 16 years old I (like many others I have now found out since then) read my first book about business. I was drawn to it in a small, old fashioned book shop that's no longer in business. At the time I didn't really know any entrepreneurs or people that ran their own business and I had no mentor to point me in the right direction. The book simply \\"spoke\\" to me and I grabbed it and bought it.Weird stuff. Especially as at the time I was a quiet, shy sort of a guy but in my heart I had a burning ambition - I just didn't realise it yet!The books name was \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" - You must have heard of it I am sure but I hadn't at the time and I would say that \`personal development' was not the juggernaut it is today.It changed my life (for the better) - it gave me confidence in general and more importantly it lit a small flame to start my own business that grew and grew until I did just that two years later at 18 years old.So what you may say, plenty of people have done that! Well it was quite a shift for me, my father only ever worked for 2 companies his whole life and I was expected to go into a life long job myself in biotechnology or something similar - certainly not to waste my \`brains' on cleaning offices and cars!!The book made me change me outlook on life completely - it made me \`think' that I could do anything I put my mind to doing and it also gave the courage to get over my shyness at key moments in my life.It was the start of life long reading habit (before that I couldn't be bothered with reading and we had very few books in my house as a kid) - even to this day 20+ years later I still go and get a few books on a topic if I want to learn something new.Also, I have adopted the strength to face all my fears \`head-on' since then - when i felt anxious about public speaking I got a few books and tapes and learnt until I was pretty good at it, the same for selling, marketing, finance, hr, technology, programming, manufacturing, teaching, training and on and on.I became curious about other people and looked for the \`good' in them and I feared nothing and no-one. I strived for my goals and I achieved them all.I am trying to illustrate the power of the written word along with a great (if a little dated) book. Also, I want to reiterate the power of personal development as a whole. Today many run down the idea of personal development and it's many offspring.Personal development is just like this book - you should read and learn and then apply the principles that you believe in to your life.You must take action on the one's you believe in and you must apply your own moral standards and integrity to anything you learn from others.For my part I have read this book many times and bought a few copies as well as the tapes, now CDs, it's time for a refresher for me and i urge you to listen to them if you haven't already."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"The folks that reviewed this book as a \\"1 star\\" might have missed the point of this book. In order for these techniques to work, you must use a common sense approach to each situation.For instance, one of the techinques described in the book deals with finding a common interest in someone you have just met. Unfortunately, if you use the book without using common sense translation it would go something like this:\\"Hi! I like the shirt you are wearing. It's got an image of a racing car on it. I like racecars, too! Now that we have racing cars in common, will you help me with my homework?\\"Without a common sense approach, this technique fails.Another technique decribes how to speak to a shy person. If you are shy, would this approach stated below work on you? I would doubt it.\\"Hi. You seem shy so I'm going to converse with you so you can overcome your shyness. So, what's up?\\"The techniques in this book will require you to use your head, your common sense and your own personality to be effective.The overall message is the Golden Rule: Treat others the way you, personally, would want to be treated\\".Also, this is not an \\"all or nothing\\" way of life. If you use a few of these techniques the way you see fitting within your personality, they will work wonders for you.I've used these techniques and have had considerable success. I believe it was a worthy investment."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I only read this book because someone chose it for my book club. I am typically very judgmental and cynical about business books, and typically find them self-satisfied and generally meaningless. THIS BOOK IS AN EXCEPTION. This is one of my favorite books and I will definitely read it over and over. Everything in here is common sense, but are things that people rarely put into practice, so it helps to have them pointed out (e.g., the sweetest sound to anyone is their own name, become genuinely interested in people, let other people do most of the talking). I strongly believe that this book is essential for anyone interested in enhancing relationships, whether personal or professional. The key is thinking about Carnegie's principals and applying them in your own way. As Carnegie stresses, this book is not about manipulating people to get what you want, or being schmoozing or being disingenuous. You have to be sincere when you apply what Carnegie sets out.The book is separated into four areas: Fundamental Techniques in Handling People, How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking, Six Ways to Make People Like You, and Be a Leader. It must be said that following Carnegie's techniques will not instantly improve your life or make all of your relationships successful, but I don't believe that is his intent. Instead, I think the intent is to get readers thinking about how people really work and think, and how understanding this can help you enhance your relationships.My only criticisms about this book are small. First, the book is a tiny bit dated (there are many references to older presidents and leaders, such as FDR, Lincoln, Coolidge, and Andrew Carnegie), but this doesn't really get in the way of the point, and is interesting for those who enjoy history. Second, I am the tiniest bit skeptical at how successful one might be at applying these principals in the more cynical modern world and have them work (I feel like some people may not be \\"immune\\" to them) or not be perceived as fake. Perhaps the secret is applying them in your own way, subtly, and, above all, sincerely.I strongly recommend this book to everyone and anyone, and I want to tell you that these principals work if you make them your own."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"\\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" was an inspiration and wonderful book that transformed my life. It presents a fantastic notion of promoting peace and encouraging readers to be friendlier with those around them. It is a masterful art that we all should take the time to study. All those that wish to improve their relations with others socially or at work should carefully read this book and apply the principles taught.The book covers several essential areas of everyday life such as arousing enthusiasm among your associates, learning to make friends easily, cultivating positive emotions, being tactful, being able to win people to your way of thinking, developing one's ideals, aiming to be more mature, having a happy marriage, solving problems, enhancing one's happiness, and learning to speak effectively, among others. This is among the best self-help book available on the market.This is a well written book by a very knowledgeable and wise man. The principles are presented in a fascinating style with so much insightful wisdom and enlightening anecdotes. The message was very clear to me and having understood its essence I have changed some of my habits and my behaviour towards others.

It will work on a lot of people. However, it will not work on people who do not feed from other people's validation.Before reading How to Win Friends and Influence People, I always believed that people are secure and happy on their own. I do not feed my happiness from other people so I thought everyone is the same. While I agree with Dale Carnegie, it also shows how sad the society is in general.I am beginning to think most people no matter what their station in life, (I dare say 90%) do not feel good on their own but feed from other people. In short, to feel good, they need other people to make them feel good. Am I the only one seeing how screwed up that is? It means most people are insecure on their own unless someone reassures them, which to me is scary. This means many people are open for \`plucking' which is why we as a society is so easily swayed by advertising and consumerism.

This book can only help a person be a better wife, husband, parent, employee, employer, neighbor, doctor, teacher, etc., etc., etc. Even if someone were a recluse, this book would help them to be kinder to themself.We hear of &quot;road-rage&quot;.....people needing selfcontrol.....people hating their jobs. I know a few people that think they just aren't &quot;people&quot; people but this book will help anyone feel a little more in control and a lot less intimidated when dealing with others.This book is not only for sales and it's definitely not a book to teach manipulation of others just for the benefit for one's self.To have better employees or children, influencing them is far better than ordering them. Influencing someone tends to work without supervision.This is a book of learning to be optimistic and caring of others. Excellent book. This publication will NEVER be outdated. I challenge anyone reading my review to read this book and to see and feel how good this book really is. As a matter of fact, I read 5 novels a month and How To Win Friends.......is going to be one of those books this month........again :-}"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"\\"How to Win Friends and Influence People,\\" in my opinion, is not the most intriguing read. I know and understand that it seems to act as the \\"Bible\\" for quite a few people, but I'd have to say that what I read in this book can be achieved through the practice of common sense. I did not discover one concept in the book that could be deemed either \\"new\\" or \\"revolutionary.\\" Sure, the book has its merits. It is probably more useful in a teaching/educational context than in a casual setting. I would not recommend this book to the casual reader who is seeking \\"self help,\\" because I feel that most people who would be reaching for this book in this day and age are truly out for books dealing with personal betterment. Given this, there are so many other easily acquired books out there that give this advice and more-in a more contemporary manner than what is presented here. Case in point is the story of President William McKinley, pesented here in its glory. McKinley died in 1901, over one hundred years ago, and the reference seems colloquial today. However, since the book was written in the 1930's, most readers could relate to McKinley's story as being one of their own. Seek elsewhere, dear reader, and you shall find. I'm not completely condemning this book, but I'd say only use it as a supplement to more contemporary (and important) manuscripts."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"i read this when i was fifteen and i've always been wiser for it. every parent should get there kids a copy of this book. it teaches you to consider other people's points of view and not just our own. this way we can mutually benefit"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This book is based on solid timeless principles and teaches the reader what is required to get along with others.

It contains lessons that I have used over and over in my life, and every time I read the book or listen to the audio tapes I go back to the fundamentals, and I also get sparked toward new ideas and applications. Another book I've recently read and enjoyed, &quot;9 Free Secrets of New Sensual Power&quot; was a similar experience in that it took me back to basics and at the same time it pointed me toward new vistas and ways of enjoying things I'd been doing for a long time. Also there are many ideas in both books which can be new for someone who hasn't put a lot of time into personal growth or self-help work."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Carnegie's &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot; is a handbook providing the reader with basic guidelines on how to improve one's communication with others in order to build healthy, long-lasting relationships.The book, comprised of four sections, with each section devoted to a certain aspect of communication, provides the reader with a multitude of ways to improve both personal and work relationships. Within each section, Carnegie promotes his &quot;principles&quot; - guidelines by which to live and succeed. These principles, though seemingly simplified and elementary on the surface - (smile, listen to others, show respect for opinions differing from one's own, etc...) - are truly sensible and contain quite a bit of wisdom. These are the principles which we are taught as children and which we subsequently forget as adults. Although he seems to prefer good manners and etiquette over proficiency, Carnegie clearly states that his target audience is comprised of competent individuals who are lacking the personal or communication skills to succeed in the workplace. Thus, Carnegie asks us to (re)develop these skills which are often lacking by the time we reach adulthood in order to improve our communication and human relationships. Additionally, Carnegie punctuates and illlustrates his ideas with narratives and anecdotes - although somewhat dated - to provide a sense of how the principles may be applicable for a number of diverse situations. The handbook is relatively accurate, and though many of the ideas are not new, they are certainly helpful in providing one with a sense of the necessity for improving one's communication. The book enables the individual to acknowledge his or her faults and setbacks, and ultimately empowers them to strive to succeed in becmoing a better person."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"It's been nearly 20 years since I read this book, but think it deserves more credit than it may get. While some may dismiss the book as being manipulative, the book stresses, developing a sincere interest in others. That's a \\"sincere\\" interest in others, not a phoney, \\"I-want-something-from-you-so-I'm-pretending-to-be-interested\\" interest in others. Other basic maxims of the book, such as smiling, being \\"lavish in your praise and hearty in your approbation\\" are as timeless today as they were in 1936. Much of this book has become cliched, but that may be because there is something to these very basic principals. Again, the book stresses sincerity. A phoney will be a fraud no matter how many creases he puts in the spine of this book. Several years ago, I met some top economists from the Russian Republic visited my city, and mentioned what they learned from \\"Carnegie.\\" Everyone assumed they meant Andrew, until they had to point out, they meant Dale.

It provides insights on how to produce the WIN-WIN situation (you win, and your partner or co-worker wins). Another thing this book has instilled in me is to know that it's cool to admit your mistakes; I'm not always correct on every issue and sometimes I screw up. That's ok, and it's good to admit your mistakes rather than stick to your idea and never think a person can be wrong now and then. I recommend this book, and I wish people would check it out.

Despite the quaint and slightly humorous title, it provides powerful lessons in management and interpersonal skills, and is the best book on the topic I have ever come across. Some reviewers criticize the book for being \\"dated\\", because many of Carnegie's examples come from the early 20th century. I think this is irrelevant for two reasons. First, the author was using examples from the time in which he lived and worked, and second, it really wouldn't have mattered if he used examples from the ancient Roman Forum. Humans are social animals whose basic interactions, wants, and needs have not changed appreciably for thousands of years. Indeed, I believe this book is more valuable today than it was in Carnegie's time. When it was written, face to face interpersonal skills were more highly developed than in our era of home schooling, computers, video games, cubicle jobs, and the increasing isolation (desocialization) of individuals in our society. While many of his lessons may seem like \\"common sense\\", this type of common sense is woefully lacking today, even among people in management. Perhaps it seems like common sense because Carnegie's writing style is clear, concise, pragmatic, and to the point. It is devoid of the jargon and psychobabble so common in later books on the subject (Did jargon and psychobabble even exist in 1936?).For example, Carnegie points out that yelling at and deriding a coworker or employee we are unhappy with (or to use a modern example, sending a nasty E-mail) may make us feel good (I told him/her a thing or two!), but from a strategic point of view is often a disastrous choice. In a business setting, it is much like throwing a hand grenade at someone across a small crowded room. We usually hit our target, but also involve innocent bystanders and cause a lot of damage to ourselves as well. Carnegie offers several alternatives to situations like this, and many examples. Suffice it to say that I personally wish I read this book years ago, and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Its amazing that a business man from the 40's and 50's can change your perspective on effective communication in the new millennium. After reading this book and talking about it with other people, I found out that in many schools, it is a mandatory read in high school. Which it should be. I still reference this book in day to day struggles with personal and professional relationships. I am often quoted as saying, \\"What would Dale Carnegie do?\\""},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"One principle really hit me in this book more than the others and so I tried it. I tried it on my coworkers and customers at work. I'm a teller at a credit union and so I talk to many people every day. It is amazing. EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT I TRIED THIS WITH PROVED THE METHOD EFFECTIVE. People would come in with business on their mind. They never talk to the tellers much other than to get their business done.I had a couple people come in who rarely talk and are often mean if you don't do things exactly right. I tried the method(s) in this book and WOW! The would come in a snarl and next thing I knew they would be talking, laughing and having a great time. They would leave with a huge smile on their faces and we both felt so much better. All of a sudden I noticed that I was laughing and talking with all of the customers. It was AMAZING.I tried it on my coworkers as well. I found out more about each of them in 10 minutes than I had in the entire last 4 months working with them. These methods make people open up to you like nothing else.Finally, my best success story: I have an extremely difficult coworker to work with. She is always rude, inconsiderate and just down right mean. She is often lazy and tries everything she can to get out of work. I tried the methods in this book on her and she has been SO NICE to me ever since. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! It basically took 10 minutes to completely make her turn a complete 180 with her attitude. Ever since she has been working harder, she actually answers the phones now and helps me out without even asking her. IT'S THE MOST AMAZING THING I'VE EVER WITNESSED. I checked out a copy from the library and I'm going to buy it to have a cherish and listen to over and over.ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Win Friends was a life-changing book for me. From the very first chapter I began to re-evaluate every area of my life and my interaction with employees, friends and most importantly, my family. Not since the Bible has there been a single book that has transformed my way of thinking so completely.Usually when I read a book I read for a set period of time or for X number of pages at a minimum. I could not do that with Win Friends. Most of the chapters are only 6-8 pages long so the reading goes quick, but I fully recommend stopping after each in order to let each point digest and be thoughtfully considered.At the end of each chapter is a single line summary. While I didn't memorize these, I frequently think back to them in certain discussions as I look for the best route to handle a situation. Each of these summaries have since been typed up, printed and pasted to the wall next to my desk. I try to read over them daily as a refresher.So what's all the good stuff? Is this book really just about winning friends and influencing people? Not at all. It's a book on how make people like you while giving you what you want. As Dale Carnegie explains over and over, it's not about taking advantage of people or acting in a false way in order to manipulate them. It's about changing who you are and how you act so that you can address others genuinely and caringly that the natural result will be them wanting to give you what you want. Genuineness is the key to Carnegie's book!Early in the first chapters I realized that this will be a book I read at least once per year for the rest of my life. The principles will be memorized over time as I read and re-read them daily. You don't have to be an unhappy person to read this book. And you shouldn't read it if you're just looking for ways to \\"get what you want\\" out of people.

With the help of these marvelous books-the book presentation was a real success.I read this book, HOW TO WIN FRIENDS & INFLUENCE PEOPLE, and took notes on index cards so that I can re-read my notes and this wonderful information many times. Here are a few key points:-Criticism causes people's defenses to emerge and honest flies out the window. Don't criticize or condemn.-Flattery is selfish, insincere, and shalllow. Approbation is genuine and strokes the othere person's ego. Flattery is counterfeit. Appreciation is the legal tender that all souls enjoy and need. Hurting people not only does not change them, but is uncalled for. Give honest and sincere approbation.-Arouse in the other person an eager want. If there is any one secret of success irt lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that angle as well as from your own.

How do you get the best of an argument? Avoid them at all costs, they are not worth the price. Always show respect for others opinions. Never, ever, say \\"You are wrong.\\" This gains you nothing. If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically. This is biblical from the mouth of Jesus, no less. Begin all encounters with people in a friendly way. Always get the other person saying yes, by finding common ground. Let the other person do a great deal of the talking, this is perceived as having great listening skills. Let the other person feel that the idea that you are presenting is his or hers. This is a skill. It is crucial to honestly see things from the other person's point of view. Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires. Appeal to the nobler motives. Dramatize your ideas to make them unforgettable and convincing. Throw down a challenge, something for the other person to live up to. This appeals to the ego and desire to be important.A leader's job includes changing people's attitudes and behavior. Here is how to be a leader in a nutshell. Always begin with praise and honest appreciation. Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly and very discreetly. Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person. Ask questions instead of giving direct orders. Let the other person save face, give them a way out. Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise. Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to. Use encouragement to get results. Make any fault seem easy to correct. Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.This is an excellent book within the realm of learning, developing, and using people skills. So many of us lack this level of tact and finesse, most of us would do well to read this book and put its principles into action.

Carnegie not only brings to light the concepts behind the necesity to foster and cultivate relationships, but also shows you how to do it, and do it well."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"The book came in a decent time. I'm content. The information in this book is very informative in a way of basically not letting how people treat you affect the way you treat them. And that will immediately give you different responses. I've exercised the secrets in this book without first reading it and I can attest, it works. Reading it just confirmed to me that what I was doing was smart. For example, a few associates at work will be so crude, rude, and mean. But I looked at it as a road block for me to jump over. Two things, not let it get to me, by ignoring it, and second, treating them genuinely positive. Let me tell you it works wonders. Folks with pride would say that you are being a kiss ass when they see you do what is in this book...when its not. You're being wise, smart, tactful, but genuine in your desire to treat and receive the good treatment you believe you deserve. Its called maturity. So, good luck, God bless and read the Bible. Peace ;)"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"The old classic has lost none of its relevance. A bonus for today's reader is the historical perspective it offers in terms of literary style and attitudes about women and race."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This book is unlike any other book. It's a classic and will be around for ages. It was first published over seventy years ago, but it will always be relevant as long as people are alive. This book contains tips on how to conduct ourselves and influence people. It is not so much about how to make people do things that we want them to do, but how to make them want to do it themselves.I found it easy to read, but because it is packed with ideas, I keep it on my shelf because I tend to forget certain things. But, practice makes perfect. I just loved this book and I think that more people should read it. I never heard anyone say that this book is not valuable.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market?

One of the best books I've read in a while. Very Helpful!"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This book is truly unique. The title is a little melodramatic, but this book by Dale Carnegie is so much more than that. I don't care whether you have 500 friends or 1 friend. I don't care whether you have $10 million or $50 in your bank. I don't care who you are personally. This book is for everyone.It is enjoyable to read, with many great little quotes and stories that you can even tell your kids as a bedtime story. It is interesting to read how people's lifes changed by applying the principles in this book. I don't think I actively apply all the principles in this book, but subconciously I might have added some of these traits to my personality. I think the most important trait is being different. There was a little story in the book about a boy who no one noticed, a little boy with no friends, a normal boy with no special interests. He acted &quot;average&quot;, doing everything like everything else. Then one day he decided to be himself, he made his hair look funky, he played Halma in the middle of the mensa, and so on. Soon he became the most popular guy in the school. Simply for the fact of being different. I think I acted normal or average as well. Most everyone does. But by being different you will make everyone around you act a little different and the world will become a happier and more interesting place.I bought this book at the Chicago O'Hare Airport because my flight was delayed. I wanted something to get me over the wait. I noticed the aisle with advice on your own self. Psychological advice, public speaking advice, how-to-do this and that books. You all know what I am talking about. Then I saw this little book in the corner, the only book with no flashy graphics, no modern fonts, no metallic cover. A simple book with a simple title. I bought it. I started reading it. I was even disappointed that my flight finally arrived and I had to get up and stop reading for a few minutes. I did not want to put this book down. Neither will you my friend. Dale Carnegie has such a fine writing style, it is a joy to read.I recommend reading this book. I have read quite many a book in my life, but this one is the truest and freshest I have ever encountered. By the way, I just started reading &quot;How to stop worrying&quot; and I have already ordered a few of Carnegie's other books.Bottom Line: A magnificent piece of work, from the first page until the very last."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I got this after reading so many positive reviews on the original print. I am extremely happy with it. The latter part of the book are useful more towards the workplace and working relationships, useful nontheless. However the first half of the book is brilliant for all relationships and social occasions. It's explanation on people and how to befriend them is priceless. Once you read it, you become aware of things in a different way.

He referred me to his son who suggested I read How To Win Friends and Influence people, twice, in order to get a good idea of how to interact with people and positively progress academically and professionally. I have read it more that a few times and have bought and distributed copies to at least 10 or more friends and family. Since then, they've passed on their copies and or bought copies for others. Bottom line: this is a great book.17March2006"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Excellent every time I read it. This book should be a prerequisit to getting a high school diploma. So many self-help books are a bit boring and too wordy but this book is very easy to read and understand. At the end of each chapter, there's an equivilant to &quot;moral of the story&quot; which makes reading this book fun as well as informative and helpful because you can't help but think of how to apply that particular chapter to life. This book is a must if you deal with the public at all. I hope my comments have been helpful but there is so much more to this book than what I have written but my main point is that you will enjoy it, it's very easy to understand and it will be a benefit to read. It has helped me be less stressed out with rude sales people and/or service people because there's even a chapter on them to help us all understand each other.A great book, don't miss the chance to read it. Start in the back, the front, the middle or just skip around the book and read it. It's effective from all angles. Enjoy ;-}"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Dale Carnegie understood the elements of healthy relationships and teaches us skills to develop them with timeless examples. My dad told me to read this book when I was a teenager, and it really worked for me. I have read it 4 or 5 times. If your realtionship are not what you would like them to be, you must read this book. I recently read Optimal Thinking-How to be your best self by Rosalene Glickman, another timeless resource(recently written), which shows you how to be your best and bring out the best from others no matter what you are facing. Both of these books are easy to read, so don't procrastinate, buy them and make the most of yourself, your relationships and your life."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"TV's come with an owners manual. VCR's come with one. Microwaves come with one. Stereos come with one. When someone is born, they should be given a copy of this book, for when they are old enough to read. It is the owners manual for life.I was told about this book in the summer of 1999 and was a little reluctant to try it, but someone I knew had a spare copy and gave it to me. Here is something for you: I read a LOT of computer books, I don't read intelluctal books. Also, I NEVER read any books cover to cover in a few days, most of mine I read over the period of months.I read this book in THREE (3) days. Cover to cover. It is THAT good. What did discourage me is the copyright date of 1936. He uses a lot of historical people, but when you think about it, no matter what generation it is, whether the 19th, 20th, or 21st century, people are still the same.Technology moves on, but humans are the same. Emotions are the same. Feelings are the same.People still feel the same way today that they did in 1936. Interacting with others hasn't changed in the last century. Only whats around us has.After reading this book, I actually tried it. I KNEW it wasn't going to work, but I thought I would try it for a week. Well, I'll admit I was dead wrong. It ALL worked. All of it.Human nature hasn't changed. Even to this day, a year after reading this book, I still put some of it to the test. An example, I bought an engine that I was told was good. After installation, it was not. Rather than go back to the seller and raise hell, I simply said &quot;I wasn't told accurately, here are the problems, and I just don't think this is right&quot;. I said it in a very nice tone. I actually got some of my money back.Had I not read this book, I would have gone back screaming.Even if you don't read it in a few days, skim the chapters. You WILL NOT GO WRONG with this book.It is the BEST book I have ever read. Rock solid advice. It takes some practice to get used to, but it works. It really works.So if you are having some difficulties at work, getting people to listen to you, or just overall want to improve your own life, pick up a copy (or check it out from the library), and read it over. You won't be wasting your time.Forget the power talkers. They are getting paid for it. Dale Carnegie is giving advice for free."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This book has been recommended to me by numerous people and was even an optional reading for my social psychology class. However, the title always turned me away because it sounds so manipulative and disingenuous. That's just not the kind of person I want to be.After seeing more and more recommendations I finally decided to give it a try and am very glad I did. Despite the title, the book is actually the opposite of what I imagined it would be. It's basic principle is universal and timeless, change the way people react to you by changing the way you react to them. Do to others what you would like to be done to you. It's the golden rule that has been repeated countless times by many different cultures. Carnegie goes into the nuances of how to apply this rule and talks about the difference between genuine appreciation and flattery, etc.Don't let the title turn you away. This book really is a gem in how to treat others better and be treated better in return."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Since the end of World War II, literally thousands of books have been written about how to improve professionally and personally. Every single one of them can be traced directly back to two books, Napoleon Hill's \\"Think and Grow Rich\\" and this classic work of Dale Carnegie's, HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE.Webster's Online dictionary defines \\"classic\\" as \`serving a standard of excellence; historically memorable'. This book serves up the standard of excellence today as it did when it was first published and is definitely historically memorable. It's quite possible that Napoleon Hill and Dale Carnegie have positively influenced more lives than any other writer's and their influence continues long after they've left this earth.Some may consider this book outdated, and thanks to our public school system, many of the historical figures of the early twentieth century that are mentioned here will be unknown to many readers. But consider this an opportunity not just to begin building a life of success, but to gain a brief introduction to some of the industrial giants and other notable business people of a century ago. These are, after all, the people who helped shape the modern era of our great country.There are certainly a wealth of great modern day teachers who might make some of this material more meaningful to today's reader. Stephen Covey, Brian Tracy, Jack Canfield and many others come to mind. I certainly recommend you study the modern day gurus of success and life enhancement, but if your goal is to improve your business or personal life, your library simply must include this book. This is one of those books you will go back and re-read every couple of years and if you're like me, you'll recall its many lessons on a daily basis."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Everyone should read this book. There is nothing bad that can come from it. The stories contained are interesting and the concepts are completely simple. In fact, nothing taught here was ever mind blowing or surprising. The surprising part was the self reflection it brought and the desire it created in me to want to adapt concepts from this book I previously felt needless. This is the kind of reading I wish I was forced to read growing up and not books about a bunch of stupid kids on an island that go crazy and fight each other."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Although originally written several decades ago, Carnegie's masterpiece about humanrelationships is still timeless classic with principles that still apply today.

I wanted to know the secret to getting people to like me. My mom bought me the hardcover copy of this book ... I still remember reading it in the bathtub. Carnegie's words are simple and soothing. The recipe for making friends isn't some coplicated formula, but a down-to-earth tactful approach. Naturally when I became an independent business owner, this book was on the booklist in the business.

Talk in terms of other person's interestsFor getting to agreements in tough situations, this stuff still works. Life at work is full of disagreements and misunderstandings.

Simple suggestions, like share your own weaknesses before trying to help someone realize that they too have flaws, and you have succeeded when you give someone an idea and they think they had the idea first are among the gems in HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE. The idea is that with the right people skills, you can do anything you want to do. Unfortunately, many of us have been conditioned to stop before we succeed. We are &quot;stalled&quot; I have just read a fascinating new book that describes these &quot;stalls&quot;. We all suffer from The Communications Stall (our messages are not understood or we don't hear what others say), The Disbelief Stall (believing that we can't do it), The Tradition Stall (we've always done it this way, so why change), The Bureaucratic Stall (too many unproductive policies and procedures to get in the way), The Misconception Stall (based on poor assumptions) and The Unattractiveness Stall (not wanting to wade in murky waters).

This is why I suggest you purchase this book instead of borrowing it from the library and reading it once.

For a book that was written in 1936 it was truly a great resource then and still is now because no matter the century, technology changes but people and human nature remain the same.This book explains ways to have people respond to you in very positive ways. And teaches you how to develop into a leader by explaining the most effective ways to deal with complaints, arguments, and people in general. This book teaches you and gives examples of how to use Dale Carnegie's messages through really short stories about really interesting and cool people.I found this book both thought provoking and fun to read because it sends its message in easily understood terms. And each chapter ends with a principle thought to remember and elaborate on, through the use of real world examples.In short, this book is a valuable resource for people struggling to make friends or trying to understand people.
