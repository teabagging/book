I myself must admit that I am not a very big book fan, in fact I totally dislike them. It was first recommended to me by one of my cousins and then after that a whole bunch of other people. My first reaction was &quot;THIRTY PAGES! I'D RATHER EAT A BUG!&quot; But I read it anyway because it was on my reading list and I loved it! It all started out with a little mouse named Matthias who lived in Redwall Abbey. Striving to be a great, famous, hero like his ancestor Martin the Warrior, Matthias sets out on a journey to find Martin's lost sword. Mean while an evil rat named Cluny the Scourge and his gang of rats and weasels plans the death of Matthias and the entire Abbey. Matthias battles animals from crows and foxes to even the evil Cluny. While Matthias is away on his journey, Cluny and his horde of rats and weasels attack Redwall. Will Matthias be able to come back and save his Abbey in time and relive as Martin the Warrior, his life long dream? Find out by reading the Redwall series! If you like adventure, fighting, action, and gory books this is the book for you! It has very, awesome, descriptive, deaths and injuries in it like a bunch get poisoned and eaten by a snake, some get burned to death and boiled to death, others fall from great heights to their death or get crushed under giant weights or are stabbed to death. Dozens are shot down with arrows, and one was even knocked off a wagon and crushed under the wheel! Cluny the scourge was missing an eye due to a fight with an unfortunate ferret whose skull is now carried a round on Cluny's staff. I would recommend reading this book because it is the best (and one of the only) books that I have ever read! I might even read the sequels (no...I am not feeling ill, Mrs. Wylie) So I think we all get the point READ IT!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"My ten year old son has read every Brian Jacques book that has been published to date. Over a year ago, when he was nine, we began reading Martin the Warrior aloud in our family. About a quarter of the way into the book he couldn't stand the suspense any longer, so he picked it up and finished it on his own. Before that he had never read a book over 100 pages on his own.We went on to read several other Redwall series books aloud in our home.Please take the time to read this book to your children (boys, especially, tend to love this series starting at age 8 or 9). Brian Jacques is a superb writer and uses beautiful descriptive language in all of his books. The feasts he describes are mouth-watering!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This is an extremely well written book with wonderful and vivid characters. Brian Jacques creates a unique world where animals walk around much like humans do. The characters are well developed and he gives each one it's own unique personality.The problems I have with this book, minor as they may be is number one the violence. In a book that's intended for kids eight to fifteen it's extremely violent. There are tons of animals dying right and left and some of them die in a very violent and horrible way. I found it annoying that Brian Jacques would create a lot of time creating all these wonderful characters and then kill them off a few pages later. Why did you take so much time to introduce several characters that you were just going to kill off in twenty pages.There is no swearing in this book that I can recall and if you have a kid or adult that doesn't mind a little violence then this is a wonderfully written book.I loved the character Matthias (the hero mouse).... he is everything a true hero should be. I also loved the main villian Cluny.... he is everything you would want from a true evil rat!Overall a great book."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I was a little skeptical about reading this book at first. I thought a bunch of rodents fighting against each other would be a bit boring. I kept this book for a long time before I finally got around to reading it. Boy was I happy I did!It is a story about a mouse named Matthias. He is a bit clumsy and awkward. He lives a Redwall Abbey and everything there is quiet, happy and peaceful. That is until word of Cluny the Scourge and he army were coming to Redwall. He is an evil, villianous rat who is set on destoroying everything in his way and taking control over the abbey. Matthias steps up and becomes the warrior the abbey needs in order to protect themselves. But first they need to find Martin the Warrior's sword. Can they find it in time to save everyone from the clutches of Cluny and his army?*A note to young readers & their parents: this book does have a good amount of violence and deaths. Please consider whether your child will be able to handle this kind of content."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I strted Redwall in the sixth grade and became hooked right away because the books are very appealing to a young student like myself. It had action, it had mystery,it had history,and it had great villains that were really nasty nd you were happy when they were destroyed. This book I thought was a great beginning because it introduced us to loveble characters and had a great storyline. Matthias a young mouse from Redwall must set out and look for the sword,scabbard,and armor of the legendary warrior mouse Martin. With this he must become the new warrior and defend the Abbey from a clan of villains led by a a terrible villainous Rat. I will not spoil the end or the specifics for you but I will highly recomend it to anyone who loves adeventure books and is a young child who likes to read. I also recomend parents to encourage their children to read this book and all the others."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I did not expect this book to be so compelling. After all, the characters are all woodland animals, suggesting that this is a children's book. As it turns out, Redwall is wonderful for children, but also solid fare for young adults. I score it lower than the adult-targetted books of Tolkien, Herbert, Aasimov, Kim Stanley Robinson, Modesitt, Melanie Rawn, Pournelle, Stirling, and others, but Redwall fills a certain niche perfectly. Full of beautiful writing, outrageous dialects, a larger-than-life cast, adventure, magic, mythology, and ancient fantasy elements, this book can please people of all ages.Jacques' gorgeous prose is evident from the very beginning:\\"It was the start of the Summer of the Late Rose. Mossflower country shimmered gently in a peaceful haze, bathing delicately at each dew-laden dawn, blossoming through high sunny noontides, languishing in each crimson-tinted twilight that heralded the soft darkness of June nights.\\"The writing remains vibrant throughout the story. Jacques commands an amazing vocabulary and selects only the most active and lively words. Some of his writing seems archaic, as though it belongs in ancient fairy tales.The story moves very quickly. Jacques keeps the action fresh by throwing in new twists and adversaries.Jacques could have written the same story with human characters, yet he risked losing the older demographics by using sentient animals. This strategy works surprisingly well. People attribute certain characteristics to animals, thus enhancing the personalities and perceptions of each hero and villain. The reader can easily envision the civilized, kind-hearted mice; the villainous piratical rats; the aristocratic cat; the engineering mole sappers; the champion-climber squirrels; the sly, spying fox posing as a gypsy healer; and the boisterous fun-loving hare.Characters remain distinct and flamboyant. They all have wonderful dialects. Moles use rustic speech and the hare sounds like an English gentleman officer.Cluny the Scourge, the piratical sea rat, is one of the greatest villains in fiction. He radiates evil power and embraces his role as a mean, ugly, fearsome barbarian warrior. He is devious and instills fear in enemies and subordinates alike. Naturally, his followers are all moronic, cowardly gutter trash, allowing the classic interplay of a nasty villain who must constantly berate the buffoons around him. His army of rats, stoats, weasels, and ferrets have some interest in Satan and plenty of interest in destruction, murder, and slaving.Cluny seeks to destroy Redwall Abbey, a peaceful refuge run by gentle monastic creatures who give aid to all woodland animals. Clearly this is a tale of good against evil, as compassionate heroes oppose heartless destroyers.Yet again the book surprised me: the battles are extremely engaging, ranging the gamut from one-on-one combat to large-scale assaults and siegecraft. The book is unexpectedly brutal, showing some cold-blooded face-to-face murders.Jacques draws upon a huge variety of classic themes, archetypes and story elements. Look for the coming-to-age quest for manhood; the humble, pious soul who becomes a hero; the search for a mystical sword; the ancient prophecy in the form of a riddle; glimpses of magic and the paranormal; the adventure through strange lands; the elderly venerable advisor; and more that I will not give away. It is all deeply rooted in old European tales and Arthurian legends. Sure, it has all been done before, but it is written so well that it feels refreshing.I definitely recommend Redwall, especially to young adults who appreciate great swash-buckling adventure and comedy. It features likeable good-hearted heroes who courageously confront the evil of the world and suffer poignant deaths. It reflects the author's great imagination and optimism. This is the beginning of a great series.-Zach Zelmar"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I loved the book from begging to end and would recomend it for ages 10+ (I'm 11 years old)"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I was told about this series of books by my mum and after reading one I coudn't stop reading.

On the night of the great fiest, a strong evil enters Mossflower. This evil is known as Cluny the Scourge.Matthias, and the Redwall warriors try everything to stop Cluny, but Cluny was too dedicated on taking over the Abbey. The only way that Matthias can stop this evil, is to go on a long and dangerous quest to find the lost sword of the legendary fighter.Matthias is captured by sparrows, confronted by shrews, almost eaten by a cat, and attacked by a giant adder, all for the amazing sword,that will slay the horrible evil."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"When the peaceful creatures of Redwall abbey are attacked by Cluny the Scourge and his band of bloodthirsty rats, weasels, and stoats, it is up to Mathias and his friends to stop them with the magic sword of Martin the Warrior.Redwall is a book with songs, poems, riddles, freindship, romance, adventure, celebration, and fighing. It will be enjoyed by people of all ages."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall is a very interesting story of a young mouse named Matthias. He has always never fitted into the Order of Redwall because of his bold spirit. He soon realized that the fate of Redwall lies in his hands for Cluny the Scourge has come to Mossflower. Solving riddle after riddle he and the ancient mouse Methuselah strives to recover the abbey's only hope of survival: the legendary sword of Martin the Warrior. This leads you Matthias to leave his beloved abbey to quest for this lost sword. After suffering much he finally gains the knowledge of where the sword is but one challenge still remains, the great adder Asmodeus who guards the sword. With the help of the Guosim shrews he successfully retrieves the sword and kills the great snake. However, tragedy strikes at Redwall Abbey. Cluny the Scourge has taken Redwall! Just as he was about to kill the Father Abbot Mortimer Matthias appears. He and Cluny start a duel while the vermin horde of Cluny battles the Guosim Shrews and Sparra warriors. Cluny is killed when Matthias cuts the great Joseph Bell and crushes Cluny.I really enjoyed this book and others in this series. The best parts, in my opinion, were probably the great battle against Cluny the Scourge and when Matthias was questing for the sword. This book offers great enjoyment and it is hard to put down once you start.

It was three months before I checked it out. I should have checked it out sooner because it is an awesome book. The book's characters are animals like mice, rats, otters, and birds. Now I know it sounds dumb and boring, but it is just the opposite. The book has a lot of action and several battles start in it. The characters in the story seperate a lot so the story jumps between characters and locations. The book is about 300 pages long so I think kids under 10 or 11 might not want to read it.

There is not a single human mentioned in the book, and it makes you imagine what a whole world without people could be like. This gripping novel about creatures with a lifestlyle very diffrent from ours is sometimes the sort of book that makes you wish you lived in the animals' world, and and had the courage and bravery to deal with the hardships they deal with.

The amazing descriptive elements help bring the written word to life.Fantasy has rarely had the warm, inviting feel of the Redwall series, especially this fabulous first enstallment. Its mystery,intrigue, and conundrums to unravel, as well as its twists of fate, assure that it will go down as a classic.Matthias is a young novice mouse of the Redwall order, a rather clumsy creature, who has left every mouse in the Abbey wondering what his destiny will be. After the celebration of their Abbot's Golden Jubilee, a large horde of rats is discovered roaming the land in a horse-cart, lead by an usually large rat with one eye...The characters in Redwall are all animals, such as those native to England (rats, mice, badgers, squirrels, foxes, and so on). The distinction between the protagonists and antagonists, and the differences in each creature's &quot;personality&quot; (not to mention their differences in accents and dialects!) add to the enjoyment. &quot;Redwall&quot; is uniquely fullfilling. This is the beginning of a long journey enjoyed by people of all ages.

Brian Jacques (R.I.P) sends off a wonderful message: no matter who you are or what you look like, or how helpless you may seem to be, you can still be the greatest person you want to become if you fight for what you believe in and protect the people you love. It is based around the idea of good defeating evil, and that the villains will never triumph over the heroes.\\"Redwall\\" is a novel that is full of adventure; if there is an event that seems slow, it is almost immediately followed by action that will keep you turning those pages. I've read this novel several times and am still not bored of it. The heroes are brave and entertaining, there are characters who are absolutely hilarious, and I've found myself laughing at a lot of parts, especially the witty dialogue. Everything is perfectly balanced and connected; characters and events share some significance to the plot. Nothing is wasted. Brian Jacques is a master at storytelling; his descriptions are so deep and detailed that you can clearly picture the settings and pretty much everything else in your head.The only downside is that it is sometimes gruesome and violent, so I think it would be a bit innappropriate for younger readers.Once you start reading \\"Redwall\\", filled with beautiful descriptions, lovable characters, hilarious moments and dialogue, and action-packed events, you'll find yourself living in the land of Mossflower yourself, and trust me, it'll be hard to put this masterpiece down."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"What a great book, its an adventure story! Good read for a variety of ages. I'd say 10 and up."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"What more can anyone say of Brian Jacques' first story that would span some twenty-odd books?Come on guys, us old people remember the first book when it was released! Eye-catching, wicked, and deliciously different from any other, the original Redwall is a gem. This book is very different from most of the others because stigmas have not been made (i.e. all vermins are evil, cussing isn't allowed, gore is usually curbed). I loved this and a very small part of me wishes Jacques kept that feel going. Certainly, Redwall might be the last book I'd recommend to a child under 10. It is stronger in themes, gore, and language than any other of the Redwall series. In many ways, this series is best reserved for people with more advanced maturity, even adults would enjoy it for sure. I do, haha.In the story, Jacques created one of the most infamous and truly evil of all villains you'll ever encounter. In the first scene you meet Cluny, he speaks of the devil and hell. I cannot recall many other times these are referred to in the series.

Now at age twelve, he asked me to purchase this book for him as a reward for mowing the back lawn. When it arrived, I decided to read it to my boys (9 & 12). They love it. They laugh and always ask me to read one more chapter. For a book geared to children, it has a very good vocabulary. Jaques was a good writer and did not short-change the kids on creative language. Many chapters make for many short reading sessions, and the story is simple but engaging enough to pick up where you left off the next day - good for bedtime reading! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall's prose is fabulous. Descriptive language is beautiful and nuanced, detailed without being overbearing. The prose tells the story without getting in the way. Characterizations are nicely done, though ironically I ended the story without much of an idea of who Matthias was, beyond a cookie-cutter hero figure. No word on what made him into a hero beside circumstance. Indeed the characters were a bit flat and archetypical. There are no sexual situations or profane language in the book, save expressions like \\"hell's teeth;\\" but there is plenty of violence, including murder.The weakness was in the story. Although fun and exciting, it was not compelling. For one, I found that there was not enough backstory. Redwall is described as a \\"helping and healing order;\\" but order of what? Only vague value assertions are made, with no mention of religion at all, despite the presence of traditional phenomena like abbot, church, cross. Also, I found the society of animals a little strange, given the vast differences in size between mouse, rat, badger, etc.The Abbey goes to war suddenly, without much angst from the mice. I would have expected more treatment of the transition. Similarly, the many deaths (really) in the book are done rather off-handedly; I wanted more emotion: more prolonged and more pungent.The denouement seemed rushed: several converging plotlines are hastily prepared and resolved in the final chapters, seeming to want more careful preparation.I think the factor that hurts the book most is its lack of overarching purpose. The premise of the book is defenders fighting off invaders. It happens to be that the invaders are archetypal gangsters, but it could have been told with more neutral attackers. That's it; no higher call. That would have turned this from an exciting story into a compelling quest."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I can't remember when my 10 year old daughter has been so excited over a book.

But there are definite advantages to the &quot;Redwall&quot; series, especially this first offering. Jaques writes with more precise description, and does not manage to bore the readers with endless exposition on the different creatures that the readers encounter, without sacrificing what we need to know about the rats, stoats, mice, badgers and hedgehogs.&quot;Redwall&quot; is the story of a peaceful abbey in the middle of Mossflower forest until it is invaded by the menacing rat Cluny the Scourge. One young mouse inside the abbey, Matthias, begins his quest to find the sword of the legendary Martin the Warrior, the sworn protector of Redwall and its inhabitants. As the peace-loving and caring citizens of Redwall defend their land against the rat horde, Matthias heads out into the world to find the sword, encountering numerous adventures along the way. This novel is a page turner, and the 400+ pages absolutely fly by. It is easy to become engrossed in the world that Jaques has created, and to appreciate the harmony within the abbey walls and the disorder in the cuthroat rat army.There are great adventures here, comparable to Frodo's journey to Mordor with the one ring. Perhaps this series is meant for the younger crowd, but there is plenty here to engross any fans of fantasy literature, and &quot;Redwall&quot; is only the tip of the iceberg, as this series has spawned a dozen or so books. Brian Jaques and his more accesible writing style make this an unmissable book for readers young or old."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This is the greatest book ever! If I could give it a highter rating I would give it a 100. It is great, full of mystery, humor, tragedy, good food and evil villians. The quest of Matthias is great and so is the mental agonation of Cluny. The best character is Basil Stag Hare. This is a book I would recommend to anyone!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"These books are aimed at the 9-12 year old age group, but as a 35 year old kid at heart, I've got to tell you, I love the Redwall books.The characters are loveable, the villains are \\"hateable\\", the scenery is vivid. I love everything about these books.I highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This has got to be one the best books ever. The only book better is the vile village by lemony snicket. It starts off somewhat boring but don't worry it gets better. There is even a war but not as bad as the Lord of The Rings. It's great for building vocabulary and is a great book overall. This book is somewhat expensive but it is most definetly worth it. I'd give it 5 thumbs up if I had 5 thumbs."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Here's something I believed prior to reading the book \\"Redwall\\". In the fantasy literature genre of juvenile books boys enjoy, writers tend to have a great deal of difficulty writing strong female characters. Just look at C.S. Lewis's \\"The Narnia Chronicles\\", where women are not allowed to fight, for example. Normally, such books will contain a single strong female character and that's the end of that. There's one in Lloyd Alexander's books, one in the \\"Wrinkle in Time\\" books, one in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" books, one in the \\"Harry Potter\\" books, etc.That said, imagine my surprise and delight when I discovered \\"Redwall\\". The story of a small mouse defending his Abbey has become a modern classic. And how many female warriors are in this book? I honestly can't say because they FILL the pages of this rightly popular series. Where else can you say that? Boys love the \\"Redwall\\" books, and for good reason. These readable little gems of fiction are packed with beautiful language, images, and prose that teach without seeming to. Want your kid to learn words like \\"tranquility\\" and \\"sibilant\\"? Want them to be interested in something that takes violence and war with an attitude that isn't flip or offhand? Want them to be entranced by fine storytelling? Finally, do YOU want to read something yourself that draws heavily on British culture and traditions without falling into remarkably dull passages for pages at a time? If so, I recommend \\"Redwall\\" wholly and without hesitation. And with its books being cranked out regularly by Mr. Jacques, I'm happy to say that there will be more and more of these beauties as time goes by."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I loved Redwall. This book was a heartwarming tale about th peaceful creatures of Redwall Abbey defending themselves from an evil rat lord. The strategic planning and surprises of the book are great. I look forward to more Jacques books in the future. I am on Mattimeo right now, and although the plots follow the same pattern, they are still great books.

Even though it's &quot;below my reading level,&quot; I found it more interesting than books by authors like Stephen King and Jane Austen. It wasn't because King's and Austen's books were too hard-- I've read books by those authors and they weren't easy or hard. Redwall was just more interesting. The plot was more fun, the characters more real (even though they were all animals), the writing more... charming."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"The Redwall books are the best books I have ever read.

Read it.I picked Redwall up in my local library because it was thick. After reading the cover, I thought that it looked interesting, so I checked it out. For the rest of the day, I was engrossed in the book, living through an experience that I doubt I will ever go through again.Redwall has the goodguys winning through, and unlike many books out today, the mice in the abbey are not semi-good. Their &quot;goodness&quot; is not questioned.Cluny is a perfect warlord. His horde feels like an army that is going out to conquer the countryside.The descriptions in this book are amazing. Page after page is filled with them (Jacques wrote this book for the children of a blind hospital, and he wanted to be able to describe everything). The whole book has the feel of a classic.Although this book is only $6 or so, it is a priceless gem.

I liked Redwall so much, I wrote a story like it.The mole and sparrow speech were hard to understand at first, but now I can even talk like them.My favorite characters are Warbeak, Matthias, Log-a-log, Cornflower, and Basil Stag Hare.

They are also the lead defenders of Redwall.If you liked Redwall, be sure to read Brian Jaques' other books."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"The story was fun and just what we needed as we drove around on our vacation. The major complaint I had with the recording was the vocal and sound quality. The characters' voices were often times very inconsistent with regard to the sound levels. Some character's had very grating voices, and when they would yell, it was literally painful.

Eventually he realizes that he needs to restore the impervious legendary sword to the Abbey. Matthias sets out following clues with his friend Methuselah to find the sword. This quest leads him through all sorts of adventures. He meets all sorts of creatures, like Basil Stag Hare (noble creatures, stags), Captain Snow, Squire Julian, Sparrows, Guosim Shrews and even an adder in a quarry.

I was gurtly afeared of the villan 'Cluny the Scourge' for i believed he was a viscious brute. I was afraid of him. I thought the hero to be, like myself a runt, however brave and coragous. However he was not an eel like myself. He was a mouse. I am afraid of mice because they try to eat my coat. Oi loike moi coat oi do. The story was a little advanced for me but it would apear to all ages. I enjoyed the viscious battles and was made hysterical by the savagery. There was a symbolic resemblance in the foremole 'GUNTER' to my ancestor Brother Gentlebi. However this story could have been improved if there had been guns."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"The success of any fantasy book depends on the reader being able to suspend his or her disbelief and the author not presenting inconstencies that jar the reader's acceptance of the fantasy world. Early on there were a couple moments when I thought Jacques was going to lose me - for instance, why do fish lack the sentience of the terrestrial creatures? - but as time went on they became fewer and further between.As someone who grew up with animal books like Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH and Kipling's Just So Stories, I found that Redwall holds up well with those classics. The book is definitely structured for young readers: there are few moral ambiguities in characterizations, in most cases foreshadowing is almost immediately resolved, and there's an extremely happy ending. Given that, the book also has a surprisingly high body count; granted I recall that Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom was brutal at times, but there's rarely a skirmish here where someone doesn't meet a grisly end. Ultimately, I think the messages of teamwork, good triumphing over evil, and a healthy appreciation for nutbrown ale, er, I mean, the realization that the smallest among us are not necessarily the least will remain with readers longer than the particularly sticky demises of the book's major villains ... at least I hope so.Right now my son's in the Winnie-the-Pooh stage of animal books (although he does enjoy the Rats of NIMH DVD). When he gets a bit older and outgrows those - not that we ever really do - I'll probably give this series a try with him. I'm a bit concerned with the issues of mortality it might raise, but if I read it with him I'll be able to judge his sensitivities firsthand. All in all, the Redwall series appears to be a winner."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This book is as good as Harry Potter, and in some ways better. It's about a young mouse named Matthias, the Luke Skywalker of the book, who is the only hope of a peaceful Abbey in the face of an invading rat army led by the cycloptic and ruthless Cluny the Scourge. Matthias must first find the sword of a legendary Redwall warrior, who died many years before. Although there are plenty of great characters, my favorite is Asmodeus, the evil pit viper who is the guardian of the sword.This book has plenty of action, mild language, a little romance, and lots of suspense. The only bad thing about this book is the ridiculous way in which Cluny is defeated in the end."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I realize that Redwall is intended for those under the age of 13, but I don't necessarily think that should exlude the rest of us from enjoying the book. Either I am overestimating the literary capabilities of children or Jacques is underestimating them, because this book seems like it would be more appropriate for 7-9 year olds with the exception of its length. I did read the book in a day, so it is enjoyable, I just wish that Jacques would've at least thrown in a few subtle adult themes or concepts for us more sophisticated (yeah righ!) readers to gnaw upon."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Have you ever been in a situation were you are making a celebration of a year of peace, and all of a sudden a mean person or in the case of this story named &#65533;Red Wall&#65533; by Brian Jacques a mean black &#65533;Rat&#65533;Matthias one of the main characters in the story has gathered to celebrate a year of peace and abundance.

Though there are many characters in the story which can make this story quite difficult to follow, the main character Matthias is the one that most sticks out in my mind. Though he is a mouse he acts with human qualities showing fear, intimidation as well as emotion throughout the story. The characters replicate human qualities so well that the reader can hardly tell that they even are animals.The plot was very complex to understand and was difficult to follow. The true challenge of understadning the dialect as well as what was going on throughout the story.Despite the constant plot twists and turns the characters Matthias, Cluny as well as Abbot Mortimer made for delightful creatures which greatly enhanced the story to its fullness. Redwall was full of colorful characters as well as good content.I enjoyed the story because of the way the author makes every creature an indiviual in their own right which made them so much more real to the reader.Redwall makes it archtypes and other mythical stories rank high on book review charts.I found that though some parts were dull and not very substantial to the storyline I also found that there emotions that they express makes up for the lack of bordem in the novel. Though a few points were made to be recognized the story makes us think of who we are and how well we can relate ourselves to the actual woodland creatures of Redwall."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall is a book about Matthias, a young mouse who lives in Redwall Abbey.

However, they are still a great read. I have read 3 Redwall books and they were all great.This is a must read. I think it is one of the best series.The books have about 400 pages in them, but is a great book to read if you are 10 or older. I found this book very enjoyable.

Matthias must embark upon a great adventure seeking out the forgotten sword of Martin the warrior of Redwall. Without the sword, Redwall Abbey does not stand a chance against the evil rat, Cluny the Scourge.Although this book is considered a kids book it should be for any person who has a brain in their head and knows how to read.

When I was reading this book, I couldn't put it down. My family was watching my favorite video, but I told them that I didn't want to watch it because I wanted to read Redwall. This book is outstanding and I'm sure almost anyone can find this book enjoyable. Although I have found other books more exciting and adventurous, this one will always be on my top 10 of books that I read. When you read Brian Jacques' books, he takes you away to another world full of adventure, excitement, and an enjoyable time. If you choose to read only one book in your lifetime, read Redwall by Brian Jacques."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I think that this book is really good because it explains everything in detail and does not leave you hanging and confused."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"The Redwall books are now without a doubt my favorites, my teacher recommended them to me and I fell in love with them. When I'm reading, I can actually feel what's happening, like I'm there watching it happen. I will read for hours, not wanting the book to end. ...When I'm reading, I feel like I'm living in two worlds; the first is wonderful Mossflower, or the Abbey, or Salamandastron, and second is the vague feeling of the real world around me. You may be surprised that a fifth grader can feel this emotion, but it happens to me all the time. I truly love these books, and I encourage everyone to read them, because even though the perfectly woven tale will end, the only way it can end is for you to start at the beginning. :-)"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This is a very good book.

I couldn't put it down after I started reading it. The main character is a young ambitious mouse named Matthias. His hero is a mouse named Martin the Warrior, even though Martin is dead. Matthias finds a riddle that explains where the hero's sword is. Matthias goes on a quest to find the sword, his friends defend Redwall Abbey from Cluny the Scourge and his army of rats, ferrets, weasels, and stoats. Matthias makes a lot of good friends while searching for the hero's sword, and saves Redwall from Cluny and his horde.

Rewall is sad, funny, and has lots of action(Note to parents:This book has a few minor swears(Hell)and has slaying, blood and gore, and some violence so I would recommend childern under 6 should not read this book).

I have also read the book and think it is a delightful adventure that boys and girls will love. It has a clear meaning of good and evil with virtues that you want to instill in your children.

But one day, a threat overshadows the creatures of all Mossflower woods, Cluny the Scourge has come! Cluny, the enormous sea rat with his eye patch on showing only his one gleaming eye and his long, strong tail with the poison tip on it. And Cluny wants only one thing, he wants to take over Redwall Abbey as his own!Cluny sends them a message: Surrender or die. And the Redwall creatures answer him, they will fight him. The Redwall creatures Constance the badger, Jess the squirrel and her son Silent Sam, Foremole, Basil Stag Hare, and others are fiercely determined to stop Cluny and his rat hordes from taking over Mossflower. But Matthias, the young mouse and Methuselah, the old record keeper, believe that victory will be ensured for them only if they can find the legendary sword of Martin the Warrior. Following clues and riddles, they find out that the sword is on the highest point of the Abbey, on the weather vane. Jess the squirrel bravely climbs to the very top but is attacked by sparrows. Jess comes down safely bringing down one young female sparrow. The put the sparrow called Warbeak inside a basket and keep her prisoner. Jess says that the sword was not there and they are all disappointed. But Matthias, being able to catch on to the sparrow's language, discovers from Warbeak that the sword was taken by the king of sparrows, King Bull Sparra.Matthias, taking Warbeak as a guide, goes to the sparrows place high above in the attics of the Abbey. Warbeak and Matthias becomes friends and that is what saves him when the sparrows start attacking him. Warbeak tells everyone that Matthias came to return her to her tribe. The young mouse is made into a pet for Warbeak and her mother Dunwing. Dunwing tells him that King Bull Sparra did have the sword but it had been stolen by the deadly poisonous adder, Asmodeus.Can Matthias escape the sparrows to try to get the sword back? And even if he does, will he be able to defeat the deadly snake, Asmodeus? Asmodeus with his eyes that can charm it's victims and his poisonous teeth? And will the Redwall animals be able to defeat Cluny?This is the first book written in the Redwall Series, though if you were to read the books in time order, books like \\"Martin the Warrior\\", \\"Mossflower\\", \\"Mariel of Redwall\\", and \\"The Bellmaker\\" are before this book. As with all of the Redwall Series, I love the hare, Basil Stag Hare, with his military ways, his enormous appetite, his humor, and his faithfulness to stick with his friends. Really like Silent Sam, the squirrel, too! Also love all the riddles and puzzles in which Matthias and Methuselah had to solve to find the sword."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Brian Jaques brings to life in the Redwall series a fantasy lived by many young children: animals that talk and live thier own human like lives, Mice, squirrels, otters, birds, rats, weasels, a badger and other critters populate tis popular series, which tends to mock medevil human life.Along with a stunning ability to make animals work in a social group much like humans, he seems to have an overwhelming knowledge of cooking, swordplay, and herbal healing.I recommend this book to anyone with children that are into fantasy and animals, if your children like Stuart Little, or Cats&amp;Dogs, give this series a try."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I think that this book is a great book to read because it will keep your attention. There are many interesting characters in this book such as sparrows, snakes, badgers, moles, rats, mice... This book is about an army of rats lead by the evil Cluny who tries to take over Redwall. Matthias is trying to get back Martin the Warriors's sword from... whoever has it. In this book and especially in the battles lots of characters die."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This book has the same pattern like the other Redwall series: A hero is found out from Salamandastron or Redwall, they go on a quest with riddles, some enemy turns up to capture Salamandastron or Redwall, ... and there's the last battle where things look hopeless ... . Still, this book was really fun,and in my opinion, it's the best book in the Redwall series I have read so far! My favorite animals are always the hares and the otters. They are so funny and so....heroic. The hares' way of speaking are really funny, it's an old English way of speaking. Otters are always referring some things with water and ships. Somehow, mice just don't make good heroes. I think otters and badgers are much better heroes than mice.I strongly recommend you to read it. Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall is a really good book. I loved it and I am not one of those big readers, but I really did like this one. If you like stuff like King Arthur you will really enjoy this book, even if you don't like that medieval stuff but you, like action adventure books you would really like this one.It has warfare and violence. It also has romance (just a little), death , and a whole lot of fighting. So if you like any of this stuff you will like this book.The main character of the book is Matthias a young mouse from Redwall abbey,who really looks up to Martin the warrior the late defender of Redwall.

J.K.Rowling takes second place. No other book I have ever read induces such inspiration, fun, humour, great battles, quests, riddles and tear jerking happiness. No magic wands, but plenty of heart.

No little animal in Redwall is hungry and everyone does their share of work. Redwall has never seen war since their founder, a warriormouse named Martin, had past away. Without knowing how to fight made the town of Redwall very vulnerable even with its towering walls and fearsome history. An evil rat and his infamous army seem to like the looks of Redwall and their treasure. After the mice of Redwall hear of the evil rat they start to form a full army of their own, but with no training Redwall is soon attacked and many Redwallers are injured. Soon, learning the ways of raw war, Redwallers start to become a worthy enemy. Meanwhile a young mouse named Matthias begins a search for the prized sword of Martin. I loved this book like I love any of Brian Jacques' books. It had an excellent plot that went in two directions. The end of every chapter left me wanting so much more.

But I recomend this book to redwall fans."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"The book Redwall will be a good book if you enjoy tall tales and folklore. If you are a romance or a nonfiction type person, than Redwall would not be the book for you. This tall tale is about a little peaceful town called Redwall, or so I thought. Redwall was no longer the peaceful little town when Cluny arrived. Cluny the Scourge was someone that everyone in Redwall despises. Cluny is determined to take over Redwall and destroy it. But the Abbot and his crew are not about to let that happen. No one is going to destroy Redwall as long as Matthias is around. To find out more read the book for yourself."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Judging the book by its cover, I thought Brian Jaques work would be an intelligent flight of the imagination. What I found instead was a book that seemed to read more like a cartoon movie and borrow plots from countless other works before his. The language at times was so simple and fractured that I couldn't believe it got past the editor's nose, and at other times the sentences were so packed with difficult vocabulary words I can only imagine the frustration of a young reader who would have to keep stopping midsentence to seek out an adult or look to a dictionary to make a what was just read coherent. By all means, I am in favor of stretching a child's vocabulary, but to write a child's book in total disregard of the language of an average child?I also found several passages confusing, such as a mistakes in referencing the evil ferret as a &quot;her&quot; in some places and a &quot;he&quot; in others.I must admit, though, that something pulled me through to the end, and it was a good outline for a story. I guess I'm just disappointed with the end result."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"My daughter is an avid reader to say the least. I love to read as well and generally read any book before she does (yes, I'm a bit over protective..) but I have to say this:While this first book is extremely creative, the author is long-winded and overly descriptive.If you're a Redwall fan, GREAT, I certainly don't begrudge anyone, but to us this book was a huge disappointment after all the hype."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This book is so great I can read it over and,over again. If you want a great book this is the absoulute BEST!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Some people have said that this book is for adults as well as children, but that definitely isn't the case here. Some books are classified as children's or young adults' (e.g. His Dark Materials; The EarthSea series;) which are really for adults. Some other series for children can also be enjoyed by adults, eg Wrinkle in Time. But this book is really only good for children. Most adults won't even enjoy it, unless they like reading children's books to get them in a nostalgic mood. The concepts are presented in a simple fashion, the language is also very plain, characterization is at a minimum and the plot isn't too complicated. This reminded me of Watership Down, but at a much simpler level. A good read for a young child (around 9 yrs old or less), maybe; but I didn't like it much."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This book occupies an odd place on the \\"children's book\\" shelf: it attracts young readers with mice and other forest cutesies but delivers action that is often graphically cruel--way beyond kid-book level, in my opinion. And yet the characters seem too cutesy to attract older readers. After seeing too many times the tears and the shock on my 8-year-old's face, I felt the need to gloss over some of the graphically violent stuff,despite my aversion to censorship of any kind. I wouldn't recommend this one for anyone under 11 or 12, and only then if readers/listeners don't mind fuzzy little forest creatures getting graphically impaled, drowned, and/or crushed alive."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Considering the accolades given this book by Harry Potter fans desperate to tide themselves over between books, I am quite surprised at how mechanically this book reads - characters are shallow, everything is a move between plot points, and the villans who start off sounding so evil seem to be thier own worst enemy.Most frustrating of all is the fact that good ideas and great characters like Silent Sam and Asmodeoussss (very creepy) are squandered. One of my biggest complaints has to do with the way conflicts with the villans are resolved. In the interest of not giving away anthing to those who will enjoy this book, I will only say that my reaction to these resolutions was &quot;What? That's it?&quot;.Ultimitely, this is geared for 13 year old boys who want &quot;action, action, action&quot;. Jerry Bruckheimer if you wanted to make a kids film, this is your source material."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I have to say 'Redwall' is one of the worst books I've ever tried to read. Jacques tries over and over to get you attatched to the characters(with scanty success) just to kill them off in disgusting ways. The plot is centered around a rather uncreative point - a rat attacking some (talking!)mice. The book seemed to be five million pages long -I could barely force myself to wade through it. In my opinion, the violence and bad language make it inapropriate for children. Don't waste your time on it!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This has got to be the best series of books ever written. While this book is excellent, the stories only get better. Each book is better than the last."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"My favorite book is Redwall by Brain Jacques, because of three things included in this amazing story. One of the things is the wars of property. Cluny the rat is the attacker of Redwall with his horde of rats, stoats, ferrets, and a fox. The protectors of Redwall, witch mainly contain a badger, mice, moles, squirrels, and some hedgehogs. The weapons they used in it are things that you would be able to use in real life, the story it basicly medieval times with animals in place of humans. Next, is the search for the famed Martian the Warrior's awesome sword. When Matthias and Redwall's abbey leader, the Abbot, start on this search for Martian's sword they have to go through mind bobbling puzzles. Whenever they do solve the puzzle they figure out that the sword is missing and that there is only the shield. Once Matthias finds out that sparrows have taken the sword he must climb to the tree and retrieve it! After a long search through the nest of the sparrows he figures out that the sparrow King his self had it stolen by a dreaded snake of everyone's fear. The last thing I like about it is that how clever Cluny is, even though he ends up never getting control of Redwall. At one point he has a black night rat climb Redwall Abbey's great towering walls to steal the last picture of Martian the Warrior. He also comes up with the idea of fire slingers, rocks covered in vines and oil lit on fire, and throws them over the Abbey's massive walls. As you can see, this book should be a must read, and all continuums of it."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I LOVE ALL OF BRIAN JACQUES BOOKS, HE IS THE GREATEST AUTHOR ON THE PLANET.

AFter that I went to the bookstore to find it. Had I seen the paperback version first, I would never have read it. They market it like a sword and sorcery book.

Brian Jacques describes the combat and defeat with such detail, and the way he describes the hare dialogue is amazing. When you are in a quiet place and reading Redwall, the combat is enough to make you feel you're in it.

All about animals that you would never have thought could or would happen. It leads you to really think it over.

The characters are well developed and there is plenty of action and adventure. Matthias the Mouse, Constance the badger and Basil Stag Hare, along with other creatures at Redwall, defend themselves against the forces of Cluny the Scourge. Cluny is a very good character. He is completely evil. I like the way the moles talk. Or as they would say, &quot;Oi do loik the woi de gurt moles talk, hurr.&quot; I have read 7 of the Redwall books in about a year.

The book has a great plot, a lot of action that isn't bad for almost any age(they are animals, for crying out loud, not people!). When I was young I loved it! They put moles, mice and other animals fighting wars. Does it sound childish? Yes, but thats the good thing about it. I believe that this book is perfect for children no matter what! Cluny is sort of a cold blooded character, but still, we aren't talking about people getting killed. These books are sort of long too, so that will help kids get used to reading long books that they could read later. I read these books with my mom when I was young and she got hooked on them too!

Jacques' book is filled with extraordinary mice, foxes, squirrels, badgers, rats, and hares that can communicate to each other in the same way as humans do. Readers who enjoy reading fantasy books will enjoy reading Redwall. Redwall is filled with all kinds of animals who fight at the Redwall Abbey and do battle with sea rats. The animals of this story encounter mighty badgers, mice, and hares that fight thousands of battles all alone. The pages of Jacques books are action packed.Upon completing Redwall readers can search out the other books in Jacques' series. Jacques' other books in his series are Mossflower, Mattimeo, Mariel of Redwall, Salamadstron, Martin the Warrior, and The Long Patrol.Brian Jacques is the author of the best selling Redwall novels, as well as many related books. He was born, raised, and still lives in Liverpool, England. Jacques has been a merchant seaman, railway fireman, longshoreman, a long-distance truck driver, a bus driver, a boxer, a postmaster, and a stand-up comic. All this adds to his experiences to make him a great author."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Though this book is not my favorite in the series, I did enjoy it. The plot was excellent, and I loved the vivid descriptions. Not to mention that I kind of like war stories, and the main character is one you will definately fall in love with.Still, him changing from clumsy orphan to heroic warrior...that happened just a little too fast. One minute he's a bumbling little kid (I thought he was a kid, anyway, but apparently he's all grown up? This confused me), next he's the icon of the Abbey, on his way to becoming the finder of a legendary sword and rescuer of Redwall. If the author was trying to show how even the silliest of children can become heroes, he didn't do a very good job of it, since the main character wasn't a silly child for more than a few chapters, when suddenly he shoots up to being a great warrior. I dunno--some people might dissagree with me, but that's what I think.This book also got a little slow at some points, and I had a bit of trouble matching up what was happening when and who was doing what while the other person was doing this...probably because the author goes to one place in one chapter, then leaves those characters and visits others for a few more chapters, then finally goes back to the ones he was talking about a few chapters ago. Normally I like this, but I think the author went just a little overboard. You'll see what I mean if you decide to read this book.Still, it was an enchanting story, and I highly recommend it. And if you feel the same way that I did after you've checked it out, don't let that discourage you from reading the other books in the series (see Mossflower, Martin the Warrior, Marlfox, etc.)--they're much better that this one, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This is the first book i read in the series. I though it was a well balanced book but im sure the other sequels are better.

I liked it because it was different from most of the other fantasy books that I've read. All the characters are animals of some sort. Although it was kind of hard to get used to the animals talking, walking lik humans, fighting, it was still good. The plot of this book is that there is a Santuary for all animals that are good. It is called Redwall. Redwall is wanted from lots of evil animals want Redwall for their home. To them it would be a great place to do evil. So this Rat named Cluuny the Scourge wants to take Redwall. Matthias, a mouse, helps the animals that live at Redwall to get rid of Cluuny. He finds this sword from an old Mouse warrior named Martin.

Mice, Moles, Hedgehogs, Badgers and many other woodland creatures are preparing for a great feast in honor of the beginning of Summer of the Late Rose. Amidst all of the happiness, a terrible villain by the name of Cluny the Scourge is on his way to take the beautiful sandstone Abbey of Redwall as his own and crush anything and everything in his way. The safety of Redwall and its inhabitants depends upon a small, nearly insignificant young mouse named Matthias. This is the story of Redwall, by Brian Jacques.Despite the woodland creatures that make up the cover and characters in the book, the imagery in Jacques' writing makes it PG-13 at times (depending on if the reader can \\"see\\" the story. Since the story is set in medieval times, Jacques was not afraid to keep some half-intense violence in the book. Some authors write books just for reading. However, Jacques was able to include riddles and puzzles in to his books. It makes the reader interact and get \\"sucked\\" into the books. You can almost see the action!At the end of the book, many questions are sure to form in any experienced reader's mind. Luckily, these questions are answered by the equally fantastic books after it in the enchanting Mossflower Woods for the reader to enjoy! But be warned! The imagery in the book (and the ones after it) may put a sanguinary image in the mind of some readers, depending on how \\"mature\\" they are.In conclusion, all book worms, young or old can find a little piece of happiness in this whimsical tale and the many that come after it. Redwall is a great book because it has a sort of spell with it that makes readers want to visit the beautiful sandstone abbey. This book is undoubtedly one of the best books of our time."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"First of all let me say I quite enjoyed the book. If you are completely new to the Redwall series you should know that it is basically an epic tale about war between several types of animals. This is in every book in the Redwall Series!Now you shouldn't shun this book just because it deals with a slightly childish topic. All characters have a near human personality and either have your heartfelt compassion or solid dislike. Now I don't want to go into to much detail, but the story follows the general plot of everyone being happy, bad things happen, good vs. bad, good guys win. The book also has a few flaws. The story has a sort of repeating tone to it, meaning that is sometimes gets a little boring.Overall I gave this book a 4/5 since it is intriguing yet dull in certain areas. Check out the book for yourself and see how you like it."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Easilly one of my favorite books of all time.

A great plot and storyline and beautifully imaginative characters. The animals in this story are enough to talk about alone. They have very descriptive personalities and even different dialect.

Like Harry Potter, subtle things in the beginning, tie in the end. The only problem with it though, was that in the beginning, Matthias was a bumbling, young mouse, pretty much still a child. In the end though, he had suddenly turned from a 9 year old to a 20 year old, which I thought was a little bit odd.

What i liked about the book was how Mathias went from a common mouse to a warrior mouse. Mathias goes from doing everyday things to manipulating birds and controlling a guerilla force of shrews. What i did not like about this book was that the author had a lack of description of size. In the book, mice work with badgers and squirrels, who obviously aren't the same size in real life. This book does have a message, and i think it is that if you stick to your goals in life, you won't ever be dissapointed. This is important because everyone should have a goal in life.

I recently finished this book as a summer reading assignment for my school, and I have to say that it was a definite page-turner. After reading this book, it inspired me to go out and buy the next book in the series. Brian Jacques, the author, is truly an amazing writer. All of his characters are really descriptive, allowing you to put an amazing picture of them in your head. His heroes were awesome: Mathias the Warrior, Constance the Badger, Brother Methuselah, Abbot Mortimer and many more. There were also great villains: Cluny the Scourge, Cheesethief, Darkclaw, Killconey, Redtooth and many more. The minor characters played crucial parts in this book as well. To name a few: Sela and Chickehound the foxes, Captain Snow, Squire Julian Gingivere, Cornflower, Basil Stag Hare, Warbeak of the Sparra and once again many more. Not only were the characters great and plentiful, but the plotline was also tremendous. It's about a community of rats, mice, squirells, etc. that was formed many years ago by \\"Martin the Warrior\\". He was a legend and the walls of Redwall gave aid to any who was in need. Then Cluny and his horde tried to conquer it. In order to keep Redwall's community from being breached all had to step up and fight. This lead to the need of a savior, a leader, a warrior. Mathias the rat would no longer be called that, for he had to solve the ancient puzzles left to him. \\"I-am that is\\", Mathias the Warrior! In conclusion, if you want the greatest fantasy and imaginative story ever, read Redwall by Brian Jacques."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I am a big fantasy fan; and every time I found myself at the bookstore I would see the vast amount of books by Brian Jacques on the shelves and wonder if it was a series I would like.

The author uses a wide variety of animals in order to create this fantasy setting, and portrays the typical battle of good versus evil in a crisp and simple way.The main character in this first book of the series is a small mouse, Matthias, who is a novice and who dreams with becoming a warrior someday. His idol is Martin the Warrior, who according to many was the bravest mouse to ever set foot on earth. Matthias lives in Redwall and is part of the Order of Abbot Mortimer, and Order that professes peace and that has vowed never to harm another living creature. But all this peace and happiness is now in jeopardy, since Cluny the Scourge, a ruthless rat with an evil army, is heading towards Redwall, leaving mayhem through his path.Cluny is the subject of a legend used by parents to scare their kids and to get them to do what they request, but now the threat is real and has to be faced. The terrifying rat is relentless, but hides a secret of his own, since in his nightmares, he receives the visit of a brave mouse that puts him to shame. The mouse is no other than Martin, who also talks to Matthias in his dreams. When the attack finally comes, we get to see a David versus Goliath type of fight that keeps up the excitement and that looks as if it will only end with the total destruction of one of the contestants.Jacques proves that he has a lively imagination, and presents a world with many different creatures, who behave by the rules of what people usually associate them with. For example, the rats are evil, the foxes are sly, etc. The narration has a good pace and the book never gets boring, so overall it is a recommended experience. People that like straightforward plots will probably enjoy this novel. However, those looking for complex fantasy, in the style of George R. R. Martin, will be disappointed."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"In elementary school the librarian would give us booktalks, reccommending the typical realistic fiction books that she thought would suit us the best. I hated all of these. At one point she warned against Redwall, saying that it was too violent for younger kids. When I got the book for Christmas in '96 at age nine, and read it, it instantly became one of my favorite books. And the violence only adds to it.I hold this book in the highest regard. It showed me what a joy reading could be, introduced me to the fantasy genre, and the whole concept of escapism. If you would like to enter a fabulous fantasical world of legend, courage, fabulous villians, and some old-fashioned good versus evil, then this is your book.Out of all the Redwall books, Cluny the Scourge is by far the greatest bad guy, partly becasue he is the only one of the lot that is not a coward. The other characters are solid and well-concieved, but Cluny is still the best. I admit that when you are older, the book loses a bit of its edge. Or maybe this is because I have been desensitized by a brutal academic career at private high school. Oh well. The description is charming and vivid. (The feasts are especially well done) What impresses me about this book is that unlike other filtered 'nice' children's books, this book has some substance. Some of the main good guys die, something uncommon in children's literature, and going to the violence, the violence is described with the same vivid detail as all the good stuff, including all the cruelty and viciousness that goes with it. If you don't like violence, or you are an overprotective parent, then you may want to avoid Redwall. Mossflower might be worse for violence. Anyhow, Redwall is absolutely wonderful and a must-read for anyone who wishes to enter the realm of fantasy.I came to love Redwall even more when I found that my paperback, an Avon 1990 first-printing, was a hard-to-find collectable. I will treasure it forever. I also hope that in '06 they come out with a 20th anniversary edition. I will buy it.Okay, I will now end my spillage of positive feedback. The end."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall is an amazing yet interesting story about mice and other woodland animals. As they battle against evil rats and other evil animals, one mouse named, Matthias, finds out more about Redwall and its history. This fantasy is a very long book and has a variation of the length of chapters. It has 330 pages. If you like long, descriptive, animal books, you will probably like this book. I would give this book a five star rating! If you are ready to find out a lot about one little mouse that can do a lot I would recommend this full of action packed book!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This book is a pretty good book. It has great detail and description but kinda gets old and boring after a while. Picture the three musketeers as mice or other small creatures, adn you've got redwall. The same swashbuckling tales, the same plot of some evil animal taking power and somehow interfering with the peaceful creatures of Redwall, the same glorious victory at the end. If you like books that just throws stuff at you out of the blue, say an attack form some tribe or whatever, then you'll like the Redwall series.

If you have not read any of the Redwallseries than set aside old harry thing and pick up Redwall. This novel is bursting with action,homliness, and crushing evil. The book starts off with young Matthias who has the spirit of Martin {the warrior and founder of Redwall Abbey} in him. Matthias must embark upon a great adventure seeking out the forgotten sword of Martin the warrior of Redwall. Without the sword, Redwall Abbey does not stand a chance against the evil rat, Cluny the Scourge.Although this book is considered a kids book it should be for any person who has a brain in their head and knows how to read. In my mind ,this book is rated 6 out of 5 stars. You heard all this from a twelve year old boy who loves to read."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I may be 17 but I enjoy the Redwall series alot. They are well written and take you on an adventure that you will never forget. May you be young or old, I recommend the Redwall series. They are a series of fantasy, magic, adventure, and unlikely heros that will keep the book up to your face until you are finished. You always feel like you're there with the characters.

If you have never read this book, I strongly suggest that you do. It is filled with action and excitement. I would have to say that Brian is one of the greatest authors of this century. The way he describes the food just gives you a feeling of hunger and thirst. He also has one of the greatest imaginations that I have ever come upon. I hope you enjoyed reading this because I sure enjoyed writing it for you."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Does it ever feel to you like you've never read a REALLY good book? Well now that can change! Once I picked up Redwall, I had trouble putting it down! I even stayed up until 2:30 AM just to finish it! If you're the type of person who loves lots of different types of fiction, I'd start reading it! It has long journies, riddles, never ending friends, an evil rat warrior, a noble sword, and a warm hearted main character who sets off to find the warrior within him to save his friends and home. It even has a little bit of romance! (Not a lot though!) I highly recommend this book! If you're like me, when you finish it, you'll want to set on a journey just like the main character, but to find the next book in the series!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This is the cutest book ever! The characters and the world they live in are rich with charming detail. The writing is upbeat and eminently readable. Short chapters make it easy to quickly progress through the book. The plot is intriguing and neither grandiose nor trivial. Brian Jacques has done a great job of writing about anthropomorphic animals without creating a childish story. He doesn't shelter his readers--bad things happen to the characters, and not only to the villains. He also achieves the proper balance between cuteness and gravity with the animals, which are adorable without being saccharine, and anthropomorphic without seeming too much like people. By populating his story with mice, rats, badgers, and otters, he creates a fantasy/historical setting that is believable and detailed while remaining slightly alien and therefore alluring. I loved this book both because the animals were so endearing and because it was one of the most enjoyable works of fantasy I have ever encountered. And yes, after finishing I immediately ran out to get the second book in the series (so far it seems to be even better than the first one.)I highly recommend Redwall to both children and adults who love animals and fantasy."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"\\"Redwall\\" is a book of friendship, war, and conflict. Author Brian Jacques incorporates drama, action, adventure, and comedy into this extremely entertaining story. Redwall gripped me and compelled me to continue reading through the night. At first, I was a little skeptical about reading this book. At first glance, it seems very childish, and after reading the inside cover, I still felt I should be looking at the Forgotten Realms or Robert Jordan novels. But, don't judge a book by its cover. I read it, and i do not regret it. It's amazing how brave little rodents can be. Jacques, despite choosing tiny creatures as heroes, wrote a compelling story, and believeable conflict. You felt as the characters felt. As the characters struggled, you struggled, as they were joyous, you were joyous, and any book that can pull you in like this one can, it is worth reading."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Good triumphs over evil...that is the resounding lesson that a reader will learn in this creative, free-spirited book. Despite the fact that disgusting rats run rampant throughout Mossflower and are trying desperately to claim Redwall as their own (under the leadership of the nastiest, most evil rat of all, Cluny the Scourge), the mice and woodland creatures of the Abbey work together providing support, hard-work, humor and love to triumph. There are plenty of reviews that will delve into the plot a little more and will give you an overview of what to expect. What I'd like to explore is the difference between this and other books on the market today....This book gives the reader a sense that, if one sets their mind to it, one can accomplish anything. Also, working closely with loved ones, having a brave heart and never doubting oneself will always make one a winner. Matthias, the mouse warrior, is the perfect role model for children and adults alike. He thinks not of himself and how he will benefit from a difficult decision, but how he can help everyone around him...even those he just met and may not be too fond of after first meeting (think of the Sparras and the Guerilla Union of Shrews). Lastly, Jacques keeps the gore and blood out of the book...he has an uncanny knack of describing the scenes (including death and defeat) without being overly descriptive of flying body parts or oozing blood.There are so many fun and interesting characters, too. From Sam the paw-sucking squirrel to Basil Stag Hare the eccentric warrior with the insatiable appetite, you'll find yourself rooting on the side of good and having a jolly good time at it.The language of the book is written in formal English...Jacques enchants you and you'll find yourself drooling at his descriptive writings about the food at the Abbey. He could make a pile of wet hay sound appetizing! Honestly, the reading will be slow going for younger children...not because it's boring, but because they will have to grasp his writing form. It's not written in the simplest form, which I applaud because it is educational as well as entertaining. I feel that, as children read, they will start to comprehend. His books are page-turners...and the family will be best to curl up beside the fire with this book and a kettle of popcorn. It will provide hours of fun (have your kids re-enact the scenes while you read aloud to them) and cherished family memories."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"When I was in the 7th grade, I had to read Pearls of Lutra. I rebelled against the book, believing that it was the dumbest, most idiotic book ever. I thought that Brian Jacques was insane to be writing a book about animals!Now that I am in the 9th grade, however, I LOVE Jacques&#65533; books! I enjoy reading about celebrations, adventure, and action. Redwall Abbey reminds me so much of my village of 49 residents, which makes this book more enjoyable to read.Mattimeo, a series to Redwall, is a fantastic fairy tale about peaceful woodlanders who live in Redwall. They are harmonious creatures who mind their own business and do not like to cause trouble; trouble always comes seeking them. Although, Redwall citizens are friendly animals, many other evil creatures do not like them, which puts the warriors of Redwall in many adventures.In this book, a huge feast is held at Redwall. Slagar the Cruel disguises his army of rats and ferrets into jesters and clowns. He disguises himself as a magician. The creatures of Redwall enjoy company and entertainment, so they allow the evil fox enter their abbey. While every creature is celebrating, some rats poison the punch, causing all the Redwall creatures to fall into a deep sleep. When the creatures awake from their sleep, they find the band of clowns gone. What&#65533;s worse, is their children are all missing and two of their Redwall friends are dead!Among the missing is Mattimeo, the great warrior mouse, Matthias&#65533; son, Sam squirrel, Tim and Tess Churchmouse, and some others. The angry parents and some of their friends go on a long search for their children. Along the way, they run into Jube, Orlando, Cheek, Log-a-log and his Guosim crew, and some others. The friends together trek south to find their children.While the brave warriors are gone rescuing the children, the remaining Redwallers are being invaded by General Ironbeak&#65533;s ravens, crows, and magpies!Mattimeo and other books by Brian Jacques are my favorite book series! I like how Jacques describes his characters and how he has more than one event happening. Jacques not only describes what Matthias is going through, but what Slagar the Cruel is doing, how the Redwall critters fend off General Ironbeak, and what General Ironbeak feels.My favorite characters in this book are Basil Stag Hare and Cheek, and of course the brave warriors. I like how B.S. Hare and Cheek always have a sense of humor and a generous appetite! I recommend this book for anyone who enjoys action, adventure, and comedy!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Last year my friend started reading a book called Redwall, and she told me it was the best book she had ever read. I didn't care much for the cover, besides being a very dog-eared old library book it showed a mouse standing on a wall and holding a sword, with a crowd of big ugly rats down below. I was also very disappointed in the book itself. How can you write a four-hundred page book on a group of talking mice and their peaceful but boring lives? I was amazed that they could find so many compliments to put on the back cover. But this year, when I found it on a cart in the library I tried reading it again and I finally got hooked, when I read about Cluny the Scourge's plans for capturing Redwall Abbey, the kingdom of the sparrows, the riddle of Martin the Warrior, and the dreaded snake, Asmodeuss. Now I am looking for the second Redwall book, and I hope it will be as good as the first. I recommend this book to anybody who likes animals and fantasy!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall, by Brian Jacques, was the best book I've ever read!!! It had adventure, suspense, romance, sad parts, happy parts, scary parts, and hilarious parts!!! Redwall told the story of a peaceful abbey of creatures who were under attack by the horrid rat, Cluny the Scourge. Cluny and his terrible minion of slaves wanted to take over Redwall, since it had so many priceless items and many hard-working creatures Cluny could use as slaves.The main character of Redwall is Matthias, a young resourceful warrior mouse destined to follow in the footsteps of Martin the Warrior. Martin the Warrior was the bravest creature to ever live, yet his body and famous weapons have never been found.

Inspired by the legend of the great warrior Martin, he sets out to find a legendary sword with which to defend his people. Meanwhile, the marauders, led by the chillingly evil Cluny the Scourge, besiege the Abbey. Before it's all over, Matthias will have to fight a dread serpent and, of course, Cluny himself. It all sounds familiar enough I suppose, except for one thing : Matthias is a mouse, Cluny is a rat, and the serpent isn't a dragon, it's actually a snake.Brian Jacques, whose Redwall series has become a well deserved bestseller, had the ingenious idea of combining classic fantasy elements, like those found in Tolkien, with animal characters, a la Watership Down, to create a story which is uniquely accessible to kids. After all, this isn't just good vs. evil, it's also little vs. big. Of course, I'm forty and the rats scared the beejezus out of me, so you might not want to try these with really little kids. But preteens who are anxiously awaiting the next installment of Harry Potter can fill their empty hours with these books which are every bit as good. And if you taking your kids on a long car ride, I particularly recommend the unabridged audio version, narrated by Jacques, but with additional voices--it's terrific.GRADE : A"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I just read this book.

First allow me to confess that I am a full fledged adult, 30 years old, with a full-time job, bills to pay, a house to maintain, etc. Having said that, I want to say that this book was truly wonderful. This is my first exposure to the &quot;Redwall&quot; series and anyone who would care to look at my recent Amazon.com purchases would see that I have many more books on the way. This series is truly addictive in the best sort of way. I think the thing I most liked about this story were the wonderful characters. Silent Sam the squirrel, Warbeak the sparrow, Constance the badger, and of course Matthias and Cluny the Scourge! So many other amazing characters as well. Cluny is probably one of the best villians in print. The story itself is full of mystery, legend, heroism, humor, bravery, sadness, valor, I could go on. The imagination of Mr. Jacques is truly astounding. He has created an entire universe and added fascinating characters to &quot;people&quot; it. What more could one ask for in a story? I have read that the entire &quot;Redwall' series encompasses over 8,000 pages, a truly monumental work. I am anticipating total immersion in these books to the exclusion of all else. In addition to it's wonderful content this book was quite simply a wonderful way to escape from the everyday stresses and concerns of the modern world. I would highly recommend this story to anyone who loves a tale of high adventure, valor, and mystery, and to those who just want to escape with a good tale. Immerse yourself in this world. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"'Redwall' is an exciting adventure that never slows, never bores, and never disappoints the reader. You could say it's a simple \\"good vs. evil\\" story between the good, honorable mice of Redwall Abbey and the evil forces of Cluny the one-eyed rat, but that would be an oversimplification. It's much more, largely in part to Brian Jacques and his skillful writing.As I was reading 'Redwall,' I realized that this book is the perfect transition between young adult and adult literature. If your child is bored with most of the books written for his level, but maybe is not quite ready for one of the heavies, 'Redwall' may be the answer. Jacques tells a very approachable story with a language that will be challenging for some younger readers, but not beyond their reach. His descriptions and characters are painted with more depth than the average young person's book, but the fun and excitement are retained. Jacques is to be applauded.If your child enjoys fantasy stories and is not quite ready for Tolkien, 'Redwall' is the perfect transition book/series.

It centers around the adventures of a clumsy, unsure young mouse called Matthias. He is forced to grow up abruptly with the arrival of Cluny the Scourge, a rat warlord who commands vast armies of murderous rats, ferrets, stoats, and weasels. Cluny's aim is to conquer the immense Redwall Abbey, which is Matthias's home. However, the Abbey's inhabitants are peaceful creatures, most of whom have never handled a weapon in their lives. The Abbey dwellers manage to keep Cluny at bay, but their skills are too poor to ward him off for too long. Meanwhile, Matthias has gone in search of a legendary sword that once belonged to the famous mouse warrior, Martin. He hopes to use the weapon to defeat Cluny's infamous army and save Redwall. Helped by different friends along the way, he finally discovers the sword's location, but is unprepared for the grave danger he stumbles across while searching for the sword...

It's the perfect story of good vs. evil, and I absolutely loved it. You feel as if you are right there with the mice and moles fighting for the well being of all woodland creatures of the future.

Yes, there are no humans in this fantasy world of furry friends and foes - only animals: mice, sparrows, badgers, squirrels, and of course evil rats, stoats, ferrets, foxes, and snakes - each with its own unique characteristics and contribution to make to this fantasy world.Conflict arises when Redwall Abbey is threatened by the notorious Cluny the Scourge, an evil one-eyed rat, with his band of equally nasty critters who want to claim Redwall as their own. The Redwall creatures need to resort to desperate measures to defend their territory, but ultimately it is the Matthias mouse who comes to the rescue, after discovering the famous sword of his hero, Martin the Warrior, and emulating his feats.Certainly there are weaknesses. Despite the clearly religious setting of the Abbey, it never becomes clear what kind of religion this is, and it never really functions in the story-line. There is a great deal of hellish imagery used in connection with Cluny's evil army, where rats &quot;look like the devil himself&quot;, use expletives such as &quot;by Satan's whiskers&quot; and &quot;by the claws of hell thunder&quot;, and join the devil in hell when they die. Perhaps Jacques is borrowing Christianity as a traditional image of the powers of heaven over against the powers of hell, to underline the struggle between good and evil. Matthias mouse also has his flaws. He is at times rather anti-authoritarian, arrogant, bad-tempered and unjustifiably rude to his enemies, frequently resorting to rather horrifying name calling that hardly befits a role-model.But despite this, it's not hard to see why children love this series. The fantasy world Jacques has created is compelling, and yet not complicated like that of Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;. The good characters are loveable, the evil ones equally despicable. The conflict between good and evil is easy to identify. There is no lack of originality, as readers are treated to forms of brilliant military strategy that they have never dreamed about. The creatures' creative schemes of attack and defence, and ingenious attempts to overcome the enemy are constantly charming. There is action aplenty, suspense, humour, even a touch of romance. And children are easily able to identify with Matthias, and join him on his journey to maturity.This series does not have the makings of a classic like Tolkien's work, because it is doubtful that the appeal of this book will extend much beyond its intended readers of ages 9-12. Adults who continue to enjoy Rowling's Harry Potter and Tolkien's Bilbo Baggins may find this book too uncomplicated and childish. But it would be unfair to criticize Jacques too much for this, because the simplicity of the story-line is precisely what has made this series appeal so strongly to the age group it is written for, and it is this strength that lies behind its incredible success. In the end, this book needs to be judged on its own merits - as a children's fantasy about animals. As such it is unquestionably successful, and deservedly so. Don't doubt for a moment that by introducing your family to Jacques' furry friends and foes you will be doing them a great favour!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Do you want to read a high-quality fantasy novel? Then I would refer you to the nearest library. Let it be a local, school, or your own personal library. Get there fast! I have just read &quot;Redwall&quot; by Brian Jacques. The book has 333 pages, but is definitely worth it. The main character is Matthis, an adventurous, young, and spirited orphan, left at the Redwall entrance. Redwall is a peaceful animal village that has beautiful and elegant . It also has arches and carved figures. The animals that inhabit it are ethical forest creatures. He is now, still young, but quite mature for his age. He has become one of the pack. Full of morales, and caring. Taking delicate procedures to keep others emotions in mind of all. These creatures have always helped others in peril. Now, Cluny the Scrouge, a rat known for being terrible and for taking over villages, is trying to take over Redwall. Since everyone in Redwall is refusing to surrender, they are forced to fight a awr with Cluny, even though it is against their ways. A part that I thought was quite descriptive and exciting was when Mathias and Guosim, a shreww friend of Matthias', fight the adder for possesion of Martin the Warriors' sword. the adder is a legendary snake, foe of all. He is known as &quot;Asmodeus&quot;, for the sound thta he makes. Asmodeus is huge, and legendarily known for his viciousness and poisoness fangs. I can't tell you who succeeds, though. Although slightly upseting, it really stood out as how war affects everyone. And it does. The brutality of war even affected Cluny. he literally went mad. I'd describe this book as adventurous and eventful. The characters are believable, but creativly amusing as animals. The plot is, at times difficult to follow, but is riviting at its higher points. I'd recommend this book for anyone who loves animals, but can stand slight gore. Also, this is a long book, 333 pages. So, anyone who can sit still for two seconds, i would probably recommend a shorter novel. I hope you choose this novel to read next."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I remember almost 5 years ago when I caught sight of a friend of mine reading a book called Redwall. I looked at it suspecially, why would my freind want to read a book with a mouse on the cover? (In the past the only fantasy I had been showed was the Narnia stories) I asked her and she told me it was one of the best books she had ever read. So of course I was intrigued and bought it myself. I was immeaditally opened up to a whole new world where animals could talk and laugh and cry and fight.This book tells the story of Redwall. It's a peacful Abbey ever since the brave Martin the Warrior banished away all the vermin. But when the legendary Cluny the Scourge acctacks, it's up to the mice to fight against them. And then there's Matthias, a strong willed mouse. Will he be the mouse to lead them to victory? And can he solve Martin the Warrior's riddle in time?

I actually found this book at a sale for 99 cents, but now that I've read it (twice) I know it's absolutly priceless, and even inspired myself to begin writing fantasy. This book is action packed, which I didn't expect when I first picked it up. It was the story of a mouse, and because of that, I expected it to be a children's story. Now that I've read it I see you do have to be mature but also young at heart. Matthias is the sort of cute little character you fall in love with at the begining of a story. Once you finish, though, you've realized how he's grown through the book. It's magical, it's colorful, and (believe it or not) it's action packed.

The large whip he held in his paw for slaying the innocent, his fake eye that looked like it looked at you everywhere you turned, everything about him scared me. The author of this book describes everything so well. He also has a very interesting background, having been born in England and occupying himself by stand-up comedy, truck driving, creating playwrights as well as a presenter for a BBC radio show, Jakestown. After reading that, one can assume where he gets all his outrageous ideas from. I really like the way that he winds the story together at the end, after it starts as two stories, then changes to probably six different stories, then back to one.

I would like to give my opinion: Martin the Warrior, (for in the beginning of Mossflower M comes from the north, and in the end of Martin the Warrior M begins southward) Mossflower, The Outcast of Redwall, Mariel of Redwall, The Bellmaker (in the end of Mariel, Mariel goes questing with Dandin, and in the beginning of Bellmaker, it is a year after they leave), Salamandastron, Redwall, Mattimeo.

I had to order the other two immediately in order to curb his withdrawl. Now all three of my boys (the other two are 9 and 5 1/2) are hooked.

I thought it must of been almost impossable to find the sword of Martin with so many riddles there are in this book, Matthias proved me wrong!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"My book is called Redwall. The authors name is Brian Jacques. He has wroten many books that are in the Redwall series. I would have to say that the genra of the book would be young adult- mystery. The book is about a mouse named Mathhias, and his whole goal is to find the sword of Martin the Warrior. He finds it, and succeds in saving his city, which is called Redwall. Also in the end he ends up killing Cluny the Scorage. Which is the main bad guy in the book. The book is much like the Hobbit series. With much action and many fighting sceens. So if you like the Hobbit, you would probably like Redwall, or vice versa. I loved this book and i think that most kids my age would also. If you like playing RPG's on the nintendo or watching adventurous movies and hate reading books like me. I garuntee you will still love this book. I loved the main character because he was always trying. He ws relentless always think up more ideas to find the sword or kill Cluny. I was also moved by how he accomplished all of it when he was only about my age. One of my fav. quotes in the book was when he said, &quot;They're coming, down the road! I can see them. I can see them!&quot; p. 48. this was when the church mouse and everyone else were waiting for the rats to come and this was one of the final battles between the two groups of rodents. When i read it i knew that this battle was going to be good, and it also left me hanging because it is right at the end of a chapter. Almost ever aspect of this book is good. It has action for some people, a little romance, and a whole lot of mystery. The only draw back of the book is that if you are to young then this book would be hard to read, or it might not be that interesting. Also if you were a little older than me it wouldn't be that interesting either. But if your my age give it a try!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Jacques world of mice, foxes, shrews, rats and other woodland creatures is both a delightful and scary place to visit.

Even though it is the first one I read I think it is a must read. I like how Brian Jacques put animals instead of humans. But the animals are like humans, they talk stand on their hind legs to walk. I like how they talk in different languages, like the Sparra folk talk very fast.Unlike most of the Redwall series, Redwall has a wildcat that is much bigger than mice. I like how Brian Jacques puts all kinds of animals in it; such as mice, badgers, hedgehogs, hares, rabbits, rats, foxes, stoats, weasels, snakes, toads, frogs, moles and that is just the beginning. Some of the names can even describe what he or she is. Such as Ambrose Spike, Basil Staghare and Queen Warbeak. Cluny is the big bad guy. Do not let Cluny stop you with his looks.Redwall itself does not have rabbits, toads or frogs. Redwall does have hares, stoats, badgers, sparrows, foxes, hedgehogs, and I won't name the rest. Over all, Redwall is a must read. It has inspired me to read the rest of the the Redwalls.

It is the classic tale of good vs. evil, and features the development of an unexpected hero in a young, unconfident, inexperienced mouse. The story uses a high level vocabulary (ie: blandishment) which I like because it gives me an opportunity to see if my daughter can figure out the meaning from the context and if not, then by explaining the meaning to her; it is great to hear her say \\"oooohhhh\\" knowing she now has added a new and unique word to her collection. We read only a chapter or two a night, which works out well because each chapter ends in a cliff hanger."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"It's an aboslutely lovely story! If you just want to take a break from the more somber fiction, I highly suggest Redwall, or any Brian Jaques book. There hasn't been one yet that hasn't made me laugh, and cry. He's a brilliant author with a special knack for poetry. Only a few authors can pull off throwing songs and poems into their works, and Jaques does it brilliantly. I tip my hat to him. His characters are wonderfully written and well rounded. I've read books where characters do things that completely go against their personalities. This is never the case in any of the Redwall books. Jaques is constant with his characters. The plot lines, although there are sometimes several, are simple and easy to follow. Any Redwall book is enjoyable, and I strongly recommend that you read them all. These books allowed my cousins and myself to fall in love with reading in the first place."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I really liked this book.

He took back Redwall in a battle against Cluny's entire army with the help of his friends, the sparrows and the mice of Redwall.My favorite character (that didn't die) was Constance, the badger.

And it is! Even though you sense that there is some King Arthur in this, that's all. The characters are loveable and they really grow on you. The villians are ruthless and believeable.

One in which he vows to claim Redwall as his own. The only way to save Redwall from Cluny is by recovering the lost sword of Martin the Warrior. So Matthias, a young mouse inhabitant of Redwall accepts the mission, and begins his quest to find the sword, creating strong bonds with various animals along the way. Now, with the help of his newfound friends, as well as the magic of the sword, Matthias must defeat Cluny and reinstate Redwall as a safe-haven for all.I have heard amazing things about the REDWALL series for years, but was never sure as to whether I would enjoy the books or not. However, during a recent bookshop trip, I saw the first installment in Brian Jacques' award-winning series, and decided to purchase it on a whim. I don't think I have ever made as great a purchase as this one. From the very first page REDWALL hooks the reader into a magical land where animals live in peace and harmony amongst each other, and adventure appears around every corner. Filled with an assortment of marvelous characters, such as my personal favorite, Silent Sam, a mute squirrel who knows the forest of Redwall as well as the back of his hand; as well as battle scenes that will make the reader hold their breath, REDWALL is a marvelous book that must hold a place on everyone's bookshelf.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I had never heard of this series of books but I thought it looked cute.

Cluny is a very powerhungrey indevigual, so he sees the abbey and thinks it would be a great base, espesaly after he captures it and enslaves everyone. but most people don't want to be enslaved and these peace loving abbey dwellers are no exception, but they are not solders. this book is basicaily how they defend themselves, w/ some important subplots, like wanting the sword of there ledgendary warrior, finding allies who understand if they don't help fight, and the abbeyguys lose them they will be enslaved too.The one major downfall of this book is that when it was written Jaques did not intend to write a whole series, so when he writes a book about Martin the Warrior there are some annoying contradictions, i just deal w/ them, the rest of the series is optimol.Although this book is good, it is not for everyone, the are gory descriptions, not dwelt apon, but still there, and some things that mnight scare some.A paticaler strong point of this book is that the bad guys are major charactors too, so if your morals are backward and you sympathise w/ Cluny you know what he is up to, but if you like the good guys you can understand w/ ferver that these guys MUST fight.If you don't like it fine, but i think this book is really enjoyable, read w/ or w/out the rest of the series. This book might have been beter if it were humans instead of animels, but what is done is done(other books in the series have more weak points, but that is discussed in other reviews)"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"My brother read the book a couple years ago and suggested that I read it. I put it off until just a couple weeks ago, and boy, am I glad he told me about this book! I finished it in only 4 days, I could never put it down! I forgot about video games and read during recess, I just couldn't stop. I've read some of these reviews and some mention size of all of these animals and say that they make no sense and differ depending on the situation, which is completely wrong!Severa;l times through out the book, Brian mentions some animals disabilities at doing some thing because of their size. He mentions how tall animals have to bend over to avoid hitting their head on the roof. I've also read that some think that this is a brutal, violent, barbaric book, but I think differently. Yes, there is a few parts were violence is obvious and Brian went a little overboard, but overall, it's barely violent at all! More than seven eighths of the book is talking about Matthias (a small mouse, the main character in a book of woodland creatures defending an abbey built and abandoned by humans against a vile rat and his army)discovering new things about his past and future and about him uncovering mysteries. This book is the best I've ever read, and I've read quite a few books being in a literary club AND in a gifted program. This book should be read by people over the age of 12, because there are very long and baffling words in there. Also, the story flip-flops between stories every chapter, which brings excitment at being able to know the position of each side (good and evil) through out the book, but that can become confusing for small children. I have recommended this book to a few of my friends, one of which being 9, 2 years younger than myself. If you read bit before you're 11, you may be confused at parts and might need a parent assistant them. I rate this wonderful, action packed book a 11 out of 10. Though I must admit that Matthias grows from a weak little kid, (as it seemed to me) to a hero a little too fast. This is an action packed, wonderful book full of love, action, devotion, action, sacrifice, and mystery. I recommend this book to all who enjoy reading good literature.REDWALL ROCKS! READ IT!P.S. Amazon,I couldn't put this thing on the review page unless I said that I was over 13, though I've seen other reviews from kids like myself"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"The first book in Jacques' series surprised me with its excellent imagery and relatively mature message. Although the writing style is simple and easy to read, this is not really a kids book. Although it is listed as being for ages 9-12, I believe that this book would be enjoyable (even exciting) for people of any age. I'm 22 and plan on reading the next (Mossflower). So, if you're contemplating reading this book, I strongly reccomend it and you shouldn't worry about it being below your reading level. It is an extremely enjoyable book from start to finish."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Adventure... Drama... Action... War... these are some of the few stimulating elements of Redwall. The reason this book is so uniquely good is that, instead of humans, it involves animals: mostly rats, mice, badgers, ferrets, otters, and squirrels, and instead of placing these animals in a human environment, they are in their own, as if humans do not co-exist on the same terrain. They have their own civilization inside a monastery called Redwall. The writing style is magical, and it keeps me on the edge of my bed. The adventure is perilous, the action is intense, the drama brings tears to my eyes, and the war keeps my heart pounding. I strongly recommend the whole series."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"AH!

The plot is great with many twists and turns. When you start reading this book you will not want to put it down because its so great and so cliff-hanging.

I agree with this quote, and I would like to add that Brian Jacques is a very accomplished author. Even though the Redwall series&iexcl; books have the same plot for just about every book, in my opinion they don&iexcl;t get boring due to the fact that Brian Jacques changes the characters every book and the plot has small twists, like multiple stories going on at the same time. Brian Jacques has written a book that has nothing to do with the Redwall series, called Castaways of the Flying Dutchman.Y Born on June 15, 1939Y Two sons: Mark and David, his dog, Teddy, his wife Liz, granddaughters Jade and Hannah, brothers Jimmy and Tony.Y Went to St. John's SchoolY Redwall wasn&iexcl;t intended to be a book. Brian Jacques told the story to children at Royal Wavertree School for the Blind, and his friend and former English teacher, Alan Durband sent it to a publisher.Y Likes to write outside in his garden in the spring, in a conservatory when it&iexcl;s raining.Y Writes fantasy stories. Most famous books: Redwall, Mossflower, Mattimeo, Castaways of the Flying Dutchman, and Triss.Brian Jacques has won a couple small awards for individual books &iexcl;V such as a Children&iexcl;s Book-of-the-Month club main selection for Martin the Warrior, Salamandastron, Mossflower, and Redwall have won the Lancashire Libraries Children's Book of the Year Award. Redwall, Mossflower, and Mattimeo have won the Western Australian Young Readers' Award.I chose this author because the Redwall series is my favorite series, and because I did not know much about Brian Jacques. &iexcl;In Redwall, a hero can be a mouse or a shrew. He can be scared, he can get hurt, he can die. People don't have to look up to him to be saved, they look to him to fight with them. They look to him because he's smart, because he's willing to pay the price. He's committed to his cause. They look to him because he is like them. He knows what's right and knows it has to be done. He'll do it or die trying. Kids learn from these stories that sometimes the characters do die. It might be their favorite character, even. They learn that heroism doesn't come easy and does not come without a cost.&iexcl; This quote was from a biography on the Internet, and I thought it was very fitting for the series. A quote from the same website I thought was funny was, &iexcl;I suppose there's a child inside me who wants to get out. A little baldy child with a beard. Ha!&iexcl; In conclusion, Brian Jacques is an outstanding children&iexcl;s author with a lot of accomplishments."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This book was really, really, really good.

I later found out it was a cartoon of the Redwall characters. Since I enjoyed it I bought the first book in the seris, Redwall.After reading the book I was immensly satisfied. It was over all a great book and worth the read. My favorite things about the book was primarily the characters and the character developement of Matthias. Matthias starts out very humble and akward but soon because a brave warrior. THe other characters such as Constance, Ambrose, Basil, and Cluny were great. Another thing that made this book was the battle for Redwall. The way that both sides try to win are unique and interesting and are what I imagine humans would try to do in such situations with such resources.My only complaint was that the book was a little too long in my opinion. I felt certain parts could be shortened as almost the entire book is just a quest for the sword of Martin. Don't get me wrong, I liked all that was involved but it seemed like a bit much."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This story was about an animal sanctuary.

In chapter 4 I remember how they said that Skullface lay in a red mist of death. And how Cluny said that tell the devil Cluny sent you,Skullface. This is only 1 reason I like Redwall.

I picked it up at a bookstore out of curiosity because so many people had recommended it and I am a true lover of fantasy and science fiction. No lie, I could not put this book down. It is so cute and just plain magical. The characters, although they are animals that act just like people, became so real to me. The plot was absolutely entrancing. This novel will truly bring out the kid in you but it is not in any way immature. I would recommend it to anyone from the ages of 12 to 112. I can't wait to read #2, Mossflower!!

Redwall is the kind of book that doesn't appeal to me much, and books similar to that, I don't enjoy reading. Since this was a class book that we had to read, I tried to get into what its meaning was. I would recommend this book to my friends only if they like to read adventure books. Otherwise, I would recommend a different type of book for them to read. The only good part in Redwall was when Matthias got captured by the sparrows and held prisoner while trying to figure out where the sword of Martin the Warrior was hidden. If I were give this book a grade out of five stars, I would give it three stars."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I always saw the &quot;Redwall&quot; novels promoted as &quot;young reader&quot; books. Being a fan of kidlit, I decided to give &quot;Redwall&quot; a go.My 3 stars is given with mixed emotions.On one hand, the book has extremely clever parts. The riddles and rhymes about Martin's sword are pretty well done. The characters, especially &quot;subsidiary&quot; characters like Basil Stag Hare are likeable and interesting. The story is *extremely* suspenseful in places - it would be good at holding the interest of many &quot;reluctant readers&quot;, I would bet.But the one thing that puts me off is the level of violence in the novel. Yes, I know it is meant to be a fairly simple story pitting good against evil. But it shocks me somewhat that the members of the Abbey - supposedly a peaceful and healing band - do not express more regret or reservation over the carnage they must deal. (Also, not to give too much away, but several very sympathetic characters die in the novel - I know some kids would be very upset by this).Perhaps this is my 30-year-old sensibility intruding on an adventure story for young teens. I don't know. But the amount of killing and swordplay in a book that I took to be aimed at 12 or so year olds was startling to me.Then again, I found parts of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; a lot scarier upon an &quot;adult aged&quot; rereading than I did as a kid...At any rate, although the novels are promoted for kids, if you have extreme reservations about violence/war/death being depicted in the books your kids read, you may wish to go elsewhere...(I say this because these books are heavily, and surprisingly, promoted in a small catalog that otherwise deals with &quot;understanding other people&quot; and &quot;peace promoting&quot; toys)"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This book tries too hard to be _Watership Down_ and doesn't succeed. It might be entertaining for young readers, but this was on the adult fantasy shelves at my bookstore and I picked it up hoping to be enchanted. Unfortunately, unlike _Watership_, the characters are way too one-dimensional, which makes _Redwall_ rather unsatisfying.I might have liked this book better had I not read it right on the heels of _Watership_, or had I read it when I was younger. However, this, unlike the Chronicles of Narnia and other classics, is a book that doesn't satisfy adults as well as children."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This is an adult's review of Redwall, a medieval monastic fantasy world that omits humans entirely in favour of wild-animal characters: Food and some habits are animal (well...mice drinking cow milk?), all the rest is &quot;human,&quot; but less biting than Orwell's Animal Farm (I don't detect a political subtext, although the initial stereotyping will attract the gender police unless they read the whole book). This is childrens' stories in animal form, rather than Aesop's boring fables or something more gut-animal like Adams' Watership Down (where the conflict is also between individuals rather than whole species, as here). Jacques writing is lovely, incorporating ground-level animal perspectives and a child's view of humans; fun to read aloud in &quot;animal voices&quot; (particularly if you can do Cockney and plummy English). The story is exciting and rapid, the characters wholly good or evil but well-differentiated among themselves. The violence in this first story is almost light-hearted, in the heroic vein, and the evil rats almost incompetent in their rabid hostility, but that snake Asmodeusssss is a true nightmare (shiver). I only wish Gary Chalk had done more drawings.

The animals that lived there worked and played in peace and harmony, and all was well. The main character, a homeless young mouse named Matthias was diligently trying to prepare for the upcoming feast. A clumsy young mouse he was, but when evil in the form of Cluny the Scourge dared to attack the sacred abbey, Matthias took on the spirit of his legendary ancestor; Martin the Warrior. When a young sparrow, living unnoticed with her tribe in the abbey loft is captured, the fiery creature and Matthias become fast friends. Going off on a frantic search to find the lost sword of legendary Martin, the only thing that can vanquish Cluny the Scourge, Matthias discovers his true spirit throughout many obstacles. Can Matthias make it back to Redwall in time to save the abbey and his friends?"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"O.K., since I would probably get flamed for this review, I left off my e-mail address. Since this is one of most praised books of late, I purchased it. After reading it, my thought is this: if I had bought this book to read to my kids, I and they would have loved it. Little animals rising up against the evil rats and serpents. It is humorous and well written. However, I found it juvinile. All right you are saying, buy a book with a mouse as the hero, what do you inspect? Well, I guess I was expecting &quot;Watership Down&quot; which is really deep, moving book, filled with symbolism and lessons on life. &quot;Redwall&quot; is not like that. It is heroic fantasy with a mouse cast as Bilbo Baggins. Disney meets Tolkien?"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"At first sight, it may seem like Redwall is another of those cheap books that have no meaning to them. I mean come on! Talking mice swinging swords at vermin?! I first read this book when I was 7. I had arrived in America 2 years before and this was the first chapter book I read. Sure, it took 3 or 4 weeks, but it was worth every minute.I myself have to agree with what some other reviewers have said about bad proportion and unrealistic plots, but is Harry Potter realistic? Do magical castles pop out of nowhere with some wizard pointing a wand at you. Of course not. J.K Rowling made it up (Duh). Brian Jacques does nearly the same thing.Now about the story. I could bore you to death by retelling a 450 page book to you or I could just tell you the basics. Cluny, a rat, with an army of rats tries to capture an abbey(sanctuary) called Redwall. But inside the abbey is a young mouse called Matthias. He is your average kid, not doing chores, messing up stuff here and there, and doing what kids do. So when Cluny attacks, Matthias and the creatures in the abbey will have to try to repel the attacker. Who will succeed; good or evil? Before I stop, I just want to caution some younger readers. Redwall is bloody, the rats have a tendancy to swear a lot(not using modern swear words, though), and some of the creatures have weird accents. Other than that, everything is OK. So take it from me, Redwall rules!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"A few of the reviews brought up the topic of size, like how big the characters were in relation to eachother, how they could live in human-sized dwellings and the paradoxes if they didn't, etc.This is the first book in the long series, so there are bound to be unfinished ideas here that are polished and refined later. Perhaps Jacques had already published the book when he realized what a mess this could be. In the first book, there are cattle and horses and dogs and towns, NONE OF WHICH APPEAR IN THE OTHER BOOKS.Once Sir Brian got the 'feel' of his world, the boundaries of which were tested and stretched as the series began, it becomes gradually more believable. That Jacques has development, periods of ups and downs between books, proves that he is not a 'robot writer', an author that copycats others for quick cash.Just one suggestion. MORE FOXES AND LESS FERRETS!Oh, and a swan as a main character would be nice too."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I like the Redwall series. I have all of them sitting on my shelf and I've read all of them 2 or 3 times. As the first book in the series, you can tell that Brian Jacques is still creating the world of Redwall Abbey. One can see markings of humans - a church, horse and cart, stuff like that - that doesn't appear in the rest of the series.Although it lacks some in comparison to other Redwall books, I still recommend reading this one first, and the others in the order they were published."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I was a little disappointed with this book. A little back I read The Pearls of Lutra, and fell in love with its descriptive dialogue, colorful characters, constant cliff-hangers, quick-paced storytelling and edge-of-your-seat-suspense. The world of Redwall wove something of a spell around me, a spell that resulted in notebooks full of anthropomorphic fanfics. But alas, despite the writing style I admired and crafted my own from, despite the magical world of Redwall, it became more and more of a chore to turn the pages. There was no character development, no divirsity, and the bad guys were all fiendishly clever or pathetically stupid... Completely bloodthirsty with no other motive but to kill, kill, kill. Yes, the line of good and evil was so stereotypical... And the fact that the good guys and bad guys were divided into something so prejudicial and simple as species hurt me a little, considering that in real life you can't tell what's in someone's heart by the outside. And of course, ferrets... they're always judged as nasty little brutes, but those fun-loving critters always had a place in my heart. It's been a touchy subject for me since Bandit died... ::Sigh:: Oh, well. Besides my endless ramblings, a very good book."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Sure, the &quot;Redwall&quot; series is well-written, and unusual in its use of animal characters rather than humans. That does nothing to alleviate the fact that the plots are all the same as any other epic sword quest. The characters are flat and stereotypical, and the conflicts wrap up a little too neatly. I read the first two books in the series, but I don't think I'll be coming back for more."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"this book was fun to read.

In the course of this book, several animals are eaten by a snake, dozens are burned to death, more are boiled to death, several fall from great heights to their death, some are crushed under giant weights, others are stabbed, shot with arrows, or thrown into a tree. The violence is not restricted to the &quot;bad&quot; animals, as some of the most likeable protaganists suffer brutal and painful deaths. In short, it is inappropriate at best for many younger children."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I ordered this product for a present for someone, under the impression that it was used, like new.

The detail that Brian Jacques puts into his books makes them a joy for children to read...and for adults to read aloud, or to themselves.In Jacques' books, each species of animal speaks with a different dialect, mostly different British dialects. The descriptions of the foods and feasts of Redwall Abbey make one want to go out and try some of the moles &quot;Deeper 'n' ever pie;&quot; and what I wouldn't give to be able to taste one of the Abbott's cakes frosted with buttercup cream!Brian Jacques has given the world a book that children and adults alike can enjoy. He begins with a wonderful description of the tales' villian...Cluney the Scourge...and holds the reader spellbound through the mysteries, adventures and romances that follow.I first read this book about four years ago. Then, while I was pregnant with our only child, I then proceeded to read it a second time, aloud, so that my daughter, Madison, would develop a love of literature at a very young age. I even recorded the story so that Madison would be able to listen to it in the future.Many times we are tempted to &quot;wait for the movie,&quot; especially when it comes to children's literature. But this book is made for reading. Jacques' unique dialects and &quot;turns of the phrase&quot; are wonderful for the preteen set to read by themselves (at 400 or so pages, they can feel like they are finally reading a real novel) or for an adult to read aloud to a younger group.Once you have read this first in Jacques' Redwall series, you will find yourself eagerly awaiting the next installment (just like I do).As I stated before, it has been over four years since I read this book, so please forgive any misspellings of the villian's name.By the way, for those of you who are interested, Madison, who just turned two, already brings me stacks upon stacks of books every night to read before we go to bed. I fear I have created a monster!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Overall, Redwall by Brian Jaques is a pretty good book, however, it does have a few flaws. The book manages to have an exiting fantasy world for the most part. Although it contains a few clich&eacute;s (chosen one, special magical sword, great war between two factions), it takes some thinking to notice, and will probably not interfere with enjoyment of the plot. The characters are enjoyable to read, and their traits are shown through both actions and words, and although they are animals, they almost seem like real people. The main villain, Cluny, is stereotypically evil, especially with his threats to his own army. However, the schemes and mindgames involving him make him interesting to read. There is one glaring problem, however: The rats as a whole are depicted as an evil race. There is not even one \\"good\\" rat. To me, this is accidental racism, and suggests that being born one way is destined to be evil. It would have been nice to see some of the rats break away and maybe try to join Redwall, and maybe some mice to break away, some of them to Cluny's army. If you want a book that is fun, but not thought-provoking, Redwall can be a good book for you.-BMW"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"A place safe from harmLoving caring homeFriends all around youCareSiege comes and never diesPlans and plansNever to succeedThe blossom bloomingThe love and care is backNever to leave againI am that isGuardedBy devotion not hateI am that isCome and see the evilNever to see againDeath is not apparentNewRebornlovedNever to see evil againWithI am that is"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall is a great story about animals trying to defend themselves from the evil ones, but I would be careful who I recommend it to.

Meanwhile an evil rat named Cluney the Scourge is trying to take over Redwall Abbey. Will Matthais find Martins' sword and make it back in time to save Redwall Abbey and his friends(who are some of the neatest animals, my favorite is Basil Stag Hare) from Cluney and his gang of evil vermin?

THiss is one of the greastest books ever made!!!!! :)"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Good book, it is a perfect amount war and peace. I liked it because it described the tranquil nature and quick witted smarts of woodland creatures against the ferocious, savage, unfair, and tormenting nature of pirates depicted as sea creatures. I also love the addictve storyline. You never know what is going to happen next."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall is about a mouse named Matthias who had been an orphan in the Redwall Abby. He had fought other characters to get freedom from enemies and the sword of Martin a warrior that the animals admire, who had died a long time ago is still alive in the animals in Redwall's hearts and remembrance. This is a great book to read for fantasy loving people. You should also read The Price of Immortality (Awesome book) and The lord of the rings series."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I loved Redwall !

I loved the book so much, I have since read every sequel available! I hope you enjoy the book as much as I did !"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This book is just a starter book if you ask me. I like all of the books I have read in the collection (which are very hard to beat) better than REDWALL. If you like this book, I highly advise THE GOLLDEN COMPASS, my favorite book. Overall, the ending came to an abrubt stop, and that's what made me give it a four."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This is a wonderful book, if you like fantasy or you just love a beautiful piece of literature you should read it. I was referred to it by a lady at school and when I first picked it up it was reminiscent of &quot;The Secret of Nimh&quot; (not sure how to spell the last word, it's been awhile) which I had read as a young child and loved. It was even better! Longer, better written, well crafted characters (no Charles Darnay but he writes well, so they're very compelling), and then a plot I took a liking too. Who would have guessed it was part of a series, which I read in about a year. The whole series is great, but read them in order, either chronologically or when they were written. This probably wasn't the best in the series (I highly reccomend Legend of Luke and Mossflower too) but it's still beautiful. Brian Jacques has beautiful writing, just see for yourself."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Sometimes finding books that 7th and 8th graders will enjoy is a daunting task, but here you have a book and a series that these kids love.I am impressed by the quality of the characters and the plot. I am impressed with the detailed descriptions of the settings in and around Redwall Abbey. I am impressed by the page turning qualities of the plot. I am impressed that even my most reluctant readers are able to get into the story of Redwall and the creatures that abide there. Matthias is a wonderful hero, and Cluny the Scourge is a dastardly villlian, you will love and hate them respectively. All of the supporting characters add to the story and move it along nicely. You'll love the twists and turns of the story of Matthias finding his place in life, his destiny.Brian Jacques is a wonderful story teller and has mastered the art of writing for the imagination.I recommend this book highly.

If you've read them all ten times each, as i have, you start seeing differences in the settings and the characters of the books. In Redwall, the brothers and sisters stress the peaceable nature of mice, which seems to disappear in the other books. There is also a hint of human activity in this one and of the dangers of Mossflower Wood, which is also not depicted in the other books. The setting and plot of Redwall is so pristine and the story is such a classic Medieval story of good and evil, right and wrong, that this is a great read. The special edition hardcover is also great because of the illustrated plates within the pages."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I read this book and i must say that it s one of the best books i have ever read. It is good for kids ages 8-14, which is good since that is about the time when kids stop finding fun in reading. Redwall has everything from faced-paced excitement to romance to a certain mystery element. I would recomend it to everyone who can read. I think it deserves a newbery award."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I am 12 years old and have read 10 out of 13 books in this series.

One of the books that was chosen to be read was Mossflower, a book in the Redwall series. I enjoyed the book immensely and immediately bought Redwall so I could continue the series. I think Redwall was the best of the series. The way Jacques writes is incredibly interesting and I loved how he wrote in such great detail. Redwall is a book for all ages, and I think even adults would enjoy it."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"When I first started reading this book, the last thing I expected to find was a thrilling story of adventurous journeys and courageous acts all done by animals. But, that is what I got. Brian Jacques has created a modern masterpiece with his superb usage in detail,dialogue and wit in this delightful tale of good versus evil. As in all true classics, good finally overcomes evil, and Jacques has left us with a lasting gift that will be cherished each time it is read."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"The story of Redwall is so facinating I read it in 2 days.

It follows and introduces the inhabitants of Redwall Abbey, a peaceful order of woodland creatures in Mossflower Wood. An evil rat by the name of Cluny the Scourge comes and tries to take the place over... Fat chance. This particular Abbey is protected by the resurrected spirit of Martin the Warrior, the Abbey Champion. A lot of action and adventure, plenty of laughs, and a good dose of morality, too-- this book gets an affectionate two paws up"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This introduction to the world of Redwall saga is an incredibly well written literary work (like all of the installments in this series). It is a lively, humorous, exciting, and altogether enthralling. Snaring the minds of the young, the old, the women, the men, the adventurer, the chaste, the fighter, the poet, and everyone else who reads! I have discussed Redwall and its sequels and prequels with many other readers, and have failed to find one who was not drawn in by the warmth and authenticity of the surroundings, the characters, and the events Jacques tells of. Appropriate for children, engaging enough for adults, kindly and sweet enough for romantics and exciting enough for warriors. Redwall will leave you thirsting for a sip of strawberry cordial, hungering for a bite of celery, shrewcake, a taste of apple and cheese summer salad, and one good shot at Cluny the Scourge"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall is not as compicated as the other books in the series. It is however just as exciting and beautifully written.Mathias is a young mouse who dreams of being a hero. His habit does not fit him and he trips over his sandals. Then the evil rat Cluny comes and tries to take over Redwall Abbey where the creatures all live.All the creatures introduced in &quot;Redwall&quot; come up in some of the other books in this series.Brain has a very unique way of intertwining the past of Mossflower to the book you may be reading.Enjoy the journey"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Brian Jaques' Martain the Worrior, Mossflower, and Redwall series are the BEST books I've ever read. The books are very funny and exciting and has very lovable characters. I don't usually read books, but after I've read MossFlower (first book of series, I bought them all one after the other and read them all. They are great; Jaques' descriptions of the settings suck you into the book and sets you in the joyous mood that the novels are in. You should buy Mossflower first and read about Martin the Worrior, and his friends Gonff, Log-a-Log, and Dinny. The Redwall books are great and brings you out of a depresed mood and sets you in the Mossflower woods or Redwall abby in the time of worriors and tyrants. Oh, and if the author sees this review, I think that you should write the books not so distantly apart with the same characters; say, two books for each generation of characters. I kinda miss reading about Martin and his friends and I think the Mossflower is the best book ever."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I liked this book because you get to learn about Medieval England through the eyes of Mathias, a heroic mouse who lives in an abbey.

When I first got Salamandastron three years ago when I was ten, I was hooked. So I looked for more and came across Redwall. I was hooked. Yeah, the plot was the basic good against evil, but the way it was described, it made it feel like you were listening to Mr. Jaques read it out loud. The story was about a young mouse who was pretty clumsy and his home, Redwall Abbey. The evil Cluny the Scourge was bent on taking over the Abbey. The war forged Matthias into Redwall's champion, following his destiny. Over all, it's the best in the series, but there maybe competition, for I heard there'll be more...."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"The peaceful creatures of Redwall Abbey are being attacked by a hord of rats, ferrets, and other sorts of creatures that are willing to join which is led by the huge rat Cluny who is dreaded by all!

FROM YOUR BIGGEST BOOK FAN: BILL"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Brian Jaques' first Redwall book, I think, is probably the best. It has lots of riddles and mystery, and non-stop action. If you havn't read any Redwall books yet, I recomend you start here."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Wonderful!

I was proven wrong! I couldn't put this book down. The story of Redwall and it's creatures is truly wonderful. This book is about their fight against Cluny the Scourge, who tries to overtake Redwall, and the young Matthias mouse, who is on a quest to restore Martin the Warrior's sword to the Abbey. This book is definatly worth the read!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"My favorite book this year has been Redwall, part of the Redwall series. One of the reasons I like Redwall so much is because of Matthias. He really just brightens up the book. He is a brave, strong young mouse determined to keep the rats away from the Redwall abbey. I also like the adventurous storyline. It is exactly the way I like it. I think one of the best parts is when Matthias goes to find the sword of Martin the Warrior. This takes him a long time, but when he finally finds it he has to fight Asmodeus Poisonteeth, the giant adder, to get it. Another thing I like are the characters instead of people they\`re animals. There are a lot other things I like to, but In the end I think this is a wonderfully fantastic book every one should read"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I thought that this book was very fascinating, full of adventure, and exiting. The book was about Matthias, a field mouse, \\"coming of age\\" and him defending the Redwall abbey. The Redwall creatures are peace loving animals that help others in need. One day a rat named Cluny comes to the Mossflower woods looking for a new castle. He finds the abbey and instantly wants it. He and his army besiege the abbey in order to gain control of it. The Redwall animals fight back and with the help of Matthias and the sword of Martin they win. During the book Matthias figures out clues and riddles to find the sword of Martin. Overall the book is wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone who likes fiction and adventure."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall is mainly about an animal war and a mouse on a jorney.

At first I was in the magic and Harry Potter stuff. But when I heard that Redwall was good from friends and family I gave it a try. I started on the first book Redwall because I heard if you read this you would understand the rest. This was the starting of a new adventure. Through the woods there laid an abbey, the Redwall Abbey. This is where the story begins. I liked this book because of it holding me to keep on reading. Like in the book I could picture Matthias is figure out how to get the great sword of Martin. Even if you know what is going to happen it will still surprise you at how Brian Jacques writes it and how he words it.The book Redwall starts at one place or one person and switches to another after a page or two. For example one part there is one of the vermin sea rats in a tent and then it switches to Matthias looking for the sword and then the brothers and sisters protecting against a siege. This is a good part in this book because it lets you see what everyone is doing that moment. Something that would make it better is that if Brian Jacques would concentrate or make longer one part or one person's view of what is going on. So over all it was a great book but needed a few small touches."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall is amazing!Brian Jacques is a great writer!How I got interested in this sereies is that I bought Lord Brocktree and The Lengemd of Luke at a book fair. I noticed it wasn't the first book so I went out and purched Redwall! I got hooked. My Grand Parents bought me the rest of the seriees for Christmas and other Redwall related merchandise. The main character is a young mouse named Matthis who goes through a amazing story. I would not be able to pick one of his books over another.As you read different Redwall books you will find out become more detailed about other ones. For ex. lets say you read Redwall. In the book Redwall they say that Martin fought a great battle.Then lets say you read Mossflower. You will be able to read about the great battle Martin fought.This is a great series don't miss this oppurtinuty to read such a wonderful set of books."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I did not know what to expect when I started reading this series. I heard from some friends that it was awsome. I was in the bookstore one day saw it and bought it to give it a try.After reading the first ten pages I was hooked. I found myself sneaking up late at Night just to read it. It is about a mouse that wants to be a hero. He sets off to find a sword while and evil rat horde comes and attacks the abbey. A story of wits and courage. A mouse faces anadder, and abbey faces a horde, and the brave faces the evil. This book will keeps you guessing untill the end. It is a must read on my list and I will probably read it many more times!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I picked this up because I was tired of all the biographies I've been reading and wanted something other then the normal fiction I've been reading. Figured I'd try it just because of the cover. Well I started reading and was struck with the fact that this wasnt a very deep or realistic book even by fantasy standards. Characters appear stunningly lucky and characters quickly change their ideas to 'like' the main few ones unrealistically, but I guess what? If you suspend you disbelief just for a little bit --- you'll find a GEM of a book. Really more of a fairytale then books like the Lord of the Rings series (which are all 5 star to me) or even the Dragonlance books I've read, but wonderful just the same. The badger and unique qualities for the good creatures just sparkle and come alive --- and all the evil characters except for Cluny have the dull backbiting habits we would classically give to 'evil' creatures. I'd say this would be a excellent book for those between 8-16 or for those that love a quick uplifting change of heart ... personally I'm looking for a Martin tapestry remake right now :)Shannon"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I started reading the Redwall books when I was 12 (I'm now 19 and in the U.S. Navy) and I still find myself reading each one over and over again. There's something mystical about Jacques' work. The way he describes things in his stories are simple yet greatly detailed- the way he describes the feasts, the colour of the different dialects. He is a truly great author and his work keeps getting better and better; thought I must say, Redwall will always be the greatest. I will pass these books on to my children to read (that is, if they can tear me away from them!) and will continue to read them myself for I just cannot get over the beauty of these tales. I cannot find words to describe them."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall is an action-packed original! Its got suspense on every page of the book. If you like castles, sword fights, and talking animals, this is a definite must have! Dangerous villians, brave heroes, and and loads of action in between!

If I had to discribe Redwall in one word, it would be ACTION-PACKED!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I found Redwall to be a fascinating book filled with cryptic endings and beginnings. Each page kept me hooked until the end. I really enjoyed reading it. Brain Jacques did an excellent job in writing the book. Each animal in the book had it's own personality and meaning. I loved the way Matthias used all his little mouse power to fight off Cluny. I found Redwall a book that is perfect for someone who loves things having to do with the Medieval times and adventures.

It's just too good! I started the Redwall series in the summer of 2004 and finished the most recent one a few months ago. Every single one was too good to put down. And to the people that complain the series is never ending, it would be fine with me if it went on forever!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Hullo! My name is Bazy and I have a love for fantasy books. We've just gotten a new kitten, a manx, that hops around like a bunny. So my mother had me running through my books, looking for rabbit/hare names. During this little expedition I've rediscovered my love for the Redwall series (among others). *This* particular book, Redwall itself, is in my humble opinion the greatest of the series. Well, actually, perhaps not: it has a different feel than the others. Slight, yes, but clearly different. I'd recommend this book for anyone: Adults, teens, children, children who cannot read yet (and would have to have it read to them). Jaques is a magical writer. There can be so much joy that it seems excentric to an outsider, and yet you delight so very much in it. For the series is rather dark and grim. The forces of evil are spectacular. Some of the best baddies I've run across in my exploration through literature. Classic bad guys. All right, so, this is rather a generalizing review; but keep in mind, that Redwall started it all, of course, so this book is to thank, hm?A wonderful read that leaves you with magic in your heart, and has you yearning for more of the world and its beautiful characters and histories.*Never* have I finished a Redwall book and *not* wept, at least a little. Whether for the death of a brilliant, sweet character, or for the terrible loss of being ensnared by the words, by the characters, by the what-happens-next?--and most of all, by the magic.Namarie.~Bazy."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"How many books have you read that catch you in their plots and don't let you out until the book's finished? There are not many books like this, but Redwall, by Brian Jacques is one of them. This well fabricated tale is about peaceful mice who are trying to protect their abbey from an evil rat and his horde. A young mouse named Mattias finds that he is born to be a leader. After setting up the defenses of the abbey with the help of a badger, Matthias goes in search of the sword of Martin the Warrior. Will he find it in time to rally the woodland animals?I enjoyed this book very much because of the sense of adventure and the spirit of the writing. I think that the characters were life like and humorous at times. The best part of the book I thought was the meetings and how the author tried to show all sides of the actions that happened. I would recommend this book, for it was, in my view, very good."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I love the Redwall series by Brian Jacques. This is the first book that I've purchased in audio. It's fun and thoroughly enjoyable, although sometimes the British accents - particularly for the moles - have me going back to listen again."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"If you read \\"The Secret of NIMH\\" you really feel like you're following mouse and other animal creatures. They act and think like the little guys and deal with the world like intelligent animals would. That's even true for old-fashioned books like Burgess's Danny Meadow Mouse or even Beatrix Potter.In the Redwall series the characters are mice because we are told they are mice. But the details are all wrong, and there's nothing particularly mousey happening. I think that's why most negative reviews have problems with scale, with bloody violence, and with understanding the physical action.That's fine, though, if the tale is entertaining enough to carry you over the bumpy parts. As to that, well, tastes vary. The tale in this book is awfully generic, and pretty much just goes through the basic hero/quest motions without adding anything particularly new or engaging.That said, this would be a fine volume to have in the family library. If it caught a young reader's interest, well that's great. I just wouldn't count on it. And at over three hundred pages in the paperback edition, I'm not sure it would work very well as a read-aloud, which puts the book in that awkward spot where it's too long for a young reader to handle but too simple for a more advanced reader to sustain his interest."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"redwall was good,but not as good as mossflower.

I'm now a happy fan of Brian Jacques and the entire Redwall series.The story moves along very nicely, with good editing and excellent characters. I found myself reading late into the night just to see what happens to them and how it ends. The only warning I have is to be prepared to be hungry! The feasts are described in wonderful detail with great imagery and colorful conversations. It's very reminiscent of holiday gatherings and family dinners from childhood.This book impressed me. I know it was written for children, but it absolutely does not read like one. I can see why younger readers would enjoy it, but adults will love it too.

It seems childish at first, a fairy tale about mice and rats. BUt then you see the epic myth that is thrown at you. THe mice is just a cover up. THe plot is great. Matthias the mouse must find a lost sword to protect the awesome Redwall Abbey from the evil band of rats led by the despicable Clooney,er Cluny, the Scourge. It's really meant for my age people, teens and preteens in middle school. The book is a good 400 pages long(a little less) and is filled with lots of blood and gore. A CG animated movie of this would be number 1 in the Box OFfice the first weekend."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I really like Redwall, because they give a lot of detail, especially with the food. I really liked the part with the sparrows and King Bull Sparra. My favorite character is Matthias because he is bold and daring. My least favorite character from the book was Chickenhound. He was very sly and tricky and stole from the Abbey. But in conclusion I really think this is a great book."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"All right, so maybe I sound a bit nutty to you or maybe you knew right away what I was talking about. I'm talking about a book, most likely the only book (actually, series) with mice that are warriors and carry armor, shields and weapons, I'm talking about Redwall. Redwall was the first in an incredibly well written series, the Redwall series by Brian Jacques.The book is sophisticated enough that I would recommend it for no one under 8 and maybe no one under 9. It has some vivid detail of death and someone who is afraid of that sort of stuff should not read it. I'm ten and I finished it last year. And maybe an adult would like it if they like adventure and detailed plots like that in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.The main character, Matthias is faced with the problem that his city is under attack by the ruthless Clunny The Scourge! Matthias' life is changed forever!The most exiting part (for me) is when Matthias finds the long lost secret to Martin the Warrior mouse, the key to making him a warrior mouse and defeating the rat tyrant and his mighty hoard!The vivid detail makes the book like an autobiography, with thoughts and actions almost as if I were there living Matthias' life and experiencing his emotions, which for me, makes any book worth reading.I really have to say that the mood of the story is peaceful at the very beginning and the rest of the story is dangerous and maybe a bit frightening.At the end Matthias becomes a warrior mouse and learns to face his fears. The mice in general become tougher.The only criticism I have for the book is that it wasn't long enough (I like books that have a story after the problem is dealt with and drag on and on).I think Brian Jacques likes to get the reader hoping against hope that the main character will do whatever he is aiming to do then have him fail and not really succeed until the end. For instance there was one par where Matthias was about to find Martin's sword but it wasn't there!Be prepared to enter the Middle Ages in the world of animals!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall Brian Jacques 467 Reviewed by: NateThis book that is the first of the Redwall series is full of action packed chapters and three separate sections. The first section is about the coming of Cluny and the first few battles. The battles are between the peace loving mice from the abbey and the battle hardened army of Cluny the scourge. Cluny got his title from his long whip like tail that he uses to rule his army with fear and power. Cluny comes and tries to take over Redwall but is foiled in his first attempts. The main characters in this part are Basil Stag Hare, the gluttonous hare woos food loving outside is made up for by his perilous fighting abilities. Matthias, the young mouse who has an air of command all his own. Constance, the badger who shares joint command of Redwall in times of trouble with Winifred the otter, Foremole the leader of moles, and Matthias. Cornflower Fieldmouse, the pretty young mouse who is in love with Matthias. In part two the main stories are Matthias is looking for martin the warriors sword and armor. Martin is the abbeys guardian spirit. The other story is the continuation of the invasion of Redwall. In the third part of this story the invasion of Redwall is continued and Matthias is still looking for the sword.

I remember the first page where the mouse says, &quot;I tripped on my abbot, father habit.&quot; I absolutely loved that part, and still do. But as I got further, my mind told me that this was going to be another one of those predictable fantasy novels. I had no doubt in my mind that the good guy was going to win because the good guys were so pure and good and the bad guys were so stupid that they couldn't possibly win anyway. As far as the storyline goes, it was okay and kinda original. The artwork was very good, I thought. Bottom line: If you want something simple and pleasant, this is good fantasy. If you want something darker and more complex, more like hardcore fantasy read something else."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall is an action-packed, non-stop exciting book.

The recommended ages of 9 to 12 are excellent, as the level of reading comprehension is perfect for the simple, yet magical tales of Redwall Abbey.The stories themselves are of course, simplistic. The characters are archetypical; good and evil, rogues and warriors, cowards and courageous heroes. There is always a happy ending and the obstacles in the heroes' way are not too frightening or depressing. The setting is well designed and imaginative, retaining the talking-animal attraction of earlier childhood fantasies.There is no better fantasy for the pre-teen crowd. Once a child gets to about 13, however, they are much too old to start. Some might continue to read well past that age, but none will want to start to read what they consider &quot;kiddy stories&quot;."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This book is about a mouse named Matthais who lives in the Red Wall Abbey.

The author/narrator starts out with a HUGE Shakespearian/Barrymore accent/attitude. His 'R's are rolled out as if they were trumpet voluntaries and his enunciation strains to be phoneme-perfect...for a Brit. It would be hysterical in a Monty Python skit but it is rather irritating after half an hour. Fortunately, it fades away after a while.Having read the book some years ago, the story is familiar and fun. Once the ear is trained and the imagination kicks in, it proves to be a pleasant experience. It certainly made my car trip seem much shorter than it actually was. However, I would hesitate recommending the audiobook to another adult. The overall tone of the vocal characterizations are that of a parent reading to a child, which made it often difficult for me to listen to without rolling my eyes and thanking God I didn't have a driving companion.

It is a must read."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Of all of Brian Jacques's novels set in his critically acclaimed series, Redwall (can't underline or italicize--they don't have the option!) is perhaps the most bloodthirsty epic of the lot. Being his first, I can understand that, and in fact, I applaud it! I am a huge fan of Brian Lumley's Necroscope series (a more harrowing experience than you could imagine) and can appreciate the maturity with which Jacques has written in what many have lauded to be a &quot;young person's&quot; novel.Okay, I know the reality check has bounced, but let's think about this. I am 17 and have a verbal I. Q. that is almost off the rating scale (ask my guidance counselor if you don't believe me) and am considered by friend and foe alike to be at least twice as mature as the average teen. Why then, O Great Critic, am I reading this? The reason is simple--I have found a kindred spirit in Brian Jacques.When I was in the sixth grade and on the last day of school, a friend of mine approached me and asked me if I wanted a book. He said that he had not read the entire book cover-to-cover and was planning on throwing it away because he had found it while cleaning out our desks. Already well-known as a bookworm, I jumped all over the chance of a free book, never thinking about the real reason why he was going to pitch it.I read Redwall in less than a week. To me, the story line was so well written and the characters so vibrant and lifelike, I immediately flipped back to the first page and began anew. Of all the characters, I identified with Matthias the most (I still do). It seemed that every action he took in his roller-coaster ride to adulthood for one still so young, I would have done the same. After reading a second time and absorbing the epic final battle over and over again, I sat back and thought, and was suddenly overcome with grief that our reality was the one that existed, not the one described so perfectly by Jacques. I must have wept in my sleep for days, because I would wake up in the morning with tearstains on my pillow. Sometimes I still do, for how can I not grieve when my ideal world exists only in specially formulated dye on sheets of tree? Thank you, Sir Brian Jacques (you should be a knight) for opening my eyes and helping me find a will to carry on, in the hopes that the type of world described would one day be a dream no longer.Oh, and the reason my friend was going to throw this book away is startling: this novel had been stolen from a local bookstore, and yes I still have it."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This is actually the first book I've read in a long time where I could not put it down. Brian Jacques is an excellent story-teller which makes his books perfect for teens (and many adults). Brian Jacques is among the few authors who suceeded in integrating human characteristics into animal figures keeping the reader believing that they are really animals. The characters are well-developed and their adventures are grand and will keep the reader highly interested.The book's flaw (which is forgivable) is that the adventure to this book doesn't seem to have a logic to it making it seem artificial. Young Matthias goes on a lot of heroic journeys, but his character is too perfect and there is no transition between Matthias' childhood years and his days of heroism.But that's okay --I loved the book!Jacques improves on his prequel to this novel --Mossflower!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I have been a devoted fan of the Redwall saga since I firstread Martin the Warrior.

Cluny had got injuried and had almost died from a brief accident. However this was not all bad. This gave Cluny the chance to think of a plan against Redwall.

Since he felt this way about a few especially, he decided to have them killed. The mice of Redwall continued to prepare for when Cluny would strike again.

As a 9-12 year old, I wouldn't even have wasted my time with this--read Narnia, or Xanth, or Eddings. Any of them are better-written.

I was spellbound, taking every spare moment I had to finish it once I had started it. I became completely absorbed in the characters, the writing, the humor, and the adventure. It became my favorite book at the time, and still remains close to that place, though it's been over 6 years since I first read it. I read it again just a few months ago, and despite having read it easily over 6 times, I found that I still had trouble putting it down once I had started, and that I still picked up on subtle details in the story I hadn't noticed before. Brian Jacques writing is simply beautiful, detailed and exquisitely written.

The story is about the protagonist Matthias trying to prove himself to be a responsible mouse. He ends up having to defeat the antagonist Cluny the Scourge in a one-on-one battle to the death in the final chapters. In the book, there are many mini-adventures that Matthias goes through. An example of one is when Matthias was taking the churchmice back to their home, the church. This is when he has his first encounter with Cluny and his horde. All of these adventures ingeniously lead up to the final conflict.This book has a great deal of strengths that keep the reader interested. One of the more inconspicuous ones is how Jacques has made-up different speech personalities for each animal type. I especially enjoyed the moles' speech, where they seemed a bit illiterate. This led to a sort off \\"playfulness\\" into the story, thus making it more enjoyable. Another strength of this book is how Jacques made it seems as if the reader were just standing in the story, watching. Even though this is done on most books, I felt that the author did it better than the others.Of course, no book is perfect, and Redwall isn't an exception. One thing that bothered me was how the book kept changing views. In the first chapter, it tells how things are going at Redwall Abbey, then in Chapter 2, it switches views to Cluny's horde. The book kept doing this for well over half the book, which could have annoyed some readers, as it did to me. Also, there were a lot of quotations in the book, but the author may have done this to keep the reader interested with the book.Redwall is a intriguing story and will be enjoyed by readers for many years to come. Although this book does have some gore and violence, this book has no disturbing morals and would be a good read for a child to teenage audience who enjoy fantasy or adventure stories. The book may also be appealing to anyone who would enjoy a fairly amusing fiction that would keep them reading for hours."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall, by Brian Jacques, is a classic book about the journey innocence to maturity.

He's mild-mannered, obedient, caring, courageous, intelligent, and a bit clumsy, always tripping over his sandals. It also makes Cluny the Scourge sound like the devil himself.

It has the right emount of humer and action to create a good setting and the characters are well developed and act like humans. I think is u like really neat language in the books you read then u should try Redwall. I think the riddle is really well written-I likie to try to find out the answer before the characters do.

If you enjoy mid-evil warfare and weaponry you will enjoy this story. Though they use only a few \\"bad\\" words throughout the story you, or your children, or students will probably not notice. I also recommend NOT watching the cartoon.There are various feats through the book as well, and the common mention of ale and( especially in the later books) other alcoholic drinks that even minors sometimes drink. though all in all it is a good book, I gave it 5 stars because that is what all the children I see tell me about it.Yours truly,Makay1a Fisher"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"The first of a prolific seriesMy 11 year old daughter picked up Redwall at a local bookstore and loved it so I decided to give it a try, figuring that it must be pretty solid considering that there are more than 2 dozen books in the series, including prequels and other side stories.But, I was not captivated by the story. I did not dislike it, but the grown up in me had some questions that pestered me throughout. The storyline is fairly simple - the peaceful community of animals that lives in and around the Abbey of Redwall is under attack by an army led by an evil one-eyed rat named Cluny the Scourge. The scholars of the Abbey believe that the sword of their ancient hero, Martin the Warrior, will help in the defense and dispatch an initiate into their order (Matthias) to find that sword. The plot follows the progress of he siege and Matthias' search.I was bothered by many things in this book that caused me to enjoy it less than my non-critical daughter:1) Why do the creatures of the Abbey look to young Matthais to be the leader of their defense of the Abbey? Vague reasons are offered but they make no sense;2) Scale. Badgers fight alongside mice. The badger in the book is larger than the mice, but not to the scale it would be in the real world. The scale with almost every animal is off;3) Why are some buildings mice-sized and some buildings are seemingly built by humans? Where are those humans?The plot itself is fairly basic and predictable - rookie hero goes off to find the secret weapon and be the hero, the plucky good guys hold off the evil enemies.Unlikely alliances offer greater strength.My daughter may try to read the rest of the series but I will not."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I have loved these books since I was in 3rd grade and first picked the first one up in the library.

Not quite yet. It's a little bit violent, I think, for him. Maybe in a year or so. Loved the story. Great character development, the plot was fantastic and the descriptions were marvelous.

If Your Like Me And Your Thinking That This Is A Junky Kids Book Your So Wrong! The Way Its Written is More Suited For Teenagers And Adults. Its Sooooo Interesting And Really Thrilling. Its Such A Great Book And I Will Be Reading The Others Soon. :)"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"A thoroughly entertaining read full of excitement, adventure, and a touch of romance.A young mouse named Matthias works his way to becoming a warrior when his beloved Abby Redwall is set upon by Cluny the Scourge and his army of merciless rats. On his journey to find establish who he is Matthias must overcome Cluny's horde, a devil-snake, some crazy sparrows, and his own doubts, with the help of both old and new friends.To me the best thing about this book is the characters. They are unique, funny, unforgettable, and lovable-many are enhanced by personality fitting accents and endearing idiosyncrasies. It is rare to find a book such as this one with a large number of \`good guys' and small players who for all their smallness of part are extremely likable and fleshed out, you can feel their character without having the whole story be about them, such as the strong-willed peace loving Abbot Mortimer, fat Friar Hugo, the ale loving Ambrose Spike, the querulous Guerilla Union of shrews, a garrulous and gluttonous hare who wants to be a stag, a vegetarian cat, and anti-vegetarian owl, and the wonderfully cheerful indomitable moles. Redwall is a book for people who appreciate riddles, good vs. evil, and British humor. I recommend that after reading this book you also read the continuing tale Mattimeo, which is even more exciting and perhaps a little funnier and deeper."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"When I first saw the animated show based on the Redwall books, I thought it was a bit interesting and neat. So you can imagine my reaction when I knew there was a book and heard how reputed it was and the high sales of the said literature.It sounds quite good; medieval age aura, the cute theme of the animals, and the hero that is generally clumsy, mediocre and humble.Now, I'm not negative, but that was about what it was summed up to.It starts OK, then becomes fluffy and sweet with all the descriptions of the merriment, prosperity, food, warmth and general mammalian hustle, bustle, talking, partying and relaxation of a good time.It's a mistake easily made, turning it into a mollified, dolly start in a story. I remember thinking, how will I EVER finish this story? And, For goodness' sake, this had so much promise!Then, Cluny and the Rats came and it started slipping up, notch after notch until it came respectable and acceptable during Redwall's war against evil.But then it became boring, a never-ending battle against evil.All that ever preoccupied your mind was more and more evil accomplices and this tiny, fragmentation of good apposing it and winning.It felt all right, but when I wanted to purchase some of the other Redwall books, I came across reviews that said they were repetitions of the first one. Sigh.Brian Jacques certainly has been busy, but from what I've heard, busy on copies of the same dry, tolerable story."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"My son read this book as a reading assignment at school and I thought the cover looked interesting so I gave it a try. I was quickly caught up in the captivating story that was presented. Would highly recommend to both children and adult readers alike!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall is one of the best books I have ever read, I put it and its sequels in same category as Lords of the rings. Great for readers of all ages. Kids will love the brave animals and adults don't let yourselves be turned off by them."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This is a great book. A belivable head villan... main characters you can relate to...no 500 characters to keep track of... the list goes on. This book has action. It has a storyline. It has a huge crossbow. I'm not very good at humor. This book is good. Like most firsts, it ranks at the top, with muddy sequels following. It is incredibly descriptive, with a spectacular end battle that occupies a larger space than most of the other books in the Redwall series. The different storylines twist and turn all over the place, eventually coming together at the end. It is gorier and more vilont than the later Redwall books, but that doesn't bother me. READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"The book takes place in a place called Mossflower, a land which is ruled by animals. It has a Abbey right in the middle of the land, with a woods almost completely surrounding it. There is a church in the S.W. corner. The peacful people live in the Abbey, which is called Redwall. A band of rats, lead by Cluny the Scourge who is a fearlous leader, have the intention of capturing the Abbey.This book is a great book. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, right to the very end. The only thing wrong with the book is that it is hard to understand the strange dialects of the animals, such as the moles. But, other than that it is a great book. It was very hard for me to put down. I recommend this book for all ages. It is a great book, that is an epic adventure that is goos for all ages."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I think that this book deserves 5 STARS!!!! It is a great book that is a classic. Brian Jacques is a writer, with a wild imagination. It is a book that keeps you on the edge of your seat, right to the very end. It was extremely hard for me to put down. He gives you vivid pictures in your head, which makes it even better. This book is a must have for your bookshelf.He divides the stroy into several little storys. You follow different characters through their hardships and accomplishments. You get attached to a character and hope that they make it through. The epic adventure is a battle of life or death. It is a compelling novel. I think it deserves 5 stars."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall, by Brian Jacques, is about an abbey called Redwall and an order of peaceful mice that are known throughout Mossflower. Cluny the Scourage, a mean black rat with a deadly tail, is also known throughout Mossflower. His story, is an old wife's tale told to scare the Dibbuns, (young ones) when they don't behave; however, when the Brothers and Sisters of the abbey hear that Cluny is in Mossflower, they don't believe it. They discover that they are wrong when a family of bankvoles are taken captive by Cluny and his horde of vermin. A young mouse named Matthias realizes that the only way to defeat Cluny, is to seek out the grave of the abbey's guardian and founder, Martin the Warrior. When he discovers the grave, he doesn't find the legendery sword, but a bunch of riddles, and the journey of a life time. Matthias needs to find the sword, and restore it to the abbey, in this thrilling tale of one mouse's adventure to save his home and become a legend. This tale is greatly told by Brian Jaques. He has written twelve others in the series that are just as well written or better. I recommend this book to anyone who likes the Harry Potter series, or the book Watership Down."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"The Book, &quot;Redwall,&quot; is one of the greatest books ever written.

That's Beatrix Potter-land. Well, all right, Richard &quot;Watership Down&quot; Adams did take the genre to a different level (I started it once but never finished it). What self-respecting child would read this stuff, or admit to reading it, let alone an adult? Well, I did! And I couldn't put it down! Brian Jacques has created a completely believable and endearing world of little creatures: the story is good, keeps you wanting to know what happens next; there's suspense; there's a mystery to puzzle out (where is the legendary sword of long-dead Martin the Warrior?); the dialogue is well done with all the major characters given a distinctive way of speaking; and the good guys win in the end. Remember how much fun Pixar had with ants and grasshoppers in &quot;A Bug's Life&quot;? I'm surprised Pixar haven't bought the rights to it (or maybe they have?). It's a lot of fun. Although it's obviously billed as &quot;children's literature&quot;, some of the vocabulary might be a little hard for a child under 11. I'm reading it aloud to my 8- and 11-year-olds (my 17-year-old turned her nose up at it, though). And there's a whole series of these to keep enthusiasts happy! The New York Times ran a piece a while back about how sales of Jacques books have surged up in the wake of Harry Potter (those kids who desperately need something while waiting for the next book to come out). Jacques' book is more low-key, but has many similar ingredients for a good tale. I've re-read Redwall several times, but so far have not revisited any Harry Potter story. OK, Redwall is not great literature, but it's a darn good story, well told, and worth re-reading: 4 stars"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Being a reader who is fond of any story involving anthropomorphic animals, or in lamen's-terms talking animals, I quickly snatched up a large number of Brian Jacques' books the moment I saw them. I've just finished reading the first book, &quot;Redwall&quot;, and I must say that it is definately one of the better stories I've read. Personally, I consider this a book that would be just grand for anyone, of any age. It is brimming with fun, adventure, light mystery, and battle. The only reason I give it a four rather than a five, is due to it's slight lack of character depth, but that is more than made up for in it's adventurous and imaginative spirit."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Redwall is an action-packed, non-stop exciting book.

It starts off with a young clumsy mouse who eventually saves the inhabitants of Redwall. The adventures of him and his many friends are funny and irresistable. He meets many types of creatures along the way: sparrows, shrews, mice, rats, and an adder. There are many battles throughout his journey. He eventually completes his quest and confronts his arch enemy. He is no longer a clumsy young mouse, but the Warrior of Redwall.I recommend this book for those 10 and over who are very mature. It is an awesome book. It does have a few very bad words. It has some violence in it, but not too strong.

The detail that Brian Jacques puts into his books makes them a joy for children to read...and for adults to read aloud, or to themselves.In Jacques' books, each species of animal speaks with a different dialect, mostly different British dialects. The descriptions of the foods and feasts of Redwall Abbey make one want to go out and try some of the moles &quot;Deeper 'n' ever pie;&quot; and what I wouldn't give to be able to taste one of the Abbott's cakes frosted with buttercup cream!Brian Jacques has given the world a book that children and adults alike can enjoy. He begins with a wonderful description of the tales' villian...Cluney the Scourge...and holds the reader spellbound through the mysteries, adventures and romances that follow.I first read this book about four years ago. Then, while I was pregnant with our only child, I then proceeded to read it a second time, aloud, so that my daughter, Madison, would develop a love of literature at a very young age. I even recorded the story so that Madison would be able to listen to it in the future.Many times we are tempted to &quot;wait for the movie,&quot; especially when it comes to children's literature. But this book is made for reading. Jacques unique dialects and &quot;turns of the phrase&quot; are wonderful for the preteen set to read by themselves (at 400 or so pages, they can feel like they are finally reading a real novel) or for an adult to read aloud to a younger group.Once you have read this first in Jacques' Redwall series, you will find yourself eagerly awaiting the next installment (just like I do).As I stated before, it has been over four years since I read this book, so please forgive any misspellings of the villian's name.By the way, for those of you who are interested, Madison, who just turned two, already brings me stacks upon stacks of books every night to read before we go to be. I fear I have created a monster!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I really enjoyed reading the book Redwall. It was a fantastic story filled with fun and magical adventure. Brian Jacques did a wonderful job writing this book. I liked how he gave the mice human characteristics. With his detailed writing and descriptive words, he was able to paint a picture in my mind. From beginning to end you cheer for Matthias and the mice as they battle Cluny and the rats for victory, and protection of their precious Abbey. This book is also a great lesson in teamwork, bravery, and friendship. This is a book that I will not soon forget,and I would definitely recommend it to all 7th, 8th, and 9th grade students."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"Though a little slow in the beginning, the first published book of the Redwall series rules. It's a wonderful tale about different heroes going on seperate, exciting journeys for the sake of their lovely home: Redwall Abbey. Me, (a 13 year old girl,) my mother, and my 11 year old brother have read Redwall - we all loved it. For anyone who wants it all: adventure, love, serious times and funny ones, this book's for you. That is what's so appealing about the book: the wonderful mix and balance and flow Brian Jacques puts in. Even though quite a few of the Redwall readers can't pronounce the author's last name (me!) the interior of the book has the word usage for practically anyone above grade 4, yet thick enough to please any adult. The characters in the amazing tale of Redwall are so well developed they capture our hearts. We all love Jess Squirrel, Silent Sam (who eventually does speak,) Matthias, Mathusalah, &amp; Constance, just to name a few of the hundreds at the strong yet caring home of the Abbey. If they weren't evil, then Asmodeussss (creepy), the Sparra warriors (evil- well, most of the time,) and especially Cluny (just plain mean,) would probably steal our hearts as well. I recomend this book and the rest of the series to any reader anywhere. In the end, I have just one question for Mr. Jacques: how does he come up with the millions of names?"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I started reading the Redwall series my freshman year in high school. A little late, but I didn't much like to read and my bookworm boyfriend thought I'd enjoy them. So glad I did! I loved the stories and characters so much and it honestly helped me in a time of a lot of confusion for me. I had lost faith in... everything. I fell in love with the relationships they had and the community they created in the abbey. I wanted MY family to be closer and live in a way where the members support the whole.It also let me believe that even without religion, a group of people could live harmoniously and spiritually. That sounds so silly when you think about it as a bunch of animals but the world Brian Jacques creates can really speak to some people... and it did to me. Not only that, the adventures were fun and the storyline very entertaining I think to both children and adults. I soon began reading so much more and now I have a whole room dedicated to a library. You hear how Harry Potter did that for many children and teens... The Redwall series did that for me! Now I'm a teacher and a mother and I try to spread the joy of this series wherever I can! Thanks so much to the inventive author who changed me to the core."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This story kicks off as Cluny the Scourge navigates his hay cart full of his sinister rat horde towards Redwall abbey. All the mice that are inside the walls of Redwall are peaceful mice, although they will have to learn to fight, and learn to fight real quick. During the first confrontation between Redwall and Cluny, Cluny tells the mice to just hand over the abbey. The mice refuse to let him in so Cluny declares war on the abbey. He takes a church, which will be his base camp for the rest of the book, just south of the abbey. Constance the Badger trains the mice in the art of the sling, bow, and staves. Cluny charges the abbey and the battle begins. Meanwhile, Matthias and Methuselah are attempting to solve the complicating riddles of Martin the Warrior. His quest takes him deep beneath Redwall, to the high lofts thousands of feet above the ground, and to a quarry where he has a confrontation with a gigantic death adder, Amsodues Posionteeth. He meets a very large variety of creatures such as a large cat, a snow white owl, and a band of shrews.Some of my favorite parts are at the end; unfortunately I can not tell these to you in fear of ruining the book. But I can say that I didn't like the fact that the book took a while to get exciting.People that would like this book are people that enjoy a quick read, but a good book. Also people that enjoy epic battles would probable like the story of Redwall. Some other book like this one would be books like the Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"His books are long and will take you some time to read, unless you're a steady reader. I would suggest reading some every day, but make sure you have time. It tends to make me lost in the absorbing and very entertaining storyline, and I end up reading for hours on end. I like his style of writing. In most of the redwall books he has two creatures he follows(the good guys and the bad guys), and chapters or stars mark the change between the two. A once in a while reader may have a hard time understanding the story line because you need to remember where each of the charactors are. Not that it's hard or anything, but if you can manage to put it down for a long time you might forget what's happening and have to backtrack.(not fun)He writes with very good detail(not too much)and makes you feel like you're there with the woodland creatures gazing at gorgeous feasts. The only thing I can find wrong about his book is the mole speech,not alot, just in a few places, which is hard to read until you get a feel for reading with a mole accent.Such as:\\"Harr, he'm be noice an' soft, sur. Baint no rock nor root to stop us'ns, straight furrer we'm a-thinking.\\"Thats an okay example. Heres a better one:\\"Yurr, 'edgepig. Where'm us a-puttin' these roots an' dannylines? 'Asten up, they'm roight 'eavy.\\"Hard to understand as they may be, they're always good for a laugh. I would recomend this book to novel readers, not young children, more like people age 13 and up."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"This is an wonderful book about a mouse named Matthias and the place he lives, Redwall Abbey. Matthias is a headstrong mouse that, even though he's a novice, is a nateral leader and is said to be like the famous founder of Redwall, Martin the Warrior.The story also tells of Redwalls trouble will a well known rat, Cluny the Scourge. Cluny has come with his giant hord or rats and has vowed to capture Redwall Abbey and enslave all the creatures inside.This is an amazing book and everyone should read it."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"The first book of the Redwall series. For the first time since it was built, Redwall Abbey is under attack: the warlord Cluny the Scourge, a massive, evil rat who uses his tail as a whip, wants to capture Redwall, enslave the inhabitants, and claim Mossflower for his own. The peaceful mice of Redwall must fight back or die. One young apprentice monk, Matthias, rises up from among the Redwallers to become a warrior and an adventurer, going on a quest to find and recover the long-lost sort of Martian the Warrior, founder of the Abbey, so that he can challenge Cluny to battle and save Redwall. As the first Redwall book, it actually the most out of place in the series: Jacques is still experimenting with setting, human influence, and the nature of Redwall itself. As a result, it does read as a first novel and feels a bit unfinished. Nonetheless, his book is already full of the riddles, memorable and amusing characters with fun accents and turns of phrase, intelligent and exciting battle sequences, and ongoing quests and adventures. It is a classic, an exiting read, and an appropriate beginning to the rest of the series.Redwall definitely reads like a first novel. By the second book in the series, the Abbey will be almost entirely non-religious and almost all of the human references will be gone; in this one, there is still an order that mice have to train in to, and there are carts, farms, farm animals, and other references to human buildings and influence. Because this novel is so different from what the series will quickly become, it feels out of place. The human elements in particular are a bit off-putting and take away from the independent, intensely complex social life of the animals in Mossflower and beyond. With human being on the edges of the picture, the Redwallers and vermin don't seem as human themselves, but rather like undercover imitators. In some books, a human world outside of the rodent world works very well (see the Rats of NIMH series), but not in Redwall. I have a hard time getting through this book and taking everything at face value because of the religious and human overtones.That said, that really is my only major complaint about the book. It doesn't have any characters, good or bad, that I love as much as some of those in other books, but the adventures and riddles in particular are most certainly classic Jacques. He always covers so much in just a few hundred pages: from the start of a war to the end, with new characters, new areas to explore, journeys to take and ground to cover, mysteries to be solved, and battles to be won. Perhaps that's what I love most about the Redwall series: so much happens that it's impossible not to learn, love, indulge, and remain actively interested. Even if this is the first in the series, all of those features are already there. The new cultures, the journey to retrieve Martin's sword, and the battles against Cluny are enlightening, thoughtful, and skilfully executed, and the entire book reads swiftly and enjoyably. Not my favorite Redwall book, but a good one, and I would definitely recommend that you read it first if you're considering starting in on the series. Many of the others can be read out of order, but this is where it all began."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I love animal fantasy, and went a surprisingly long time without ever reading Redwall. When I finally did read it, I found it to be what you expect with the mice animal fantasies now- the creatures wear habits and sandals, wield swords, and the proportions are odd. The mice seem to have no trouble coexisting in the same place as a badger, when you have to wonder how they ever manage to use the same stairs.But still, Redwall is a great read. You almost want to call it whimsical, with the typical journey against evil and the occasionally soft and cute characters- but you can't. The inhabitants of Redwall pour boiling water on their enemies and stab them with spears. Foxes back into snakes in dark caves, and there is the occasional life-costing mistake. The little creatures are definately at war.But that's not a reason to not read it. It made the story more believable and real, and Brian Jacques handles the deaths in a way that fits the story. The main character, Matthias the mouse, is likable and his personality rings true, while the villian Cluny the Scourge is dark, sly, and smart, right down to the poison barb on his tail. All the others characters are well done- I especially liked the Sparra warriors and the fact that Jess Squirrel is the warrior while her husband ladles the soup.This is the only Redwall book that I've read, and I'm inclined to read more after this. They're good animal fantasy that can be appreciated by even those who aren't interested by the \\"talking mice\\" concept."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"I love this novel - and every one that comes after! Sure I love Tolkien, Martin, Feist, Jordan, and other authors who weave very complex and elaborate worlds- but these books really touch you, are simple and easy to follow, and are simply relaxing, wonderful reads!I can't believe some of those ridiculous criticisms below! Comparing the size of the animals and whether or not a mouse could open a door knob is absurd! This is a fantasy novel- just let your imagination take over! I bet those people had very boring childhoods, never were allowed to watch cartoons, and developed very poor appreciation for anything that stretches the imagination...Oh well, don't be one of them- read these books and just enjoy them! You will find yourself going back more than once. I find that these are good stories to read when I need a break from those elaborate and complex epic fantasy novels I also love.."},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"With Redwall author Brian Jaques brings us in to a world of fantasy inhabited by talking animals. The mice live peacefully in Redwall Abbey, until Cluny The Scourge comes! Cluny, a one-eyed rat with a whip-like poison tipped tail, invades the lands surrounding the Abbey with his rat horde. Among his most trusted are Redtooth, Darkclaw, Cheesethief, Skullface, Shadow, Scragg the weasel, and Killconey the ferret.The rats rest in St. Ninian's church, while the peaceful Woodland creatures prepare for the worst. Cluny sends his spy rat, Shadow, to steal the mice' most prized possesion, the piece of tapestry with the picture of the mouse hero, Martin The Warrior, who has recently been haunting Cluny's dreams. The mice begin to lose hope, but young Matthias brightens their spirits before the rats make their first attack on the Abbey. The mice fight back with the moles and Constance the badger on their side. Meanwhile Matthias and Brother Methuzelah, the old mouse gatehouse keeper, seek the famed sword of Martin The Warrior. They find many riddles hinting at where the sword is, but do not find it. They do however find the shield and belt of Martin. They finally figure out the sword's hiding place, a tower in the Abbey, inhabited by warrior sparrows, led by tyrannical ruler King Bull Sparra. King Bull keeps the sword scabbard in his possesion, but lost the sword years ago to the great snake, Asmodeus Poisonteeth. Matthias eventually slays the serpent, retrieves the sword, and returns to the Abbey to fight the last battle with Cluny and the rats. He returns to find that Cluny has taken control of the Abbey. Matthias fights him atop the Joseph Belltower, until Matthias drops the bell on top of Cluny, killing him instantly. Matthias is a hero now, and earns the title \\"Matthias The Warrior.\\" His sword is named Ratdeath, and the story ends with the Abbey under his protection.This book is a fast-paced read, and I highly recommend it. The story is, however, a violent one, with rats, mice, weasels, stoats, ferrets, and shrews getting killed at one point or another. I would recommend it to ages 10-13.One inconsistancy in the book that bothered me time and time agin is the problem with the scale. The Abbey appears to be human-sized; the badger is around the same size as the mice; and I couldn't tell whether the sparrows were smaller than the mice, the same size as the mice, or larger. But some of thes problems are easy to overlook simply because the story is so interesting. I am a fan of Tolkien and Lewis so that says a lot. This book is definately going on my top ten list!"},{"Title":"Redwall: Redwall, Book 1","review":"\\"It was the start of the Summer of the Late Rose. Mossflower country shimmered gently in a peaceful haze, bathing delicately at each dew-laden dawn, blossoming through high sunny noontides, languishing in each crimson-tinted twilight that heralded the soft darkness of June nights.\\"- Brian Jacques.That was a quote showing how beautiful the 1st book in the Redwall series is. You can just see Mossflower when you read that quote. In the beginning of the book, that is how it starts off. But it all goes down from there.Cluny the Scourge and his horde, the most feared group of rats ever, are coming to Redwall! They arrive and when they see the exquisite abbey Cluny automatically wants to take it over. Redwall abbey is a peaceful abbey where they take any hurt animal in and tend to their ailments, they would never think of fighting in a war. But when they see that Cluny is coming they decide to fight to protect the abbey and the creatures in it. Only once before in the history of Redwall have they had to do this type of thing. Martin the Warrior was the mightiest mouse to ever fight for Redwall, and they worship him because he saved it. Matthias has the spirit of Martin the Warrior in him and he is the main person in fighting for Redwall. He has to find the sword of Martin if they want to win. With the help of his friends will he find the mythical sword in time to save Redwall?

It was one of David Lavender's first works in a 40 book career and it does not disappoint. Covering the period 1830-1880 Lavender highlights the people of the southern Rocky Mountains from Yellowstone to Santa Fe. Loaded with interesting vignettes about people we never heard of like Otto Mears, Chief Ouray and mountain man Lucien Maxwell, this book delves into the early economic development and settlement of the land along the Continental Divide.The original settlement of these areas evolved around 2 primary economic activities, mining and transportation, and Lavender richly illustrates the symbiotic relationship between the two. From wagon roads to intermountain railroads, from sledgehammer powered drills to water powered destruction of whole valleys, this book takes the reader on a spectacular, remarkably interesting ride about towns that are some of today's finest skiing destinations: Telluride, Leadville, Alta, Park City and Durango. Mining was religion here. You lived it, smelled it, ate it, breathed it and dreamed it. Transportation equally so: Ore was useless unless it could be gotten to the smelter. Early on, before the smelters came west, ore was transported from Colorado to San Francisco around Cape Horn at the tip of South America and then up to Wales for smelting. And it still netted $180 per ton. The mineral riches were spectacular: Gold, silver in most remarkable amounts, copper, lead and coal.This is a big, brawny, brawling book about rawhide tough people who hack their survival out of an extreme wilderness and in the process settle one of the most beautiful sections of our country. Well written and painstakingly researched, this book is David Lavender at his finest."},{"Title":"The Big Divide","review":"My husband really enjoyed getting this book.

He had a tiny practice and, where it has been possible to check his accounts of what went on in his sessions with the accounts of his patients, it's clear that in his case notes and his books he was a fantasist and a self-serving liar. He is not known ever to have cured a patient, though he claimed to do so almost invariably. He nearly killed some patients by advocating and in one dramatic case personally botching surgery to cure supposed mental illnesses. His name was Sigmund Freud. If he hung up his shingle today, he'd be struck off for malpractice so quick it'd make his ears spin.In his chosen discipline of psychology he has no remnant of credibility and his ideas (that is, those ideas that were actually his; he did not, for example, invent or discover the \\"unconscious\\") have no influence. He is to most psychologists a mildly interesting figure from the history of the discipline, akin in interest and importance to, say, Francis Galton.But in the 1980s something very odd happened. A number of mainly French writers who:* adopted psychoanalytic - usually also Marxist - jargon;* wrote it deliberately badly to disguise the fatuousness of their \\"thought\\";* were briefly popular in France in the 1960s: -suddenly became important in the US and UK. Not in their own fields, where no-one outside their cults took them seriously, but in, of all places, literary criticism.So for a while academic publishers put out literary criticism like Gelpi's book on Shelley, in books that treated charlatans like Freud, Lacan, Kohut and so on as authorities who only need to be quoted in order to establish that something is true. This book is stuffed with the fantastic furniture of those dead cults, from the Mirror stage to the the Oedipus complex to the \\"narcissistic injury\\", and so on. Spectral things they are, these days, like rusting rides in an abandoned fun park.So if you want a book analysing Shelley in an entirely arbitrary and tendentious way, using the concepts of mainly French versions of psychoanalysis, then this is as good a book as any other of its kind.Its kind includes similar books by a number of writers who cited each other and wrote blurbs for each other's books. Each wrote excruciatingly bad books about Shelley in the 1980s and 1990s, from within what appears to have been an academic mutual support system. I know none of them, and have nothing against them except their bad books, but I shan't name and shame. Pick up any one of the books, and you'll find the others getting boosted, if you're interested. But I can't see many people outside the circle bothering to cite much of this stuff, though.If you want a book on what Shelley actually wote, how he wrote, and what his writings actually say, this book is useless. Now lit crit has moved on to fresh fields, and the people who made their careers writing Deleuzian vapour now discreetly omit those names and their associated jargon from their more recent publications. Lacan and the merry crew used to be name-dropped; now they're just dropped.The best recent book on Shelley as a writer, as opposed to a subject for long-distance, chronologically-challenged telepathic psychoanalysis, is probably William Keach's \\"Shelley's style\\". It's illuminating on what Shelley wrote, how he wrote it, what it means, and what's distinctive about Shelley as a writer. Recommended.Summary: in the 1980s and 1990s there was an intellectual train wreck. Round the decay of that colossal wreck there are strewn books like Gelpi's: badly written, incoherent, and written from an intellectual framework that simply has nothing to do with literature or, though it has political pretensions, Planet Earth and its politics. Useful in gardening, I suppose, or as landfill."},{"Title":"Maconochie's Gentlemen: The Story of Norfolk Island and the Roots of Modern Prison Reform (Studies in Crime and Public Policy)","review":"NORVAL MORRISTHE MODERN DAY JOHN HOWARD[The power of political leadership in pursuit of popular support by relentless and unscrupulous means has surely and frequently been demonstrated....a public misled by false statistics, sensational and selective sound bites, and political leaders seeking votes is plain to see....Consequently, a prison regime defines the razor edge between power and freedom, authority and autonomy. NM]In this compelling &quot;roman a clef&quot; entitled: &quot;Maconochie's Gentlemen: The Story of Norfolk Island and the Roots of Modern Prison Reform,&quot; the humanism and the incisive intellect of Norval Morris are beautifully revealed. Published in 2002, the novel gives a vivid portrayal of Alexander Maconochie's heroic achievement of creating a \\"token economy\\" for rewarding positive behavior through a convict \\"Marks System\\" in the penal colony at Norfolk Island, a thousand miles off the coast of Australia, 1840-44. Moreover, it shares a passionate belief that a virtuous prison is possible in the process of maintaining humane and safe prisons. This belief epitomizes the life and work of Norval Morris.Why would anyone devote himself to penal reform? If there is a viable alternative, why choose to suffer the chill breath of adverse public opinion, the bemused stares of neighbors, the frustrations and lack of reward? It is a vexing question; a satisfying answer is not easily come by. Yet, down through the history of prisons, penal reformers are legion. In contemplating the extraordinary saga of John Howard (1773) and his narrative, The State of the Prisons in Europe and England, Norval makes note of his own life's journey of penal reform.In an incomparably lesser way, I have devoted the last five-and-a-half decades to the minutiae of prison regimes in four continents. Yet, a vocation in the academic side of criminal law provided all I needed by way of a comfortable, professional, and personal life. To add myself to the list of prison reformers is not to draw a self-serving comparison. Rather, it is to seek an answer to the troublesome question: Why should anyone of reasonable ability see the conditions of prison life as meriting serious and sustained concern? So, when devising prison conditions, you should devise them for yourself. (NM)As the nineteenth century American prison reform heroine, Elizabeth Gurney Fry has advised: If thee should build a prison, consider thee and thine children might inhabit it. In tribute to Norval Morris, and at his behest for achieving a better understanding of the dilemma(s) of corrections, I recommend an absorbing read of \\"Manonochie's Gentlemen.\\" Here one will find the heart and soul of a life committed to penal reform. Here, too, one will discover how we will all continue to benefit from the enduring legacy of Norval Morris.Jess MaghanChester, Connecticut (2/25/04)"},{"Title":"Maconochie's Gentlemen: The Story of Norfolk Island and the Roots of Modern Prison Reform (Studies in Crime and Public Policy)","review":"&quot;Maconochie's Gentlemen&quot; displays Norval Morris's large gifts as a fine narrative writer and a preeminent social scientist.

It is, in the first instance, an illuminating story, told through the eyes of Captain Maconochie and the family and colleagues he brought with him to Norfolk Island in 1840, of Western society's first efforts at penal rehabilitation. The fiction is followed by incisive reflections by Morris in his role as one of America's leading criminologists, relating Maconochie's experiment to the circumstances today.

It is the only system on White I play [unless I am giving lessons to students]. In fact, I am currently writing a book on this opening.\\"A Killer Chess Opening Repertoire\\" is a high-quality book. Only 144 pages long, but it makes great use of those 144 pages. On the other hand, with so little space, there are some limitations of coverage. One advantage of this book is that it does NOT attempt to cover both the Colle-Koltanowski AND the Colle-Zukertort. Why should a white repertoire book attempt to do both? This saves Summerscale much space to focus on what is important.The book is written with the supposition that you are playing resonably high-level players. This means that you will often be in a situation where your opponent has made a lackluster move not covered in the text, and you will then need to understand how to exploit that. On the other hand, the same could be said of almost any opening book.This book has a very different philosophy than either \\"The Ultimate Colle\\" or \\"Winning with the Colle System.\\" Lane, author of \\"The Ultimate Colle,\\" is content with certain simplifications that Summerscale is not. Smith and Hall's book, \\"Winning with the Colle System,\\" is aimed at lower-level players and tends to be too rosey in its evaluations. Summerscale's book is both more ambitious and more honest than either of these. Summerscale wants a real attacking iniative or some other concrete advantage. If a line does not work well enough, Summerscale is willing to transpose out of the Colle to something more appropriate. Lane and Smith/Hall are less willing to play something substantially different.Summerscale also covers some lines that the other books simply do not. For example, the extremely important 1.df d5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.e6 Bf5 line, quite possibly the most powerful response to the Zukertort, is completely ignored by Lane and Hall!! Summerscale covers it, though he does not spend enough time on it.Another example where Summerscale covers lots of lines others miss are the various early c5 options for black [1.d4 d5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.e3 c5 for example].The common theme here is that Summerscale covers a lot of early deviations and options, but does not go very far down most of those trees. This is more useful than it sounds; trying to track down all the variations in all the anti-colle systems would take hundreds of pages.One problem with the book is that the options it gives [150 attack and barry] for dealing with Gruenfeld/Indian options are systems for which other manuals are not available. It would be good to have separate books on these to bolster the repertoire given. This is a serious issue because those defenses are very common ones.Still, as a extremely fun, slim repertoire book, it is hard to do much better than this!"},{"Title":"A Killer Chess Opening Repertoire (Cadogan Chess Books)","review":"This repertoire, based on 1 d4 utilizes the Colle-Zukertort, 150 Attack and the Barry Attack and covers every Black response. The book has just the right amount of information, enough but not an overwhelming amount of variations. Best of all, the lines chosen eliminate so many Black mainstays such as the King's Indian, Grunfeld, Queens Gambit, etc. etc. It's one of those few repertoire books which is manageable in a short time.zZ"},{"Title":"A Killer Chess Opening Repertoire (Cadogan Chess Books)","review":"This is an above average chess book, but it would be a great book with an extra 20-30 pages of more detailed analysis of key lines, especially on the anti-colle section as early bishop pins from black can be very annoying (I had to use Chessmaster 2500 to figure such lines out). Overall, this book does what it promises."},{"Title":"A Killer Chess Opening Repertoire (Cadogan Chess Books)","review":"This book helped me immensely in winning against oponents and computers. I LOVE the Barry Attack! It's truly amazing! It's such a solid alternative to the Queen's Gambit that I can develop an outright sacrificial attack with it, or slowly destroy my opponent positionally. I found I can use the Barry Attack against all queen pawn responses by black, not just when black uses a fiachetto bishop. The 150 Attack and Colle Zuckertort are also useful weapons to have in your arsenal to shock your opponents, however the Colle Zuckertort has proven ineffective against black's fianchetto positions, so be careful. I recently had three explosive results with the Barry Attack, one against a computer, two against foes. The positions became very interesting because black castled queenside (in all three cases) and I was able to attack efficiently. However I was disappointed when I consulted the book later to find no variations of the B.A. with black castling queenside. Hopefully this will be updated in a future edition."},{"Title":"A Killer Chess Opening Repertoire (Cadogan Chess Books)","review":"This is certainly a book for a player rated over 1200.

Therefore, after reading this book I decided that this system isn't for me!However, this doesn't mean that if you are fairly advanced that this system isn't for you! The book could use some more variations. Overall it is an ok book."},{"Title":"A Killer Chess Opening Repertoire (Cadogan Chess Books)","review":"To begin with, let me state that the greatest book on chess ever written is How to think ahead in Chess by Horowitz. That book truely taught me the basic ideas of a strong opening for beginner, namely, the Stonewall Attack. Before that, I was clueless about handling 1 d4 as white.Now that I have become more comfortable with Stonewall Attack, I have begun to recognize early moves that do not allow me to play Stonewall Attack. In fact, I am clueless on how to handle Kings Indian Defence. I clearly needed to learn a few basic strategies of dealing with early deviations from Stonewall Attack formations, So I started hunting for books. I have browsed through hundreds of books in Borders or B&N; or local libraries and read reviews on Amazon.com for many more. I finally decided that A killer Chess Opening Repertoire would be a good book for me, and I did indeed order it from Amazon.com.It has been a couple of weeks now, and I can say confidently that the joy of playing chess has increased marvelously for me. The best two chapters are the ones on Barry Attack, and Colle Zukertort system. They both provide excellent kingside attacking chances for white - I always go for kingside attack ... I understand the goal much more clearly than the subtle maneuvers involved in QGD. Since I do not make mistakes in the opening with this repertoire, I end up in games that are 70+ moves long and most of the time, I am attacking the king !!! It is really fun !An added benefit has been to adopt the same repertoire in the reversed manner when playing as black. Whenever white fianchettoes is king bishop, I play for Barry attack reversed and the game looks fantastic.One of the good things about the book is that it includes games on early deviation that are not strong and shows how the attack crushed opponents. It is really useful because most of the time at my level, opponents do deviate from the mainline very early and I can look up how to deal with them - While I am not very good at finding the key tactics in a time crunch situation, I am good at copying the tactics - so if I already have a demonstration of the tactics involved in the situation, I can reproduce them over the board.I have read online that Barry Attack and 150 Attack (when Black avoids d5 altogether) are covered only in this book ... I still haven't got around to learning about 150 Attack ... but at my level, almost everyone plays d5 or fianchettoes ... To me, this book fills the critical gap created by the How to Think Ahead in Chess. These are the only two books you will ever need for opening as white.To summarize: If you love to play Stonewall Attack, and are looking for creating a repertoire around that, this book is for you. Stop looking around, I have done all the hardwork, save your time and just buy this one. Note: this book does not actually cover stonewall attack ... for that I recommend the classic -How to Think Ahead in Chess: The Methods and Techniques of Planning Your Entire Game (Fireside Chess Library)"},{"Title":"A Killer Chess Opening Repertoire (Cadogan Chess Books)","review":"...The name of this book is deceptive, this is really for d4 only as white... Maybe if you play 1 Nf3 you can transpose into some of these lines. They do least a few games that start out like that and its one reason I got the book. Mostly I bought the book just for 3 of the chapters... For the Barry attack in chapter 1, 150 attack in chapter 2 and The Anti-Dutch in chapter 7... Ill give a basic review of the entire book though... The introduction explains the basic goals of the book and is worth reading... Basically is for people 2000 and below in STR...Chapter 1 deals with what is called the Barry Attack... The chapter runs from page 7 to page 35 so its decent sized... He gives a basic intro as to why to use the Barry attack and some other things about it... Then gives games and the coverage seems pretty complete to be honest... He does not just data dump so if you actually spend the time and read... You should have a pretty good understanding of the Barry Attack... He gives the basic move order as 1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. Nc3 d5 4. Bf4 Bg7 5. e3 0-0 6. Be2... So you can try that out and see what you think for yourself... Many times the h pawn is sent down the board and is not that easy to stop... The name Barry attack sorta means it looks naive but can have some bite... This is also one of the few books I know that has any coverage of it at all...Chapter 2 deals with what is known as the 150 Attack... This is good to use vs. Pirc and Modern defense setups... It got its name cuz people in England about 150 rating were using it... That would be about 1800 under most rating systems if you were to convert it... It starts on page 36 and ends on page 51... He gives an introduction about it and some games and for the size of book coverage seems good... He does not data dumb and talks so you should be able to least understand it... This is another opening Ive not seen talked about really in any other book... So I was happy that this and Barry attack were in same book :)... Unlike the Barry Attack chapter he does not have any games that start with 1 Nf3 in this chapter...Chapter 3 he gets into the Colle-Zuckertort System... Im really not a huge fan of this system... Still I do not really think its totally bad or anything... Just the style I play it does not seem like it will work well with me... He gives it as an alternative to Queen's Gambit games... I prefer the Levitsky attack in these cases personally... Still he starts on page 52 and ends on page 69... I feel this system can be a bit on the drawing side and hard to get a real advantage... The basic setup he gives is 1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. e3 e6 4. Bd3 c5 5. b3... He also has least 1 example using 1 Nf3 and going into it... So this can be good to know if you play 1 Nf3 at times... Figure more options of openings you have to transpose into the better...Chapter 4 deals with Beating the Anti-Colle systems... The basic setup is 1 d4 d5 2 Nf3 in this chapter... Black responds with moves mostly like ...Bg4, ...Bf5, ...c5, ...Nc6 and also has some 3rd moves by black... The coverage seems pretty decent and at worse you should have basic idea what your doing. It runs from page 70 and ends on page 89 so its got a fair amount of coverage for size of book...Chapter 5 is the Classic Queen's Indian, this chapter tells what can be bad about using Colle-Zuckertort setup all time... Seems mostly for those having trouble with Queen Indian experts... Starts on page 90 and ends on page 102 so maybe not the most coverage on it... Still if you play Colle-Zuckertort probably will need to check this chapter out as well...Chapter 6 is the Anti-Benoni which Im not sure how good a chapter it really is... He takes a shot at the Hawk and does not seem to worry much about Benoni... Still says it can get dangerous for either side in those openings... He does not cover any d4 c5 games of the Benoni... That is really what bothers me about this chapter... It starts on page 103 and ends on page 127... So with all those pages could of least touched on that a little bit... Since as white those are the Benoni style games I have the most trouble with...Chapter 7 deals with what he calls the Anti-Dutch... This guy must of really had a positive childhood using all this Anti stuff in names ;)... I use this sometimes so I was kinda glad that it was in this book to say least... Since really not sure any other books that cover it... Basically the moves are 1 d4 f5 2 Bg5 and the games can get tricky... This can be annoying to black also if they want a certain setup... The chapter starts on page 128 and ends on page 137... I just wish they gave more pages to this chapter and less to one of the others... White wins all 4 games they use as examples... So I guess this must really crush the Dutch :)...Chapter 8 is a great number but sorta weak Odds and Ends... This chapter is kinda cheesy and has only 1 d4 h6 as the only real game it talks about... He gives some other small examples of other second moves... The coverage he gives to them really is not worth a mention... Just to give an idea he thinks that 1 d4 c5 will end up 2. d5 f5 the Clarendon Court variation which he brags about being 100% with... Also is kind enough to mention beating Hebden with it :)... The chapter starts on page 138 and ends on page 141... So not really sure I consider that much if at all a chapter ;)... The Index in the back is actually done rather well for the 3 pages it gets :)...If you play 1 d4 or 1 Nf3 I would think about getting this book... I would say its a solid 4 star book and would of been 5 if not for a few things... The final chapter is kinda weak and maybe some of the systems he talks about are not the best... I would of rather Levitsky attack over Colle-Zuckertort... Still to each their own on that part... Really he left some gaps that I run into and that annoyed me... Many games I play I do 1 d4 and they reply ...c5 or ...e5 and wish he covered that... I really got this book for 3 chapters so I can't complain... I know someone that used this book to get over 1700 on ICC... He swears by the Colle-Zuckertort and other systems in book... This is not for those who like to play early c4 as white... Or who are against blocking their c pawn before pushing it... This is good for those that play 1 d4 and hate pushing c pawn and don't mind blocking it... Also for those that play 1 Nf3 and want more systems to transpose into... Not to mention the Anti-Dutch is worth a try... I have won a few games with it and it can really annoy black... I would say of the newer books this one is better written than most I see... Also he does not just data dump he talks about stuff and gives general ideas..."},{"Title":"A Killer Chess Opening Repertoire (Cadogan Chess Books)","review":"I a was kind of a &quot;trying-hard&quot; chess player studying e4 to include in my repetoire as white, influenced largely by the books I read suggesting that e4 is best. But I found out myself that e4 is just not for me. For one, I have to study and memorize bulks of theory, else my opponent will always be the better prepared. I am not a full-time chess player so I cannot accomplish that. I was almost tempted to study the most off-beat openings if I had not read 'Secrets of Practical Chess' where Nunn advises against such openings because the reason why GM's do not use those openings is they are defective.Why not d4? So I decided to consider d4. I came to know GM Summerscale when I bought his video about the Colle-Zukertort system. The system is so easy to understand that I started to use it in no time after I watched some parts of the video. I won some, lose some. In most of my lost games, black uses a setup where the Colle-Zukertort is not effective such as the Kings Indian, Queen's Indian and pirc. I did not know this. I thought that the Colle-Zukertort can be applied against any black setup.The Killer Opening Repertoire now equips me against any possible black setup. It does not have bulks of variations because you don't have to know detailed variations. Once you know the patterns, you'll know what to move against any black reply (!)I like the chapter about the Anti-Colle systems. The Colle-Zukertort is now very popular that many black players attempt to sidestep the main lines (just like white sidesteping the main line sicilian making alapin so popular). I encountered a lot of games in ICC along these lines.But other chapters are similarly important and clearly written. I think the most amazing is the Barry Attack (against the King's Indian Setup). My winning percentage against the King's Indian using this setup significantly increased.The book can be read in any order you want. For me, I directly go to thepart where the lines are similar to the last few game/s I played so that I can review where my opponent and I deviated from the book lines. I am thinking of encoding this into ChessBase format to make it more convenient to review.I wish there is a similar book for black. A similar approach was by Purdy (24 hour opening repetoire for black) but this is a bad buy because for one it is very outdated. Also, much of the given lines are not taken from grand master games which is GM Nunn's strict requirement for an opening repertoire book.If you are struggling with e4 like me, it is most likely that this book of Summerscale is the right one for you."},{"Title":"A Killer Chess Opening Repertoire (Cadogan Chess Books)","review":"As a low to mid level club player I think Summerscale's book is terrific. I've played Queen pawn openings (Colle System, Torre Attack, London System) for a while, but Summerscale does some really special things with Queen pawn openings in this book. First, instead of offering a single &quot;all purpose&quot; pawn structure (like the standard d4, e3, c3 triangle) he presents various patterns of pawn and piece placement. The various patterns of development all have a similar &quot;flavor&quot;, but each is tailored to attack against a specific defensive pattern that Black might play. These patterns combine to form a complete opening reperoire to use with the White pieces. Second, Summerscale presents some interesting and flexible attacking variations. I especially like his choice of the Colle-Zukertort against 1...d5 and his choice of the Barry attack against King's Indian formations. Third, this book presents complete games that show how these systems can win games for White in modern grandmaster chess, and also historical games that show how ideas have evolved. Fourth, this book is well layed out, with good introductions to each section and a clear index of variations at the end. I really like this book!"},{"Title":"A Killer Chess Opening Repertoire (Cadogan Chess Books)","review":"Opening repertoire books for white are a tricky proposition for a chess author. It is more common to find repertoire books for the black pieces - often based around a particular first move which thereby ensures that whatever white's continuation, the game will be channelled for at least a few more moves in the system of black's choosing. I am thinking, for example, of Yrjola & Tella's excellent 'Explosive Opening Repertoire for Black' in which 1 ... d6 is played against any white opening move. The difficultly is that a white repertoire must be able to cope with a vast variety of black responses - from the Nimzovitch (1 ... Nc6) to the Modern (1 ... g6) and everything in between - yet must not overwhelm the reader by presenting endless variations. Yet there are some successes in presenting a repertoire for the white player - Kosten's 'Dynamic English', Palliser's 'Play 1.d4!' and this book by Summerscale.In many ways, for the average player, I would opine that this book is the better choice. Summerscale presents a queen pawn repertoire with an emphasis on quick development and an attacking set up. Kosten's book, while very well written, advocates quite a sophisticated set up requiring reasonable positional knowledge. Palliser's book is very good, and he presents a solid repertoire using the theoretical best move for white 2.c4, but it is also very comprehensive and thus requires a lot of time to study.By not playing 2.c4 white, in theory, is not pressuring black quite as much - but there are compensating advantages. The most obvious is that the amount of study required is drastically reduced. Another is that white tends to remain in the system of their choosing. Less obviously, these systems lend themselves well to a style of play based on attacking, straightforward chess which is simply quite fun to play. I would recommend - in fact I would say it is essential - reading Vukovic's classic 'Art of Attack in Chess' if you wish to adopt this repertoire in order to get the most out of the aggressive setups you will (hopefully) obtain.But let's not get carried away here. These systems, while easy to learn, can certainly be countered by black. Black can equalise without too much difficultly if they know what they are doing. On the other hand, even the theoretically best openings played in master games usually end up with only a small advantage to white.In my opinion, a more serious defect is in the presentation of the repertoire. The 'complete game' format - while often touted as enabling better comprehension of an opening - also makes it far more difficult to spot holes in the system. For example, I compared the system that Summerscale advocates against the Pirc (150 Attack) with the lines given in the Yrjola & Tella book, which uses the Pirc (in Summerscale's book, you reach the 150 attack by 1.d4 d6 2.e4). In the main line, around move 5, the move given by Yrjola & Tella is simply not considered. Nothing, no mention and its a good move (which I won't disclose - in case you ever use the 150 attack against me in internet chess!). As black, I certainly would not fear the 150 attack based on what I have seen in the Summerscale book. However, this only confirms the point I made above - black can equalise if they know what to do. I guess using this book is about trade offs - you study less, and your games are probably more fun if you find attacking fun, but you have less chance of a lasting advantage against a good player.Physically, this an attractive book. High quality paper, nice typesetting and I like the graphic design on the cover.Overall then Summerscale presents a repertoire that is easy to learn and fun to use, with a few holes which you may be able to plug using other sources. A parting thought - as other reviewers have noted, some of Summerscales lines are less effective against black's indian systems. Have you considered the Trompowsky (1.d4 Nf6 2.Bg5)? It is also an attacking line that is fun to play, and in conjunction with Summerscale's book will broaden your repertoire."},{"Title":"A Killer Chess Opening Repertoire (Cadogan Chess Books)","review":"Tired of the same old Queen's Gambit declined? Facing the King's Indian defence with the same old tired ideas White is supposed to employ? Need something unfamiliar to Pirc defence, Benoni defence and Dutch defence players? Here's your answer!! An all purpose book for the Queen's pawn player, ideas and games are given to show you that 2.c4 can be avoided while still maintaining nice attacking chances. Even though 2.e4 is still given when facing the Pirc, the move order shortly after will leave Pirc players on their own since they can have quite a few 'normal' variations memorized to some extent. I have had particular success with the Berry Attack facing King's Indian defence players. It's great because instead of White castling Kingside and often coming under fire with Black's Kingside pawn advances, White holds off, perhaps castling Queenside instead, and ramming the King's Rook pawn (H Pawn) down Black's throat, eventually opening the Black Kingisde up, which is exactly the opposite of what Black is expecting. I love this book and will continue to employ the ideas put forth when the mood strikes me."},{"Title":"A Killer Chess Opening Repertoire (Cadogan Chess Books)","review":"I have been searching for an opening repertoire for my whole chess life. I keep coming back to this book as most of my answer. I don't want to play 1. e4 because I hate facing the French and the Sicilian (and for that matter, I am not fond of the Caro-Kann, nor do I like facing 1...e5!). I am a 1. d4 player, but I have never been completely comfortable playing 2. c4 because I am a control freak and this move cedes control of the opening to black. He can play queen's gambit accepted, or, alternately, benoni, king's indian, pirc, etc. etc. etc. I find that playing 2. Nf3 gives me more a sense of control over the opening. In addition, it is a safe move, furthers development, and sometimes irritates black players of king's indian, etc. etc. This book by Summerscale is the first place I have found a repertoire that suits my needs. It is truly amazing how it does this. It is a well-written book, it is exciting, and it has lots of analysis. I know I may eventually get to be a 2. c4 player, but I am not there yet.

The colle zukertort seems very good for correspondence chess, black dosent have much counterplay and i have found the kingside attacks generated build up slowly and have real force behind them. Especially good against opponents who are using computer help as they dont see the attack coming until its too late.I have had many people playing the c5 lines against me and i found the benoni section good. Playing Nc3 instead of c4 is underrated and seems to give white good positions.For a booked up club player i think this book will repay itself many times, it will be a tournament winner. It really is the only book you will need for white"},{"Title":"A Killer Chess Opening Repertoire (Cadogan Chess Books)","review":"I found this book from Mr.Summerscale while searching for something more aggressive as white with respect to the Queen's Gambit (I know this seems strange, but let me explain). I used to play the QG simply for 2. c4 ... is generally considered the best follow-up to 1. d4 .... The most of the times I exited the opening phase with an advantage (I have a good memory :-) but at the very beginning of the middlegame ... well ... I simply didn't know what to do! My opponents defended very calmly and very well, waiting for the right moment to counterattack and eventually win the game.\\"A killer Chess Opening Repertoire\\" doesn't contain a killer chess opening repertoire at all! Neither of the lines suggested by Mr.Summerscale will promise you an advantage in the opening, and if black knows what he is doing he is able to equalize without problems. But this is not a problem! The greatness of this book is simple: you are armed with a solid, reliable, difficult to crack opening system for white. You are unlikely to get caught into an opening trap, and if black doesn't exactly know what he is doing (which is the most of the cases in Club/Tournament play) he is likely to equalize and ... eventually lose the game.Yes, through this book I learned the most important thing of chess (for me): the relation among the opening and the middlegame, and how to understand an opening THROUGH the middlegame positions it produces.Now I hardly get an advantage in the opening against good opponents, but after the opening I know what to do very well, and I enjoy my games more.A few remarks about the opening lines the book suggests:a) after 1. d4 d5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. e3 e6 4. Bd3 c4 Summerscale suggest 5. b3 ..., the Colle-Zukertort System. Don't underestimate this opening! It is played quite frequently by GM Artur Yusupov, and if a player of this calibre play the opening, well ... I can definely trust in it!b) after 1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 Summerscale suggest 3. Nc3 d5 4. Bf4 ..., the Barry Attack. This is a very exciting opening system, likely to caught the \\"unaware but always thrustfull\\" KID player in obscure territory. Even the line suggested by (the great) Joe Gallagher in his \\"Beating the Anti King's Indian\\" maybe let black to almost equalize, but brought the game on a positional ground which is certainly not what the KID player wants. And if the KID aficionado don't know the line really well... the white fun will start!c) against the Pirc/Modern (What? The Pirc? But I play 1. d4 ...! Ok, but after 1. d4 g6 or 1. d4 d6 you MUST play 2. e4 ...!) Summerscale suggest the \\"150 Attack\\". I don't like the name, but the name is the only thing I don't like, and since Peter Leko agrees :-) I'm convinced as well! Learn to play well the \\"150 Attack\\" and you will find your opponents to change their repertoire! (BTW even Alburt and Chernin, in their \\"Pirc Alert!\\", the bibble of the Pirc, treat the \\"150\\" setup with great respect)d) against the Benoni Summerscale suggest a line with d5, stating the Colle-Zukertort to be not quite good since black can delay ...d5! I prefer to stick to the Colle, even if this time I prefer the Koltanowski variation, which is not covered in the Summerscale book (if you are interested, I can suggest \\"The Ultimate Colle\\" by Gary Lane)e) against the Dutch, Summerscale suggests 2. Bg5.... Leaving apart that this line can be completely ruled out by the move order 1. d4 e6! (the exclamation mark assumes black wants to follow-up with 2. ... f5, being ready for a French after 2. e4 ...), I'm sorry but I don't know very well this chapter because I play the Dutch myself as black and when faced with it as white I prefer one of the main lines. If you have no time to spend on the main line Dutch, then I think 2. Bg5... is a good choice, but you have to find something after 1. d4 e6 2. Nf3 f5.f) against the Queen's Indian, again Summerscale opts to leave apart the Colle-Zukertort since black can avoid ...d5 for as long as he wishes. Ok, but I don't want to learn a new line, and following a suggestion from Mr.Lane's book (see above) I stick to the Colle-Zukertort nevertheless.To summarize, five starts for a great book which teaches you how to study openings, and give you a very good system to start."},{"Title":"A Killer Chess Opening Repertoire (Cadogan Chess Books)","review":"I would say this is one of the best opening books available.

He was once here walking and living on this earth, but He is now in heaven. He uses other means now to maintain a personal relationship with us. For example, we can know Christ through His word and through prayer. Just as in the book, He often also sends other Christians along in our life to help us and encourage us. This book is a good example of a walk of faith. We can't see and physically touch Christ right now, but when we are in heaven we WILL see Him just as Bunyan talks about in the book.

[July note: Penguin is again listing it as current!] Most of my comments are specific to this edition, and a few other closely related text editions.Back in, I think, the early 1970s, I was taking a course in seventeenth century English literature, and encountered a library copy of Roger Sharrock's 1960 Oxford English Texts edition of \\"The Pilgrim's Progress from This World to That Which is to Come,\\" an immensely impressive editorial treatment of the famous allegory of the Christian life, but fairly expensive, and, I think, out of print. (There was a revised printing in 1975; it seems to be out of print for now.) Sharrock's edition was intended as a revision of a 1928 edition by J.B. Wharey, but it broke new ground in Bunyan studies. It returned for its base text for Part One to the first edition of 1678, drawing on the second (also 1678) and third (1679) editions only for Bunyan's additions to the text. (For Part Two, published in 1684, only its first printing has any claim to authority.)This decision was based on the recognition that printing house practices had rather quickly denatured Bunyan's highly personal, colloquial, and even regional (Bedfordshire) English, turning it into what typesetters thought of as acceptably genteel, beginning as early as the second printing. The progress of textual corruption had continued through the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, despite several attempts to provide scholarly editions. Close study of Bunyan's other, rather extensive, and generally less frequently printed, writings, helped to establish a clearer idea of his use of English, as against that of the printers. For the first time in centuries, Bunyan's most famous book was available in (almost) exactly his own words, as nearly as possible as he had set it on paper. Since Bunyan's vocabulary and style of punctuation reflected the speaking voice of an accomplished preacher (the \\"crime\\" for which he was imprisoned for twelve years), this almost amounted to restoring the correct meter to a poem long printed with incorrect versification.Fortunately, or so it seemed, Roger Sharrock had also edited a very slightly modernized text, without the full critical apparatus and notes, for the Penguin English Library (1965). It was not readily available at the campus bookstore, and the student-oriented stores in the area were already being replaced by chains, but there was a religious --- excuse me, a *Christian* -- bookstore in the neighborhood, which had a good selection, and generally well-informed and helpful clerks. I was bemused to find an unfamiliar member of the staff, who was quite enthusiastic about the King James Bible, in what is in fact Elizabethan English, but dubious about an unmodernized version of \\"Pilgrim's Progress.\\" The book's language is almost a century closer to us in time, and it claims only to be the work of a \\"Tinker and a Poor Man\\" (as the title of American editions of Christopher Hill's biography reminds us), not divine revelation. Still, she assured me, an original-spelling edition of it would be just \\"too hard to understand.\\" Surely I would be better off with one of the many nice adaptations or retellings? See the children's' section. (I had a sudden image of a special angel assigned to each and every copy of the King James Version, to supply linguistic information to its readers, lest they go astray over the unfamiliar words and grammar, but decided not to confide this to the clerk, who was trying to be helpful.)In the end, it turned out the Penguin English Library edition was unavailable; I eventually found a used copy, years too late for the course, but worth having. I don't find Bunyan an edifying guide to the religious life (see below), but he is in many ways an appealing human being, and a remarkable writer, the author of the last great medieval allegories in English, which are at the same time among the first modern novels.In 1986, however, Penguin reissued Sharrock's popular edition in the Penguin Classics series, and even gave it a revised edition in 1987, as well as a splendid new cover (from William Blake's illustration of a scene in the book). In the meantime, the Oxford text as such formed the basis of a World's Classics edition, edited by H.N. Keeble, with a new introduction, helpful notes, and a chronology of Bunyan's life based on the latest research (1984). That edition went through a number of printings, and was reissued in slightly larger format when the World's Classics line was revamped as the Oxford World's Classics. Keeble's edition has just been replaced by a new version by W.R. Owens, likewise following Sharrock's critical edition, but restoring a few more (specified) first edition readings which, in Owens' view, make sense as they stand; I have reviewed this last separately.It should be made clear that I have written this review as a reader with an interest in seventeenth century English literature and history, and a concern with the combination of realism of style and incident with a narrative of marvels and adventures. As far as what John Bunyan considered most important about his work, I am probably a less than ideal reader. Although coming from a secularized Jewish background instead of an Orthodox one, I tend to agree with David Daiches that the Pilgrim, Christian, seems to spend far too much time worrying \\"What must I do to be saved?\\" in the World to Come, and too little asking \\"What ought I to do?\\" in this world. Still, I find Bunyan's sincerity, and willingness to work out the implications of his theology, impressive in their own right."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress (Great Epics)","review":"This book is truly a literary classic!

Despite its archaic language and sometimes tedious preaching, I found my time well rewarded. The familiar aspects showed me as much as the unfamiliar ones did.Among the unfamiliar ones, I was struck by the pervasiveness of the religious sense in Bunyan's world. Seemingly ever action was seen in terms defined by religion. It almost appeared as the sole source of light in that world, without which nothing could really be seen, and tinting everything with its own color. Likewise, the literary tool of \\"morality play\\" naming sounded odd to my modern ear. Writers still use names in many ways, but characters names like Hope, Atheist, or Mr. Money-Love come across as heavy handed. Perhaps that mechanism helped in a semi-literate society, where subtlety of reading could not be counted on; perhaps it acted as a short-hand, invoking values shared consensually across a fairly homogeneous society.More familiar aspects of the storytelling also struck me, possibly because of their contrast to the ones no longer used in modern writing. Christian's journey, for example, has been copied repeatedly and in many variations by writers ever since. Not just allegory for seeking, it provides a natural way to expose the protagonist to a series of other characters and challenges, and foreshadows some destination for the story. The \\"journey\\" has been refined over the years since Bunyan and rarely takes such a central spot in more recent texts, but I enjoyed seeing it in this relatively pure and primitive form.In itself, 'The Pilgrim's Progress' holds only slight interest for me. As an historical document, reflecting the religious sense of its time, and as an ancestor of modern writing, I found it fascinating.-- wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress (Great Epics)","review":"This book was packaged in a plastic rap which was very nice as I am giving it as a gift to my Pastor and his wife.

Rich in Biblical theology, it is the best-known allegory of the Christian's life. It tells the story of a pilgrim named Christian as he walked a journey from the City of Destruction (where he lived before his conversion) to the Celestial City (an allegory of heaven), sharing with us the many challenges, obstacles, comfort, and encouragement Christian encountered in his long journey. This book reminds me that I, too, am walking in a similar spiritual journey as Christian did.When I read of Christian passing through the Valley of Humility and falling into the Swamp of Despondence, I'm reminded of those times when I, too, was in such a swamp and valley, and how God graciously used those trials to humble, comfort, and rescue me.The Pilgrim's Progress reminds me and encourages me with the Biblical promise that regardless of what deep valleys I may be in, whatever swamps I fall into, whatever rough roads I tread, whatever rivers to ford, or whichever steep hills I may be climbing in my own life journey ... my Guide is ever watchful, my Deliverer unfailing, and He is indeed faithful in keeping and persevering all of His elect in the faith till they arrive to their final destination at the Celestial City--that glorious, everlasting City that is so different than the one I've traveled from and \\"built not by the hands of man.\\" Every Christian can learn and be encouraged from the Biblical doctrines taught in this story."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress (Great Epics)","review":"I give this book away every chance i get $$$ enough to do so.The first time i read it i was amazed at how i was on this adventure and it was changing the way i thought of things.and how it influenced my dreams was amazing as well; being that the story is a telling of a dream, made me even more in wonder.than i read it a second time and could not believe the amount of detail that comes out of this little book. if you know your Scriptures you will see them jump off the pages and here they are with visual application.If you don't know Scripture and find it hard to understand what The Bible is saying, here is a story that puts it in perspective.I love this book and can now understand why it has been so poplular for so many many years.i will read this book again and again as medicine for my soulHigh five for John Bunjan"},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress (Great Epics)","review":"This past year in school my class studied &quot;Pilgrim's Progress&quot;.

Be aware, however, that much of it will seem trite and worn -- not because of anything inherently wrong with Bunyan's writing -- primarily because we have all heard so many poor imitations that it will be difficult to put them aside.However, this book still warrants a reading for the simple fact that it is a great story!

The price was very competitive and it made a great gift to a dear friend."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress (Great Epics)","review":"Pilgrim's Progress is without a doubt one of the true classics of time--an allegory that has remained a best seller years after its introduction.My first introduction to Pilgrim's Progress was as a child in parochial school. I had to do a book report on it in 5th grade and ended up reading numerous times for various projects throughout grade school.The reader follows the main character--aptly named &quot;Christian&quot;--on his journey to the Celestial City.Along the way, Christian passes through the many trials of life, symbolized by intruiging characters and places along the way. An early temptation is the &quot;City of Destruction&quot;, which Christian narrowly escapes with his life. The various characters are perhaps the most fascinating portion of the book--Pliable, Giant Despair, Talkative, Faithful, Evangelist, and numerous others provide the reader with a continual picture of the various forces at work to distract (or perhaps, encourage)Christian on his ultimate mission.Of course, the theology (for those of the Christian faith) of Pilgrim's Progress is a constant source of debate, the book is nonetheless a classic of great English writing.It's not a quick read--that's for sure--however, I certainly would recommend that one read it in its original form. Don't distort the beauty of the old English language with a modern translation."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress (Great Epics)","review":"In this classic work, John Bunyan paints a detailed picture of the Christian life/walk, giving true-to-life insights and experiences. The despair, sorrows, trials and temptations that a believer may face are depicted in an allegorical manner, as well as the hope, joy, and salvation found in Jesus Christ. The main character Christian (once named Graceless) sets out on a lifelong journey from the City of Destruction, where his family disowned him, and encounters many persons and difficulties along the way to the Celestial City (heaven). The characters he meets are given names that reflect their mindset or what temptation they bring. At times he stumbles and at times he perseveres, but all by the grace of God. The second portion of the book tells of the conversion and subsequent sojourn of the wife (Christiana) and children of Christian. The discussions of Christian in the first part and Christiana and her companions in the second part are very interesting, as they defend their faith and explain their purpose to those they meet along the way. The book is quite different from your ordinary novel, and has many interesting words of wisdom for the Christian life. Readers should be aware that some of the language is antiquated and has unfamiliar usages, so its a little bit of an adjustment to read."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress (Great Epics)","review":"A letter to Marvin Minsky about this book:I urge you tolook at a remarkable book by the English Puritain John Bunyan(1628-1688), \\"The Pilgrim's Progress\\", which is one of the great evangelical Christian classics, though clearly that is not why it interests me and should interest you (although I AM interested in the puzzle that is the religious sense, which even the irreligious feel, and this book can give remarkable insight into that as well).Rather its fascination lies in the pilgrimage it depicts, or in the fact that human traits, vices, virtues, &amp;c are PERSONIFIED as particular individuals who are their living and speaking epitome, and who are encountered along the way in revealing situations.Bunyan's hero is appropriately named Christian. Someone once wrote that \\"Christian's journey is timeless as he travels from the City of Destruction to the Celestial City, meeting such characters as Pliable, Talkative, Giant Despair, Evangelist, Worldly-Wiseman, Faithful, Ignorance and Hopeful.\\"At first this personification is merely amusing, even a bit annoying (as caricatures or truly stereotypical people can be); but after a while I found myself enthralled because I realized that the effect of this odd literary device was to give unmatched insight into the nature of such traits. The force of the whole thing comes from the fact that one journeys about in - literally INSIDE of - what is both a comprehensive and finite moral and psychological landscape (a \\"psycho-topography\\"), very much as though one were INSIDE the human mind and your \\"Society of the Mind\\" was embodied in the set of actors. This is more or less the opposite or an inversion of the \`real world' of real people, who merely SHARE those attributes or of whom the attributes are merely PIECES; in \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\", by contrast, the attributes are confined in their occurrence to the actors who are their entire, unique, pure, and active embodiment, and humanness, to be recognized at all, has to be rederived or mentally reconstructed from the essential types.The effect, for me, was something like experiencing a multidimensional scaling map that depicts the space of the set of human personality types, by being injected directly - mentally and bodily - into it by means of virtual reality technology.So Bunyan's book has something of the interest to a psychologist, neuroscientist, or philosopher that Edwin Abbot's \\"Flatland\\" has to a mathematician.I don't mean to overpraise \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\", of course; it was written for theological rather than scientific purposes, and has conspicuous limitations for that reason. But its interest to a student of the mind who looks at it at from the right point of view can be profound.- Patrick Gunkel"},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress (Great Epics)","review":"I have to admit that I've never been a fan of Pilgrim's Progress. Despite the fact that I usually like all sorts of folk art and corny stuff in general, this ham-fisted allegory just seemed too weird---too kooky.Yet Edward de Souza's *reading* of the text turns the thing into a work of art. I'm a voracious consumer of audiobooks, and I have to say that De Souza's performance for Naxos here is the best I've ever heard. The dramatic pause---almost as if perhaps he's thinking up the name---just before he tells you the goofy name of each new character, turns what I used to consider the most annoying aspect of the book, into the most charming instead. Bravo.And it's not just this book. From the opening strains of the fine, authentic 17th century music, you're at once made to know that Naxos has thankfully brought the art of the audiobook out of the dark ages.

I dreamed, and behold, I saw a man clothed with rags, standing in a certain place, with his face from his own house, a book in his hand, and a great burden upon his back. I looked, and saw him open the book, and read therein; and, as he read, he wept, and trembled; and, not being able longer to contain, he brake out with a lamentable cry, saying, &quot;What shall I do?&quot;In this plight, therefore, he went home and refrained himself as long as he could, that his wife and children should not perceive his distress; but he could not be silent long, because that his trouble increased. Wherefore at length he brake his mind to his wife and children; and thus he began to talk to them: &quot;O my dear wife, said he, and you the children of my bowels, I, your dear friend, am in myself undone by reason of a burden that lieth hard upon me; moreover, I am for certain informed that this our city will be burned with fire from heaven; in which fearful overthrow, both myself, with thee my wife, and you my sweet babes, shall miserably come to ruin, except (the which yet I see not) some way of escape can be found, whereby we may be delivered.&quot; -John Bunyan, The Pilgrim's ProgressPilgrim's Progress, though hardly anyone reads it anymore, is one of the best-selling books of all time and was enormously influential for several centuries; in fact, we are still living under its influence. However, like Dante's Inferno, it has passed out of favor in recent years, not because of its pedantry and antiquated style, but because much of its message is simply too harsh for the tenor of our times.The narrator relates an allegorical dream in which Christian, having received knowledge that his city is to be destroyed by heavenly fire, leaves his wife and children and sets out on a quest for salvation which takes him to the Celestial City. In the Second Book, his wife, Christiana, and the kids follow. In their travels, they must pass through such places as The Valley of Humiliation and Death, the Slough of Despond, and Vanity Fair, and must resist the blandishments of folks like Ignorance and Hypocrisy. Ultimately, all of the pilgrims do make it and enter through the gates of the City, saved by their unbroken faith.It's easy to see why the story was so popular. First, it's an exciting tale of adventure; one reviewer aptly refers to Christian as a Protestant Indiana Jones. Second, it is triumphant, with Christian overcoming all the odds to arrive in the Celestial City, nor is there ever any real doubt that he is going to succeed. Bunyan, who had become a Baptist preacher after a lifetime of tormenting dreams and struggles with doubt, wrote the story (and an autobiography) during two periods of imprisonment, one lasting twelve years, for holding services that were not in accordance with the teachings of the Church of England. Especially in light of the author's circumstances, he expresses a bold certainty that Christian's path is in fact the path to Heaven.But it's here that we see why the book is no longer popular. Start with the idea that God's judgment is coming and that most of us face the fire this time. Then add in the concept that Christian's are embattled by temptation and the sinners around them, and that many will succumb. Top it all off with the notion that it is only by following in the Pilgrim's footsteps that you can attain salvation, that everyone else is doomed to Hell. These aren't exactly the humanistic, inclusive, permissive doctrines which inform modernity are they ?But there's one crucial tenet of Nonconformist Protestantism which Pilgrim's Progress captures and which is both the religion's greatest gift and worst legacy to modern times : the primacy of the individual. John Bunyan experienced the struggle for faith as an intensely personal battle and his protagonist, Christian, likewise makes his pilgrimage alone. It shocks our sensibilities for him to abandon his family and friends to their fiery fate, but such is his desire for &quot;eternal life&quot; that abandon them he does. Here lies the two-edged sword of the radical Protestantism of the 16th and 17th centuries, for if it is true (and I think it is) that this emphasis on the individual in religious matters also spread to economic and political matters and brought about the concurrent rise of protestantism, democracy and capitalism, it is also true that this emphasis on the individual, if unchecked by morality, ethics and institutions, leads to the complete atomization of society and a cult of selfishness which undermines the very free society that it creates. Personal freedom has been the greatest engine of progress that mankind has ever known, and it has been generated in large part by the Protestantism of which Bunyan was a part; but that same freedom, if torn loose from the laws, responsibilities and moral precepts out of which it grew, becomes mere license. The individual, though paramount, is not sufficient. Freedom, though vital, is not everything. In particular, extreme individualism and liberty are inadequate ideals around which to build a civil society.Christian's pilgrimage conveys the message that faith is the most important quality we bring to our approach towards God. As theology, this doctrine of &quot;salvation through faith alone&quot; is harmless enough, and for all we know it is absolutely correct. But in organizing Man's affairs here on Earth, we have to emphasize works as well as faith--works which manifest themselves in following the law, accepting one's responsibilities to one's fellow men, and behaving morally. Otherwise, come Judgment Day, God won't have to smite us with heavenly fire, we'll have destroyed ourselves already.Bunyan's book, besides being a rousing adventure tale, should be read both because of the influence it has exerted in shaping the modern world and because the issues it raises, of individualism and the like, are still just as important today, when they have gone to far, as they were when he was writing, and they had not come far enough. It is a brilliant, though flawed, work, one who's impact on English Literature and Western Culture can not be overstated.GRADE : A-"},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress (Great Epics)","review":"Pilgrim's Progress is an important religious work, and should be read for that reason alone. It can be heavy going at times because of the moralizing and preaching that goes on throughout, but in spite of that there is a pretty good story here.

This book is a product of the Protestant Reformation (published in 1684) just after the release of the King James Version of The Bible.

We will find the waters of life deeper or shallower according to our faith in the King of the Place (Heaven). Buy the book. I don't think you will be disappointed.

I struggled and persevered with it, using a dictionary to decipher most words longer than 6 letters! Eventually I came to the end with with a strong determination to face up to my life with the same courage as Christian! Unfortunately, like Christian, I lost my way,more than once in my later years, lingering in unseemly places,falling into pools of Despondancy,and loosing Hope at one stage. I cant really remember the entire ending to Christian's journey,but as a man of some years now, and finding life a lot less turbulent and more meaningful,then I graciously look forward to the final part of my journey. Praise be to God. Like the book of JOB,John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress is impossible to rate with a few stars!

I am making plans right now to read it to my kids (right after we get through with the Chronicles of Narnia series). Though this book is old (published 1682) it is still one of the best descriptions of the Christian life available in either fiction or non-fiction form. The mental image that has stuck with me since the day I first read this book is of Christian coming up on the cross. &quot;He ran thus till he came at a place somewhat ascending; and upon that place stood a Cross, and a little below, in the bottom, a sepulchre. So I saw in my dream, that just as Christian came up with the Cross, his burden loosed from off his shoulders, and fell from off his back, and began to tumble, and so continued to do so, till it came to the mouth of the sepulchre, where it fell in, and I saw it no more. Then was Christian glad with a merry heart. He hath given me rest by his sorrow and life by his death. Then he stood still a while, to look and wonder, for it was very surprising to him that the sight of the cross should thus ease him of his burden.&quot; Unfortunately I have met some who won't read this book due to it's length and archaic language, and this is a great loss for them. Truly this is a book that warms the heart, rekindles our affection for Christ, and provides encouragement for us in our own journey to the Celestial City."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress (Great Epics)","review":"I read this book about 8 years ago and still have it in memory. I cannnot recollect everything the book said vividly as at now. However, I still recollect what the story entails: a guy named christian who decided to leave his home to the celestial city. Basing all his actions on his strong faith in God, he went through a lot of up's and down's. I remember at one time he gave up and decided to return but he had a change of mind on the way and decided to pursue his journey. This is a great book and I'll encourage anyone who gets the opportunity to spend a little time reading it. It is highly inspirational."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress (Great Epics)","review":"The Pilgrim's Progress is perhaps one of the most enduring allegories ever written; it has set the form for several more recent works (Hannah Hurnard's \\"Hind's Feet on High Places,\\" most notably). Bunyan's work was, for 18th century Christians, a companion to the Bible. The theology is a perfect example of Reformation thought, and were it not for a major flaw in the allegory, this work would be just about perfect.Setting out from the City of Destruction, Christian makes his journey throughout many perils and temptations, eventually finding his way (through death) to the Celestial City, to live with Christ and the saints. Along the way he learns much about evading temptation, and much practical advise on escaping sin is given to the reader through his discussions with travelling companions Faithful and Hopeful.However, by no means is Christian's journey representative of the Christian life as it is meant to be lived. Two stunning flaws stand out - first, that Christian in no way has any direct contact with Christ, until after his death; secondly, that Christian's life is devoid of relationships, outside of his two travelling companions.These two realities of the novel are startling, especially given that the Christian life is, first and foremost, relational-primarily, the Christian lives in relation to God, and then in relation to his neighbor. The Christian is not an island; he is to evade the world, but love those in it. Bunyan entirely misses this key point.Not only is the life Bunyan paints theologically incorrect, but it is entirely undesireable. It would be unimaginable for the Christian to live an entire life without, along the way, enjoying intimacy with Christ. Indeed, it is these moments of intimacy in spite of imperfection, which drive the Christian's soul onward. And it hardly needs mentioning that a Christian who, rather than reaching out and loving those around him, dismisses them as sinners and leaves them behind, is more reminiscent of Pharasitical hypocrisy, than Christian love.If one is looking for a challenging allegory, they need look no further than Hannah Hurnard's \\"Hinds Feet on High Places;\\" its protagonist, Much Afraid, is throughout her journey often in direct contact with Christ, and her redemption comes not through death, but through Christ making her able to go out into the world and love. Though \\"Hind's Feet\\" is not as theologically rich as Bunyan's allegory, its practical application is far more uplifting, hopeful, and correct."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress (Great Epics)","review":"Other than the Bible this book has sold more copies than any other book in history.

Hendrickson Christian Classics. ISBN 156563134X. (Due to Amazon's tendency to post reviews of one edition of a book on another edition's product page, make sure you're viewing the product page for ISBN 156563134X.)This review focuses on the edition only, as the Pilgrim's Progress itself needs no review. The hardcover binding is handsome and tasteful, and looks well on the shelf. The typeface is very readable. It would in fact be a perfect inexpensive edition of a great allegory, if not for two relatively minor flaws.The first is no \\"Note on the Text,\\" or even the name of an editor (of this volume; I believe the series may have a general editor). From what edition was this text edited? What other editions were consulted? What is the history of the text of the Pilgrim's Progress? A Note on the Text wouldn't have been much trouble, and would have raised this edition up a notch or two.The second is the glossing of words such as \\"I trow\\" which the unknown editor considers difficult for modern English readers. Glossing should properly be done either with footnotes or in the margins, but in this edition, the glosses are in brackets immediately following the word glossed. E.g. \\". . . I trow [believe] . . .\\" I find the procedure annoying; other readers might find it helpful. And if glosses in brackets make a great work of English literature accessible to more readers, then I suppose the editor is justified.Other than that, it's an excellent edition. I commend Hendrickson for bringing out their line of \\"Christian Classics\\" in handsome bindings for very low prices."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress (Great Epics)","review":"This is a Christian classic that is my favorite of all Christian works, bar none (except the bible of course). Possibly the second most published work outside the bible, it has been highly regarded by many, and was once widely taught in the schools.I wish my school had taught it. I first read this book a year ago, and I feel as if I've been deprived all my life.Pilgrim's Progress is written by a mature Christian, with insights that you will not get from anyone other than a mature Christian. Few people are capable of writing such a book.And the book shines with great quotes. Two of my favorites are:What means this? The Interpreter answered, 'This is Christ, who continually with the oil of grace maintains the work already begun in the heart, by the means of which, notwithstanding what the Devil can do, the souls of his people prove gracious still. AND IN THAT THOU sawest that the man stood behind the wall to maintain the fire, this is to teach thee that it is hard for the tempted to see how this work of grace is maintained in the soul.And this: Now a little before it was day, good Christian, as one half amazed, brake out in this passionate speech. 'What a fool', quoth he, 'am I , thus to lie in a stinking dungeon, when I may as well walk at liberty. I have a key in my bosom, called promise, that will (I am persuaded) open any lock in Doubting-Castle.'A key called promise.. great thoughts.There are many editions to Pilgrim's Progress, and I haven't found one I am happy with yet. Try to get one with the original wording, and the references to passages in the bible. Many versions delete the references to passages in the bible, which are, of course, the most useful to Christians and of least use to the world.ISBN 0140430040 appears to be true to the original wording of the classic. On the other hand, it lacks the biblical passage references, chapter divisions, and is a paperback with (quite frankly) an ugly cover.ISBN 0785242228 is a modern spelling version. However comparing it to the original shows that a lot more than just the spelling has been changed, and it doesn't read nearly as well. This is a nicely bound hardback with quality paper and chapter divisions, and some (but not all) the references to the bible. Character names are annoyingly abbrievated throughout book.ISBN 1557480990 is a children's version of Pilgrim's Progress. While a children's book, it remains true to the original and is worth getting. The illustrations are great.There are also many etext versions of Pilgrim's Progress that include the original text and all the references the text makes to passages in the bible.I recommend you take your time reading the book, and reflect on what is being said. Also, if you have a full version of this book, with the references to passages in the bible, you could use it as part of a bible study.BTW: the phrase 'vanity fair' comes from this book."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress (Great Epics)","review":"In contrast to Dante, Bunyan fills his allegory with real people, not just stereotypes - or even archetypes. Though his characters have names like &quot;Honest,&quot; &quot;Feeble-mind,&quot; and &quot;Ignorance,&quot; they come across as real people given a nickname. The names apply to some extent, of course, but not to the point of making caricatures out of the characters.This volume contains parts I and II of Pilgrim's progress. The first part concerns the journey of a pilgrim named &quot;Christian,&quot; while the second describes the journey of his wife, Christiana. Both start from the City of Destruction and both encounter many of the same obstacles - the Slough of Despond, the Vanity Fair, the Castle Doubt - before reaching the gates of the Celestial City. Other than that, their journeys are rather different, for Christian travels on his own, with a bit of help here and there, and with one or another traveling companion, but his progress is almost entirely his own. Christiana, by contrast, travels as part of an ever growing company, who support one another and who are defended by one or two powerful champions.You never lose sight of the allegory, but this work is not a mere tract. The story itself and the characters entertain - even today."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress (Great Epics)","review":"This book is essential reading for any Christian who wants to &quot;fight the good fight&quot; and to finish the race well. The excellent thing about this book is that it helps to give the big picture of life and what small events that happen in life can mean in the scheme of things. The first book is about about a man named Christian (you can see that the allegory isn't too hard to understand) and the things that happen to him after he starts on the journey on the road that leads to Heaven. We see how with each step and misstep along the way Christian has the option of continuing on the road to Heaven or giving up, and that helps us readers to realize that the same thing is true in our own lives. Another thing I really like about this book is how even when Christian totally goes off the path and in the wrong direction, God extends grace to him and he is able to return once again to the road to Heaven. The second book is about Christian's wife and family, and is also worth a read. One thing to note though, unless you are extremely comfortable reading old English (which I am not), it would be a good idea to get the modern language version instead of the original; because I read the original and there were several times when I thought about how I probably would prefer a more readable, modern translation. But whichever version you choose, make sure you read this book. It will help you to thoughtfully consider the here and now and also your final destination."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress (Great Epics)","review":"Everyone should read Pilgrim's Progress. I read it for the first time last week. It is a book about a journey by the main character, Christian. It will also set you on your own journey through the Bible. John Bunyan writes that his allegory contains \\"nothing but sound and honest Gospel strains\\" and he includes references to Bible verses on nearly every page. I found it easy to understand Christian's journey by looking up these verses in my Bible as I came to them. By doing this, Bunyan was giving me fresh guidance because I had not read many of these verses recently. The references also allow me to keep Bunyan accountable for his words by comparing them to Scripture.Reading a book is a journey in itself, especially when it is read along with the Bible. It was also a literal journey for me because I was reading Pilgrim's Progress while on an airplane. In one sense I was meeting John Bunyan for the first time through his book while at the same time my flight from Los Angeles to London was taking me closer to Bunyan literally. On City Street in London is a cemetery called Bunhill Fields which is full of non-conformist preachers (Puritans and others who severed their ties from the Anglican church establish by Charles II). This is where John Bunyan is buried. Last night when I finished the book I came across a related quote by Charles Spurgeon:Go into Bunhill-fields, and stand by the memorial of John Bunyan, and you will say, \\"Ah! there lies the head that contained the brain which thought out that wondrous dream of the Pilgrim's Progress from the City of Destruction to the Better land. There lies the finger that wrote those wondrous lines which depict the story of him who came at last to the land Beulah, and waded through the flood, and entered into the celestial city.\\"So the day after finishing Pilgrim's Progress I took Spurgeon's advice and went into Bunhill Fields to see Bunyan's tomb (as well as John Owens). It is ironic that a man whose life and thoughts so greatly followed and conformed to the Word of God would receive the reputation of non-conformist. It's clear from the story where Bunyan's loyalties lie:Ignorance: What be good thoughts respecting ourselves?Christian: Such as agree with the Word of God.Ignorance: When do our thoughts of ourselves agree with the Word of God?Christian: When we pass the same judgment upon ourselves which the Word passes...Ignorance: What are good thoughts concerning God?Christian: Even, as I have said concerning ourselves, when our thoughts of God do agree with what the Word saith of him.I appreciate Bunyan's regard for the truth. He clearly shows that we all are born into the City of Destruction wearing nothing but rags. He insists that the only road to the Celestrial City is through the Narrow Gate. He portrays the progression of our sanctification as a grueling journey, but one that is nevertheless fueled by God's grace. The true nature of worldliness is portrayed in Vanity Fayre, Satan's schemes are encountered and explained, and numerous actions, attitudes, and feelings are examined.Pilgrim's Progress is about the ultimate journey of life of pursuing a pure heart through faith in Jesus. By modeling faithfulness and perseverance, its characters illustrate the trials and tribulations by which God works His good in us. This book is a classic and I hope it remains in print for a long time so many more generations can learn and be encouraged by it."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress (Great Epics)","review":"\\"The Pilgrim's Progress\\" is a classic Christian text written by John Bunyan. Written in an allegorical format, the two-part story focuses first on \\"Christian\\", then on his wife \\"Christiana\\" and sons. Convicted of their own sinfulness, the characters set out on the journey to salvation at the Heavenly Gate. Characters such as \\"Honesty\\", \\"Great-Heart\\", and \\"Faithful\\" aid the pilgrims on their journey, whereas they face trials from the Slough of Despond, Vanity Fair, and the Valley of the Shadow of Death.Getting through the book takes some work, less because of the story and more because of the depth of the allegory. Also, the dialogues between characters regarding salvation and righteousness often require a careful read. However, the story is exceptionally creative and thought-provoking, and the lessons that can be gleaned from it are timeless and worth the effort that needs to be expended. I recommend reading this one at least twice."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress (Great Epics)","review":"John Bunyan confronts the world head on in his allegory The Pilgrim's Progress. Using the journey, conversations, actions, and interactions of his main character, Christian, Bunyan draws contrasts between true Christianity and the vast array of opposing philosophies and opinions offered by the rest of the world. Each contrast demonstrates the superiority of Christianity to the perspectives and beliefs of the fallen world.The story is told through the use of a narrative device. That devise is that of the narrator himself recounting his dream in which Christian makes his way to the Celestial City. The device serves to put the action of the story in context as well as a way break up the story into manageable segments. A key phrase often used in service of this device is: &quot;then I saw in my dream&quot;. The narrator's dream begins in the City of Destruction; which is Christian's homeland. As Christian Journeys to the celestial city, he encounters many people and trials. Each one is representative of various worldly, or otherworldly philosophies or beliefs.Bunyan has in all these encounters faced the problem of the truth of Christianity. If Christianity is true, how come there are all these alternative ideas in the world. Bunyan successfully exposes the weaknesses of the alternative ideas by refuting them one by one in the context of his pilgrimage allegory. Through his characters, Bunyan agrees with the apostle Paul. His argument is that our best weapon as Christians (once we have accepted Christ as our Savior and realized that only his grace is sufficient to save us) is to keep our eyes on God and the things of heaven (Colossians 3:2). All the arguments presented by the characters contrary to Christianity in this book add up to meaningless noise compared to the word of God and the truth expressed therein.Bunyan takes great care to steer clear of the idea that Christians are somehow intrinsically better than other people. He is careful to express that only God's grace working within them makes them capable of withstanding the trials of life. He demonstrates time and again that Christian suffers from the same weaknesses as normal people and is therefore prone to failure. It is only the love and assistance of God that allow Christian to reach his destination.God's grace and God's grace alone are sufficient to save Christian from the perils he encounters in his journey. Any time Christian attempts to do something of his own accord, his plans go horribly wrong and God must rescue him.The second part is about the travels and trials of Christian's wife: Christiana. It too is very instructive and entertaining.Pilgrim's Progress is insightful as an allegory. It is instructive and would be useful reading for anyone currently alive and making there way through our current sojourn or &quot;pilgrimage&quot; here on earth. Anyone going to the real Celestial City would profit from taking a glance at this book as they walk along the narrow path. I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress (Great Epics)","review":"The first time that I encountered Christian and his pilgrimage was as a preface and a family favorite in the book Little Women by Louisa May Alcott. Unfortunately, it was not until twenty-something years later that I actually got around to reading the book itself. If I were you, I would not wait that long.The first part of the current combined book appeared in 1678. Bunyan, a nonconformist Protestant minister who was imprisoned for preaching without a license, wrote at least the first part of the book in jail. The second part was first published in 1684. It is likely the most popular allegory ever written, and is still one of the best selling books of all time.What makes it so popular? The obvious key to its popularity is its simple, crisp style. Even accounting for the language changes between the seventeenth century and now, it is not a struggle to read Progress and it flows well for the modern reader. Although the book is allegory, the characters are full of little realistic details that make them feel quite human. Incidentally, I was reading this book as I was walking some of the old pilgrimage trails of Europe and it was interesting to me how vivid and applicable his version of the pilgrimage experience is. The Slow of Despair rang remarkably true, as did characters such as Talkative and Mr. Worldly Wisdom.The Oxford University Press edition is bound with a scholarly introduction which is, for a change, worth reading. It also came with explanatory notes and a glossary which were helpful for the modern reader who is not familiar with the everyday language of the period."},{"Title":"The Pilgrim's Progress (Great Epics)","review":"Pilgrim's Progress has been accepted by the world as a classic piece of literature. However, just as Handel's Messiah is recognised as a magnificent work without people really appreciating the message it brings so Pilgrim's Progress can suffer from its own fame. Here we have the stories of believers moving towards heaven. They have ups and downs. They suffer pain and experience pleasure. All the time the christian reader is being led forward into experimental practical christian avenues. Despair, doubt, backsliding, the temptations of the world, helps from above and support from others on the Way all make this work so vital and relevant. Both parts, Christian's journey and Christiana's are wonderful in their own ways. For the past four years I have preferred the second part. Read it every year at least once.

As much as I dislike some of what Roth has written, I can't deny that he's one of the greats in American literature. \\"Letting Go\\" reads as you might expect Roth's first novel to read--that is, it's ambitious, outrageous, and (most of the time) brutally honest. Themes that Roth would go on to expand upon later (Jewish identity, the problems of sex and love and marriage, the desire to find meaning in great works of literature) are evident here in spades. But it also reads like a *first* novel--meaning, Roth was still finding his footing and not without a few fumbles.The book is ambitious, no question--too ambitious, I think. It's as though Roth is trying to consolidate the entire human condition into one novel, which though admirable, is impossible to do. He's grappling with mature themes and questions, but the result is one of dilution. He paints his characters and issues in broad strokes; no particular theme or question gets its full due, despite the book's staggering length. Roth clearly learned his lesson with \\"Letting Go\\"--his subsequent novels were much more pointed and concise.Other drawbacks: the male characters, as is typical of most Roth novels, are drawn far more convincingly than the females, who are too often portrayed as screeching, manic-depressive nags; Roth wanders too often from his narrative course (which accounts for the 630 pages)--for example, the shocking event that transpires in Part 5 is a blatant plot device that screams of insecurity on Roth's part and does nothing to shed light on his characters; and the overall dreariness of the characters and their nihilistic views of life often inspires, not empathy, but eye-rolling.The strongest aspects of \\"Letting Go\\" are the strongest aspects of Roth as a writer: some of the sharpest dialogue out there; some beautifully rendered details and scenes; a genuine seriousness that pervades the work; and a fine portrayal of early-mid-life disenchantment. Most impressive is Roth's ability to show a 1950s America that is about to undergo a radical moral and social change. For a number of reasons, this book reminds me of \\"Rabbit, Run\\" by John Updike; but despite its flaws, I like \\"Letting Go\\" a lot more.This book should have been 200 pages shorter, but that's beside the point. What Roth has done for American literature in the 40 years since \\"Letting Go\\" was published more than makes up for his early fumbles and shortcomings--and, in fact, renders them rather fascinating."},{"Title":"Letting go","review":"Don't listen to the negative reviews. I read this book 3 times, the first at age 16. I am now 53. It is my favorite of Roth's work. The fact that he wrote it at age 29 makes it even more remarkable. Make up your own mind."},{"Title":"Letting go","review":"This vast novel of urban Jewish academic life in the mid-1950s (first published in 1961) is a dark, brooding meditation on birth, death, family, and the inescapable angst of life. Our \\"hero\\" Gabe Wallach and Paul and Libby Herz, the married couple his life is entwined with, are at first graduate students in literature in Iowa and then young faculty members at the University of Chicago. Gabe reluctantly and bafflingly becomes more and more involved in the depressing and difficult lives of Paul and Libby. In many ways this is an existentialist novel and reflects the basic ideas of existentialism, which was so popular in the 1950s. Gabe, and the others, are constantly faced with choices, some trivial seeming, others momentous, and must confront their freedom and their inability to ground their choices or even understand their choices.Among the momentous choices are Gabe's and Paul's rejection of traditional Jewish religion and life. This is a novel of secular Jewish life and its compromises and difficulties. Gabe's mother has just died, and he is drifting away from his New York dentist father. Paul is Jewish, from Brooklyn, but Libby is a Catholic who converts to Judaism. They met and loved as students at Cornell. Both Paul and Libby are shunned by their families, which leads to tragic consequences.Gabe and his friends are just beginning to explore the leading edges of the Sexual Revolution and are struggling with issues that today seem rather obsolete. Nevertheless these first glimmerings of women's liberation and sexual freedom caused all sorts of turmoil for those in the avant guard. Roth captures the angst, fear, depression, and exhilaration of those exploratory days. In line with the theme of sexual liberation and the existential angst this can cause, the novel is a sensitive examination of the emotional dangers of abortion.The plot of this novel is structured around the motivations and disastrous emotional effects of Paul and Libby's decision to abort Libby's unexpected pregnancy. Thus this novel can be considered to be a warning and alarm about having an abortion without fully realizing how wide and deep can be the consequences. In this way Letting Go is somewhat like John Barth's Sabbatical. Both of these novels, I think, could fairly be called \\"anti-abortion novels\\" but not overbearing, not political--they are sympathetically and complexly anti-abortion.Letting Go by Philip Roth is not for those who want a quick and easy, entertaining read. The book is long, slow and at times agonizing. There are seemingly endless pages of dialogue, dialogue that circles and circles and does not seem to get anywhere. It reminds me of those French art movies of the 1950s and early 60s where the characters just talk and talk and talk. But Roth is such a fine writer, has such a good ear for dialogue, and is able to marshal so many details that this novel, for me, was gripping, absorbing, and troubling. I grew up in the 1950s and 1960s (Jewish, urban, academic) and the reality of this novel is almost frightening, uncanny."},{"Title":"Letting go","review":"Your favorite book isn't necessarily the greatest book you've ever read: it's just the one that speaks most directly and resonately for you. This is my all-time favotite, and I've read all of Roth. I love the characters, the structure, even the typeface and lay-out design. I first read this book in its old orange mass-market paperback edition way back in the late 80s, in celebration of my leaving graduate school in order to go write my first novel--a novel, I'll go ahead and admit, influenced sharply by &quot;Goodbye, Columbus,&quot; which I had also recently read and adored--and for the next couple of years, as I toiled away at that novel, I kept picking up my beat-up copy of &quot;Letting Go&quot; and reading it at random, the way people used to read the Bible: I'd stroke the binding, smell the paper, re-read the notes I scribbled in the inside of the jacket. Later, when I was too poor to do so, I shelled out $65 for a mint-condition first edition of the Random House hardcover edition, complete with a flawless book jacket. After my kids and my wife, that's what I'm grabbing when my house catches on fire. I revere Roth as much as I want to argue with him--he's not the greatest confrontational writer of our time for nothing--and yet this one I remove from that great corpus and insert directly into the fabric of my own life."},{"Title":"Letting go","review":"I went back and read Goodbye Columbus, then Letting Go on purpose and just loved Letting Go even more the second time around. Roth was showing flashes of his magic with his short stories, but his first novel was masterful.

Although quite realistic in its complex approach to male-female relationships, this may account for why I did not quite like it. While I admire Roth's honest approach to inter-faith marriages (a novel set in the 1950s of a Jewish man marrying a Catholic woman), I found the work way too negative and depressing.It became readily apparent that the Paul and Libby Herz union was seemingly doomed to fail. Then again, at least today, about half of the marriages in this country fail, no matter what the religious backgrounds of the couples. Plus Paul, in the early part of his marriage to Libby, encourages her to abort their intended child. This, too, puts a strain on their relationship. Gabe Wallach a/k/a Wallace, a colleague and friend of Paul Herz, falls in love with a divorced woman, Martha Reganhart. She has her own issues related to her ex-spouse and their two children.A large part of the book concerns Paul and Libby's problems related to a possible adoption (much of the issues related to their mixed marriage) and a would be young, rather pathetic, surrogate mother, Theresa, and her money grubbing, thuggish husband, Harry. Gabe becomes deeply involved in paying Harry off to sign a legal admission of his being the father of the Theresa's new-born child. The results are rather funny and scarey at the same time.The author's own experiences with marriage probably account for much of the book's negativity. Plus the book seems to take forever to complete reading. One can tell that _Letting Go_ is Philip Roth's first novel. His later works are more concise and more to the point."},{"Title":"Letting go","review":"This is a great way to own Philip Roth's work. The print is good sized; the book quality is also good. I believe Roth is one of the best."},{"Title":"Letting go","review":"LETTING GO receives Luke Daniels' fine professional voice adds fire and life to this account, Roth's first full-length novel published just after Goodbye, Columbus when he was twenty-nine. It provides a story of mid-America's changing morals and tells of a newly discharged Korean War vet freed from duty and reeling from his mother's recent death. A fine classic for any audio lending library."},{"Title":"Letting go","review":"I've had the pleasure of reading ten of Roth's books, and plan to eventually read all of them, but I must admit to being quite disappointed with _Letting Go_, his first full-length novel._Letting Go_, unlike _Goodbye, Columbus_, and later novels, but like _When She Was Good_, is what can only be described as &quot;self-consciously literary.&quot; Roth downplays the talents he showed in his first book to create a sweeping (too sweeping), long (too long, at 600+ pages, as far as I know his longest book), Jamesian (too Jamesian) novel. Gabe Wallach is a veteran from the Korean War, if memory serves, who in this disjointed narrative undergoes and failes a series of trials of conscience as he tries to help people less fortunate than him. In the end of the book, Gabe finally &quot;goes the distance,&quot; with disastrous results, alienating all his friends... and for those who don't get the &quot;point&quot; of the novel, there's a letter from Gabe at the end which pretty much sums up the entire novel.There are only two interesting characters here: Gabe's father, who has basically a bit part, and Martha, Gabe's erstwhile lover, who is really the backbone of the story. Roth has admitted that his novels are not &quot;plot&quot; novels but &quot;character&quot; novels, and that he specializes in putting his characters in impossible situations. In many of his books, the result is brilliance, but in _Letting Go_ most of the characters are flat, even the central character, Gabe, so it's hard to sympathize with them.I'm led to believe that _Letting Go_ is supposed to be &quot;funny&quot; at points, presumably in the ridiculous climactic scene, but by that time the story had simply gotten on my nerves. The death of Martha's son, and the events leading up to and following it, are particularly bad.The narrative here is disjointed at times, as mentioned earlier. The purpose of switching from first to third person is lost on me, as is the fact that the seven parts of the book have little continuity. Such devices can work sometimes, but they don't in _Letting Go_.This novel isn't all bad. Yes, the characters are flat, but compared to many writers they're positively 3-D, and Roth had already showed an improvement in style compared to his first book. And I can't say I regret reading this book, even while I felt Roth was being &quot;self-consiously literary&quot; and not just doing his own thing, as he would start doing with _Portnoy's Complaint_. Overall, however, avoid this book unless you _must_ read everything Roth has written."},{"Title":"Letting go","review":"The previous review matches my own experience reading the book quite well. For someone who's read a lot of Roth, the book is interesting as a way of seeing him develop his themes - guilt, Jewish identity, etc. But the characters never quite become distinct enough (with the exception of the children and Gabe's father). Still, the book is continually moving in its depiction of the struggle of young adults coping in the mid-50s, trying so hard, it may seem to us now, to be 'adult.' Captures very well a feeling of hopelessness and a trapped quality to so many lives of quiet desperation. I didn't find anything particularly comic about the book, and felt in fact that the book strained for tragic dimensions at times. Maybe I didn't agree with that last review so much after all. I would hate to keep anyone from reading it -- but I wouldn't want to be responsible for sending someone out to buy it. (Given the themes of moral responsibility that the book grapples with, that seems an appropriate note on which to end.)"},{"Title":"Letting go","review":"I have read &quot;Letting Go&quot; after reading &quot;Goodbye, Columbus&quot; and &quot;Zuckerman Bound&quot; and I felt bitterly let down by this book.

It was everything but engaging. I believe Roth was &quot;trying&quot; something new here, a new literary approach, and it failed because it made him move away from his own fictive heart and soul-the deeply personal realm, the contradicting impulses in life, the soaring intelligence faced with the everyday compromises, the devastating sense of humour."},{"Title":"Jagdwaffe: Reich Defense 1 1943-1944 -Volume 5, Section 1 (Luftwaffe Colours) (Vol 5)","review":"This series of books is worth the money.

Clarke. Later, I saw references to him in Heinlein and Poul Anderson, and decided to see what it was all about. This book was worth reading. Toynbee's thesis is that all societies rise and fall through a process of &quot;challenge and response.&quot;As long as a society is growing, encountering new challenges, overcoming them, and moving on to other challenges, it is healthy. He also describes the &quot;dominant minority,&quot; &quot;external proletariat,&quot; and &quot;internal proletariat&quot; groups that make up societies. For instance, to take the example of Rome, the Romans themselves were the dominant minority, whose traditions sustained the Republic and then the Empire. The internal proletariat of Rome was the Christian religion, which came to inherit the prestige of the Romans. The external minorities were the Slavic and Germanic tribes on the northern borders, which were kept at bay until the dominant minority lost its will to expand.Toynbee does not see empires (such as the Roman Empire) or &quot;universal states&quot; as triumphs of a society's strength, but rather as a sign of weakness. A healthy society expands, develops creative arts, and encourages social mobility; an empire has rigid rules of conduct, laws, and social hierarchy. Toynbee's thesis is an excellent primer for understanding history, and can easily be applied to today's societies, including ours. He offers many different examples of growing, static, and declining societies, and shows an incredible mastery of his subject.Now the bad news: This is dry, tough reading. There are no maps, no visuals, and few &quot;helps&quot; for people unfamiliar with world history. Toynbee wrote for a scholarly audience, and assumed everyone reading would know what he was talking about. Toynbee also has a streak of racism that most clearly comes across in his discussion of Africa. He does not even deem African civilizations in his text, and decries the influence of &quot;African rhythms&quot; on Western culture (jazz, at the time of his writing). You've got to really like history to get into this stuff, but there are some profound things in Toynbee's work, which can make you look seriously at who we are, where we came from, and where we are going."},{"Title":"A Study of History, Vol. I-VI","review":"A Study of History is an excellent, lifetime study of how and why civilization progresses through time. Written in 1939, Toynbee predicts the rise of nationalism, the fall of the USSR, and victory of capitalism, and the enormous growth of Western culture. His central theme is simple yet true: civilizations advance by overcoming outside challenges and internal stagnation. Read this once per lifetime."},{"Title":"A Study of History, Vol. I-VI","review":"Toynbee's comparative analysis of the birth life and decline of civilizations is an enlightening masterwork. The corrolations we can draw from history and apply to our own individual development are mind-blowing. A must have in hardback for any library. Takes awhile to work through, but high value added from the experience."},{"Title":"A Study of History, Vol. I-VI","review":"I came to this book through a personal study of the secrets of human development. Singapore's miracle of development from 1970 on was the immediate precursor to discovering this work. The architect, Lee Kuan Yew, repeated read Toynbee's work through his career and used the challenge and response theory effectively to lift his country. Study of History is an enduring masterpiece. Clearly, it is more detailed and rich addressing western civilizations than eastern, but some of this imbalance might be due to the abridgement. I also find it interesting to contrast the book with Jared Diamond's \\"history as science\\" theory and would have loved to have seen Toynbee's consideration of Diamond's scholarship. Though Toynbee's emphasis is on the social, cultural and spiritual levels and boxes in geo physical factors in accord with the science of his era, I believe the two works complement each other in the end."},{"Title":"A Study of History, Vol. I-VI","review":"I don't normally go after other reviewers, but the dolts submitting their thoughts about this author are uninformed in the extreme. If ever there were a &quot;desert island&quot; author and a book that I would want to have with me on said island it is this one (though not the abridged version). Toynbee is a true polymath and one of the progenitors of Jacob Burckhardt, Daniel J. Boorstin, Jacques Barzun, et al. He delivers in concise, exquisitely rendered prose, an overview of western culture that has never been matched in terms of scope and economy - two terms that are not always congruous. For insights into the development of western civilization, its driving forces, main events, greatest influences, etc. , one need look no further than Toynbee. To compare it to Wells' work is to compare persimmons to oranges. One leaves a slightly bitter, puckery taste, the other slakes one's thirst."},{"Title":"A Study of History, Vol. I-VI","review":"Toynbee has three major theories of the rise and fall of civilizations.1. Challange and response. There must be a challange to the population in order for a civilization to rise. The challange must be just right. Too little and the civilization does not rise. Too great a challange and the civilization is destroyed before it gets a chance or rise or is destroyed soon thereafter.2. Withdrawl and change. An element of the civilization withdraws in some manner from the central civilization and undergoes some sort of creative transformation which it then introduces to the greater body of the civilization. This is a mechanism for maintaining the civilization.3. The Nemesis of Creativity: There is within a civilization a creative minority. If the creative minority lacks the opportunity to create, the civilization will die or stagnate. This can happen in two ways: The majority group, lacking the talent to create, gains enough power to create, but the creativity is second rate and the civilization dies or stagnates. On the other hand, an exogenous group may gain power over the avenues of creativity and the creativity produced is destructive to the civiliation.Of the three basic ideas the Nemesis of Creativity notion seems the most insightful. The challange and response seems little more than the golden mean. Withdrawl and change seems more relevant. As far as the Nemesis of creativity is concerned, this can be visualized in a simple microcosm. Suppose, for example, government action were taken which prevented the highly talented minority from obtaining either an education or given a good education, this minority were prevented from getting prime jobs. If, say, the space program were afflicted with this sort of thing, second-rate engineers, managers, scientists and such would be in positions of responsibility. Their positions would promote failure. It would be better to give these people jobs with good pay and no decision-making powers."},{"Title":"A Study of History, Vol. I-VI","review":"The reason why I am giving it five stars is that I cant give it 10!

It would take too long. If you have an intellectual bent, if you are interested in history, this work is a treasure trove.I particular admire that the author, unlike Spengler, found a space for God at the head of all that he documents; the author was not swayed by the simplistic atheistic zeitgeist of our age."},{"Title":"A Study of History, Vol. I-VI","review":"A study of history had been on my reading list for a while, I initially thought I'd go for the entire series but ended up reading this abridgement instead. I'm glad I chose the abridgement because reading the original would have been an even bigger waste of time.This book supposedly covers all civilizations, but this is really true only insofar as all of them are MENTIONED at some point. The great majority of material is taken from western history, particularly from the classic Athens-Rome-Europe axis, with Christendom as the example of a \\"universal religion\\". The existing literature on non-European history was of course much more limited when this work was written than it is today, and undoubtedly mr Toynbee was very well acquainted with all the material available to him, but why should you as a reader of history today be limited by what was there in the 1940s?The second problem with this work is its philosophy. Toynbee searches for genesis, growth, breakdown and disintegration patterns in the \\"life-cycle\\" of civilizations. This looks extremely interesting when you browse the table of contents, but the actual work is quite disappointing. Basically a model which applies reasonably well to western European history (Athens-Rome-Europe, again) is forced on all other civilizations, and the results are not pretty. A couple of suitably interpreted cases from a couple of civilizations are enough to \\"prove\\" any given proposition. Possible objections are not discussed at all even though anyone with a good knowledge of world history will see that the argumentation is often ridiculously weak.Finally, I should mention that I think volumes VII-X provide more interesting reading because they do not drag the dead weight of the Argument with them. But on the other hand these latter volumes are burdened by the author's religious convictions which make some texts resemble sermons more than historical writing."},{"Title":"A Study of History, Vol. I-VI","review":"A key to Toynbee, fascinating in itself.

C. Somervell of Arnold Toynbee's multi-volume set into two small volumes is too selective to encompass the whole picture. People with strong political opinions might even agree with Walter Kaufmann, at the end of his book, FROM SHAKESPEARE TO EXISTENTIALISM, that Arnold J. Toynbee's attempt to write A STUDY OF HISTORY in ten volumes, which provides abundant lessons which leaders of today ought to heed to avoid the ignominious fate of numerous nations, peoples, and civilizations who are far less prosperous than Americans today, if certain outstanding obligations are not considered and everything which must be reported as income for tax purposes is assumed to benefit someone, actually amounts to a form of argument in which, \\"His method is what Stephen Potter calls \`one-upmanship.' Where a red herring might be recognized and challenged, the queer fish that Toynbee introduces with an air of mildly bored authority silence all opposition--unless you either happen to know about them or have the patience to find out.\\" (Kaufmann, FSTE, Chapter 20, \`Toynbee and Religion,' p. 413).The Table of Contents has parts and chapters both consecutively numbered with Roman Numerals, so Part V. The Disintegration of Civilizations, includes Chapter XIX. Schism in the Soul. Subdivisions such as (3) Truancy and Martyrdom show such mixtures of cowardice and courage that even Toynbee gets caught considering subjective natures in the worst possible light:\`~\`The truant soul of which we are in search is a soul whose truancy is inspired by a genuine feeling that the cause which it serves is not really worth the service that this cause demands of it. Similarly the martyr soul of which we are in search is the soul which goes to martyrdom not merely or mainly to render practical service to the furtherance of that cause but rather to satisfy a craving of the soul itself for deliverance fromthe heavy and the weary weightOf all this unintelligible world. [W. Wordsworth, \`Tintern Abbey]Such a martyr, noble as he may be, is psychologically more than half a suicide. He is, in modern jargon, an escapist, as is also of course our truant an escapist of a more ignoble variety.'~' (Toynbee, A STUDY OF HISTORY Abr. Vol. I, p. 442).Continuing on the same page, the disintegration of civilizations was not a pretty picture, even in ancient times:\`~\`The Christian Church was the principal target for the parting strokes of a Hellenic dominant minority which turned savage in its death-agony; for this dying pagan ruling class refused to face the heart-rending truth that it was itself the author of its own downfall and destruction. Even in articulo mortis it tried to salvage a last shred of self-respect by persuading itself that it was perishing as the victim of a dastardly assault on the part of the proletariat; and, since the external proletariat was now marshalled in formidable war-bands which were able to defy or elude the Imperial Government's attempts at retaliation for their galling raids, the brunt fell upon the Christian Church, which was the master institution of the internal proletariat.'~'Toynbee is able to appreciate the martyrs of the early Christian Church. \\"Ignatius of Antioch, one of the notable Christian martyrs of the second century, speaks of himself as \`the wheat of God' and longs for the day when he shall be \`ground by the teeth of wild beasts into the pure bread of Christ'.\\" (Vol. I, p. 443).There is much more to Toynbee than theology, but it was a very religious time when Volume I of the Abridged A STUDY OF HISTORY was published in 1947 and became an international best-seller. The second abridged volume appeared much later."},{"Title":"A Study of History, Vol. I-VI","review":"This is one those books like Well's Outline of History that seem to reach beyond the grasp of any discipline.

It talks about anatomy and physiology of the heart, info on various heart conditions, cardiac medications, cardiac tests and medical procedures, cardiac rehabilitation, and finally how to keep your heart healthy: through exercise, nutritious diet, stratagies for de-stressing, and quitting smoking.

Two days later he emailed me and I got back in comunication with him and as a result of reconnecting with him created a nice insurance sale that solved his problem and created a $3,500 commission because I addressed the source of his frustration with the quote from the book.

It's GREAT! Sometimes I work with another practirioner so we can combine talens in working with clients who want to walk through doors. We use visualization,listening to Spirit,listening to the Client, and listening to our hands. We combine Reiki with another energy healing technique to facilitate easy, safe,and gentle breakthroughs. We hold the field for the client so they aren't left in limbo. (Joe does this for us in his book)I have done a lot of work on myself through the years and now with these tools, the help of others I have accomplished massive amounts of clearing. It is not possible to go through these doors without help to guide us in the correct direction, and to bring us through all the necessary levels to heal safely,gently,and easily.I love your book &quot;Spiritual Marketing&quot;. I have known most of what you wrote for years. Why did it suddenly make more sense??? Timing! Yes, Timing! I have done the exercises and am now looking forward to the Universe delivering. The timing must be right or it will not happen. However, I have made my desires known...and I will look for the doors to open and I will walk through. I love it.Your book is easy to read with all the necessary information plainly illustrated and confirmed. A change of attitude is a marvelous tool. I teach this principle in one of the workshops I am a team facilitator for. We do not always see this the first time (our need to change our outlook).

As a 25 year old entrepreneur, I'm always looking for ways to increase my profits and enjoyment from my businesses. For me, marketing is where the real profit is (assuming you have a good product or service!). I highly recommend this book for people who have open minds and want to increase the success of their marketing. The book is about a mind-set, about your beliefs, rather than specific how-tos about marketing strategy. To be blunt, I don't think this book will help people who arn't open minded - it's very different from other marketing books and you'll probably learn things that very few marketing 'experts' will ever tell you. And after reading this boook, I now have a more holistic view of how to use all the skills I've gained from all the other wonderful marketing experts I've studied. I must let you know that this book is very short. At first I felt a bit jipped, but after I got such a PRACTICAL shift in my mind set, I realised that it's not the length of a book like this that counts but instead it's the quality and quantity of the results you get. I can see how a book like this could get a few bad reviews - afterall it is VERY different and I know that if I had read a book like this a few years ago I wouldn't have had an open enough mind to experience the benfits (and there are a lot of benefits!). Thankfully there are people, like the author, who think differently from the mainstream. I hope the author continues to write books like this.

I believe who buys this kind of book is people who is not reading about this argument for the first time; and what happens often is that we have the sensation of reading 'already known' things, and so we finish one book and begin another...just to have the same sensation! Joe's book, for me, had the power of 'making me act' finally, instead of only read and read! It's pretty simple, and he really makes us understand how to make our desires happen. Without being too long, he touches the main points and explain what is necessary to understand to get what we want. At the end, we do not need to know how a fax machine works to send a fax, do we?

This book is not really about &quot;marketing&quot; per se but more about using spiritual techniques for tapping into the wealth available to all of us all. Joe uses personal stories to illustrate how emotional blocks may be stopping us from creating the life we deserve and gives us the five steps to overcome those blocks to get focused on what you really want from life. I read this book through quickly once and now I'm reading it again more slowly with a yellow highlighter. During my first reading of the book I focused on my desire to add a certain type of new client to my practice and within a week that very type of client materialized and signed a long-term contract within days.

I didn't know what to expect going into it. And I can honestly say it just blew me away. Mr. Vitale's writing style is smooth, funny, and vibrant.

If you truly have difficulty grasping the concept in PotSM then don't despair just yet. You're supposed to read it at least twice in a row. And again, yet again...still again....I do appreciate this author's attempt at friendly. And that he does at least MENTION PotSM. However the attempt resulted in weakening the message. Giving him the benefit of the doubt, I'd say that perhaps this is an attempt at targeting freshman students of the mind, that results in success in writing something for a junior student at english.I gave it two stars just b/c the concept is UNDERrated.There is no comparison between this and PoySM - and I was really reeeeally tempted to give this a &quot;0&quot; zero. A half hearted condescending (how many times have I used that word...take notice!) attempt (also that word) to profit off a TREASURE-OF-A-BOOK lacking a copyright. Also helps to spiff up the title using the buzzword &quot;HOW&quot;. As other readers have said, the title is kinda misleading. It's more of a feel good book for dummies.

But don't just put it on the shelf after you've read it. Read it again, and again. And then, select passages at random to read, over and over. The simplicity of it is very deceptive.

While I didn't write my new book, \\"Spiritual Marketing,\\" with an eye to infusing it with some sort of magic spell, it somehow in fact may contain one. One person read it and said a skin condition they had cleared up the next day. Another person read it and healed their cat of a long-term food allergy. My sister read it and went out and bought a new car. My brother read it and went out and bought a new truck.

It was more like the book found me.Searching for a book on marketing, Joe Vitale's book appeared on my search list. In retrospect it was serendipity. I read page after page of glowing reviews and decided that there must be a reason all these people are taking the time to say such great things about the book; it was either that or Joe sure had a lot of friends.As mentioned in one review it is a very short read. It isn't the number of words that matters as how much impact those words can have on your life. To risk being redundant to previous reviews the results are profound.After reading the book, I told a friend about it and suggested he read it. At first he wasn't interested because it challenged a couple of strong beliefs that he had about himself and others. Maybe it was my enthusiasm that caused him to agree to read the book.A few days later my phone rang. It was my reluctant friend who said, \\"hello,\\" then paused before speaking in a slow, quiet voice, \\"I think that book got me a job.\\" If you've read the book you'll recognize the irony and if you haven't read the book you should."},{"Title":"Spiritual Marketing: A Proven 5-Step Formula for Easily Creating Wealth from the Inside Out","review":"Each book I read, or each audio I listen to of Joe Vitale's, I am hypnotized. I just read &quot;Spiritual Marketing&quot; and I am blown away. It had very simple, but awakening truths that gave light to my otherwise negative experiences in business and in life. My own limiting beliefs have kept me from major successes in my life. Specifically, I've had very successful entrepreneurial projects going... one's that received accolades from clients and experts alike... and I sabotaged them, thinking I was not worthy of them. Joe's book speaks to people like you and me who know we're capable of so much in our life, but our limiting beliefs and negative energies keep us from moving forward. In this book are 5 simple steps to help you get anything you want in life... from the inside out. &quot;Thank you, Joe, for your inspriration, your experience, and most of all, your simple and effective way of communicating all of it.&quot; I have read many books, and I must say, &quot;I am a changed man because of this simple book.&quot; - CV"},{"Title":"Spiritual Marketing: A Proven 5-Step Formula for Easily Creating Wealth from the Inside Out","review":"Thanks Joe Vitale!This book has re-opened my eyes, and I am no dewey eyed innocent on the threshold of maturity, but a mature sixty with forty years of commercial and IT experience, most of it at an executive level. I have read many motivational books and found most of them interesting, but none have gripped me so strongly that I read it from first word to last without a break. Joe's book takes you back to your beginnings when the world was your oyster and shows you that it still is. Even more, he reminds you of the truth of your early feelings and attitudes which have been beaten out of you over the years, and restores the confidence you once felt. I recommend this book to anyone who has reached the stage that I had, knowing that I was swimming across the current of life or even against it, not knowing how to change direction and go with the flow again. This book is inspirational. So stop chasing your tail and read it. You will never regret it. Thanks again Joe."},{"Title":"Spiritual Marketing: A Proven 5-Step Formula for Easily Creating Wealth from the Inside Out","review":"I had read two previous books by Joe Vitale (&quot;The Seven Lost Secrets of Success&quot; and &quot;There's a Customer Born Every Minute&quot;) and thoroughly enjoyed them. Consequently, I ordered this book as soon as I heard about it. &quot;Spiritual Marketing&quot; more than lives up to the high standards that Mr Vitale set with his earlier books.This book explains five simple steps to leading the life of your dreams. He calls these steps &quot;The Million Dollar Formula&quot;. By following these steps you can achieve anything you set your mind on. I know, from my own experience, that this formula works, but I have never seen it spelled out in such a simple and effective way.I was impressed at the way in which Mr Vitale explained different points using his own life story. He held nothing back, and comes across as an exceptionally honest, open and spiritually evolved person. It must have taken a great deal of courage to write so openly about some of the difficult times he experienced, and his feelings about them.Mr Vitale writes well and gets his message across clearly and effectively.I recommend this book unreservedly."},{"Title":"Spiritual Marketing: A Proven 5-Step Formula for Easily Creating Wealth from the Inside Out","review":"While reading this book, I had an absolute break-through. For the first time in my life I gave myself permission to earn money! You know how we have those issues that hold us back until somehow we find the way to get them up? Even after all the affirmations I've done over the years for financial freedom, I didn't realize how much I was holding myself back with all kinds of money &quot;issues&quot;. This book SET ME FREE! and ignited in me a passion for life that I haven't had in years!Everything in this book I'd read before somewhere, but Joe Vitale's writing style seems to carry an energetic impact. It was as if a healing energy came through the pages, an energy that can help heal people of their financial misbeliefs. At least it did mine!

And if your $12.41 opens up your ability to expand yourself and your business to serve others and to make thousands of dollars more than you are now, you will have benefited even more.

But it wasn't until reading &quot;Spiritual Marketing,&quot; that I realized what was holding me back from living the life of my dreams.That missing key was in the chapter, &quot;Get Clear.&quot; I realized that my subconscious beliefs were holding me back. That I could not proceed with my visualizations until all of me was in agreement on going after my goal.Shortly after reading the book I created a new website Imagination Science. The sight is brand new and already it is helping people achieve their goals. I've been wanting to teach about the imagination for 15 years. So this is the first major thing that &quot;Spiritual Marketing,&quot; has helped me to manifest.The techniques on Inner Marketing are fantastic. I think it explains the quick growth of my site. This technique shows you how to put a Spiritual Charge into your advertising materials to magnetically attract more business.Overall the book is filled with valuable information and is very easy and enjoyable to read. The average reader could read it in 2 or 3 hours. But it is packed with information to help you achieve your goals via his 5 step process. There are also lots of resources and people you can contact to further help you in achieving your goals at the back of the book. I've already ordered some of those books and contacted some of the healers and coaches mentioned there.I also love Joe's books, &quot;There's a Customer Born Every Minute.&quot; and &quot;Turbocharge your Writing.&quot; Another author I recommend that is really great on this Inner Manifestation topic is Neville Goddard.

Sounds like Joe ran out of copywriting material, that is, until i read the book. When I read how miracles happened time after time to him and how he went from rags to riches,from shop lifting for survival to living in a dream home, something in me snapped. I guess, it was my ego,and my pride that was broken. If a great copywriter acknowledges that his success is not accomplished through mere human effort, but by HE who watches over him, who am i to even have an ego? Many times, we humans want to do it ALL by ourselves,but how do we know how much more can be done in accordance to HIS perfect will? This is not evangelistic dogma. It's the GREATEST SECRET TO SUCCESS! Joe reavals in his book, that trying to solve our problems by ourselves is really the WORST thing that we can ever do for ourselves. The solution? Just let go. The skeptic in you will be hollering in protest now. You don't have to listen to me. I'm nobody. But, you need to listen to what Joe says. It'll change your life. I'll swallow a grasshopper if it doesn't. Bottomline: This books reveals how to succeed at marketing, without marketing. Paradoxical? Get this, when i applied Joe's affirmation as revealed in the book, i suddenly had so many new marketing ideas that surged right through my head. Never before have i been in such a resourceful state and accomplished so much. Suddenly,it struck me that THIS IS THE WAY TO SUCCESS.

Have faith, my friend, there's light at the end of the tunnel.I was working on a book project and wondering why I wasn't having the success I expected. Something just didn't feel right and I was hard pressed to find a cure. Joe's book, Spiritual Marketing, helped me immediately identify the problem and take steps to fix it. But that was just the beginning of the benefits I gained.I've been a follower of Joe Vitale's marketing books and tapes for quite a while now and was very intrigued when I read about it on Joe's MrFire.com website. I had not realized that Joe was also a very experienced journalist in the new age/spritual area. Joe presents concepts that were not new to me but he did so in a way that got me to take action. The book is a quick read and all the better for it. The quicker you finish it, the quicker you can get started with creating the life you truly want and eliminate the sometimes hidden roadblocks along the way.I don't know how many times I've read self-help books only to get caught up in endless exercises and complicated theories and end up never moving past the first few chapters. Joe's book gets you involved pretty quickly by sharing his own personal experiences and inspires you to do further work either on your own or will the help of other specialists.Joe presents this information in the same way a friend might share his or her experiences rather than sounding like he's giving a lecture.

Everything said in this book is very practical, many successful people use the techniques consciously, but like most of us we do it unconsciously therefore we rarely have success and joy in our life, and when we do experience good in our lives we think it came from some place outside of you ( beyond ya control ). With this book, he shows us that we can choose what we already have ( in our minds/Soul/subconscious, heart) and experience them in real life,consciously. I do not think it is nessarily to believe in anything he says, just re-read it until you grasp the main ideas and apply them, and you will know that you are the cause of every experiences in your life, as soon as you realize this, you won't believe a single thing he says, you will know it's truth and gain many more insights..

I have to admit that I am a prosperity book and tape junkie. After 15 years of reading and taking classes and listening to tapes, it's clear that the true path to prosperity must be spiritually based. Joe distills the spiritual wisdom of many masters for achieving one's dreams and brings it to life lucidly, powerfully. By sharing some of the skeletons in his closet (like shoplifting to be able to eat) and showing us how he was ultimately able to create what he wanted by using a simple, straightforward, 5-step program, he makes our own dreams seem much more accessible and possible! He speaks as a regular guy (rather than say, for example, as some superduper -seemingly successful- motivational guru who achieved meteoric success in a way that most of us just know we couldn't possibly replicate)who shares miracles achieved by himself and other ordinary people using a simple, but life-changing plan.

As a businessman, I believe that we have leaned way too much toward the head, and should be considering the heart as we balance our business affairs and decisions. My favorite in Spriritual Marketing is Step 5, &quot;Let Go&quot;. This is very POWERFUL stuff whose time has come. Thank you, Joe, for writing Spiritual Marketing. Moreover, thank you for having the courage to be among the leaders who are showing the rest of us that there is a different way, a better way."},{"Title":"Spiritual Marketing: A Proven 5-Step Formula for Easily Creating Wealth from the Inside Out","review":"Filled with time honored wisdom for creating a full rich experience of life, this little book is written with such fresh enthusiasm you'll feel as if you have your own cheer leader and personal spiritual advisor rolled into one.I gave it 5 stars because I think anyone would get 5 stars of values added to his life from reading it."},{"Title":"Spiritual Marketing: A Proven 5-Step Formula for Easily Creating Wealth from the Inside Out","review":"Spiritual Marketing is one of the best books I have ever read.

Even if you have heard this information before, this time it makes sense. Joe Vitale has provided us with a unique and simple method to understand that our attitude toward the universe has a direct bearing on how successful we are. This is a hard concept to understand, however, it is true and it works when the freedom is realized. I have begun to realize my ability was always there and I had a lot of the correct answers for success......however it is necessary for me to believe in me and my product.

Yesterday, I picked up two very lucrative new projects that came out of nowhere from two new clients. These projects have literally buried me in work and are going to help me grow my marketing and promotions business to the next level.

Trust Joe Vitale to do just that. This fast paced book by the master marketer kept me on the edge of my seat. And I didn't put it down until I was finished. I beleive Joe's success is a good barometer of how &quot;right on&quot; his phiolosphy is about Spiritual Marketing. Plus not only did Joe give his all in explaining his concepts about marketing using your spiritual side, he also gives you a wealth of information on where to go next. Believe me, after reading Joe's book on Spiritual Marketing I'm hooked on his work."},{"Title":"Spiritual Marketing: A Proven 5-Step Formula for Easily Creating Wealth from the Inside Out","review":"Yes, the title is a &quot;grabber&quot; (one of the reasons why the author has become one of the best-known and most sought-after marketers/copyrighters today). The message is outstanding. Vitale outlines five spiritual principles that have helped him, as well as many others, attain success beyond what at one time may have been their wildest dreams.I found myself highlighting and putting &quot;sticky notes&quot; on pages throughout the book.This book is brief; one that can be read very easily and comfortably. It's a book I believe everyone deserves to own. I'd also recommend buying this book as a gift for those in your life you feel may need a boost. Perhaps they are people who are on the right track and just need a boost to help propel them. Or, maybe they are very hard, dilligent workers who are not achieving the success they desire . . . because they need help in getting on the right track in the first place.This book is a gem.

That is what comes to mind when I think of Joe Vitale's book, Spiritual Marketing. It is a surprisingly rare and powerful tool for achieving your goals in business, relationships, marketing, writing, art, or... whatever!Joe Vitale is a true guru, from both a marketing and spiritual standpoint. He's a good example, as seen in his work, of what a guru should be. I tell people they would be hard-pressed to find a marketing expert who is more honest, knowledgeable and inspiring than Joe.In this book, which reads like a good memoir, he opens his heart, taking risks to talk about something that is dear and personal: His spirituality. He reveals his trials and hardtimes. His pain and disappointments. But he doesn't leave you there. In the friendly, personable style for which he is known, he shows how he obtained success by spiritual means.Unlike any author I've ever read (and I've read many), Joe successfully weaves marketing techniques and spirituality into a compelling package that leaves you breathless. He pulls you into his world with his colorful writing and infuses you with motivation to make your dreams come true. While revealing he is human, despite his high level of success, he challenges and encourages you to immulate his success by taking the spiritual road. Unfortunately, for many, it's the road less traveled.In a way, Joe's effort reminds me of the steps taken by the late great Bruce Barton. He was an incredibly successful adman who dared to write about Jesus in &quot;The Man Nobody Knows.&quot;In Spiritual Marketing, Joe has created something that will not only benefit people from all walks of life -- and businesses, he's done something that would make Bruce Barton proud!Congratulations, Joe!"},{"Title":"Spiritual Marketing: A Proven 5-Step Formula for Easily Creating Wealth from the Inside Out","review":"I'd like to say thanks to Mr. Vitale for saving my marriage.

I have been struggling with a belief in how tired and lazy I have been feeling lately for some reason. And I realized yesterday that I would awake in the morning and literally &quot;think&quot; to myself how tired and lazy I am and resultantly lay down and be just that. So I decided to change that last night get up and change my routine. I jump on my TGN site and started reading &quot;Spiritual Marketing&quot;. And I will tell you what, I was just amazed how we all live those beliefs unknownly and how damaging they can be. And how by realizing negative beliefs that good things come your way. And there it was, &quot;Spiritual Marketing&quot;.Your book had me thinking and looking at myself inside and I found beliefs that I didn't really know were there. I found myself uncomfortable with that yet on the other had I was overjoyed in knowing they were there, and ways now to overcome those negative beliefs.Thank you very much for you bookI will pass it on to everyone I know.

During 2002, I launched two products that were a total flop. Seriously though, I thought they were a great idea at the time. I needed to examine why these flopped and what I was doing to prevent myself from getting what I wanted. I later learned from a gentle nudge about Joe's book. For two days straight I read and read. I was so excited about what I was learning. I began to realize that my husband and I had been under a borage of negative energy. So on Thanksgiving Day we began the \\"purge\\" as I call it. Since then I have soaked up every free thing Joe has on his site together with the wonderful newsletters I signed up for. I am now reading The The Proof (Hypnotic Marketer) and already see that I want to make some major changes to my website as well as my direct marketing material. We are now launching our third product. The power of positive energy generated 5 pre-orders of this product within two days. Would I like more? Of course!!

He has taken &amp; synthensized the timeless principles of manifesting into an easily understood format accessible to anyone. It is obvious from the references to many other exponents of these timeless principles in the book that he speaks from both study &amp; experience &amp; I highly recommend his book. I'd also suggest you take a look at his list of recommended reading too: it has some of the pithiest summations I've ever had the pleasure to read!"},{"Title":"Spiritual Marketing: A Proven 5-Step Formula for Easily Creating Wealth from the Inside Out","review":"I owe Joe Vitale a debt of gratitude. I had read about intention statements before I read this book, but reading Spiritual Marketing is what finally propelled me to actually write one. I did this on August 16, 2001 and it is amazing the way my life is becoming aligned with my intentions.My business has grown from $6,000 - $8,000 per month earlier this year to now $75,000 per month in September and October. Most of that growth is due to people I did not know contacting me out of nowhere with fantastic opportunites to promote my business.I have also discovered numerous things that are helping me tremendously with some health problems that have plagued me for years. These discoveries were also through phone calls from people I did not know or from people who were not even interested in natural health! (This has also been a key to the growth of my business. :-)I have had doors opening all over the place in my life since I wrote this intention statement.Below is my intention statement. I am sharing it in hopes that it may be of benefit to others.________________________________I now live a balanced life, full of love, abundance, and miracles, that is flowing and smooth.I am centered and full of energy and love.I radiate pure love to everyone around me and it is contagious.My presence on this planet will positively impact the lives of billions of people.I now have positive loving relationships with everyone I see and meet.My very presence shifts people's energy into a positive state.I attract people into my life that can help me achieve more love, peace, and abundance and for whom I can reciprocate the same.I am healthy, in great physical shape, and beautiful inside and out.I am in constant connection with God and I experience almost constant cosmic inner giggles at all the amazing miracles I am experiencing everyday.I am filled with overflowing gratitude for all the abundance and miracles in my life.Everything I need comes into my life automatically, without effort."},{"Title":"Spiritual Marketing: A Proven 5-Step Formula for Easily Creating Wealth from the Inside Out","review":"The only reason I give this book one star is because everything in it is also in Vitale's other book The Attractor Factor. Attractor is an expanded and much better version that I rated 5 stars and which I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Spiritual Marketing: A Proven 5-Step Formula for Easily Creating Wealth from the Inside Out","review":"I felt misled by the title when I bought this book. I expected it to be about marketing in the traditional sense, perhaps with a different twist but basically about marketing. Instead I found that the word is used in its widest possible sense that we all \`market' ourselves all the time by the vibration we are giving out to the world. The book is nothing to do with traditional marketing techniques and everything to do with clarifying our personal vibration to attract the things we want into our lives.So I felt disappointed because I have already read a number of good books along these lines. What does Joe Vitale's book add? Well, he has some personal success stories to tell, which are always interesting. Of his 5-step formula, 4 of them were not new to me, but may be new to others. However, the one step he gives most attention to, happily, was the one that was most useful to me: getting clear, in the sense of emotional clearing, identifying those limiting beliefs and emotions that might be sabotaging your best intentions. I tried one of the methods suggested in this chapter and it was a very illuminating process for me. I am also taking steps to get someone who can help further as Joe suggests.So finally I was glad I had bought this book. It is a quick and easy read, but be aware that if you have read this kind of book before, you may not encounter much that is new to you here."},{"Title":"Spiritual Marketing: A Proven 5-Step Formula for Easily Creating Wealth from the Inside Out","review":"Once you've read any of Joe Vitale's marketing books, you are hooked - AND - they are all worth it. I started out as an engineer, so marketing doesn't come easy. But Joe &quot;Mr. Fire&quot; Vitale is helping me to think like a marketer. His proactive style really mixes well with mine; I think he has a knack for writer to each person as if you happen to be the one he intended the book for. Joe has written the perfect book for those of us who want our major purpose in life to be in harmony with God's plans!Needless to say Spiritual Marketing is already playing a huge role in helping me to be a successful writer. Ever since reading the first book of Joe's, I have considered him to be a success mentor. His wisdom is easy to follow - but more than that, it is right on! I guarantee that if you read Spiritual Marketing you will have tons of marketing ideas for marketing your business and yourself so that you feel congruent with life - it's that incredible.In his books and tapes, Joe always covers all of the proactive bases: smart thinking, system thinking, futuristic thinking, and positive thinking. If you are truly seeking the kind of success and abundance that makes your life 100% livable - you must read this book. Some of the ideas Joe promotes are found in SUCCESS BOUND, another book built on learning how to live a proactive life that is God centered and fulfilling.My recommendation to you is, take a few minutes each day and ponder the wisdom and truths of this book and let them seep deep into your subconscious mind. Then, move out confidently towards fulfilling your dreams and goals, knowing you are one with the Creator and are truly success bound."},{"Title":"Spiritual Marketing: A Proven 5-Step Formula for Easily Creating Wealth from the Inside Out","review":"I have spent the day reading Spiritual Marketing by Joe Vitale.Have you ever been frantically searching for your favorite pen or glasses and you're tearing your house apart searching and swearing and the harder you look, the more frustrated you get? The more you do the less ground you cover? Then you look in the mirror and your glasses have been on your face all along or your pen is in the other hand as you've been lifting things? LOL (yes, I've done that)Well that's the experience I had with this book.I have read other personal development books, money books you name it, I've probably read it...but suddenly, after searching for the answer to what exactly was blocking me.Why would I come so close and stop myself whenever I had a goal, especially money-goals?Then a light went on in my head! I felt a physical shift inside of me while reading and doing the simple exercises that Joe describes in his book.I started writing about my present negative condition that I was having with money and all of a sudden, it was as if I was in a tunnel and my hand and mind were just on their own. Honestly, I didn't even see the paper I was writing on.Like an onion, layer after layer my negative feelings came out and I realized that I knew EXACTLY what was blocking me from getting to the next level in money matters and in life. With each feeling that I wrote about another deeper layer was uncovered until something in my mind and body said &quot;Eureka&quot; that's it! All of a sudden the &quot;lights&quot; came back on and I felt 1,000 pounds lighter. I felt the feelings I've been trying not to remember and was able to release them. I felt all the pain and anger go right out of me - for real. I truly thought I had done that, but had &quot;forgotten&quot; about the real anger and fear that I was carrying that was buried deeply inside of my heart and mind, stopping me from moving forward.I was shaking and light and greatful and at the same time felt so receptive to everything good that the universe has been waiting to give me that I've been stopping. I don't know how to explain it. It's like I've been walking around in the dark for years without realizing it. I felt as if I was looking at my living room for the first time ever. I felt the goodness of the universe just surround me and realized that I was the one blocking it from surrounding me in the first place.But that's not it. I went back to my office checked my e-mail and I had two people join my team. One that I've never met and the other that I spoke to briefly and set up an appt w/ for today, but she e-mailed me and said that she just felt compelled to join right away. Then my phone rang and it was my sponsor who felt compelled to place someone under me. He said he was talking to a woman and as he was getting ready to sign her up, he thought of me and gave her my referral number instead of his. Then I got a call from someone that I spoke to about 2 months ago and he told me that he would be signing up today. My phone did not stop ringing until about 9pm last night. No one was pukey. The goal I had set up for myself a few weeks ago was reached without my struggling. Wow! Thank you, Universe!I have always believed in miracles, after all, my daughter is a miracle, but when I prayed for her to live, I also promised that I would never ask for anything else. I would gladly give up ever wanting anything else. I blocked myself from recieving. I now realize that the universe doesn't keep a tab. It will keep giving as long as I allow it to.I feel as if my life will never be the same again. If you haven't read this book, please do so right away.IreneThere are no coincidences :-)"},{"Title":"Spiritual Marketing: A Proven 5-Step Formula for Easily Creating Wealth from the Inside Out","review":"Vitale is a guru in his field, perhaps self-appointed, but a guru just the same. His steps are consise and powerful. Your life will change if you follow them. I bought \\"Outrageous Marketing\\", also by Joe. It is fantastic as well. The main idea he promotes is that you can do whatever you want, have what you want, and be who you want to be if you are willing to take certain 'spiritual steps'. These steps are nothing but absolute laws of nature that must be observed by everything on the face of the earth. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Spiritual Marketing: A Proven 5-Step Formula for Easily Creating Wealth from the Inside Out","review":"&gt;&gt;&gt;Sometimes it's not what is said, but who says it and how.Joe Vitale is a modern day magician. He can raise the dead back to life. Dead businesses, dead marketing, and now... dead dreams.It used to be that we looked to poets for the words that move us. But today, who knows how to trigger our emotional buttons more expertly than the geniuses of marketing and copywriting?Like many people, I learnt about Joe Vitale through his marketing and copywriting products at his mrfire.com website.So I was intrigued to learn about this new SPIRITUAL MARKETING book. I read it in one sitting. Then got my wife to read it. Then emailed some people to go check it out. I loved it! So did they!Marketing is a reality-based profession. It's grounded in the here and now. Spirituality, on the other hand, can produce some real &quot;flakes&quot;. Nice people with big ideals who haven't a clue when it comes to surviving and thriving in the real world.Joe Vitale is a man grounded in the science of getting the results you want in the fastest, most efficient way possible.Marketeers are explorers. Constantly looking for ways to improve what they do and who they are. Joe's search led him to some extraordinarily insightful people. With a marketeers eye, he has plundered the treasure chest of wisdom for the true gems and honed them into a system that can produce results.I've certainly read a lot of info like this. But I respect this author and therefore listened a lot closer to what he had to say.Joe Vitale walks his talk. And I found this book very effective, insightful and timely. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Spiritual Marketing: A Proven 5-Step Formula for Easily Creating Wealth from the Inside Out","review":"I enjoyed Spiritual Marketing very much. Although I am not new to the principals the book is based on, Joe brings a fresh voice to the subject of how you can use your thoughts to create your physical reality. He is warm, humerous, effective and just plain fun. He invites you to do what he does--to enjoy the same positive success he enjoys using the same spiritual tools he employs--and he spells those out in detail. It is a light, yet powerful &quot;read.&quot;I have purchased other eBook products from Joe's website (www.mrfire.com) and have been pleased with those publications as well. His positive enthusiasm is contageous.Thanks, Joe!"},{"Title":"Spiritual Marketing: A Proven 5-Step Formula for Easily Creating Wealth from the Inside Out","review":"Joe,I had difficulty putting into words how I felt about reading &quot;Spiritual Marketing&quot;. I have read my share of books related to creating abundance, and I am no stranger to working with this in spiritual meditations. With that in mind it should be no surprise to you that I didn't find anything new in the contents of your book except, of course, those wonderful true events you had provided.The theory and the steps are information I was already aware of, so why has this book started things happening in my life when all of the prior information I absorbed had little or no effect? Before I touch on that I want to be clear that I accept self responsibility and it is not up to a book to change my life, it is up to me.Within the same day of finishing the book I received three different sources for income. In reading the book I felt a definite shift in my reality, which I can explain - sort of.What I found in reading Spiritual Reality was that it talked to the body as well as to spirit. Whenever we try to make changes in our life we run into many body arguments to keep things just the way they are. The simple exercises in the book managed to involve the body and then get it out of the way to let the spirit do what it does best - create life.Thank you for this little gem."},{"Title":"Spiritual Marketing: A Proven 5-Step Formula for Easily Creating Wealth from the Inside Out","review":"I live within 10 minutes of one of the world's largest metaphysical libraries in the world so I don't lack for anything to read. I've read Joe's book twice. I've sent people to Amazon.com to buy it and I've purchased it to give away to friends and clients. I feel it is a blessing. &quot;Spiritual Marketing&quot; is a must read for anyone who wants to learn how to manifest what they deseire in their lives. What sets Joe's book apart from so many that I've read is that he shows you how he found people who could heal, coach and otherwise truly empower him to change his beliefs so that he was able change his outer reality. I feel most of you who are thinking about purchasing this book have read many others who tell you basically to do it yourself. Joe keeps referring to a power I choose to call God. This along with the healing and coaching abilites of the people he refers to or others you are led to will empower you to have the life of your dreams. There's also someting magical about Joe's book that truly can't be put into words. I beleive it has a lot to do with Joe's intent of being of service by making this book available to so many.

But, if I had to think about it, I would say because it conveys a feeling of seeing, understanding, or experiencing something that we never thought we could before. That self-limiting *too good to be true* feeling that has turned into *wow, now I'm actually seeing this impossible thing or it is happening to me.* After reading Joe's book, I now know this is a feeling we ALL should constantly live in - to always expect amazement in our lives. At 32 yo, over the past 5 years, I've been struggling with the dilemma of *do things, people, situations that come into my life happen to come in my life for a REASON (and, if so,why don't I understand the REASON at that moment) or do I have certain control over creating circumstances that I want?* The age old question: Coincidence or Fate? I once read a quote (&quot;Your Fate is the hand life deals you; your destiny is what you do with that hand&quot;) that actually makes me think these are mutually exclusive. But, if I have totally grasped the essence of Joe's Million Dollar Formula, by applying the 5-STEPS, fate &amp; destiny become mutually inclusive. In other words, to stick with the quote above, by telling the dealer (fate or my inner consciousness) what I WANT and truly believe that it will come to me (without worry or doubt), I can actually influence the TYPE of hand that the dealer (fate) deals me next time around. Also, reading this book will help you to *give up&quot; trying to control so many things in your life. It will help you to KNOW that you're in a position to make &quot;Life Pay YOUR price&quot; (verse you paying ITS price). You will realize, like I have, that achieving that position can be a tremendous struggle without Patience, Trust, and Gratitude.

As an instructor at the Air Force Academy, I first used this textbook many years ago to interest my first-year students in the Arabic language, before progressing to formal written Arabic in the second year. I must say that virtually all of my students found this book interesting and immediately usable, mainly due to its being written in Romanized (English) orthography rather than the Arabic script. Later on, because of the requirements of their profession, many of my former students found themselves in Saudi Arabia and were able to immediately communicate with their Saudi counterparts.Still teaching Arabic in 2004 as a civilian, I have recently used this same textbook to provide communication skills to a wide range of people who may end up in that part of the world in the near future. Again, the response was the same. The book was very practical and immediately useful.The vocabulary and sentence structures in the book are incrementally paced, beginning with polite social exchanges all the way to complex conversations on politics, history and related topics. Vocabulary lists and short grammatical drills reinforce subject matter without becoming too onerous.A word to the wise, however. This is not a book that will seamlessly lead you through a course in Standard Arabic. Standard Arabic uses the Arabic writing system and a discernably different linguistic structure. Many of the words are not the same and Standard Arabic places a greater emphasis on grammar than does the spoken language. Nonetheless, I believe that this particular book outshines all other texts for spoken Arabic, regardless of the dialect. Of course, the CD's that accompany this text are indispensable and should be purchased along with the text. Despite its &quot;plain&quot; appearance and lack of any graphic support, this is still the book to get if you want to become proficient in a spoken Arabic dialect. I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Saudi Arabic: Urban Hijazi Dialect, Basic Course (Arabic Edition)","review":"This is a reprint of the Foreign Service Institute book used for State Dept. personnel, and offers the advantage of the Saudi dialect--the most complicated phonetically, but if you learn Saudi it's a lot easier to go from it to other dialects than vice versa. It starts properly, with the always-essential politeness phrases that show people you mean well, and has clear explanations of grammar along with a lot of substitution drills. Unfortunately it is intended to be used with a native speaker (who need not have any special training), so you will need a saparate audio course--&quot;Vocabulearn&quot; uses Saudi pronunciation and is a good suggestion."},{"Title":"Saudi Arabic: Urban Hijazi Dialect, Basic Course (Arabic Edition)","review":"FSI produced many excellent tools to help people learn languages that are better than many of the flashy ones put out today. These books and accompanying materials are actually in the public domain, so you can find some of them online. It is much easier to have the book to work with than to use a pdf so I would recommend buying the book, but you can find the pdf and accompanying cd tracks (cost hundreds of dollars otherwise) here, http://www.fsi-language-courses.com/Arabic.aspx The audio material for this product is at the bottom section."},{"Title":"Saudi Arabic: Urban Hijazi Dialect, Basic Course (Arabic Edition)","review":"I am using an old, tattered photocopy of this book, then I found copies on Amazon. I ordered two of them (one to give to my native-speaking tutor who has a very beat-up copy). It's been a great introduction to Standard Arabic -- hits the most important point first and introduces things in a clear and concise manner. I currently live in the region where this book was researched (in 1975) and everyone (native speakers) I show it too really finds it very accurate. They're surprised a book like this exists. As mentioned before, it's transliterated in a easy-to-understand manner. It's not intensive on the written part, but it does show the Arabic writing for key words and verbs. I have been assured that this Arabic makes it well to be understood anywhere, albeit you might have trouble understanding regional dialects and accents. This is the best starter language guide I have ever seen. Margaret Omar did a superb job."},{"Title":"Saudi Arabic: Urban Hijazi Dialect, Basic Course (Arabic Edition)","review":"I recently ordered and received this book, and even from looking through it for 10 minutes I realized it was a great learning tool, probably one of the best I've come across. I've had experience with several languages and I know that it's often the small things that count towards the greatest understanding. This book gives a great breakdown of the functions and use of the language and it's structure, which I love. I find that having a background in MSA (Modern Standard Arabic) is very useful, at least for me it was, especially considering that the Saudi dialect is probably the one that contains the most similarities. In all, I would highly recommend this book! It's incredibly useful and, as mentioned, for those with knowledge of MSA, even better, as it will be easier to pick up."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"This book gives a nicely written look into the life of a young girl being brought up in the Amish tradition. It focuses on Rosanna's life and that of her family, and allows the reader a glimpse into what traditions and values the Amish instill in their children. The story goes into detail about such things as holidays, prayers, weddings -- even down to how they set their tables! A thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"While this book may not be for everybody, and it might not include all the aspects that a reader might expect - kind of a one stop shopping to tell everything that is necessary to understand this sect - it nevertheless tells you what the Amish are really like and why they wear the unusual clothes they do, as well as preach against the \\"worldly wisdom.\\" You get to follow Rosanna through her childhood, youth, courtship, and marriage, and child-rearing. Not only that, you see how her Amish life will differ from that of her Catholic friends, especially when they visit from their Philadelphia home.While this is not a modern day presentation, it is really useful as a historical piece. Just don't get bogged down by expecting a thorough intellectual examination of the Amish. The book is not intended for that. It is written as a honest, sympathetic and straightforward reflection of these folks from a religious, social, and economic snapshot. The traditions of the Amish are celebrated, and it's done very nicely. Recommended!!!"},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"I loved this book....and was sorry to see it end. The author (son of Rosanna) wrote a beautiful yet simple and compelling biography on the life of his mother, and the people closest in her life. I felt privileged reading this story - almost as if I were a member of this close-knit community. This story of honor and simple values would be wonderful today as it was then. Probably the most surprising statements which helped me to put it in perspective were comments made about Lincoln.....while I would prefer to believe this was a modern day story - stage coaches were in use and Lincoln was the President of the day. I highly recommend this book as an insight into the wisdom of how people should hold respect for one another, how families could work together for each other's good......and how communities can thrive without the aid of much of the electronic gadgetry of our modern times. This is a book of simple wisdom and peaceable lives. I am so grateful to son Joseph for his writing. There is even a very few pages at the end of the book, telling a bit about him......I highly recommend this book and hope you find value in it as I certainly did."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"The author is the son of the main character, Rosanna. Rosanna is the daughter of an Irish immigrant who is born around 1840 (my estimate as it is never given in the book). Rosanna's mother dies following Rosanna's birth. She is given to an Amish family on a temporary basis. When her father dies some months later, she ends up being permanently adopted and rasied by this old order Amish woman who later marries and bears more children.The author tells this interesting story, all the while weaving information about the lives of the old order Amish. I found this an interesting read. Explanations for why the Amish do things the way they do are given. There are details about their religious services, weddings, and funerals. Why they refuse to buy medical or fire insurance, why they refuse government aide, and why they refuse to fight in American wars is all explained.The author ends up going to college and later leaves the old order Amish to become a Mennonite. The old order Amish don't allow attending college as the author chose to do, to further his formal training as a teacher, so he had to change religious affiliations.What is missing from this book is a true spirit for Rosanna as a woman. Specifically, there is not much emotion or thoughts about certain things such as what it is like to mother children. There was virtually nothing about the experience of pregnancy, childbirth from her point of view, or how she could balance all that work and rearing so many children. The emotional aspect of losing her only daughter when she was just a toddler was not really elaborated on. I understand that it may be the custom to not verbally express emotions but I refuse to believe that emotions are not experienced...then again, if she was quiet about expressing her emotions I guess she would not have told her son therefore making these thoughts impossible for him to know and write about. Also missing was an explanation for what an Amish childhood is like, how much do they play and work? How much do they contribute to the laborious farm work the families accomplish? How does a busy Amish mother have time to pamper and enjoy her newborn baby? Also I'd like some parenting information such as common philosophies such as \\"is corporal punishment used\\"?Something else that I would have appreciated is a bit of an overview of the differences between the different orders and about the differences with the Mennonites. A better explanation of when and why people are ex-communicated, banned or shunned would put things more in perspective. There is nothing about this except a couple of sentences of inferred information. To get that information will take further research and reading.The account of the old order Amish is tastefully and respectfully written about in this book. I think this would make a great read aloud book for young children or as a book for a young person to read to themselves, perhaps if learning about American history or just to satisfy a curiosity about the Amish. There is nothing in here that is controversial such as sexual content. Since they live such a clean and virtuous life, there is nothing that needs censoring here for young children.The old order Amish are portrayed as a content, happy, and peaceful people. If we each changed a few things we non-Amish do to follow in their footsteps we'd be all the better for it."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"I remember my mother reading this book to the family when I was a child so when I found it in the bookstore I had to pick it up.I found the book interesting and the Amish a fascinating group of people. The book tells about the Amish and about growing up Amish. The Amish live a totally different type of lifestyle than most of us are used to and this book explains some of their reasons for why that is. In living close to them I was able to compare what the book said with what I saw them doing.If you ever find this book I recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"Rosanna of the Amish is the story of a young orphan raised in the 1800's among the Amish of Pennsylvania. Beginning with it's first pages, the story reaches out and pulls you in. From it's descriptions of the Amish worship to the simplcity of daily life, it brings the often secluded world of the Amish to life, not only describing how things are done, but in many cases why...I couldn't put the book down once I started and to date have read it numberous times. It is a classic that bears reading and re-reading."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"First written in 1940, this book tells the story of the author's mother, an Irish girl who was orphaned as a newborn and raised by an Amish neighbor after her father and older siblings move away. Rosanna grows up to be Amish in everyway, and over the years, she does get a chance to see her Catholic siblings from time to time and the difference in their lives.I enjoyed the character Rosanna and reading about her life. Her characterization, and that of other characters was good, but not outstanding. What makes this book so enjoyable is how naturally the author brings you into the Amish lifestyle. We learn about dress, selection of ministers, the bann, courtship, worship services, etc and very much feel like we're part of the scene. There are some differences compared to the Amish of today (and between different groups), in the exact specifics of dress, most using generators and having bathrooms today, etc, but the fundamentals of the group and their basic principles are the same.To anyone who is fascinated by the Amish or enjoys reading other Amish books, I would definitely recommend this one. This book has the advantage of being written by one who grew up in the community. It conveys the lifestyle very well and is an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"I thought this was one of the most interesting books I've read all school year. I've always wondered about the amish society, but until I finished this book this afternoon, I didn't have any clue as to what the amish believed.Joseph Yoder makes it possible for people like me to really enjoy a school book.I really think that if you have any questions about the amish to go straight to this book and read it."},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"I read this book almost thirty years ago, and read it again this year. My memories of a great story about the Amish were completely confirmed on the second reading. Joseph Yoder tells a very sensitive and caring story about his mother, Rosanna, and the family and Amish community in which he grew up. The reader must accept that the book was first published many decades ago and therefore was written to different standards than today's family stories. I credit the author with refraining from judgement when it comes to doctrinal differences among various Amish and Mennonite groups. The fact that he left the Old Order church of his childhood for a less conservative church, yet was still fully accepted in the community of his youth speaks for the respect he retained in the Old Order group. If you are looking for a completely family friendly story with great information on the Old Order Amish of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, you will not find a more enjoyable read.Rosanna's Boys"},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"The book was in great condition and was exactly how they described it. Can't believe they only wanted a penny for it! The only thing was the first time I had to sit down and read it for a long period of time I started to smell something and when I pulled the book closer to my nose, I realized that it was the book that smelled like cigarette smoke. I gag almost everytime I open it, but spraying it with body spray seems to be helping =)"},{"Title":"Rosanna of the Amish","review":"I have enjoyed reading several other books detailing the customs and religious beliefs of the Amish. I purchased this book thinking it too would be enjoyable reading. In my opinion, this book is one of the most boring and &quot;slow&quot; books I have read in a long time. I will probably not even read the last few chapters, but go on to another author, hoping for more enjoyable reading."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Anyone who doesn't give this book atleast 4 stars hasn't read the book or did and had a tremendous bias about the subject. If your read this book with an open mind you will find it interesting, educational, and worth reading. You have to read the book to really understand the man who is said to be the worst man to walk the earth. You can't even start to understand WWII or the Holocaust without reading this book. If you even think you know anything about Hitler until you read this book all you have been told is bias."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"The first thing to consider before reading this book, is whether or not you have at least a basic understanding of early 20th century Germany. If not, it would be very easy to get lost in the dragged out rants that Hitler writes about these times. That being said, this book was by no means exceptional. As a matter of fact, I believe that had it not been for his brilliant oratorical skills, there's no way Hitler would have ever gained the power that he did based on the banality of this book.Throughout this book, the author contradicts himself, and causes confusion for the reader, and I don't believe that it's just clarity lost in the translation, it's a general lack of good writing skills. He also has a tendency to spend several dozen pages saying what can be said in just one or two. Hitler thinks of himself as the messiah of Germany, and it comes out in not too subtle of a way. In fact I even hypothesized that the division of the book into two part was some kind of pathetic attempt for the author to create his own Bible like the Holy Bible with it's old and new testaments.There are several shining moments, however, throughout the book where Hitler makes some very valid points about the state of society and human nature. He writes about the failure of the school system to teach history properly, an argument that I believe holds true today. As well as the struggle of the lower classes and the vicious circle of discrimination and poverty that they face.What is important here is to understand that Hitler wasn't just some monster. He was a man. A man with ideas, very dangerous ideas. All too often we dismiss Hitler as a madman, and don't even try to understand the rage and anger that was inside him. To not learn from history, is to doom ourselves to repeat it. There are leaders today, not just in middle east and other war-torn nations, but even in the free world who mirror some of the dangerous ideas that made Hitler who and what he was. It is so crucial for us, as a society, to oppose the acts of our leaders that perpetrate these same actions and principles. To break from mainstream thought, to put together the pieces of the real truth, and to think for ourselves.What Mein Kampf allowed me to do was to begin to recognize patterns in leaders and to look past media propaganda. This book serves as a lesson of the danger of ignorance.So if you are looking for something that is a good read, this is definitely the wrong book, because it is slow, repetitive, and oftentimes it seems as though the author is just trying to sound too intelligent. It's definitely not some of Hitler's most captivating words. But, as a historical document, and point of reference for recognizing dangerous thought, it is essential. I don't think that this book is going to gain any followers to the Nazi cause, so as far as I'm concerned, it should be mandatory reading."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Definently an interesting work, a glimpse into the mind of the man who brought nazi-germany to power, and his plans for the world. The third reich's campaign brought the nazis to a war the would engulf the entire globe, and bring death to over 35 million worldwide. I would highly recommend history-buffs like myself, and anyone who has a particular interest in wwII or Nazi Germany to read this book, it brings to perspective hitler's plans for the world, and a slight peek at the character behind the leader of the third reich that will never be forgotten."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"I am rating \\"Mein Kampf\\" with 4 stars due to the translation & introduction by Ralph Manheim and Abraham Foxman. Also, due to the importance and significance of reading this piece. Though cringe-worthy it may be, this is an important piece of Literature.My personal feelings towards the material...It is an incredibly long and at many times redundant read. Be ready to set aside some time. Before attempting to read this book, make sure that you have a strong foudation in your own worldview perspective. Remember while reading, that like the Angel of Light himself, Hitler has ways of peppering truth in the midst of insanity and lies. At times you may find yourself in agreement with him, in regards to some of the reasons of Germany's downfall, which can be psychologically torturing. It is relieving once he reveals his answers to these problems, which are completely void of sanity, and hopefully like myself, the reader will find no commonality. Having read this book, it is easy to understand how someone not strongly founded and perhaps in a defeated moment may look to a Hitler for answers. It would be wise that this book be read by all in order to steer clear of such cults of personality.NOTE: I do not condone the ideas below, they are Hitler's, and his alone.Now, I hope to objectively summarize...Reasons for Germany's downfall...International Capital (Marxism) verses National Capital (National Socialism). Increased population. Growing difference between the rich and poor. Unemployment. Money worshiping culture. Aristocracy controlling finance capital. Loss of private property rights. Property rights transferred to stock companies. Internationalized economic life. War against heavy industry. Weak education system. The ultimate reason for the decline was failure to recognize the racial problem. German states began to dissolve as Reich began to take from them. The states were in financial bondage to the Reich. The Reich took away rights as it took away property.The Race War...Jews are the masters of lies. Aryans are the Prometheus of Mankind. All other races are chaff. Lower human beings must be used. The Jew is the mightiest counterpart of the Aryan. The Jew exploits and plunders all nations. The Jew, in his attempts, overthrows governments. Unconsciously, many Germans fight for the enemy, the Jew. The purpose for Israel being a nation would be to have a central organization for their international world swindle, endowed with sovereign rights, removed from state intervention, and a haven for scoundrels. Jews are mongrels and a lesser race. Jews are ape men. Aryans are physical perfection, Jews are bow-legged. The Jews struggle for world conquest.The Answer...The attention of a people mustn't be divided, but concentrated on a single foe. The fight must be posed as a fight for \\"freedom.\\" The effect must be aimed at the emotion and only to a limited degree the intellect. The use of propaganda, whose task is not to make an objective study of the truth, but is to serve our own right. Supporter of conscription. Only give the people what they need to know, not the ultimate plan. Treatment of the body is not a private affair; there is no freedom to sin at the cost of the race. Personal freedom recedes before the duty to preserve the race. Sterilization of the unfit. Must take over labor unions and the press. Masses must be nationalized. Leader should be a hero. There should be a strong, uncompromising party. Continuous mutual higher breeding to create the best of humanity. Aryans are the master race and must put the world into service of a higher culture. Racial purity must be established. The youth must be educated to be a valuable link. Clothing should be adapted to physical exertion. Youth must be supervised by the State even after school hours. There is a need for Citizen's Diplomas and Health Certificates. Human salvation lies in the Aryans' creativity. Authority of every leader downward and responsibility upward. No representatives, only advisors. There should be a senate of the elite. Primitive soldiers will do the bidding for the folkish philosophy. Trade union officials will work as officers. Need for trained forces that are not military. Propaganda is used for Organization which leads to Power. France is a mortal enemy and must be crushed. German land is too small and must extend east in order to prevent extinction or slavery.Ominous quotes...(p.124) \\"I hope someday to make a name for myself as an architect...which Fate would allot me, to dedicate my sincere services to the nation.\\" (p.206) \\"There is no making pacts with Jews; there can only be hard: either-or.

One definately has to have &quot;the Will&quot; in order to finish it. With that being said, this book is extremely important for the insight that it gives into Hitler's mind and for the things that would come to pass once Hitler assumed absolute power. Most everything that would occur in the late '30's and early '40's is blueprinted here from the attacks on Jews to the elimination of physically and mentally undesirables. I urge that this book be read by all those interested in World War II and the Third Reich. Only after reading this will anyone truly grasp what influenced the world during that time period."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Hitler is usually described on TV as some sort of madman.

In his \\"History of The World\\" H.G. Wells discusses the atttempt to bring the world under a \\"firm Jewish heel\\". It is interesting that Wells takes this as an obvious fact, not out-of-the-blue speculation. Hitler came to the same conclusion. His initial hatred for Jewswas not theoretical, but based on his observations or taking as fact that Jews ran brothels in Vienna where the sexual favors of German girls were sold to all interested. His reaction apppears similar to what a traditionalist White Southerner might think on seeing Howard Stern on TV today. It is unclear if Hitler was aware of Oswald Spengler's view that the German loss of WW I was the first great step in the downfall of Western Civilization to the \\"colored world\\" (Spengler's words)and that the \\"next war\\" would determine if Western Civilization survied or died. Hitler's views are far from insane; they in many ways seem the product of a logic machine. \\"X\\" is happening; \\"Y\\" is promoting \\"X\\"; \\"X\\" is not desired, thereforeeliminate \\"Y\\". Exactly the same logic exists today, but \\"X\\" is the destruction of European man and \\"Y\\" is the forcescreating \\"X\\" and \\"X\\" is desired, therefore \\"Y\\" is promoted.It is evident that Hitler's hatred for Jews was not based upon any sort of theology, but upon their more-or-less generally perceived negative impact upon the Western World in general and upon Germany in particular. If the Jews had been any other peoples having the same perceived impact, Hitler would have felt the same about them. This is evident by his dislike for France, based upon his perception, stated in Mein Kampf, that that country would be a Negro state in several hundred years and that France had put Negros on the Rhine. Perhaps the greatest difference between Hitler and conventional politicians is that Hitler though more of the future than the immediate, as he said in the context of the 1938 pact with Stalin. Hitler appears to have had a fair knowledge of Judaism. He once said that Judaism is not a religion, but a philosophy. Einstein said almost the same thing. Interestingly, Herman Cohen said that to be a religion a system had to be true, in the scientific sense, not \\"I know\\" when \\"I believe strongly\\" is meant, As any casual student of TANACH and Talmud knows, Jewish ethics are based upon the notion that whatever is in the long term interest of the Jewish people, as centuries go by, is a positive good and sin is anything which acts against this end. The reversal of values in America is an astounding exhibit of the power of tightly controlled propaganda. As a whole the European population of the US has become convinced that caring about the future is a positive evil and not caring is a positive good. Judge Learned Hand (the 12th member of the Supreme Court) wrote many years ago that control over the great newspapers and magazines constitutes the real government of the United States. Today TV and motion pictures would be in first place as influence. The anti-European programming on TV has become standard. An interesting directly political case showing this control is the now dead \\"Fairness Doctrin\\" of the FCC about 30 years ago. The doctrin was that TV stations having ads for political candidates had to accept ads of all political candidates. The controllers of TV at the time went to the federal courts, where the Supreme Court ruled the doctrin constitutional. So the controllers had the heart of the doctrin cut out by the FCC itself. The objection was, of course, that it partially created a free press in the US. Now the term \\"right wing\\" means harmless radio and TV opinion programs where serious discussion is never found. The European population of the US (and of much of Western Europe) has with exceptions of course been induced to give up their self-respect. The US government has been influenced by this same mentality of low self-respect. It should be obvious that a people who lack self-respect will find themselves attacked externally. Judaism to some degree defines itself in terms of enemies. This seems obvious- to be Chosen necessitates that the \\"other\\" is non-chosen and inferior, \\"the evil ones\\" as RAMBAM calls them. The introduction of Kantian ethics into modern commentaries on TANACH appears to be a conscious attempt to reduce the notion that the non-chosen are valueless to God. This is a moving away from Rabbi Akiba's argument that God cared only for Jews, because Jews are circumcised, which is to God as a uniform is to the king, and as the king loves his own soldiers and recognizes them by their uniforms, so God knows and loves his chosen and not the non-chosen.When you read Mein Kampf remember that it is a political argument trying to attract and maintain support, not a scientific analysis. We are today fully familiar with half truths and statements quoted out of context and similar devicesused by American political figures to attract support for themselves or this or that program. Hitler did much the same thing. In one almost universal practice of national governmentsHitler's book is a bit stupid; it is a stupidity widely shared. In addition to being a statement of his views, Mein Kampf is also a policy statement, though it was written long before he had governmental authority. National governments have a great bias for establishing and then following policy without due re-examination. Hitler did just that. He established policy and he followed it somewhat blindly with little regard to the flux of circumstance. In many ways it may be said that he had little understanding of the impacts policy, once established, carried out would have upon Germany. He was making policy beyond his understanding; a common fault at the national government level, where policy makers seldom really understand the varient effects of policy carried out. He put what he perceived as the national good above the welfare or even survival of the individual. That is a common mindset of political and other leaders. Maimonides in M-Torah says thata person should let himself die rather than be treated by an apostate physician, clearly a bias for the long-term good of the people over the survival of the individual. It seems pretty clear that Hitler judged the accomplishment of his aimsto be limited by personal leadership with institutionalized continuation rather than by a rule-following institution, thus he saw the realization of the principal aims as having to be accomplished by him individually. This limitation was his great weakness.As far as reading is concerned, Mein Kampf is of interest only because it is by Hitler. Obviously, a student of the period should read it.There was an overwhelming change in World history produced by the destruction of Germany by the US, UK and Russia that is far greater than any historical event in thousands of years. It does not mean a change of colors on a map; it means fundamental, permanent change in the nature of man at the biological level. Most past European wars had meant little more than which prince peasants would pay taxes to or perhaps whether they would have some sort of representation at most. Hitler's book should be read with the understanding of what he saw at stake: The fundamental nature of European man for all time. He was willing to do anything to protect it.It is of some interest that Hitler does not mean by the word \\"race\\" the classifications used by physical anthropologists such as Carlton Coon, who put man into five biologic divisions, with mixed persons not fitting into any of the five. (Caucazoid, Mongoloid, Congoid, Capoid and Australioid) Hitler uses the term to mean any of very many groups, thus he says that the only surviving pure race will be the \\"Jewish race\\". The translation given a German newspaper of the Hitler period is \\"Racial Observer\\". The German is \\"Volklisher Beobacer\\" which does not mean racial observer, but something more akin to \\"Popular Observer\\" or more loosly \\"National Observer\\"."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"The Mannheim translation is not quite as accurate as the Hurst &amp; Blackett edition, in fact it contains a significant editorial(?) error. To those who have read it and found it boring, so I believe you would find much literature of the turn of the century. Literacy and literary style have changed a great deal since then, but not necessarily for the better. Perhaps it is not quite up to par with the classics, but Hitler was not a professional writer. He did have quite an understanding of contemporary and historical events of his age, and made quite a few accurate predictions and/or analyses. Certainly not the mad ravings of a lunatic rug-chewer that I was otherwise led to believe. This is also only one aspect (although a fundamentally significant one) of the National Socialist German Worker's Party. Another important document would be the pamphlet of the 25 Points of the Party's platform, penned by Hitler and Gottfried Feder. Good Luck trying to find it- it doesn't match up with the &quot;evil monstrous vehicle of hatred&quot; we've all heard since 1945. You've maybe heard of the &quot;Big Lie&quot; propaganda technique? Check out pg.232 of the Mannheim edition. See who really invented the Big Lie...you'll be surprised."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"I have read this work half a dozen times and each time I discover something new. The Hitler who wrote Mein Kampf was not the Hitler who later went on to rule the Third Reich and most of Europe. He was still developing.Hitler was, naturally, a better public orator than he was an author, nevertheless this book can be compared with his \\"Table Talk\\" conversations (which were published after his death), as Mein Kampf is filled with Hitler's thoughts, opinions, ideals, and plans. He also gives an interesting, albeit brief, account of his childhood and young adulthood as well as an especially fascinating first-hand account of his experiences as a soldier in WWI.One is stunned at this man's great intelligence, despite what popular opinion would have us believe.It is certainly not light reading, but anyone in search of truth about Hitler and his way of thinking, not to mention his countless critics and would-be judges, must first have read this fine work."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Excellent read for those interested in political philosophy, history or psychology. The only complaint I have is that the typeface is tiny."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Adolf Hitler is by far, one of the most mysterious and controversial men of all time. This book shines a light for all the world to see why exactly hitler is the way he was and why he did what he did. This book is an unexperigated edition, meaning that it doesnt edit anything out; in this day and age i feel comforted in knowing what i read isn't biasely edited to suit the publishers agendas and causes."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Adolf Hitler was one of the most loved men of the 20th Century. In &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; we learn about the author's childhood, the collapse of Germany in 1918, the founding of his National Socialist German Worker's Party and the abortive Beer Hall Putsch of 1923 which sent Adolf Hitler to Landsberg Prison where he wrote his famous book. The author goes into detail on policy questions which will later be realized just before and during the Second World War. The book is said to be very prophetic in that sense. Any rumors of the difficulty in reading the work or the poor writing are false; it is easy to read and highly interesting. In short, this book is a must for those wishing to gain a more thorough understanding of German National Socialism and its creator."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Though most don't agree with its ideals but it's a great key to understanding Hitler's ideas and the Holocaust. It makes you better understand the wworld you live in..... a great lesson in ethics."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"In order to give any clear review for Mein Kampf it is necessary to attempt to read it as just another book by just another theoretician. While this eventually became untrue, viewing it this way helps to see it as it was initially encountered, which in turn may help us to understand how it went from long political diatribe to near-eternal infamy.If we do that, here is what we discover. Adolf Hitler's long tome is not unintelligent. One could, in fact, make a list of quotations from Mein Kampf that are easy to agree with. This is due to the fact that in exploring his ideas Hitler touches on many areas of human and even natural experience. In doing so he states many things which would be difficult to not call truisms.Yet in investigating this philosophy Hitler makes errors that perhaps it is easier for us to see in our time, but might have been harder when this was published. In describing human structures, Hitler is quick to designate terms that he feels he can pigeon-hole people into. Given his racial views this might not be surprising, but without that assistance, it might not be as easy to note his logical flaw when, for example, he divides activists into idealists and politicans; though he acknowledges that occasionally one is both, what he fails to notice is that the line between the two is not nearly as easily definable as he thinks it is.Besides his use of this belief system as it relates to race, his tendency to do this extends to the rest of his writing. Mein Kampf is packed with various lists that Hitler feels can describe different phenomena. The more he lists, however, the more that you see someone in love with his own self-created systems than with any desire to map them accurately to reality. This is in spite of the fact that Hitler spends a good portion of the first 1/5 of the book discussing the evolution in his views as his old opinions fell in the face of adult-acquired evidence.There is also a problem for the non-German reader in that Hitler spends a good amount of time focusing on specific words that appear to drive the debates of his time, the same way that the fight over words such as \\"liberal\\" or \\"alternative\\" defines ours. So when Hitler describes the battle for proper use of the word \\"folkish\\" to describe his utopian state, most lack the social history necessary to even fully understand his points, let alone judge his accuracy in describing them.So the question comes: do you need to read this? That's not easy to answer. At roughly 700 pages with highly complex sentences that often go to more than 10 lines, Mein Kampf is a very difficult read. On the other hand, because we now know of the nightmare Hitler unleashed on the world, it is natural to want to read this to find out where he went wrong so we can avoid these problems in the future.For people who feel that way, I would answer this \\"yes\\", as the answer for this is more hidden than you might guess. If you get into this with the mindset that you will find a one-to-one correlation of his philosophy to those of some modern-day leader or party, you'll be in for a surprise. Elements of right and wrong are interspersed all over Hitler's rambling. That makes it even harder to work through, but it also provides a reward more fulfilling than any black-and-white rallying cry. And given that that was the kind of world that Hitler saw, and we now know the results of these ideals, that might be all the more reason to put the effort in and understand with more maturity and clarity exactly where Hitler missed the point."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"I am Jewish and an Israeli - grandson of Auschwitz victims. I am also a literature major and a writer. A thorough and detached reading of this manifeso reveals that in addition to being mad, Hitler was also an EXTREMELY able writer with an unquestionable &amp; eclectic artisitic bent. His book is at times a fairy-tale at times a piece of sharp journalism and often a surrealisitic epic. He uses original metaphors and other imagery that to a German could have been easily inspiring. Together with the lectures, sermons and intuitive analysis on politics, psychology, and history, Hitler left me gasping with shock and wonder: six million jews and the world were in grave danger by 1908 when Hitler came to terms with his anti-semitism, not in 1933 when he began realizing this book word for word."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"To truly understand Hitler, one must read his manifesto, not someone elses opinion on the man &amp; his ideology. He outlines his plans for Russia, the Jews, and the 3rd Reich. What gets me is that when he came to power in 1933 the rest of the world didn't take him seriously. Did Stalin even read Mein Kampf? While he is one of the most notorious figures in the 20th or any century for that matter, there are few world leaders that have matched the depth of his dedication evil though it was. Hitler was the rarest of birds in the political arena-The true believer &amp; this is evidenced by his actions. This book reads more like a collection of twisted thoughts without any specific order rather than a work with any sort of continuity. The last thing I have for Hitler's actions is admiration, but one must be objective when reading a book by so notorious an author, then make your own judgement."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Just got this edition written by James Murphy, and I got to say its Insightful. It brings you to the mind of Adolph Hitler, and let's you know is view towards life. It has some English errors! but nothing too serious."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"This book is really something that one should take the time for, it is not an easy read, especially not in German, and the book is also not very exciting, it is, after all, a political book. Some people seem offended that I own this book, when they see it on my shelf, some dare not say anything, afraid i might be some kind of neo nazi, but Mein Kampf is one of the best selling books ever published, and it had a great impact on those who read it during it's time of first publishing.People simply look at Hitler as being this disturbed man, who was just dangerous to everyone, and should never have been alive, but there is more to Hitler than hatred. He had the power to convince millions of people that he could change their economical, social and political situation, he influenced and inspired them. He was a brilliant man, although also said to be mentally ill, possibly schizophrenic.People are scared of young adults reading Mein Kampf and being influenced by it, but in order to prevent something like this from happening again, we should look at the situation at that time, we can read this book and learn from it, find out what drove Adolf Hitler to this. I believe this is a book more people should read and learn from, instead of fearing it and the man behind it.But beware, it's not an easy read."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"The book is obviously a must read for understanding Hitler's early thought. But, as many of his associates would attest, he himself declared the book obsolete, irrelvant, poorly written and he regretted publishing it (which is why he never published his second book). Most high ranking National Socialists never read it, with the exception of Goebbels. The book probably has more emotional impact on people today than it did back then, and I personally don't understand how it's now become so significant to neo-nazis and censors. The book would probably be more useful to historian types than to the general reader. The prose is turgid and disorganized, and definitely seems to simply be rant put to paper (it's not simply the translation, the German edition is the same way). The book is also difficult to read all the way through. The chapter on propaganda is proably the most useful one, and is the only here where Hitler shows his brilliant understanding of persuasion. Most of the book is still filled with his typical perorations with his pseudoscientific, somewhat simplistic understanding of things (although he probably read more than most people). Despite his intelligence, most of this book is by no means a masterpiece, especially given many of his problematic beliefs. For insight into Hitler's mind, his second book would be a better read, but even more important would be his 'secret conversations'. It's definitely a worthwhile read for us serious students of history, just like the Communist Manifesto, but otherwise I would pass, as I think it's significance has been way overblown. I nonetheless gave it a five for it's significance as a historical text, but without that, I would have given it a 2 or a 1."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"'Mein Kampf' is a human document, if it is neither precisely history nor precisely literature. It has been cruelly criticized. Quite the most bitter things that could have been said about it have come from the side of literary rather than of political criticism. To that extent they are negligible and beside any real point. Hitler's mind teemed in Landsberg as it teemed since, with a multitude of urgent ideas. It must have been of immense mental service to him to set them down, with the aid of the enthusiastic and devoted Hess, and reduce them to the order and the cogency of ink!THIS BOOK, IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED, WAS ADDRESSED TO THE ADHERENTS OF THE ORIGINAL GERMAN WORKER'S PARTY, AND IN NO WAY APPEALED TO OPPONENTS AT HOME OR TO FOREIGNERS ABROAD."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"This was a present. They loved it. Keep it for study. It was just what was ordered. My friend loved the book"},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"This is a very difficult book to read, not only because it is the product of the hateful and ignorant mind of a man that seized control of Germany and plunged the world into one of history's most devastating wars, resulting in the ethnic genocide of millions of Jews, Slavs, gypsies, homosexuals and others.\\"Mein Kampf\\" [My Struggle] is extremely poorly written, even after considerable editing. The author, Adolph Hitler, airs his thoughts at random and in appalling crudeness on every conceivable subject, including culture, education, the theater, movies, the comics, art, literature, history, sex, marriage, prostitution and syphilis. Those wishing to learn about the life of the German leader will be disappointed as there is little autobiography in this book.Written while he was serving a prison term for his failed Beer Hall Putsch, Hitler originally wanted to title his work \\"Four and Half Years of Struggle against Lies, Stupidity and Cowardice\\". However, Max Amann, the hard-struggling manager of the Nazi publishing business, shortened the title to \\"Mein Kampf\\".The book was first published in 1925 and was some four-hundred pages long. Other editions soon followed, especially after Hitler came to power, and sales made the German leader a wealthy man. Journalist, author and historian William Shirer, author of the monumental \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\\" wrote of \\"Mein Kampf\\": \\"Except for the Bible, no other book sold so well during the Nazi regime.\\" Not every German who bought a copy read it and even Nazi party stalwarts admitted that it was difficult reading and that many were never able to get through the end of the book.Hitler's ideas were formed in the early 1920s and we have his own word for it that he learned little afterward and altered nothing in his thinking. When he left Austria for Germany in 1913 at the age of twenty-four he was full of a burning passion for German nationalism, a hatred for democracy, Marxism and the Jews and a certainty that Providence had chosen the Aryans, especially the Germans, to be the master race.In \\"Mein Kampf\\" he outlined his views and applied them specifically to the problem of restoring Germany to power and building a new state based on race. That state, the Third Reich, would include all Germans living outside Germany at the time the book was written. Hitler made it clear that there would a final reckoning with France and that German expansion would have to come largely at the expense of Russia.Thus, \\"Mein Kampf\\" is a blueprint for conquest. France would be destroyed, but that would be secondary to the German drive eastward. First the immediate lands to the East inhabited predominantly by Germans would be taken, including Austria, the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, and the western part of Poland, including Danzig. After that Germany would turn on the Soviet Union.While not a bluepring per se for ethnic cleansing, \\"Mein Kampf\\" certainly laid the foundation for the Holocaust that followed under the Third Reich. According to Hitler, Jews and Slavs were inpure races and when he became dictator he would forbid their marriage with Germans. He made it clear that in his New World Order they would serve the Third Reich as slaves serve a master. Thus it began...Why then was the world so surprised when Hitler and Nazi Germany set out to accomplish exactly what the German leader had set out in \\"Mein Kampf\\"? Because, of course, they had either not read his book or, having done so, did not believe that he was capable of carrying out his program. Indeed, who in their right mind would have believed the program outlined in \\"Mein Kampf\\" possible or that Hitler and Germany were capable of carrying it out?Anyone who wants to understand the mind of Adolph Hitler and the true nature of his Third Reich must start here. It is a terrible beginning indeed."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"There are very few translations of Hitler's Mein Kampf in English. I believe Ralph Manheim has done a good job in presenting the translation as understandable, at least to an average reader. This book certainly dispelled my early views of Hitler as a mere bloodthirsty lunatic psychopath. Unlike me, someone who was directly involved in World War II or who have lost their loved ones in the war, might have contrary views. Footing solely on the book, one can conclude that Hitler had extraordinary leadership qualities. His magnificent ability as an orator as well as the deplorable condition of the German people in post-World War I Germany, elevated him to unquestionable power .Hitler also appeared to be a man of strong principles, discipline and good organizational skills. As much as he had the above mentioned admirable qualities, it is counter balanced by his insistence on resorting to fanaticism and bloody-force . Through out the book, his scorching hatred and intense contempt toward particular groups or issues, seems to be purely emotional rather than justifying it through facts and logical arguments. He dreamt of creating a glorious Aryan-Germany, but his means defied both God and Nature, resulting in an unattainable end and gothic memories in the heart of millions who have lived and are still living."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"I would have to say this is one of the best books I have ever read. It uses interspersed ideals to explain a complicated but heartfelt belief. It is actually a really sad book, when you read between the lines. What could be sadder than the anguish of a tortured mind in a world of people with no understanding?(And by the way - the reason that the text seems so rambling is that Hitler dictated it to Rudolph Hess so it really would work better as a speech.)"},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Excellent book written for National Socialism but is something every citizen of the United States and also worldwide to understand Hitlers motivation to do what he thought was neccessary. All around excellent book."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"First, a disclaimer: I do not advocate or support Hitler's ideas, but I recommend this book because so much of the world currently thinks this way and applies this philosophy or similar to issues of economy, immigration, international relations, and even their daily business and community lives. Because Mein Kampf reflects the mindset of so many, from leaders such as Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (President of Iran) down to the common American factory worker, it's important to realize that these ideas--as any really--are as dangerous as they are logical.Is this an evil book? No. We have several maniacs publishing books, sitting in places of political power, and with loyal followings on political talk shows whose ideas are as or more threatening to world order if they were allowed to reign. And since you should understand those competing ideas for what they are, I recommend reading the father of them all--Mein Kampf.The most shocking thing about reading this book is that Hitler offers a very logical and appealing argument: that foreigners (the Jews in his time, but perhaps we could substitute the Chinese or Mexicans in ours, or we Americans if you are from Europe or the Middle East, or 'White' Afrikans in 'Black' Africa) are a threat to our wealth and welfare, the health of our society, that they are slowing taking over economically, that it's only a matter of time before they are a ruling, wealthy minority which will subjegate our culture and people--and that they must be stopped.After all, this has happened in other countries--you're bound to think--and isn't it happening today? Wouldn't we be right to protect our interests against this imminent threat? Of course, the answer is to irradicate them, seize their assets, erase all traces of their culture. At the very least, doesn't Mein Kampf match very well with the idea of closing United States borders to all immigration, and deporting those who are not already citizens? Hitler himself argues the point far better than any politician today--and boldly.Hitler does not come off as insane or evil. He's preaching to the chior in his time and place, and it's not much of a stretch to say that this same argument would be very effective today.It's scary how convincing this book is, and that's exactly why you should read it. Even if you, as I, may not agree with how he incorporated his political philosophy, it's a wake up call to read something by the individual who personified evil for nearly all of us and yet find that his ideas are considerably well thought out."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"I am rating \\"Mein Kampf\\" with 4 stars due to the translation & introduction by Ralph Manheim and Abraham Foxman. Also, due to the importance and significance of reading this piece. Though cringe-worthy it may be, this is an important piece of Literature.My personal feelings towards the material...It is an incredibly long and at many times redundant read. Be ready to set aside some time. Before attempting to read this book, make sure that you have a strong foundation in your own worldview perspective. Remember while reading, that like the Angel of Light himself, Hitler has ways of peppering truth in the midst of insanity and lies. At times you may find yourself in agreement with him, in regards to some of the reasons of Germany's downfall, which can be psychologically torturing. It is relieving once he reveals his answers to these problems, which are completely void of sanity, and hopefully like myself, the reader will find no commonality. Having read this book, it is easy to understand how someone not strongly founded and perhaps in a defeated moment may look to a Hitler for answers. It would be wise that this book be read by all in order to steer clear of such cults of personality.NOTE: I do not condone the ideas below, they are Hitler's, and his alone.Now, I hope to objectively summarize...Reasons for Germany's downfall...International Capital (Marxism) verses National Capital (National Socialism). Increased population. Growing difference between the rich and poor. Unemployment. Money worshiping culture. Aristocracy controlling finance capital. Loss of private property rights. Property rights transferred to stock companies. Internationalized economic life. War against heavy industry. Weak education system. The ultimate reason for the decline was failure to recognize the racial problem. German states began to dissolve as Reich began to take from them. The states were in financial bondage to the Reich. The Reich took away rights as it took away property.The Race War...Jews are the masters of lies. Aryans are the Prometheus of Mankind. All other races are chaff. Lower human beings must be used. The Jew is the mightiest counterpart of the Aryan. The Jew exploits and plunders all nations. The Jew, in his attempts, overthrows governments. Unconsciously, many Germans fight for the enemy, the Jew. The purpose for Israel being a nation would be to have a central organization for their international world swindle, endowed with sovereign rights, removed from state intervention, and a haven for scoundrels. Jews are mongrels and a lesser race. Jews are ape men. Aryans are physical perfection, Jews are bow-legged. The Jews struggle for world conquest.The Answer...The attention of a people mustn't be divided, but concentrated on a single foe. The fight must be posed as a fight for \\"freedom.\\" The effect must be aimed at the emotion and only to a limited degree the intellect. The use of propaganda, whose task is not to make an objective study of the truth, but is to serve our own right. Supporter of conscription. Only give the people what they need to know, not the ultimate plan. Treatment of the body is not a private affair; there is no freedom to sin at the cost of the race. Personal freedom recedes before the duty to preserve the race. Sterilization of the unfit. Must take over labor unions and the press. Masses must be nationalized. Leader should be a hero. There should be a strong, uncompromising party. Continuous mutual higher breeding to create the best of humanity. Aryans are the master race and must put the world into service of a higher culture. Racial purity must be established. The youth must be educated to be a valuable link. Clothing should be adapted to physical exertion. Youth must be supervised by the State even after school hours. There is a need for Citizen's Diplomas and Health Certificates. Human salvation lies in the Aryans' creativity. Authority of every leader downward and responsibility upward. No representatives, only advisors. There should be a senate of the elite. Primitive soldiers will do the bidding for the folkish philosophy. Trade union officials will work as officers. Need for trained forces that are not military. Propaganda is used for Organization which leads to Power. France is a mortal enemy and must be crushed. German land is too small and must extend east in order to prevent extinction or slavery.Ominous quotes...(p.124) \\"I hope someday to make a name for myself as an architect...which Fate would allot me, to dedicate my sincere services to the nation.\\" (p.206) \\"There is no making pacts with Jews; there can only be hard: either-or.

But it is still on balance mistaken.Although most nationalists in the United States and even in Germany do not consider themselves national socialists, multiracialists and anti-White Jewish advocacy groups call each and every one of us a \\"Nazi.\\" It is an undeniable fact that in our contemporary political climate *any* white nationalism, as recent events in the Balkans amply demonstrate, will be labeled Hitlerian and will summon, in breathless media presentations, \\"the specter of the Holocaust\\" and anguished fears that \\"it\\" might just happen again, if the goyim get too restless. That, after all, is the central lesson taught by the countless Holocaust Museums sprouting up, like noxious toadstools, throughout most of the West: that White racial consciousness is literally lethal and must therefore be actively combated, a lesson which we have now enshrined, in deference to Jewry, at the Holocaust Museum in Washington, a national memorial to our White wickedness.We are thus obliged, like it or not, to live under Hitler's shadow. Our enemies have ensured that any expression of White racial consciousness, however innocuous, will be officially pronounced hatefully Hitlerian and \\"Nazi,\\" whether we admire Hitler or despise him. It is therefore incumbent on us, as a simple matter of self-defense, to arrive at a balanced view of Hitler and the movement he founded.Anyone who doubts all this should recall the abuse that Pat Buchanan received at the hands of the controlled media and the organized Jewish community during his campaigns for the Republican nomination. Buchanan is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a national socialist, nor even a conscious racialist. He is, instead, a traditional Christian conservative, with all the virtues and liabilities that entails. But he was persistently labeled a \\"Nazi\\" nevertheless. [After] his 1992 speech at the Republican National Convention, Jewish columnist Molly Ivins opined, \\"probably sounded better in the original German.\\" Her meaning was clear: She was identifying Buchanan as a \\"Nazi,\\" delegitimizing his nationalism and social conservatism with the most potent weapon in the Left's rhetorical arsenal.So as racial nationalists we can either manufacture false \\"anti-racist\\" credentials by claiming to hate Hitler just as much as Abe Foxman does, a subterfuge that I very much doubt will convince anyone, least of all Abe, or we can tell the truth.The truth is that the maniacal Hitler of popular demonology is a World War II propaganda fiction, and the principal purpose of the fiction's incessant repetition more than fifty years after the war is to stigmatize any nationalist movement, NS or otherwise. Hitler now represents not a specific historical figure and the political party he led, but nationalism of any variety, from timid anti-immigration conservatives to angry White-power skinheads. The System's anti-Hitler orthodoxy, invoked almost daily, is in effect tacit propaganda for multiracialism and a potent device to keep all nationalists perpetually hiding in closets, too afraid of labels like \\"racist\\" and \\"Nazi\\" to openly say what we sincerely believe. We have, therefore, a real interest in demythologizing Hitler, and we have no hope of escaping our association with what he now represents. We can't run away from Hitler, however much some of us want to.Let's Notice the ObviousThe crucial facts about World War II are uncomplicated and readily available in mainstream sources. NS Germany had limited war aims: the recovery of territory taken from Germany at Versailles, the acquisition of living space for the German people in the East, and the destruction of the Marxist Soviet Union, history's most brutal regime. Insofar as the United States had any stake at all in the outcome of the war, it would have been to help Germany and her Axis allies, including thousands of Russian patriots, accomplish the latter. Absent the campaign conducted by the Western democracies to save Stalinism by defeating Hitler, the Soviet Union would have collapsed.Since America had no national interests in the conflict in Europe, our government deliberately lied about German war aims in order to manufacture the perception that we did, claiming that Hitler had global territorial ambitions, a plan for \\"world domination.\\" Over fifty years later most Americans still accept the lies.The predictable result of the Allied victory and the German defeat was Stalin's occupation of half of Europe. A war that ostensibly began to restore Polish sovereignty ended with Poland, along with the rest of Eastern Europe, being handed over to the Communists. And in quite concrete terms no American would have died in Vietnam if Hitler had destroyed Soviet Communism, arguably the central objective of his political career; American soldiers fought in Europe so that their sons could die in Southeast Asia.None of this should be the least controversial. It is a symptom of the effect of persistent propaganda that so many of us fail to notice the obvious.It is only a slight exaggeration to say that multiracialism itself, along with our servile deference to Jewry, is founded on the mythical image of Hitler as evil incarnate, Satan's secular counterpart in modern history. Remove the false, childishly simplistic Hitler myth, and a significant ideological justification for multiracialism would collapse. The simple question, \\"Were Hitler and NS Germany really as evil as everyone says?,\\" therefore has huge repercussions, and an entire machinery of propaganda--ranging from Hollywood films and \\"Holocaust education\\" in the public schools to off-hand comments in the controlled media (\\"better in the original German\\")--has been designed to discourage anyone from even contemplating the obvious but heretical answer.National SocialismHitler defined his own national socialism as a uniquely German movement:The National Socialist doctrine, as I have always proclaimed, is not for export. It was conceived for the German people. (Hitler-Bormann Documents, Feb. 21, 1945)In other words, German National Socialism arose at a specific time in a specific place under the pressure of a unique set of historical circumstances, none of which could ever be precisely replicated elsewhere. In particular, the autocratic F&uuml;hrer state, central to NS Germany, would never be acceptable to Americans; our republican political culture and belief in individual rights are, thankfully, far too strong. Hitler was a dictator and his government authoritarian; Americans prefer their political and civil liberties.Which doesn't mean that NS Germany was a police state. It had in fact fewer policemen per capita, and far fewer secret police, than either modern Germany or the United States, despite the misleading image most of us have of legions of sinister Gestapo agents kicking down doors in the middle of the night.The basic principles of national socialism are, nevertheless, universal: that God (or Nature) has assigned each of us to a racial group and has endowed each group with distinct qualities; that a nation is not simply a geographical concept, a set of lines arbitrarily drawn on a map irrespective of the people living within them, but instead derives (or should derive) its political institutions and national objectives from the character of the people themselves; that a nation organized to preserve a race and develop its distinctive character is therefore \\"natural\\"; that the strength and social cohesion of a nation derives from its sense of a common identity, of which race is the most important determinant; that in addition to our individual rights we have larger social obligations, not only to the present generation of our nation but to its past and future generations as well; that the primary purpose of a nation is not economic, but the preservation and advancement of its people, economics being subordinate to the volkisch (racial/national) objectives that should be a nation's core reason for existing.\\"The [Nation-] State in itself,\\" Hitler wrote, \\"has nothing whatsoever to do with any definite economic concept or a definite economic development. It does not arise from a compact made between contracting parties, within a certain delimited territory, for the purpose of serving economic ends. The State is a community of living beings who have kindred physical and spiritual natures, organized for the purpose of assuring the conservation of their own kind and to help towards fulfilling those ends which Providence has assigned to that particular race or racial branch\\" (Mein Kampf, I, iv).In the generic sense of the term national socialism is (arguably) not inconsistent with democratic institutions, despite Hitler's own view of the matter; its true antonyms are multiracialism and capitalist, one-world globalism. Nor is national socialism inconsistent with an American \\"melting pot\\" view of ethnicity, provided that the various ethnic groups that comprise the nation are sufficiently similar that each can see a common identity and common destiny in the others--that is, insofar as they, despite their ethnic differences, are branches of the same race and can, therefore, be effectively acculturated to a common set of national ideals.I consider Hitler less a model to be followed than an avalanche of propaganda we must dig ourselves out from under. Never in human history has a single man received such sustained vilification, the basic effect and purpose of which has been to inhibit Whites from thinking racially and from acting in their own racial self-interest, as all other racial/ethnic groups do. Learning the truth about Hitler is a liberating experience. By the truth I mean not an idealized counter-myth to the pervasive myth of Hitler as evil incarnate, but the man himself, faults and virtues, strengths and weaknesses. Once you've done it, once you've discovered the real Hitler beneath the lies and distortions that have buried his legacy, you'll be permanently immunized against anti-White propaganda, because you will have seen through the best/worst the System has to offer.(by Irmin)"},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"One word: Genius.

He blamed all of Germany's problems on the Jews- they controlled the banks and the media, had money and didn't spend it, horrible for the economy. Also it was revenge for Germany's embarassment during World War One. The language is foul- kike this, Jew that. They set up concentration camp ghettos- sent into gas chambers and ovens. I think it is a sour taste on 20th century Germany. Thise who survived the Holocaust mostly fled to America. Martin Luther started the Jew bashing in the 1500s when he opened up the door to Protestantism. The Jews tried to reinvent themselves as successful. I think Hitler is a joke.

He clearly teaches the significance, the social necessity of homogenous culture. Mein Kampf is a philosophic tour de force of intellectuality. Hitler was a thinker-a clear thinker. He was an altogether different man from the one portrayed to us by modern media . . . he never suggested the harming of the handicapped, Gypsies or Jews in Mein Kampf, or in any of his writings.

By doing some research on Hilter I have found that this inbreeding probably caused some of his &quot;psychotic&quot; behviour. If I dare to use that strong of a word. No &quot;normal&quot; (what is normal?) person would have the ability to almost kill off an entire race. Mein Kampf is one of those books you only want to read once because you shake your head at the thoughts this evil man had. I couldn't believe that one man could be so evil and want to cause harm to someone whom he has never met. Another theory I heard about why Hitler wanted to kill the Jews was because when his mother was dying it was a Jewish doctor who was treating her.

Putting it on a list of forbidden books in many countries will have the opposite effect of the one law makers wanted.

It's also not very well written and doesn't show any intellectual brilliance of the author. And the third argument to read it is that it's a part of recent world history, weather we like it or not. As far as the translation goes, some people state it's sloppy and bad, well I disagree. In Poland, where I live there is a Polish translation available and this is sloppy and quite unreadable. I was looking for an English translation for quite some time, but none was to be found in Poland and all Amazon branches didn't ship the title abroad. This year however I managed to order from Amazon.com (Amazon.co.uk still doesn't allow international orders) despite it stating on the page that this item can only be shipped to the continental US.

I found that his analyses of military, political, historical, and economic affairs was quite insightful! Not bad for an artist from Linz (beautiful town by the way). Hitler seems to lose rationality and experiences emotional flooding when he discusses the aristocracy, the marxists, and the jews. odd, in that it was the marxists who were supposed to rise up against the aristocracy. karl marx was jewish i believe, so the source of his hatred against the marxists might have been from that angle. it's amazing how all throughout the book, when it asserts a claim, he backs it up with brilliant logic and cites examples to support it. always, that is, except where the jewish people are concerned. there, the flood gates are opened and the ravages of hatred are unleashed. given the level of hatred for marxists expressed in this book, i'm stunned that a brilliant tyrant like stalin would ever have trusted hitler's promise not to invade russia. i had hoped to find more information on the financial sources that supported hitler's rise but it certainly wasn't to be found here. this is heavy reading and, frankly, i don't know if it is because the man was evil or because i approached the book believing that the author might be evil, but, it wasn't easy to read. nevertheless, for anyone who wishes to study history, ww1 or ww2, jewish studies, or political science (and, maybe even psychopathy), this ought to be required reading. Oh, another downside, I felt that the organization was lacking and he rambled."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"This review is for the Menheim translation of Mein Kampf.This a controversial book. Mein Kampf is a hard and boring book. Hitler was a lot of things, but not a good writer, and he is quite terrible at expressing his thoughts in a way that would be understood easily by the reader. Reading Mein Kampf requires a lot of patience.Now on into the content, the book is a combination of an attempted autobiography, a critique to the various events that shaped German history during Hitler's life, and the foundations of Nazism as expressed by Hitler. The book is a great primary source, but its content is controversial - it has been proven at many points to be unreliable, with statements of Hitler's life simply being false. I would suggest reading Mein Kampf with another book analyzing its ideas and validity (Such as The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, which has a great chapter on Hitler's mind, and Mein Kampf). Hitler jumps from one subject to the next with no clear structure whatsoever. The structure and expression improves in the second volume.I don't suggest reading Mein Kampf, simply because of its complexity, its unreliability, and its terrible approach to the reader. Better read an analysis on Mein Kampf, but in the case that you would go for it anyway, the Ralph Manheim edition, (although just like any edition of Mein Kampf, it is not perfect) would be a great choice as it is fairly an accurate translation."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"\\"Mein Kampf\\" is an important historical source and probably should be read as such. If you can get through Hitler's bombastic writing, the sheer volume of the book, and many of its obscure German historical references, it will definitely give you insight toward the internal momentum that lead Germany to wage the second World War.Among other things, \\"Mein Kampf\\" is autobiographical. Hitler describes his childhood, schooling, his war experience and his subsequent \\"struggle\\" in the political upheaval of post-war Germany. While it is interesting to get into the dictator's mind, one should remember that Hitler had an enormous ego and that he wrote this book for public consumption. Many of his self-praising statements are simply false. For example, Hitler claims that he was the top student in his childhood history class and that his application to study in art school was rejected because the faculty felt that his architectural drawing was superior to his painting. These statements and numerous others are false, which is well documented by Alan Bullock, Ian Kershaw, and other biographers of Hitler.Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of \\"Mein Kampf\\" is its literal force. Although Hitler may have distorted some facts about his past, he was scrupulously honest about his future intentions, which included killing the Jews of Europe and colonizing Russia.In fact, \\"Mein Kampf\\" is more a combination of Hitler's self-promotion and a blue print of his future plans that it is an ideological tome. The central aim articulated in \\"Mein Kampf\\" is purifying what Hitler perceived to be the master race and providing it with \\"living space\\". But Hitler never provides a truly revolutionary idea that is comparable to themes found in works such as \\"The Holy Bible\\" or \\"The Communist Manifesto\\". Like Fascism itself, \\"Mein Kampf \\" is more about mood and momentum than the articulation of a compelling new idea.If you are unfamiliar with Hitler's role in modern German history, you may want to read one of his numerous excellent biographies before tackling his own words. For anyone interested in exploring the phenomenon of Nazi Germany and how a despot managed to package himself and his genocidal intentions, \\"Mein Kampf\\" is an indispensable read."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"I have just spent some time reading this book for the first time, and I can only come to the conclusion that most of the reviews of this book are written by people who have not read the book.Hitler makes profoundly accurate indictments of modern internationalism and anti-culture. For anyone who has some understanding of how empty our modern culture is, this book will have a great deal of meaning.The Jewish Question is a rather minor point in this book, and contrary to popular belief you will find no evidence for the Holocaust in Mein Kampf.Overall, this book is not about Racism, but cultural unity. Race is perhaps a part of cultural unity but Hitler does not argue such a point in the way most would think. In this modern era of anti-internationalism known as anti-globalization, you will find in this work the first thorough criticism of the obliteration of group culture both in economics and art.I find Hitler's writing style to be very personal, and genuine. Despite whatever one may think of his conclusions, he writes with a passion that is rare. In the future, this book will be much more appreciated as it was the first articulated reaction to our modern times. One thing is absolutely certain, the path humanity is currently following will ultimately fail. This book is an early attempt to explain why human existence is much more than having food, clothing, and shelter."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Not at all what I expected. I expected a monster spouting hate and ignorance. Instead, I found a very well written autobiography. Hitlers writing style has a lot of flavor to it, and the stories are very intriguing, particularly the ones about his youth and the time he lived in Vienna. What is interesting to me is that he tells his story the way he saw it whether it benefits him or not. He freely admits his faults, as well as his strengths. For example, his sadness at being rejected from art school when, in his mind, he thought he was a very good painter. Or, when he admits his lack of understanding of how labor unions work when confronted by co-workers on a construction site. It is a very interesting book. It is a good study of one particular persons version of sociology."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"While Many people have jumped to criticize this book, either from a literary point of view or an ethical one, my area of intrest and expertise was in the impact and lasting impression of Mein Kampf. While anyone can mention the horrors of Hitler's reign, Mein Kampf gives the reader an insight into how Hitler became so spiteful with the State of Post War Germany. Filled with insightful (and at often times, somewhat accurate in their approach)criticism, Hitler truly struggles against the German sheepherd. He is a warrior living in the land of the weak, and through his passion, guts and most of all...action, he predicts his rise out of the gutter and into the glory of the German Homeland. It's intresting to me to try to figure out where the facts end and the fiction begins...his criticism, based on patriotic love and zeal often reveal his desire to truly bring Germany back to prewar status as a heroic nation....where blood was truly the fuel of war and bravery. Being exposed to other WWII studies including concentration camps and war strategies, I didn't find this book too utterly shocking. While people of the Jewish heritage might feel resentment to this book (they clearly have the right to), try to remember that this book was written BEFORE WWII, and that might be the most remarkable fact of all...that a man could write a book, predict the future and almost singlehandedly acheive it, at the height of political power with millions to serve him. If nothing else could be learned from this book, learn that 1 person has the God given ability to touch the future, whether he be a force for good or evil. Don't admire Adolf Hitler for what he did when he came to power, admire him for being a single man who may have risen higher and impacted more than anyone in this century. With the combustable discourse of the White Hate movement of today, this book serves as a reminder of the energy and drive of a young man whose time in Vienna, sparked the flame that would impact the world."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Part biography, part party manifesto and part propoganda pamphlet, \\"Mein Kampf\\" (\\"My Struggle\\") is three volumes of a work first published in 1925 while the Little Corporal was just that, an obscure agitator serving a brief prison sentence for a failed coup (putsch) in Munich. Manheim's translation of \\"Mein Kampf\\" is perhaps the best one so far. He does an excellent job translating many of the German metaphors into English. Don't feel guilty about buying this book. Having it on your bookshelf doesn't make you a Nazi sympathizer. So go on, buy it, read it and remember that those who ignore history are condemned to repeat it."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"I can't stand it when people post reviews which point out factual errors made by other reviewers, as this is usually done to show off their own knowledge rather than out of any charitable impulse to correct a wrong. That having been said, I have to do just that the two official Amazon reviews of this book posted at the top, one or both by Sunny Delaney, who should have checked the facts before posting them as such.The original July 18, 1925 release of \\"Mein Kampf\\" was not a failure as stated. In point of fact this first printing of 10,000 hardback books sold 9, 473 copies in less than six months, despite a depressed economy and a relatively high price of 12 marks. If the printing had been a failure, Munich publisher Franz Eher would never have ordered a second in 1926. The second edition was in fact a disappointment, sales dropping off sharply in following years, and it was not until the Nazis gained significantly more momentum in Germany years later that additional editions were ordered. However, it is recorded that Hitler gained a substantial, if temporary, income from royalties of his book, and it may have financed or partially financed the 28,000-mark Mercedes-Benz he bought when released from Landsberg prison.I understand that most people cannot even fake objectivity about Hitler as a historical figure because of the things he did and set in motion, but that is not an excuse for getting the facts wrong. \\"Mein Kampf\\" was by no means a runaway success, but neither was it a failure. It neither fulfilled the lofty expectations Hitler had for it nor flopped on its face as so many of his critics (and there were many, even in 1925) hoped. Hitler, as it happened, had no respect for objective truth and bent it to suit his purposes and his whims; in studying his life, career, and beliefs, we have an obligation to do the exact opposite and get the facts straight. There are enough myths, legends, and outright lies about this crucially important figure of modern history told every day without committing any more of them to print."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"This is one of the most incredible books that you could ever read. Almost twenty years before they occurred, the author predicted catastrophic events that killed tens of millions of people. However, he was not psychic, but a man who drove the events that plunged the world into the greatest cataclysm it has ever known. It is amazing to read the book and see how he sets down some of his history and his plans for the future.As you read the book, you wonder why the people who opposed him could not have understood the consequences if he were to rise to power. Certainly, if they realized it, his rise to power would not have been so relatively easy. My personal theory is that everyone is accustomed to hearing politicians spout wild ideas and then be tamed down under the \\"burden of responsibility.\\" Because of this, it was believed that Hitler would follow in the same path. When he was appointed Chancellor, some of the leading Germans thought that they had placed him under control. Therefore, if you examine Hitler's political career from this perspective, he is one of the most unique politicians of all time. He set down a program and he never wavered from implementing it. It is so tragic that the program was so evil, for that kind of achievement could accomplish great things. In fact, had he died in late 1938, he probably would be remembered as the greatest German leader of all time.I first read the book twenty-five years ago and even though it is disjointed, I couldn't put it down. It is a rare occasion when you read history before it happened, but I found myself relating what he was saying in the twenties to what happened after he rose to power in Germany. In that respect, it was very spooky to read. However, I think everyone should read \\"Mein Kampf\\" and realize how serious we should take the statements of politicians, especially when they seem radical."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"This is a interesting yet tough read. It was fascinating to see how Hitler saw the world, its problems and himself. As he laid out the problems his insights were sometimes deep, lucid and fact-filled (though not always for he was a master of leaving out all the facts and twisting them to suit his needs) and then he would mention the word \\"Jew\\" and the rest of the chapter would be full of venom filled hatred with attacks, insinuations and claims that were way beyond reality! Then he would close with his solutions to the items covered in the chapter and this was sometimes very in-depth, always interesting and sometimes put in general terms that you wonder if he knew what he was going to do, or if he was just hiding it from the masses at the time. The chapters are long, so if you read this, give yourself time for each chapter. Much of what Hitler decided to do when he was later in power are indeed covered in this book. Some plans he did not follow, such as never fighting a two front war and his thoughts that Germany could be allied with England in the next war. Mein Kampf is a fascinating look into the mind of Adolf Hitler. But, be prepared, for while it is fascinating and a must read for those who wish to know more about Hitler it is a tough and at times tedious read because of his writing style and his rants about the Jewish, the Slavs and others he desired a \\"sub-humans\\". If you want a glimpse into the mind of this insane, power hungry, ruthless dictator then read this book. But, give yourself time!"},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Let's face it, Hitler is not the best writter a man can be. His writtings are, in some way, unorganized, almost as if it were a dairy. However, deep into the jungle of words, you can find a treasure of content and information about Nazism that only Hitler can give. This book is long and sometimes get boring, but there are some sections that really make you understand the feelings and perceptions of Der F&uuml;hrer. This book is a piece of gold for researchers, students or anyone who really wants to dig into the roots of the Nazi leader. He tells the story from the very beginning of his life as politician, and even gets more into the past when he was a condecorated soldier. Although it won't give you the answer of why he did what he did, this will give you a very good inside look of the political system Hitler established on Germany for more than 10 years. If you dispise anti-semitism hardly, beware, since this book has too much pages insulting and telling how &quot;threatening&quot; Jews are."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"I've given \\"Mein Kampf\\" 5 stars based on its historical importance, not on its literary or organizational quality. As a literary effort, the book is a disaster. It is an absolute whirlwind of ideas, observations and prejudices. Hitler repeats himself time and again and rarely follows an idea to its conclusion. Hitler would have done well to have employed a first-class editor but, given his ego, this was not a possibility. Perhaps it is even more remarkable that this thing became the Bible of the Third Reich and was actually given as a wedding present to all newly married German couples. I have little doubt that some of Hitler's true believers must have recognized the book's defects but were afraid to make any real criticism. This, in fact, is one of the real problems with leadership--dictatorships in particular. The leader almost automatically is insulated by a thick layer of 'yes-men' afraid to speak the truth. A fairly recent and egregious example of this was Sadam Hussein's inability to recognize that he was staring down the twin barrels of an American shotgun about to blow his head off. His numerous syncophants were too terrified of Hussein's lethal anger to speak the truth.Even so, the book is of value to the insightful historian. Hitler, in his own words, tells of the forces that shaped his belief system. To be certain, he frequently lies, perhaps to himself as well as the reader but even lies can lead to the truth. Antisemitism is not the main emphasis of this work but it's there. He claims, disingenuously I'm sure, that he never even heard the word 'Jew' while living at home i.e. that his anti-Jewish opinions were the product of personal observations of Vienna Jews. Then he turns around and cites the 'Protocols of the Elders of Zion' as proof of Jewish malignancy. He hints darkly that the 'Jews will get theirs' but doesn't elaborate.Much of 'Mein Kamp' is a bitter diatribe against the extinct Austria-Hungary. His hatred--and Hitler has a lot of hatred--is partly because the A-H Empire sucked Germany into WWI but also because the Empire had become a polyglot of peoples [make that slavs] many of whom had positions in the Austro-Hungarian Parliament. Young Hitler, starving in Vienna and with time on his hands, seems to have spent a significant amount of time observing the parliamentary wrangling which he likens to something like the cacophony at the Tower of Babel. He describes how his observations pushed him towards anti-democratic beliefs.He makes a fairly insightful statement. He writes that in parliamentary democracy there is no one to take real responsibility. If things go right, everyone takes the credit. If things go wrong everyone points to members of the opposite party. How much better, he writes portentuously, that one man take responsibility, a person who is big enough to take both the credit and blame. Of course, this is precisely what Hitler eventually did.He pats himself on the back many times. He hates the Communists but not individual German Communists who he sees as men, much like himself, who are aimless, post war wanderers looking for solutions. He cites a number of cases in which Communist goons enter his beer hall meetings in order to heckle and break things up. He claims that these same goons walk away convinced Nazis.Is it true? Maybe. Communists appealed to 'true believers' as did the Nazis. As Erich Hofer writes in his 'True Believer', it is not possible to convince a true believer but you can convert him. Hitler was a powerful and charasmatic speaker and no doubt appealed to true believers--even Communists--seeking for answers. I've even heard the testimonies of two Jewish men who were prevailed on to attend a Hitler speech. Both testify as to the power of the event and how, before the speech was over, they too felt a need to 'do something about the Jews.'Hitler writes that one of Germany's greatest blunders in WWI was to fight a two front war. Of course, Germany had little alternative because Russia and the Western Entente declared war on Germany almost simultaneously. We, in reading Hitler's book have knowledge how he actually performed when he came into power. Early on, most of his moves were fairly reasoned and were, of course, extremely lucky. He was able to make a treaty with Soviet Russia and the West backed down time and again. It started to come apart when he invaded Poland but again--and against the advice of his generals--he proved incredibly successful against the Poles and then the French.He was stymied by the English...but...if he had continued to exert full force against the English he might very well have proved successful in driving England out of the War. He did something both remarkable and inexplicable. He invaded his erstwhile partner, Soviet Russia--leaving the fighting English on his flank. In doing so he directly contravened his own military advisors and, more particularly, his own advice in 'Mein Kampf'. Why?For what it's worth, I'll offer several possibilities. Following his own star, Hitler had proven ridiculously successful even in the face of detractors. He may have believed that he was fated to achieve victory...no matter what. Another explanation is that Hitler really didn't want to destroy England. He reckoned that they were fellow Aryans and would sooner-or-later partner with him. They were, in his opinion, neutralized by his occupation of Europe and U-boats. On the other hand, this would have been a truly stupid conclusion. The English had battled valiantly and showed every sign that they would fight on.My own suspicion is that Hitler, who was probably bipolar, was starting to feel the effects of his physician's daily amphetamine injections. Hitler became, quite simulataneously, increasingly grandiose and paranoid. He thought he could fly over tall buildings. He couldn't miss. Proof? His subsequent personal and military behaviour. Time and again he made increasingly stupid military decisions. Some of the more remarkable were his orders to Rommel, defeated in North Africa, and von Paulus, surrounded at Stalingrad, not to retreat. Rommel disobeyed orders and his army lived to fight another day. Von Paulus followed orders and lost an army of 340,000 men. Another is at Kursk, the largest battle in world history. Hitler and his staff had evidence that the battle plan was compromised but went for it anyway and lost big.Another is the D-Day invasion. Hitler's staffers, terrified of his towering anger, didn't wake him up to tell him the truth. The Battle of the Bulge is another. The war was all but over but he organized his scant reserves--forces that could have been better used to slow the advancing Russians--to try to force something like a major victory against the Western Allies. Again Hitler only managed to hasten his end.Ron"},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"I am in the process of reading Mein Kampf and am nearing the end. I have found that the book is useful for the purposes of understanding Adolf Hitler as a person. I have also found out by reading the book that Adolf Hitler was not a hypocrit, and nearly all ramblings on did come to light.In addition, I felt that the most interesting thing about the book was that Hitler knew that in order to have a National Socialist State he needed to introduce his policies to every person by making them first nature to all Germans and so that they, particularly younger people, would know little different. In effect, it would be the uniting foundation to their existence, all sharing and striving for one ideal over personal greed. These are just the hollow ideas, not the reality as it turned out."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"When reading this book it is important to keep a perspective about the times in which it was writen. I enjoyed the book even though some of it got repetitious. Hitler goes from being viewed as an out-of-work down-on his luck Bum, to a dedicated soldier, to a crazy mastermind and a compulsive Manic-Depressive. It's real easy to get inside of his head as he pretty much writes whatever seems to come into his mind at the time. I read it at the same time as two other books in order to give me an historic perspective. It is important to know your history to fully enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"This book may not be a great literary peace of art but it's a good token for history. In the book Hitler does call Jews, Commusist, Catholics, etc. bad names and says bad things about them; but in Mark Twain's book &quot;Huck Finn&quot; don't blacks get bad titles? So if your not going to read the book for that reason it's a bad choice! Don't get me wrong I'm not a Nazis actually I'm a Roman Catholic and I still read the book and thought it was good for history reasons. Only one thing he does ramble alot and you must be willing to suffer through it. It does show one of the most intelligent minds with the most bad intentions&gt;"},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"From my point of view this is probably one of the most important books written. This is one of those books that changes history. Yes, this means I completely disagree with what Hitler said about books. He mentioned that books don't change history, but a good speaker/leader does. While this is very true, books usually exist in conjunction with this. I think you need both because the book is far more timeless than the speaker and often times a book precedes a major turning point for a movement. Look at texts like \\"The Bible\\", \\"The Principia,\\" or Euclid's \\"The Thirteen Elements\\". All these texts were turning points in history and changed the way we look at the world. \\"Mein Kampf\\" would forever change the way we looked at the world as well. It literally moved nations to act... in opposition of such a major power struggle.I do not advocate Hitler's methodology in what he did, but I do acknowledge the profound impact it has left on the world and the major advancements we were all forced to make in realms such as technology. Now that this book is part of history you can't help but think of the \\"what if...\\" scenarios as I read through this massive text, I'll play into these concepts as I touch upon specific areas. Now I'm not a World War II or World War I historian by any means, so it was a hard book for me to read some of the more minute details Hitler referenced in this book. However, I read it more for the prospects in philosophy.This particular edition is split into two different volumes with an excellent introduction by the translator. Volume I was printed in 1925 and then Volume II came out in the year 1926, so they were written very close together. The first was mostly philosophical and recounts his childhood growing up. The second was more a general history of the political party and how to deal with foreign nations. It's interesting that Hitler didn't put out any other books after these two and I assume it's because his involvement in politics took up much more of his time and no longer had the free time to write. However, they did find another book he was working on after the fall of the Reich and is now published as \\"Hitler's Second Book\\". This edition is great because it compared the first printing with the second printing and footnotes the discrepancies. It also adds in details on the people Hitler named specifically in this book who would be relatively unknown to the rest of the world outside Nazi Germany and especially helpful to me because I haven't read that much about this period in history to know the extreme details. In Volume's I and II Hitler specifically references incidents in World War I that really helped shape the beliefs he has here.Anyway the introduction that prefaces this edition is rather lengthy, but well worth the read. It adds more of the historical background into the text you are about to dig into. It has interesting anecdotes about Hitler's involvement with the party, like in the text he states he was the seventh member of the DAP, but later it was found out he was 555th and this was corroborated with an unsent letter from Drexler, one of the founders. In fact when historian's looked at the membership items that were left behind after the war they could see that Hitler's had been altered physically. Also the introduction has an excellent overview of the printing of this book. Such as how it is not allowed to be printed in certain countries. Luckily in my country no such restrictions apply to any printed document, so I am free to read and review whatever I wish, regardless of how inaccurate a printed document is. I'm definitely glad there was an introduction even though it added another twenty pages onto an already daunting read. The introduction also forewarns us that Hitler can have a tendency to ramble in forms that eventually make little sense. I'm glad this warning was stated because when reading this book it was quite clear when Hitler felt particularly passionate about the subject he started to go off on these ridiculous tangents and tirades, often times in run on sentence form.In the spirit of this book, I will review Volume I separately from Volume II. So first we discuss Hitler's philosophy and growing up. Personally, I think Hitler should have stuck with the philosophical approach and left politics to the politicians (regardless of the fact this didn't mesh with his philosophy). Hitler's main point in doing the things he believed in was to change society for the better. It's very clear that he truly thought he would be saving the world and putting Germany in the forefront of being that savior. Hitler's conclusion was that it would most easily be changed through moving into the political realm. He specifically outlined his plan for getting access to the political realm and the backing of the people through propaganda. He even spells out that the propaganda doesn't always have to be true; it just needs to draw a person's attention. Realistically, when we look back on what he was planning on doing and how he did it, none of the world should have been shocked that this is what would happen. He pretty clearly outlines where his prejudices are and why he has them.Hitler starts his story as a young boy growing up and becoming disillusioned with the world around him. His father wouldn't let him do what he really wanted to do, which was art. He doesn't seem like the over confident Hitler that history portrays today. In fact I would say the movie \\"Max\\" starring Noah Taylor as Hitler did a pretty good portrayal of that possibility, only that movie was not about Hitler in his High School years, so it was a little unrealistic. When World War I started Hitler joined the military and I think this is where his confidence in himself really started to take root. This is also where he became convinced that propaganda was the key to winning the war because upon viewing the enemy's propaganda it was better than what Germany was putting out. It would appear his assumption was correct; since via propaganda he got many crowds gathered to listen to him speak.Probably the most well known facet of his beliefs is the anti-Semitism that brought on the Holocaust. He eventually ended up in Vienna and I think this is where his prejudice became firm. You can see where his theory turns into some sort of paranoid dementia, because before you knew it he was calling everyone on the street a Jew in disgust. This was mostly based on looking at the person and guessing. He believed they had penetrated the newspaper industry and were completely lying to everyone in the world. As Volume I continues you find that eventually this belief grows into him thinking that they also controlled the governments. I think a lot of this stemmed from one other text, which he mentions in this book \\"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.\\" This is a hoax that has existed for a while and first started getting published in 1897. I believe the global conspiracy outlined in that book only solidified what Hitler suspected with his newspaper theory. I was surprised that Hitler had originally wanted to start out as an artist and actually held a few gallery viewings of his work. I wonder at this point if there is any Hitler original art around. If I remember correctly I heard actually wasn't a very good artist. It's interesting to note that as Hitler continues with his tirades I this book, you can tell he has a special soft spot for art because he wants more of that industries presence in Germany.Overall I was surprised at how little anti-Semitism there was in the book in comparison to the length of the text. I was actually expecting a lot more. Don't mistake me, he took jabs wherever he possibly could and there was an entire chapter dedicated to the subject. However, I felt like in the first volume he spent more time criticizing the Slavs and the Austrians as being a much more immediate problem. It's almost as if the first and foremost problem was his own government and Austria; the issue of the Jewish population was a more of a global problem and probably seemed to be less immediate. You get a wholly different feel by the time we reach Volume II though.I was also very surprised at the countries he referenced as being respectable, specifically England and America. He must have been greatly disappointed in England when they refused to side with him during World War II and he must have felt doubly wrong about his initial assessment of America when we funded a lot of his enemies. Being an American I found some of his comments curious since it seems he felt we had a dominant German aspect of our country. I found this odd since it was essentially founded by England and France mostly. I couldn't help but think that Hitler was misinterpreting his history or the books he was reading were just plain wrong.For the most part Hitler is a pretty good writer. I found that he appears very intelligent and very well read, also very arrogant. He has sections that discuss the part of his life where he was looking into the political arena and when he came across the German Workers' Party. He doesn't hesitate to point out how superior his ideas were or how much better things worked when done his way. From the point of view of a leader, this seems counter to what you would want. Since his ability to elevate his own status seems to be his main underlying motive rather than helping his people, despite what he actually says. There is one instance when he was recounting the first speeches given for the party and how the first speaker was rather boring, but when he spoke the crowd became excited and into the words, they stood up and cheered even. History recounts Hitler as a very excellent speaker and I have no doubt this is true, but it's curious to see that he puts himself over his own party members constantly in this book. There were also sections where he got very passionate about a topic that became very confusing, as I explained above. I don't think this speaks to his inability to write, but rather his inability to write clearly when he is really trying to get his point across on a topic he believes as a core problem.Either way you looked at it, I couldn't help but think by the end of Volume I that Hitler would have been one of the world's most celebrated leaders if he had just put his prejudice aside. This was the case... at least until I read Volume II. Through Volume I he seems to genuinely want to help his people and the world around him. The one major crux in his argument is that he believed in some overly prejudice driven conspiracy. I think Hitler really had to start struggling in the end when it was becoming even clearer that the Jews weren't as well off in Germany as he believed they were, especially during the great depression. I was surprised at his focus on helping the middle class and a seemingly focal point on intelligence and action. It appeared his main push to change the nation was centered on elevating the knowledge of the German peoples as well as moving them to the desire for action to help their nation. I think this is a great point and he's most certainly not wrong about it being needed. However, my interpretation of this concept would be dashed by Volume II...Volume II made it incredibly clear to me that Hitler had no place in becoming a leader and especially no place on deciding education reform. Shortly into Volume II he has a lengthy chapter on what he plans to do with education to bolster a more national spirit for young Germans and to create what he refers to as a \\"folkish state\\". The concept of the \\"folkish state\\" is discussed in great length throughout Volume II and seems to be the main focus. One of the first things he was going to do was decrease the amount of time in classrooms and increase the amount of time for exercise. Following this he would decrease the amount of subjects being taught in school. This completely conflicts with his desire for an intelligent Germany, and he also discusses at length how the intelligentsia of the area are all weaklings and spineless. He notes that many students learn quite a bit of frivolous subjects in High School, which is true, but I personally believe that being a well rounded student is far better. I do agree that people need more exercise, this is painfully clear to me living in America, but to sacrifice the access to knowledge is not a viable solution! He complains at length that too many people complain about certain political actions, but being spineless professors they never actually do anything about it. Hitler sought to change this and part of this included that right after High School the population (men) would go directly into the military. Hitler being a Veteran clearly thought his experience taught him strength, so he thought that what was good for him would be good for everyone else. If only such things were true, this is clearly something that cannot be put into practice. A lot of these crazy ideas may have seemed plausible on paper, but realistically they are a fool's errand... an errand Hitler was intent on running! After a citizens completion of Army service they were then allowed into the community to pursue whatever higher level career they saw fit to pursue. His purpose in High School was to expose the students to enough generalities for them to make a choice, which is a good idea, but his plan of execution was fairly far fetched and unrealistic. Personally, in 2008, I don't think High Schools are teaching students enough to prepare them for college or to perform in the working world. So it would seem less education on academics is not the answer, but the world really does need to find some kind of a balance on this subject, even Hitler recognized that and he lived in a vastly different era from our own.Volume II also takes a drastic turn in terms of anti-Semitism and his foreign relations outlook. England seems to have been demoted into a nation that they could possibly not ally with due to the financial control of the Jewish empire. The United States was also seen as a victim of this disease, but his knowledge of American finance seems to have been quite limited. Granted there were some major firms in the U.S. that were founded by German Jews, namely Goldman Sachs, but what about firms like J.P. Morgan? In terms of the major American firms there was a balance and in the 1930's Goldman Sachs nearly went out of business in the Great Depression, so clearly this racial favoring of economic power was quite unfounded. I think Hitler spoke on these foreign nations rather out of turn because it was pretty clear he didn't know all that much about the nations and had gotten all of his knowledge from books, which may have been biased. For he terms Ford as one of the only free American business men, but in the second printing he no longer names Ford specifically, I felt this was curious. This was a drastic change from my perspective after reading Volume I, where he praised America. So even within his own book he is very contradictory. Also the focal point of being against the Slavs and Austrians has been replaced by Germany's mortal enemy... France. This sort of came out of nowhere, since in Volume I they were not \\"mortal enemies\\" just the regular kind. Hitler must have read a lot more on the subject and decided the French were far worse than they once appeared. I find all this curious because he prefaces Volume II, with saying that it's going to be about the party history and formation. The above topics have nothing to do with the party history or its formation, rather Hitler's own pet peeves about the problems that he saw after World War I.Most of this Volume is spent complaining about current (1920's) Bourgeoisie decision making and discussing what Hitler plans to do to fix that. I personally wasn't buying it, but then again, his book is so long that I doubt many of the general workers ever actually read what he wrote. He did spell out in Volume I that he was essentially going to dupe the masses into following him by creating the best propaganda to get people to go to the meetings. At that point he probably understood the concept of mob madness and let that do the rest for him. He recounts his early involvement with the party as becoming the head of propaganda, which is what he wanted because he believed propaganda, first and foremost, was the fulcrum to a party's success. Hitler even points out that it doesn't matter if the party is well organized at that time if the propaganda doesn't bring the masses in, they will have nothing to organize in the first place. He also discusses at length the rarity of a man who can organize and lead well; I couldn't help but feel that he thought himself to be such a man. He was a brilliant strategist and acutely aware of the power of the threat of violence on the general populace, especially after a major war that was still fresh in peoples memories. One of his main points was that he believed that it didn't matter what the people knew as long as an intelligent leader was looking out for them, and it's clear he believed that he was the person that could truly help the most and should be leader. This is regardless of the violence he would have to inflict; besides he only wanted strong people to be German anyway, so a show of strength went a long way with him.It's interesting to also note that he clearly wanted to rewrite some of the annals of history to favor the German people. In his long winded explanation of the Folkish State he points out that he believes the Aryan's are the only ones who could ever develop culture. No, he wasn't referring to the peoples belonging to the nation of India, but rather the Germanic peoples. See, the term Aryan comes from India, and I have no idea if Hitler knew this or not, but that's its origin. Indians clearly wouldn't have been high on his list, and certainly didn't qualify as those being able to create culture despite their history of creating that vast nation. Rather, it appears the legend and concept of the Aryan survived and came down to Hitler as the superior race. For some reason he equated that with the Germanic peoples. His whole concept of the white population being the only force intelligent enough to create culture is clearly unfounded. He gets even more contradictory in this concept since he was well aware that Germany was vastly tribal up until the Roman invasions. He states the reason was that \\"we were a young people\\". This is just foolishness because it was trade in technology that eventually brought what we call \\"civilization\\" today to the Germanic tribes. It has nothing to do with them being the only creative force in the world. He completely ignores the fact that Egypt existed long before as a civilization. I question whether he knew of the Arab city-states of Sumer, but it doesn't explain Egypt. I think Hitler merely viewed them as \\"uncivilized\\" or \\"not a cultured\\" or whatever other twisted elaboration he wanted to thrust upon them. Either way, he does not explain his reasoning in detail, and just states matter of factly that only Aryans harbor the creative force to develop culture and no one else.Overall I walked away with reading a superb book, in my opinion. At times it was very hard to read and I will be the first to admit that not everyone will struggle through this thing. There are too many sections of rambling that don't drive home the main points. It all sounds very smart at first glance, but when you sit down and analyze what he's saying inherent contradictions come to the surface. Then it occurs to the reader that most of his language use is merely superfluous for the sake of sounding intelligent (much like this sentence). No one wants an incredibly inconsistent leader (however, I feel like that's all we get at times!). Despite the racial hatred, I am glad I read this book, it gives me a great historical perspective and I now understand where Hitler was coming from. On a philosophical note, it really makes me think of the concept of evil and how that plays into perspectives. From Hitler's perspective he thought he was saving his people. He thought he was actually saving the world from the greatest threat and he really thought the other nations would see the truth that he saw and back him up. Alas, for Hitler he was chasing after rumors and ghosts that didn't actually exist.In reading this I also couldn't help but wonder about what the world is like today. Lots of \\"what if\\" questions come to mind. Despite the incredible tragedy that Hitler wrought on so many lives, it was really the need to ramp up production of war elements that brought the world out of the great depression. So Hitler really did end up helping the world in this sense by provoking everyone to action. He also motivated the world to increase production and research into massive amounts of technology. Atomic energy might not have come to us as soon as it has without this provocation. I can't deny this factor. Also, I have to look at the historical perspective that the country I now reside in is the major world power because of Hitler's actions against Europe! Many people will probably consider these horrible thoughts, but I can't deny the reality of the situation and it leaves me to wonder that if Hitler had become the artist he always wanted to be, would we be in the same situation? Would Israel exist today if he never came to power? After World War II the Cold War went quickly into effect and I wonder if I would even have the internet to relay my ideas if World War II had never taken place, since that also forced us to ramp up production and research in technology. As a philosophical perspective these are all very profound concepts and questions. Despite all the horror that was wrought in the war, if you step back with the utilitarian perspective of Mills and look at all that has come out of the war that has elevated our lives and the economy as a whole.On the reverse side, what if Hitler had actually succeeded in what he wanted to do? Israel surely wouldn't exist today. Would Christianity be the same? Since he seemed to respect Christianity and he was surely no atheist, so would his disdain for the Jewish people provoke him to edit the Bible down to just the New Testament? I've already said before that he clearly sought to rewrite history and I don't think anything would be out of his grasp. I do know one thing for sure though, I wouldn't have been able to read all the books I have under a reign like that, and I most surely would not have been able to criticize this book as I have in such a society. Thankfully his party was not in power for a long time, but apparently long enough to change the world."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"I state the reason for my rating because, while this is the idealogy of an evil man, objectively it is an extremely important historical document that cannot be overlooked.It is important to realize that from the outside looking in, the results of certain philosophies are so terrible that we often refuse to examine them beyond the death and destruction.The truth is, however, that there is a thought process in bigotry, eugenics, etc. Though it is indeed logically flawed, it is still an ethical duty for all to look at the literature and philosophies that result in a very human evil."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"If you are one of those people who are looking to further understand history by reading literature, then you will probably want to read Mein Kampf. In this book, you will find the ideologies and personality that led Adolf Hitler to take the course that he did.

Keep in mind, however, that this book must be read with an open mind that wishes to learn more about this aspect of history.Mein Kampf was not written for you to sit down and read for enjoyment, and it should not be taken that way.

There is no denying that he along with the Nazi party killed many million Jews and other groups but to judge him as an intellectual squarly on his actions is harsh. If one reads this book and takes the time to let it sink in, he or she will soon realize that this man was extremely intellectual. He was not evil, possesed by the devil, or satanic in anyway but just wanted better. It is said in this book that all he wants is a better life for the people of his race. Although he took this to an extreme in killing other races, he had a good idea. He just wanted a prospering community without hunger or violence. Wrongly, Hitler chose to make his dream by denying basic human rights to others. I am not a Nazi nor do I glorify Hitler in any way, but if one truly takes the time to listen, he or she might learn the other side of the one-sided story taught to us in school."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"When we think of Hitler today, it is hard not to see him as the man who led a nation to the brink of globe-spanning power and demographic revolution.

By all means, read this book if you are interested in the modern history of Europe, but understand that this is not the work of a man who knew much about what he attempts to describe. Influenced not by reason and truth, but by absurd racial philosophy, Mein Kampf is terrifyingly devoid of clarity.

Now that I have finished, I'll never inflict this reading on my students. This is easily the most tedious, boring book I have ever read. I think that is partly why Hitler was able to get away with basically spelling out his plans years before he came to power, and people were still surprised when he did exactly what he said he would do. Also no one took him seriously, and were horrified when they found he actually believed all this drivel he wrote.Still, it is a very important book historically, because it announced his plans 15 years before he carried them out. World leaders who wondered what Hitler was about had only to pick up Mein Kampf. As I read this book, I noted the most glaring cases of anti-Jewish remarks, as well as Hitler's views on the rest of the world. Often, the two subjects are intertwined. The quotes you read below are just some of the worst examples; this book is packed with countless other lies against the Jews and other nations.GERMANY VS THE WORLD:P.134, \\"Unused soil exists for people with force to take it.\\"P.138, \\"Don't let political boundaries obscure the boundaries of eternal justice.\\" (Borders of other nations)P.139, \\"What (land) is refused by amicable methods, it is up to the fist to take.\\"P.255, \\"No half-measures; gravest/most ruthless decisions to be made.\\"P.398, \\"Victory lies eternally and exclusively in attack.\\"P.455, \\"Terror is only broken by equal terror.\\"P.610, \\"The aim of a German foreign policy of today must be the preparation for the reconquest of freedom for tomorrow.\\"P.611, \\"For the oppressed territories are led back to the bosom of a common reich, not by flaming protests, but by a mighty sword.\\"P.651, \\"The boundaries of 1914 mean nothing at all for the German future.\\"P.651, \\"Only childish & naive minds think to correct Versailles by wheedling and begging.\\"P.652, \\"We National Socialists must hold unflinchingly to our aim in foreign policy, namely, to secure for the German people the land & soil to which they are entitled on this Earth.\\"P.654, \\"Germany will either be a world power or there will be no Germany.\\"P.654, \\"If we speak of soil in Europe today, we have in mind only Russia and her border states.\\"P.660, \\"Let no one argue that in concluding an alliance with Russia we need not immediately think of war; an alliance whose aim does not embrace a plan for war is senseless and useless.\\"P.688, (conclusion) \\"A state which in this age of racial poisoning dedicates itself to the care of its best racial elements must someday become Lord of the Earth.\\"HITLER'S VIEWS OF THE PEOPLE:P.107, \\"Broad masses can only be moved by power of speech.\\"P.341, Calls voters \\"Bourgeois voting cattle.\\"P.375, Refers to \\"Unshakable stupidity of the voting citizenry.\\"P.465, \\"The NSDAP should not be the servant of the masses, but their master.\\"P.577, \\"National Socialism must lay claim to the right to force its principles on the whole German nation.\\"P.608, Calls people \\"Great stupid sheep's herd of patient lamb-like people.\\"P.654, Refers to African nations as \\"Little ni***r nations.\\"P.659, Openly says he appraises value of men on racial basis.ANTI-JEWISH REMARKSP.169, Refers to Jews as \\"Poisoners of people.\\"P.206, \\"There is no making pacts with the Jews.\\"P.232, Refers to Jews as \\"Great masters of the lie.\\"P.244, Says Jews control the press.P.246, \\"A 30cm shell hisses louder than a thousand Jewish newspaper vipers, so let them hiss.\\"P.255, \\"Clear away filth of civilization, ignoring screams.\\"P.272, \\"Jews in the press promoted lies about Germany in WWI.\\"P.308, \\"Once this book (Mein Kampf) is common property of the people, the Jewish menace may be considered broken.\\"P.324, \\"The personification of the devil as the symbol of all evil assumes the living shape of the Jew.\\"P.351, \\"The Jew is the great master in lying, and lies & deceit are his weapons in struggle.\\"P.453, \\"The first task is the elimination of the existing Jewish state.\\"P.556, Accuses Jews of manipulating Northern & Southern Germans against each other in WWI.P.561, First uses the term \\"Jewish question.\\"P.638, Refers to \\"Jewish plot to rule the world.\\"P.651, \\"It is the inexorable Jew who struggles for domination over nations; no nation can remove this hand from its throat except by the sword, and such a process is and remains a bloody one.\\"P.661,\\"(The Jew) goes his way, sneaking in among the nations from within; he fights with lies and slander, intensifying the struggle to the point of bloodily exterminating his hated foes.\\"P.662, Says Jews are from Satan.P.679, \\"If at the beginning of the war (WWI) or during the war 12,000 or 15,000 of these Hebrew corruptors of the people had been held under poison gas, the sacrifice of millions at the front would not have been in vain.\\"By now it should be crystal clear how evil this man was, and this book is. This book was dictated while Hitler was in prison in 1924, and published soon after. It would be nearly a decade before he gained power. You have to wonder why his opponents and other world leaders who read this book at the time did not take it more seriously, especially in the late 1930's leading up to war. It's all laid out here; his determination to dominate Europe, to ally with Russia and then betray her, his contempt for the common citizen, his lust to tear up the Versailles treaty, and his unending hatred of the Jews. He openly hints at his desire to destroy the Jewish people many times. These views are mixed in with endless, incomprehensible rambling that will put you to sleep faster than Nyquil. Still, we only have to read it; Hitler was notorious for putting his own generals to sleep with his hours-long tirades.In any case, at the end of the book I was left with a feeling of disbelief that the rest of the world had not seen it coming, with this material available for anyone to read. I know that hindsight is 20/20, but hopefully the next time we are confronted with this kind of insanity, we'll be a little more quick to recognize it."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Great book!!!!!!Lots of great information about how the media works.......also the real story of Nazism and Pan-Germanism"},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Mein Kamph although long winded, a tremendous insight into how an individual can through being a failure apportion blame and hit out at minorities in order to further a cause by appealing to the lowest common denominator.

The yard stick that is required to understand this document is unconventional. With that being said, Hitler lays out his whole plan in one work and shadows future dark events in Europe and the world from 1933 as Chancellor of Germany to 1945 as Fuhrer of Germany. Please keep in mind that this is the recipe book that all the world strongest powers such as Germany, England, France, Italy, Russia, United States and Japan would participate and conduct history that would change world and cultural history forever. Hitler shines a little light to us into his childhood as an early youth in Austria and progresses to show and tell us why the German nation shall rule the world. From a literary sense, Adolf Hitler does a deplorable job. Looking at it from the standpoint of trying to convince a broken German society and concoct bigotry doctrine and propaganda, he excels in. This work that should be taught in universities all around world as a sole class to breakdown the true essence of Hitler, postwar World War I Germany and World War II. I will say that this book isn't for the faint of heart, and it's the type of reading that requires frequent breaks to digest the material. This is a message of bigotry and hatred and there's no way you cut it to make any sense. After reading this book, explains why the modern western world is the way it is and changes you as an educated reader and as a person.

Eighty-six years ago. It remains just as relevant today, remaining one of the most universally-known books in history. Everyone knows the name of three books- the dictionary, the Holy Bible, and Mein Kampf.I should add, before proceeding further, that this is so far the best version of \\"Mein Kampf\\" I've yet found. Originally translated and published in 1943, my copy was printed in 1975 if I recall right. It has a foreword and some footnotes that probably wouldn't have existed had the Reich won World War II, but what matters most is that the translation is excellent. And at times, the original German is even provided and compared with the way it was translated into English.What makes \\"Mein Kampf\\" so significant is not so much the book by itself- unusual as it is- but rather the man, and the deeds of the man, who wrote it. This book either details outright or strongly implies the plans and intentions of Adolf Hitler. Having read it, was I that surprised that he went on to invade nearly every country in Europe and engage in the genocide of millions of people? No, not really. That's what makes this book so important. Whatever it is or isn't worth as a work of literature, it is the story of one of the most powerful men in history. It's also 715 pages long, so don't expect it to be short.As a work of literature, \\"Mein Kampf\\" is like no other book I've ever read. In fact, there is only one collection of written words that has struck me as being at all similar: the journal of Eric David Harris. Both their writings were, to me, a bit like a burnt cookie- always limited by that hate pulsing within the pages. Nobody paid attention to Adolf Hitler, or Eric Harris, until the opportune moment to stop them had passed. Hitler published his plans in this book for all the world to see, and Harris kept his plans in a journal, right there in his room. My point? Read the writings of people like them, because ignoring them has a long record of being a spectacularly stupid mistake."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"For people who are interested in the pure translation without any frills, this is probably the book.

He doesn't come right out and specify these particular countries, but anyone who knows their history will know exactly what he is talking about. Further along in the book, in the chapter titled &quot;Nation and Race,&quot; he tells us that the Holocaust is going to happen. If you look up reviews of _Mein Kampf_ written when the book was first published in English, you will see that the readers at that time thought Hitler was just some crackpot who didn't need to be taken seriously.

Oh yes: if you get past that stuff, you'll be able to see Mein Kampf for what it really is: the world's most influential Self-Help manual.Who needs Dale Carnegie & all that \\"Smile 'til your Gums Bleed!\\" crap when you've got Adolf Hitler: Carnegie wants you to wag your tail & get another friend, Hitler wants you to wag your fist in your enemy's face & slice off another rump puppet state.Let's take a little mental inventory of Adolf Hitler, circa 1923: starving, failed artist, no money to pay the rent, wandered around ranting and drinking all day in beerhalls, and worst of all, stuck in the Munich pokey after he and the boys got knocked around by the local hoo-haw after a wild night gomezing around on the town and a few too many Heffeweisen.And yet this guy, not even a decade later, is not only shooting hoops and slam dunks but kicking everybody's [EXPLETIVE!] around the court. Around about 1941, Hitler doesn't have any time left to kick [EXPLETIVE!] & take names. Why? Because he's too busy kicking [NAUGHTY!] to take names.With that in mind, let's break this little masterwork of Teutonic Take-no-Prisoners Motivation down by the numbers & see what Mein Kampf can do for you---today!1) Give in to your Anger! Your Hate will make you Strong! Whether it's building a battle station that can destroy a planet in a single blast or emptying the Eastern Marches of Bolshevik Scum, get in touch with your Inner Monster & give that bad boy a ticket to ride!2) It's all about Marketing! Coco Chanel knew it! Tommy Hilfiger knew it! Idi Amin knew it!---Marketing Matters! Hitler proved it. Schwag matters. Gift boxes matter! Little corporate doohickeys with your logo & slogan on it---all of that matters.WWHD?---'What would Hitler Do?' He'd make it colorful! Primary colors, baby, lots of red and black and white! He'd add chrome! He'd come up with a catchy slogan. He'd probably have a military march with torches somewhere in there! He'd invade Poland!3) Mission Statement: KISS goes here (\\"Keep it SS\\"): make it brutally simple. Example: a) Revenge the betrayed fatherland by shooting the Bolshevik rotters; b) hold lots of torchlit parades; c) invade Russia.Show me, don't tell me. It's results that count, daddy-o. See #3.3) Business is War! Get in the other guy's face & scream! Make him wipe your spittle off his mouth! Yes! Go over the line! Pound on the table all you want to, but if you don't get what you want, it's time to cross the enemy's line of Death! No more Mr. Nice Guy!Your Enemies are a bunch of Fairies! They shave their legs & go cycling after work. Think I'm wrong? Think Carstairs in Accounting has the mojo to take you on, Dear Leader? Try nailing his cat to his desk. Your patience is at an end! Exactly! Would you like a little Belgium or France with your order, Sir?4)Shoot your rivals. What about Carruthers, the guy from Marketing? Seriously, Old Hoss, keep an eye on that guy. He's quiet, he's shifty eyed, he does what you tell him, and when you screamed at him in that P&L; meeting last week he---I jest thee not---he wet himself. That said, remember: it's the quiet ones who get ya, one way or another. Hitler, for instance. Hitler was a frustrated Marketing guy, too.It's kinda funny to think about, but had someone back on the old arts school admissions council at the Vienna School for Drawing Little Teutonic stick figures decided to let Hitler in, we'd have gotten about 15 years of bad cubist stuff instead of the Blitz & the Holocaust.5) Strike first! Strike hard! Kill! Kill! Pick yourself up out of the gutter and get back on that Tiger tank! You think it's enough to humiliate Dimwiddy in the board room, you lunk? Fool! You've got to destroy Dimwiddy! You've got to crush him, annex his office space, invade and destroy all those little projects that mean so much to him, get him fired, laugh as he has to haul all his personal shxt out in a cardboard box---and even then it's not over! You've got to gloat, gloat and cackle, when you spot him on the street corner, down in the gutter, eating his daily ration of cat food out of a tin! Shove his face in that horsemeat! Push!6) Never Underestimate the Stupidity of the Masses: This is a biggie. Think about it: you're German, it's 1930, and one of the candidates for Reichs Chancellor has a shifty looking brush moustache. When asked about his resume, he replies nonchalantly about being big on killing vermin.Would you vote for that guy? Guess what? They did! Hitler won in a landslide! If he can, you can too!With that in mind, ACHTUNG! Baby! We got a little Liebensrauming to do.JSG"},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"This is hands down the most interesting autobiography I've ever read. It was fascinating to read the thoughts of one of the most insane dictators in history. It's scary to realize that Hitler was well educated and makes many references to literature, French culture, and history. We don't seem to think that violent people have much intellectual ability, but Hitler had both, which is probably why he was able to rise to power and convince so many to follow him and commit such terrible actions."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"It seams odd, VERRY odd to have purchased this book.

As far as I have experienced, dictated books don't work to well, and although this sounds more like a long speech it actually works well as a book too. Even behind the philosophy there is something which is interesting if people took the time to think about it.

At first some of us were a little creeped out by reading the words of Adolf Hitler, but it became very interesting to learn about his warped view of the world. It was clear that he was a dangerous person long before World War II. He had traits of a psychopath early on. But his book is not all vitriol by any means. He does show that he was an educated person, and he could write down his ideas in a catchy way, which was very evident later in his life when he gave speeches that electrified German crowds. He was indeed a madman, but he wasn't dumb, at least not on a booksmarts level. It really is fascinating reading. It definitely left me with a list of traits to avoid in any politician that I ever vote for."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"First let me say by no means do I agree what this screwball represented but from a historical perspective this is a must read for a historical buff like myself."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"One must have a strong stomach, as well as a lot of time to pay attention to Hitler's musings, to be able to sit and read this book cover to cover. This book is obviously an important book that should be in every bookshelf of a student of history, but that doesn't make it readable. Hitler's statements about the Jews and other things such as Lebensraum are well known in other secondary sources, the value of Mein Kampf is to be able to read them in their own convoluted badly written context."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Wow! What a read! Finally, to understand where Hitler was coming from. It is hard to believe any historical documents about the war these days. There is so much distortion, the numbers, the facts, the revisionists, etc.This book explains race, nationalism, politcs, and much much more.What frightens me most, is how the things that were true in Germany in the 20's-30's is completely true in America today. Please read it with an open mind to see the parallels of then and now. It wouldn't surprise me if \\"history repeats itself\\" wasn't so far off.The worst thing is, that America never will have the chance at any glimmer of nationalism. We have no culture. We have no history. We have no definitive race to call our own. We're just a mish-mash of rebellious runaways, tryin' to make a go at it...."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"It is the year 2008. As the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq enter their seventh and fifth years respectively, anti-war sentiment has reached a fever pitch among left-wing segments of the American population. During a day of nationwide mass protests, large contingents of Washington's 250,000 strong crowd, aided by certain disaffected units of the armed forces, storm the White House, the Capitol and other government buildings and declare a new government to be headed by Senator Charles Schumer, with a Cabinet consisting of Ted Kennedy, Hillary Clinton, Cynthia McKinney, Diane Feinstein, Barbara Streisand, Michael Moore and other prominent left wingers. Responding to the call of the new government, legions of illegal immigrants, radical college students, racial minorities and assorted left-wing types follow suit in cities across the nations and assume authority from the overthrown \\"tyrannical\\" regime. The new government immediately declares our foreign \\"adventures\\" at an end, and begins evacuating the troops, issuing a proclamation assuming all war guilt and begging forgiveness from the Iraqi and Afghan people, as well as Al-Quaida. The rest of the world, seeing the newfound \\"reasonableness\\" of America's new leaders, queues up with grievances in hand. The new \\"People's Republic\\" starts a round-table international discussion which will result in a treaty that 1. reduces the US military to a token contingent of around 100,000 men. 2. cedes southern California, Arizona, New Mexico and 1/3 of Texas to Mexico. 3. Forces the U.S. to pay trillions of dollars in reparations to dozens of nations and non-state actors, including Mexico, al-Quaida, Iraq, Iran, Vietnam, etc. 4. New York City is declared an international city under the control of the U.N. while South Florida goes to Cuba and New Orleans declares itself the capital of the new nation of New Africa. The results? Inflation is at unprecedented levels. The U.S. economy collapses. Millions are begging in the streets. White Americans in the reconquered territories are being systematically discriminated against and sporadically massacred. When the first reparations payment is late, UN troops occupy New England. Communist China prepares to take advantage of the situation. The country is in chaos.How would you feel about this? What would you do? Would you calmly sit back and fondly hope that things would turn out ok in the end, or would righteous indignation compel you to take action and do whatever it took to reverse the situation and restore your country's strength and independence? Perhaps this book, if you shook off a lifetime of incessant government and media propaganda, could help you put yourself in the shoes of an early twentieth century German and understand why Hitler thought the way he did and why he was not only democratically elected but enjoyed the love and support of the vast majority of his people until the day he died. Without giving sanction to all his ideas or actions, I could without reservation wish that America had one statesman who loved his country as much as Hitler did.As for the notorious book itself, printed with a stark and scary cover obviously meant to color your opinion of the book's contents, I recommend it to both students of the era and modern day practitioners of the political art, especially conservatives. Of course, being on the Index Liborum Prohibitorum of much of the \\"free\\" world, there are an ever shrinking number of countries where one may even legally be allowed to read the book, so get it while you still can. Much of the book deals with contemporary German problems, which would probably only interest history buffs like myself. Contrary to popular belief, Hitler does not rant about the Jews on every page of the book. While the \\"Jewish problem\\" is addressed, it does not occupy a large portion of Mein Kampf and Hitler's opinions on the subject were probably not that different from large and influential portions of every society in the civilized world at the time. Hitler was not an intellectual or a polished writer but he was a political master and a genius on the subject of human psychology, especially as exercised upon mass society. And that is where this book would be interesting and relevant to a modern audience, especially those involved in concrete politics. Hitler was not only spot-on but scathingly hilarious (I know I sound like Franz Liebkind now- \\"The Fuhrer was a terrific dancer!\\") when describing the shortcomings of the conservative politicians of his day and their tragicomic actions in the face of the communist/liberal threat. It's obvious that conservatives never change- a weak, bloodless and cowardly breed of hidebound lackwits, impotently opposing societal degeneration, foreign threats and existential destruction with witty repartee, dithering, toothless political gestures, patriotic fustian and endless compromise. Hitler deals in depth and- in my opinion- with great insight on the subjects of political propaganda of both the written and spoken kind, the use of media, symbolism, personality, mass psychology and all aspects of how to achieve political success. Obviously, conditions vary greatly in time and place, but the human material stays the same and the one overriding rule still applies to politics- men follow courage and the method by which one displays that courage is physical (by defending one's beliefs in the presence of the enemy) and moral (by always telling an unpopular truth, despite the hatred and opprobrium that will be showered upon you). Never back down and never surrender.Propaganda is a part of every war but there has never been a war in American history in which the propaganda has continued to be shoved down the population's collective throat 60 years after the enemy's defeat. Even Robert E. Lee was lauded as an American hero by the North a mere 5 years after our Civil War. Americans should ask themselves why we are still subject to insulting governmental indoctrination about the Nazis 3 generations after WWII. Reading this book would be a good start to answering that question."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Mein Kampf should be required reading for every American citizen. Here, clearly written in these pages, are the seeds of hatred that destroyed not only its author but his entire country.There need never be a better object lesson about the virus of hatred and the inevitable results it brings to anyone and any society that allows it to take root."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"I became interested in Hitler greatly in high school history class, and should've bought the book then. No complaint other than it drags. I like politics also, because out of reason rather than genuinely wanting to be different, I differ greatly in political stance. What he says in some ways has bearing in real life. It's so funny, too. Most people view anything they deem deviant with bias. This is real world history- not just some racist talking. Hitler is an icon- the media made him one just like Charles Manson. Manson was a scapegoat for the love generation, Hitler was a scapegoat for the melting pot generation. Imagine what a swell world we would live in instead of a mixed world resulting in all these problems."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"I have great interest in WWII and the man who made it all happen. This book provided me an indepth look in to the mind of that person. It always amazed me how one man's idelogy can bring so much destruction to the entire world. Nothing positive can be said about Hitler nor did he do any constructive work in his entire life. What ever he thought about, where ever he laid his eyes on, where ever he walked he only brought destruction to the lives and property to that place. For this reason Hitler remains the true personification of pure Evil."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"I've been to the concentration camps in Poland. I've seen various movies, including &quot;Night and Fog,&quot; &quot;Triumph of the Will,&quot; &quot;Schindler's List,&quot; and &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank.&quot; I've read all sorts of books (&quot;Night&quot; by Weisel being my book of choice in that genre). I am an Orthodox Jew from Brooklyn who grew up with the monolithic Holocaust casting a dark shadow over many aspects of my childhood and adolescence. However, I never fully appreciated the terror and horror that was Adolph Hitler on an intellectual level until I read this book. I felt the emotions. I had many experiences. But I still could not understand. I give absolutely no credit to Hitler's &quot;genius&quot; or to his so called &quot;leadership skills.&quot; However, as a result of this book, the evil inherent in his little smirk, his deep eyes, and that small mustache has become much more tangible. Therefore, while personally this book had I guess what you can call a positive effect, I cannot with a clean conscience recommend this book to anybody. Despite this, we must never forget. Never forget."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"I bought this book out of fascination, to see and judge Hitler's character for myself. As I read it, I became pretty disapointed in that Germany followed, believed, and some still believe this complete self serving fool. His lunatic conclusions on race are laughable, in that he basically describes normal human behaviour, which he demonized in connections with the Jews.Mein Kampf is not political, nor is it a scientific piece of work. It is funny to even mention science in connection with this book.Most of the book is written in an attrocious style, it is extremely self centered, in that Hitler constantly has his 'moments of truth' which are idiotic since these SAME 'moments of truth' repeat over and over.At first I thought, Hitler couldn't have possibly reached the educated through this trash, but then so many did fall for it. It seems that most of his followers were the blue collar worker, who not only were uneducated, but were very suggestive due to Hitlers oratory skill.In anycase, I can't tell you not to buy this book, buy it, read it for yourself. I'm only concerned about those who will generate their knowledge from one source, this book. Then it becomes dangerous, since those folks will believe in a laughable and a ridiculous fairy tale of a manifesto."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"While reading this book is not enjoyable, it has given me a great deal of insight into the mind of a madman. I have always thought that people made a couple of wrong turns in their youth, but Hitler started in his childhood. From the time he entered primary school to his days in WWI, the man was not right in the head. His views about his aryan race were based on mythology, not any scientific fact. His early influences were men that dabbled in the occult.The frightening thing about Hitler is that he was not the only one of his kind. There are so many people, nowadays, that are steeped in mythological traditions that they perceive to be real. For example, vampires. This used to be a frightening bedtime story, but it has evolved to the point that we see people that actually believe that they ARE vampires. There are radical religious zealots that believe that their way is the ONLY way; that God will allow them to destroy all but their adherents. Radical Muslims call us fascist, and yet, if we look at their mistaken ideas, we see that they are the 21st century equivalent to the National Socialists of the 1920's through 1940's.We could go on and on about people that have been deluded into believing in mythological stories. The bottom-line is that it could conceivibly happen again. In fact, mini-holocausts happen on a constant basis. Darfur, Somalia, Bosnia, and the list goes on. One valuable result of reading this book is being aware of the mental condition, and the mind-set of potential Hitlers, or Stalins. This is the only value of a book like Mein Kampf."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"This book seems to be written by some philosoher named &quot;Adoplh Hitler&quot;. First of all, the book is way too long. Secondly, you begin to wonder where the author gets all these ideas! He has some sort of &quot;germ theory&quot; about the human race. I don't mean genetics. But his complete obsession with the Jews. He creates a road map where the Jews step in and take over a country. Then they make friends with everybody. And then they begin to acquire the country that they habitate. The big question is, &quot;Where did this gentleman get his facts?&quot; He seems to have made it all up in his head without any basis of fact except for perhaps his own life experiences. He comes up with some good ideas. Such as increased physical education in the school systems. And also increased courage and will power. But he just falls to pieces periodically. All of his ideas. They don't come together into any coherent whole. He goes into such incredible details about how the Jew takes over. a), b), c), and so forth. But he literally gives no concrete examples. It's as if he is living out a comic book. Worse yet, it's as if he created the comic book. And after awhile, it is (need I say it) just plain boring. Don't buy it unless you want to get terribly confused without any purpose (Note: Written with the sole purpose of how this book review would appear if I knew nothing about the Holocaust - it is boring and ridiculous - only buy it if you are an historian. It's better to read about Hitler than to read Hitler obviously)."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Mein Kampf is interesting to read, not because Hitler is a great writer but because it gives us a glimpse of what went on in the mind of the man. He has some surprisingly shrewd insights but his plans and ambition are pure dementia. It's very political but his plans for the supremacy of the race and destruction of the inferior ones are clearly outlined and the \\"philosophy\\" behind it simply put: basically, the way of Nature is survival of the fittest and Germans will be the fittest and ANY means will be acceptable to that end.I simply CANNOT believe any reviewer who actually read the book could write, as one did: \\"he never suggested the harming of the handicapped, Gypsies or Jews in Mein Kampf, or in any of his writings.\\"You have to be incredibly blind, incredibly obtuse or incredibly hypocritical to not see the writing on the wall in Mein Kampf. But before 1933, I don't think any one could have CONCEIVED of such ideas actually being carried out in practice."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"What did Hitler think? Well for the most part it's here in this dreadful cockeyed and intellectually stunted book . His ontology is confused and contradictory and based upon assumptions that require no proofs beyond Hitler's belief that it is true. It's not surprising given the fact that he was a high school failure with no real education that he understands little to nothing of logic and proofs and rigorous thinking.In higher learning, you are forced to examine all sides of things, and you are trained to think critically with an open mind. Hitler made a virtue out of being the oposite. \\"I know people who 'read' enormously...yet whom I would not describe as 'well-read.'...their brain is unable to organize and register the material they have taken in. They lack the art of sifting what is valuable for them in a book from that which is without value, of retaining the one forever, and, if possible, not even seeing the rest.\\" Adolf as explains the purpose behind reading as being the gathering of facts to fill in a mosaic that you have already designed. In essence, he refuses to open his mind to new and contradictory views/explanations/facts. I guess if you believe you have everything figured out, you already know what reality is, anyone who disagrees with you is wrong no matter what. It reminds me of when Hitler was presented with incontrovertible evidence that the Protocols of Zion were fake. The Protocols are a virulent anti-semetic tract supposedly written by Jews on how they plan to take over the world. Hitler said, \\"It is completely indifferent where these originate. The important thing is that with positively terrifying certainty they reveal the nature and activity of the Jewish people and expose their inner contexts as well as their ultimate final aims.\\" So even if something was patently false it was still true. He was the epitome of the anti-scientific, anti-intellectual, closed mind.His worldview is very cockeyed. I mean take his casting of Jews as a monolithic entity that created, championed, and controlled both international capitalism and international Marxism from Jew HQ. Yeah, that's why it's ok to firebomb Sol's local laundromat, cause he is the cause of capitalism and communism. Goofy. I always wondered how Hitler thought millions of Jews communicated and co-ordinated themselves over thousands of miles. Or how highly educated and very talented Jews were hurting German industry, science, and arts. Talk about blinded by hate.Another example in Mein Krampf is his view on WWI. Hitler's view was that the the people under Jewish influence let the troops down, and that if there were no Jews, national pride would have kept the population on side and Germany would have won the war. It was bogus, and anyone examining the evidence and listening to the leaders who made the peace would have known it wasn't true, but Hitler wasn't one for facts.As an aside, the war ended for the following reasons. First, the naval blockade of Germany starved the country of raw materials and food. Germany's sea power could not compete with Britain. Second, Germany was near exhaustion having been fighting on two fronts the combined forces of the British empire, the United States of America, Russia, and France. In fact, the entry of the US in 1917 meant fresh troops (10 000 per day), fresh money, and fresh equipment. The US drafted 4 million people for the war. Third, industrial output was 50% 1913 levels in 1918 and food scarcity was causing malnutrition and starvation. Fourth, civilian moral was desperately low, with strikes and protests common. Revolution was a real possibility. Fifth, the German army suffered defeat after defeat in the final months, hemorrhaging men. The German leaders knew the war was lost and sought an armistice.Hitler did have decent political instincts, though. In Mein Kampf, he seems to have been right on how a fascist political party in 1920's Germany should get their messages out: furnish no proofs, keep repeating a simplistic message ad nausem, and concentrate on the stupid people. I would imagine though that these insights were hardly original and mostly likely cribbed from someone else.So how does a despised shunned doss house failure and stool pigeon rise to the status of supreme dictator? Well it's not because of rational thought or an appeal to the noble side of humanity. It is in an appeal to the base evil side of humanity and the application of force to back up every claim or demand. Disagree or refuse to do what Hitler wants and suffer the consequences. As he explains in Mein Kampf, right from the beginning when he took over the 7 member worker's party and became it's dictatorial boss, force was the key to his expansion of power. And right from the beginning he demanded unconditional obedience and an oath of total submission to his will from those who followed him. So another couple of themes that can be plucked out from the book is belief in the use of force and demand for total submission. His talent seem to have lain in the use and exploitation of certain kinds of power thereby attaining more of the same, until he ruled Germany.He serves no idea, people, or guiding principle except for himself. The thrust of the book is extension of his personal power and revenge upon those he feels resentment to-wards, and providing proof that he is special. In fact, resentment is one of the keys to Hitler's personality, he feels himself persecuted and treated poorly to an amazing degree and of course he seeks violent revenge of these imagined offenders. Altruism, compassion, kindness, sympathy, fairness, and humour are all completely absent from this book, and I imagine from the man himself. There is nothing that inspires love in his work, only fear and anger which I believe is what attracted his followers. There is no nobility in his words, only ugly baseness.So here are some of the baguettes Hitler pinched off for this book:1) Democracy is weak, stupid, and worse than useless.2) Germans are the Greatest people in the world and have a natural right and duty to rule all other peoples.3) Germany's woes and lack of empire and the loss of WWI are due to the Jews.4) Violence is OK as a political tool, just like pamphlets and posters.5) Elimination (murder) of political opposition is OK.6) The destruction of a free press is good.6) The power of the party boss is absolute and absolute submission and unquestioning allegiance is a must.7) Certain elements of society must be removed.8) Germany must go to war to secure land and glory.9) Hitler is always right should never be contradicted. Should you argue with him, you should be beaten and then put in a concentration camp to work until you die.10) Hitler is special and better than everybody else.Pretty much what happened during the years between the writing of the book and 1945 is stately literally, or is easily predicted from this book. The book is so outrageous, the Frankfurter Zeitung (sp?) proclaimed it an act of political suicide. You can't accuse him of false advertising at least.If you can believe Hitler, and he was a liar through and through, there are a couple of surprises. The main one being that Hitler wasn't raised a racist. Apparently his family and school environment were tolerant of Jews, seeing them as just another religious group like protestants and catholics. It was only when he was out in the big city when he was older and a failure that he started reading racist works and hanging out with racists that his views changed. Another surprise was that Hitler's biggest fear was being ignored.In conclusion, if this book is at all representative of what he actually thought and believed, it is no surprise his life ended in suicide with no joy or friends or love (Eva Braun was nuts and incapable of real love, and Hitler was a malignant narcissist and could only love himself); only fear, death, depression, and rage were his companions in that bunker."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"It is a horrendous mistake to ban Adolph Hitler's evil manifesto -Mein Kampf- written about a decade before the dictator came to power. Well meaning censors are indeed right in prudentially warning immature minds to be cautious. One most certainly should not offer -Mein Kampf- to a child. This book, however, allows us to more fully understand the mindset of the Nazi leader who unleashed pure hell upon the world. We must remember that Hitler wrote this work in 1924 during his incarceration in Landberg Am Lech Prison. Few believed this minor league figure had a political future. The Nazis were mostly perceived to be a collection of losers, a fanatical fringe group that need not be taken seriously. Hitler and his goons were not feared as much as ridiculed. The American journalist William Shirer, for instance, recalled the barroom fellowship of colleagues who made fun of the Nazis. Charlie Chaplin even did a comedy routine imitating the mannerisms of Hitler.Adolph Hitler was not subtle and discrete. The charismatic Fuehrer readily indulged in pseudoscientific jargon to convey an intellectual authority to support his lunatic theories. Chapter XI of Volume I entitled &quot;Nation and Race&quot; wherein the Nazi leader charged Jews with &quot;poisoning&quot; the German race alone should have alerted the world. Democracy was viewed as nothing more than a swindle perpetuated by the weaker races to defeat the master German elite. The enemy of my enemy is my friend is how many justified their awkward and uneasy alliances with the Nazis. Hitler's contempt for Russian Communism encouraged these people to naively let down their guard. This was especially true of those religious adherents of the Roman Catholic and Lutheran Protestant traditions. It was not all that unusual to find individuals who dismissed Hitler's vile utterances as nothing more than exaggerated tongue in cheek rhetoric. The at least metaphorical reality of Original Sin guarantees that Adolph Hitler will regrettably not be the last of his kind. We need to study -Mein Kampf- to guide us concerning similar dangers that will forevermore threaten humankind. Should -Mein Kampf- be prominently displayed in one's personal library? I will not disparage others of laudable intentions who boldly place this book in public view, but I've long ago personally decided that a more fitting place is in the back of my garage. The legitimate study of Nazism does not seem to me to require a constant blatant reminder of Hitler's diabolical era. Remembering history so as not to repeat it is one thing. Nevertheless, allowing it to dominate every waking moment is also not wise. A spiritual and psychological balance must be maintained."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Interesting to note that much of what Adolf Hitler speculated/suggested in Mein Kampf has come to light. This alone makes the work interesting. The &quot;democratic&quot; West is awash in a sea of contradictions and cultural ailments; consumerism as a religion, modernism as a life-philosophy, violence, censorship, etc. Hitler saw Capitalism as the logical enemy of the folk. Mein Kampf is the literary manifestation of National Socialism and as such recognizes and illustrates (rather well), that any political/social system that places the obtainment of capital above all other concerns, is a society doomed to wallow in abject materialism, apathy and cultural neglect. All of this leading to the degredation and eventual extinction of that culture. Some of Hitler's grounds for anti-Semitism stemmed from the fact that he saw the Jewish race as the architects of Capitalism (and Communism).Hitler is often portrayed as an aberration of his time. He was not. His scientific/cultural world-view was very much rooted in and shaped by the works of writers like Spengler and Gobineau. Nationalism, traditionalism, anti-Semitism, Nordic mysticism, anti-materialism, and &quot;volkish&quot; sentiment had long been a close comrade of mainstream European politics. Critiques of Hitler's scientific, Darwanistic view of race and culture should be concentrated where they find their literary roots.As a piece of literature, Mein Kampf affords scholars and laypersons alike the chance to examine one of the most critical points in Western history. How often do we actually get to read the blue-prints for a global revolution? Long after we are gone, and this century has faded into time, this book will still be studied and argued. It's THAT important.In conclusion; Mein Kampf now stands as a testament to one alternative the West could have taken had she foreseen the awful consequences of abandoning her cultural roots for what Julius Evola called, &quot;spiritual and material degeneration&quot;."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"If you can get past all the extraneous material (such as the highly negative introduction and footnotes) which seem to be working overtime to make sure you *don't* like this book, you will find it to contain many truly inspiring pieces of political wisdom, put forward with a rhetorical flair and energy that keep you turning the pages, even if you may not agree with everything he states. There's nothing \\"tortured\\" about the prose at all (try reading Spengler -- there's some tortured prose for you.) Of course, Hitler was writing as an ordinary, self-educated man: he makes no claim to be an academic or even a professional writer. We must remember that this was written in 1925 while he was imprisoned for political activism. He had served bravely in the disastrous Great War of 1914-1918, was severely wounded, no doubt saw many of his buddies killed on the front lines -- only to come home to economic and political chaos and despair. That would be enough to make any man highly angry and bitter. But Hitler didn't just sit around and mope, he did something about it; he became active in politics and put forward a philosophy that, though it has its detractors, is still \\"controversial\\" eighty years later. And despite the hypocrisy of those who publish this book (repeating how badly written it's supposed to be), it's still a worldwide bestseller, so *someone* must be reading it. And the publishers don't mind cashing the checks either -- if they were sincere they would put it into the public domain and wash their hands of it. BTW: go for the new black cover edition -- it's a huge aesthetic improvement over that really ugly old orange edition."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"This work is something of a phenonemon is that no other published work has been judged so predominantly on it's author alone without regard for it value as a literary piece. Had Plato, or Dickens or Shakespeare written this it would have had praise lavished upon it, just as if Hitler had written \\"Hamlet\\" it would have been condemned. To fully appreciate this work that narrow, blinkered political dogma has to be set aside. Approach with an open mind and evalutate the work itself and you will find that this book is not at all as it is commonly portrayed. It is reasonably well written, although it's foremost asset is the committment and passion with which the autor addresses the issues closest to his heart and the emotions of a man driven by burning ambition which radiate from every page. Whether or not you agree with the sentiment, I suspect most will not, every point is made with conviction and feeling. These are the words of a man speaking his mind with forthright honesty, a man who has a confident, unshakeable faith in his ideas and is not ashamed to share them with the world, a man with a vision in which he passionately believes. This book is branded \\"evil\\" as a matter of routine, but it is still essential reading if any objectively complete understanding of this period of history is to be achieved. No man should condemn that which he does not know, the other side of the story must be heard, and can there be a better source that the central figure in the story himself. Read this and dismiss it as nonsense if you see fit, but do read it for the insight it provides is as illuminating as it is invaluable."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"This is a review of the Mannheim translation.After reading Hayek's The Road to Serfdom and von Mises' Omnipotent Government, I wanted to see what the relationship of Nazism to socialism was in Hitler's own words. I also wanted to know whether the German people were simply predisposed to Nazism, as Shirer insinuates in The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, or whether Hitler had presented an agenda that appealed to them economically, as Brustein finds in The Logic of Evil. I found surprises in both respects.Hitler was no great writer, and admitted his preference for oral communication. He was a master of propaganda, and explains his method throughout MK, including especially his belief that the National Socialist German Workers (Nazi) Party should recruit primarily from the working class, rejecting intellectualism and adopting a defiant, menacing, and if necessary, violent stance. His philosophy, though bizarre, is self-consistent on the surface. The anti-semitism is a recurring theme, but he neither explains nor defends it. For me, there were three main thematic surprises: Hitler's embrace of socialism and simultaneous rejection of Marxism, his equivocation between Jews, Marxists, and capitalists, and his foreshadowing of events to come.After his parents left him orphaned just as he reached his early adulthood, he moved to Vienna to pursue his intended career as an artist. Unfortunately (both for Hitler and for history), he was rejected and became a poor day laborer. The passages in which he describes the demoralizing effects of poverty read like Upton Sinclair's The Jungle. Somehow, he managed to reject Marxism in those days, possibly because the tabloids he seems to have preferred wrote it off as a Jewish conspiracy. However, he does seem to have genuinely embraced a brand of socialism which would uplift and allow working classes to embrace German culture and to produce little German warriors for the \\"coming struggle\\". Indeed, throughout MK, wherever he refers to socialism, it is positive, and he is careful to distinguish it from Marxism, which he consistently rejects on the grounds of its Jewish origins.In addition to conflating Jews and Marxists, Hitler also rejected capitalism as a Jewish ideology. He euphemistically uses communist, democrat, internationalist, and other epithets to refer to Jews-as-Marxists, and \\"international finance\\", Manchesterism, hyperindividualist, and other such epithets to refer to Jews-as-capitalists. In his theory, the Jews are a supranational state, a nation who attached themselves parasitically to \\"real\\" nations like the Germans. They had been taking from the German state in their role as financiers, and were especially successful in using the treaties concluding WWI to do so. However, he claims that they were also using Marxist theory to seal the trap, playing both ends against the middle. How this worked, he never explained, but he does steer Nazism through the middle as a philosophy that protects German workers (as opposed to all workers, or German landowners, intellectuals, and capitalists) against foreign parasites (which meant, of course, Jews).Finally, he strongly suggests the events yet to come. That was surprising given the context in which MK was written: at the time, Hitler was in jail for leading a silly coup in a corner of Germany, his party had been outlawed, and Germany was thoroughly out of the picture as a military power. Just as von Mises claims, Hitler's economic program calls for wage and price controls. Those controls would be pressured by international trade (conducted against the Germans by Jews, of course), so Hitler realizes that Germany would have to be self-sufficient. WWI came about in part because it had been thought that Germany could achieve self-sufficiency by obtaining colonies to produce food paid for by manufactured goods sold in them. Hitler rejects this approach and outlines a plan for taking land in the East. Although Hitler always describes such struggles as if they would have to take place over the course of generations, we need no longer guess at what was to become of the inhabitant Slavs.Ultimately, Hitler was freed, reinvigorated his gang/party, obtained a third of the votes in the country, gained the Chancellorship and implemented the dictatorship implicit in his Fuhrerprinzip theory of responsibility and leadership. From the perspective of the Austrian economists, this was the culmination of decades of socialist theory in German politics. Hayek dedicated TRTS to \\"socialists of all parties\\" because he saw similar trends in England in 1944. Today, if we replaced the word \\"Jew\\" in this tract with \\"multinationals\\", \\"outsourcers\\", or \\"jihadists\\", and if we dropped the references to race out of the 25-point Nazi economic-political program, would their programs be palatable to a majority of voters in a western nation? Finding answers to current problems is the reason we read historical texts, especially when the ideas in them led to great evil."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Mein Kampf is an interesting book by a fascinating yet terrifying author.

Read the book and think for yourself."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"I decided to read MEIN KAMPF as the result of reading the books and seeing the films ATLAS SRUGGED and THE FOUNDTAINHEAD by Any Rand. I came to the conclusion that Rand didn't understand the difference between Marxism and Fascism. Clearly, her concern was state-controlled capitalism (Fascism) and not the absence of a free-market economy (Marxism). Highly educated people often confuse the two political philosophies because of the social oppression that undergirds both of them. As for me, any ambiguities between the two philosophies were resolved after reading MEIN KAMPF (I read DAS KAPITAL while in college). Three critical issues emerged from my reading. These include 1) Hitler's level of intelligence and his command of the written word; 2) What he ACTUALLY said (which if not the same thing as what people say he said); and 3) His influence on politics and political propaganda in contemporary American society.1) After reading MEIN KAMPF, there can be no doubt that Hitler was an extremely intelligent man. The general public often confuses education and psychosis with intelligence. There is no significant association. Although Hitler embarrassingly admits that he never obtained what we would call a high school diploma and his failure to be admitted to architecture school, he was well-read* and had a supreme command of the written and oral word. Once one reads MEIN KAMPF, it becomes easy to understand how his contemporaries became Jew-haters and blindly follow his dictates.As a budding scholar (many years ago), I was taught that the most effective strategy to establish a complex position is to express the salient points in a list-like manner. People like to read lists (which is what I am doing in this review). This is exactly what Hitler did. Writing by lists, keeps the reading audience attentive. In addition, his vocabulary is nothing less than magnificent! Anyone who knows pre-World War II German history, will be able connect the enthusiasm and attraction of MEIN KAMPF among the non-Jewish German population.2) I have heard MANY times, that Hitler's plan for the \\"final solution\\" was clearly articulated in MEIN KAMPF. This is simply not true. Within the pages of MEIN KAMPF, it is clear that Hitler hated Jews and Communism. His hatred for Communism was profound. However, his anticommunism perspective emerged because he envisioned Communism as a Jewish plot. I speculate that if Marx was not born as a Jew, Hitler would have bought into his economic plan. The fact is, throughout the entire book, Hitler employs Marx's unique vocabulary. The bottom line is this: Reading MEIN KAMPF immediately after it was published would offer no insight into the German plan for World War II or the Holocaust. There is no plan laid out as many TV commenters contend. In fact, MEIN KAMPF suggests that the first country to be invaded would be Russia - to free the people of Jewish Communism.3) The most astounding dimension of MEIN KAMPF is the propaganda devices and half-truths. I am writing this during the summer of 2012 and have witnessed the articulation of the party planks of both Democrats and Republicans. Both seem to be students of MEIN KAMPF. As someone who has rejected party affiliation, I get chills when I notice that American politicians are employing Hitler's strategies to win over the ignorant sector of the population. As a sidebar, Hitler admired the social and legal strategies that American's employed to contain the African-American population. In particular, he noted that if Germans followed the American example, Jews would have never been able to control mass media.MEIN KAMPF is a critically important book for people to read. However, because of Hitler's masterful employment of rhetorical devices, I can see how he can pull those who are not well-read into becoming white supremacist. I actually thought about requiring MEIN KAMPF for my freshmen, but there is too great a chance that they would fall into the same trap as Americas who are buying the absurd political propaganda during the summer of 2012.* There is no doubt that Hitler read and had a thorough understanding of Marx's DAS KAPITAL and Machiavelli's THE PRINCE. In addition, he had an in-depth understanding of European and American history."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"My husband was really impressed with the quality of this book! The green leather with the gold lettering looks classy. The only problem is that the printing is quite small, even with wearing glasses."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"You may hate Hitler, but you can't ignore that he has played an important role in Western experience. You cannot talk about the 20th century without talking about Hitler. You can hate him, but you cannot ignore him. Hitler redefined military history, literary discourse, philosophy, academic discussions, and even theology. You may not want to give him credit because you may hate what he tried to do, but he is probably the greatest mover in history. Hitler gave Germans a sense of pride. Most Germans did not care about killing Jews -- it was in fact a side effect that many Germans tried to ignore or pretend did not really exist. Often, Hitler is only seen vis-a-vis the Jews and that detracts from correctly understanding Hitler and his role in German society. Reading the original document by Hitler is a step in the right direction to truly understand the mind of the evil genius. It is important to go to the primary source in every case and develop your own opinions, rather than take others' words for truth."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Mein Kampf is the one of the world's best sellers, second only to the Christian Bible. In this book, a manof the 20th Century sets social and political goals for an economically ruined, morally devastated post-war.Germany. Hitler gives us a picture of his Weltanschauung and his future plans for a Europe under National Socialist domination.This book is also valuable for its autobiographical nature. The first chapter of the book deals with Adolf Hitler's youth and upbringing. As with any autobiography, it shows us an ideal image of the young Hitler; but at the same time, we gain insight into how Hitler saw himself.Anyone familiar with the &quot;Hitler Myth&quot; can certainly see that Hitler was a man who believed what he wrote and said (even though it was not always the truth). One also gains knowledge of the beginnings and rise of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, the party which Hitler lead to victory in Germany's chaotic political atmosphere of the late 1920's and early 1930's. One reads about Hitler's decision to join the Party, the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch in Munich and the days in Landsberg Prison, where Hitler was sentenced to 9 months after the failed Putsch. This is where Hitler wrote his famous book. I would recommend this book to everyone who has an interest in history and 20th Century politics. It shows the mindset of a nation gripped by the tragedy of defeat and poverty after the First World War. It makes us aware of the ideas to overcome the tragedy held by many political figures of the time. It also proves that history can be predicted and even changed when we are armed with the education to do so."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Yes, I have read the book, but I read it long ago and my memory is not perfect. In 1988 I was persuaded by a college student (I was 44) to investigate the neo-Nazi movement. He had been persuaded by one of his professors to do the same thing. My adoptive mother was the daughter of Ukrainian Jews who came to Boston circa 1900. I was therefore highly unlikely to become an anti-Semite. Like everyone else, I took it for granted that Hitler was an evil madman, the ultimate bad guy of history. I therefore approached the reading of Mein Kampf and a bunch of other such books and publications, racist and anti-Semitic, with a bias against them. I found that Mein Kampf did not appear to me to be the product of a deranged mind. Economics bores me, and the economic parts of the book did not appeal to me. I managed to read the whole book with as much dispassion as possible (\\"with an open mind\\"). I had as a teenager seen many pictures of the devastation wrought by the Germans during WWII. The Nazis were not heroes to me. Nevertheless, I read this book and many others written by hardcore racists and anti-Semites. I learned to see the world from their point of view. I fell into the habit of \\"Jew-counting\\" i.e., looking at the masthead and table of contents of magazines to see how many Jews were there. There were a lot. I began to wonder whether the anti-Semites were not correct after all about the claim that the Jews control the press. This proved to be a slippery slope indeed. Although I have long since ceased to read such material, it still had a surprising effect on my outlook that has never entirely gone away. One does not have to be a bigot or a madman to fall under the spell of this sort of thing. A century ago, racism and anti-Semitism were quite common, not merely in Germany but also in America and elsewhere. Many, perhaps most, Americans used to believe that \\"the only good Indian is a dead Indian.\\" I don't want to go off on a tangent, but I wish to point out that bigotry is not something that exists only among ignorant people. The eugenics movement was common a century ago, and it was widely believed that lower-class people should be sterilized i.e., exterminated. Hitler's mindset was not an aberration, it was typical of his time and place. Hitler did not invent genocide. The Namibians were butchered by the Germans when Hitler was young. As luck would have it, my landlord was a Jew at the time when I was reading this stuff, and his nasty disposition didn't help me to ward off the temptation to believe that the Nazis might have been correct on some points. I am trying to point out that you don't have to be a stereotypical trailer trash type in order to develop a social grudge of some sort. It is an historical fact that many Jews were Communists, and the Germans, Russians and Hungarians had to deal with them in the streets in a way unlikely to discourage a belief that Communism is Jewish. The Neocons of today are the children of yesterday's Communists. So, if you think that Mein Kampf is \\"the ravings of a lunatic,\\" you understand nothing about the social background of the book. As for the style of this book being \\"turgid\\" (the favorite word of those reviewers who disagree with the message), this is a matter of opinion, and pretty much falls into the category of ad hominem attacks and terms of belittlement (such as drab, shabby, shoddy, etc.). As for the charge that this is a wicked book because it laid the groundwork for the Holocaust, one could point out that the vast number of human beings (yes, that's right, human beings) killed in abortion clinics since Roe vs Wade has been far greater than 6,000,000. To say that abortion is not murder is roughly the same as denying the Holocaust, is it not?"},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Ordered for husband he is enjoying reading it.

Please keep in mind that this is the recipe book that all the world strongest powers such as Germany, England, France, Italy, Russia, United States and Japan would participate and conduct history that would change world and cultural history forever. Hitler shines a little light to us into his childhood as an early youth in Austria and progresses to show and tell us why the German nation shall rule the world.

As with most any piece of work, it is critical that a reviewer be analytical in their approach. To enter a review with prejudice and or bias simply categorizes the opining party as a proponent or opponent rather than as an observer/reporter of the text. If I wish to have somebody tell me what they think - I'll seek their opinion. Otherwise, I am quite capable and appreciative of the opportunity to formulate my own opinions. When studying great figures in history, it is fairly common to have some understanding of what the respective figure is known for. With that considered, I feel that works such as this are what are of the most significance; as they offer true insight in to the thought process' that compelled their subjects to their chosen courses of action. To speak dismissively of someone that you have differing opinions with is a very weak (unfortunately common) tactic. Also, only listening to one side of a story will further inhibit one's ability to compile the information necessary to form an accurate history/opinion of a given historical event/figure/period.Actually, since I could write a book on this material - I better conclude for now. I will mention just few quick thoughts:-Stalin was responsible for far more deaths than Hitler (mostly of his own people!), ironic that that FDR sold him to the American public as \\"Uncle Joe\\"!-Communism and its progenitors is the political/religious doctrine responsible for more human suffering than any other in history.-A further irony is that the case for liable against the German's wartime actions was greatly substantiated by the very machines/techniques that the Germans (or people of Germanic descent) were responsible for inventing/developing, i.e. cameras, film and thorough documentation practices."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Mein Kampf is a conundrum of a book. Hitler wrote it whilst serving an absurdly truncated prison sentence for attempting to overthrow the democratically elected government of Bavaria. Even with the editorial advice of better-educated friends and sympathisers, it's still a turgid, rambling, humourless (!), frequently mendacious read. Hitler frequently lies about his own life and career (for example, he casually omits to mention that he used to be an Army propagandist for the Social Democrat government, before he ever got interested in the fledgling German Workers Party that would evolve into the Nazi Party). He churns out a lot of stamped-in-tin rhetoric about the evils of democracy, and there's some sub-pornographic BS about curly-haired Jews raping Aryan maidens.Nevertheless, a lot of very committed and dangerous people think that this book is a masterpiece. This is perhaps because they are too lacking in any sense of justice and human decency to see that the man who wrote this book went on to cause an unimaginably destructive and needless war, destroying the country he claimed to love in the process.This needs to be said: Hitler was not some supernatural genius. He was a beerhall orator, with unusual gifts of persuasion and a raw tactical skill, who rose to prominence because power interests around him had no faith in anything better coming along. Ian Kershaw's excellent biography makes this clearer than anything I could say. It's worth pointing out that Hitler himself, once he had gained the Chancellery, admitted that if he'd known he was ever going to get that far, he'd never have written this book. It exposes him for the small-minded, unimaginative, hate-ridden racist he was, and he knew as much himself.It's a bloody awful read, but it remains the best guide there is to the cramped and stuffy little world that is the imagination of the Nazi. Or, for that matter, Neo-Nazi."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"I found this book very interesting for the purpose of understanding Hitler. It's not light reading but rather its value is in the information and insights it provides.A key time period in Hitler's troubled life was perhaps when he was in the hospital after getting mustard gas in his eyes during WW I. He found out that Germany had lost the war. He was devastated after all he had seen and experienced during his four years in the trenches. He eventually recovered his eye sight but realized he would never be able to paint or draw again.And I think Hitler began to severely resent those who had not experienced those things.It goes on to tell about what Hitler was doing after the war, his involvement with various political parties, etc..From there he started giving speaches in beer halls where fights often broke out with the communists. People got beat up. Sometimes they got killed. It was during those times that Hitler began life long friendships with people like Hess.Eventually Hitler's simmering rage and resentment was focused on three groups:1. the bourgoise2. the Marxists3. the JewsThe borders between these groups got sort of blurred in Hitler's mind. For example he blamed the bourgoise for not fighting against the Marxists, he says Marx was a Jew, etc..In this politically correct world we live in today it is unusual to find someone who so openly hated other people based mainly on race and religion. He viewed the Jews as unwelcome foreigners in Germany who were defiling the pure Germanic blood by marrying German girls. The effects of this 'cross breeding' (as he puts it) he felt could only be corrected over hundreds of years through a process of extermination and sterilization.Hitler refers to a document of questionable authenticity called 'The Protocols Of The Elders Of Zion' which claims to prove that the Jews have been scheming to take over the world for hundreds of years. This document is I'm sure a favorite for neo Nazis and many other suspicious people like William Cooper. Cooper died in a shootout with sheriff's deputies, undoubtedly believing they were agents of the New World Order who had come to arrest him and take him to a secret concentration camp.Not everyone believes this but supposedly the Russians recovered the bodies of Hitler and Eva Braun and were able to perform autopsies on them. They discovered that Hitler was sexually malformed. I suspect this is true and explains why Hitler never really had any sort of serious or long term relationship with a woman.So there's a sexual frustration component to Hitler's philosophy I think. He was perhaps projecting his own deepest resentments and fears when he created his 'survival of the fittest' ideology.Interesingly Hitler took a bullet to save one of his officers during WW I. Years later in Munich one of Hitler's followers took two bullets to save Hitler's life when they tried to overthrow the government and were put into jail.There's a great Twilight Zone episode about the Nazis called \\"He's Alive\\" with Dennis Hopper. Several other TZ episodes deal with Hitler and that time period including the great \\"Death's Head Revisited\\".This book became the blueprint for a holocaust.

Remember Hitler came from a family that constantly moved and was controlled by an abusive father, Alois, Hitler would have became an artist if not for his father who forced him toward his path to power. The book does have doragatory references to the jewish race and is quite racist, but to learn of the turmoil of that period it is an exellent book to read"},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Mein Kampf details Hitler's course of action to revive his war- torn country. It is written with extreme confidence and persuasive ability. It is easy to see why other Germans were convinced that this plan would succeed. Hitler does not give a single hint of doubt that his plans will not work. He has an answer for everything. Some of his ideas are good, while others are extremely flawed. His argument in favor of racism is absurd. He seems to think that the world is composed of races of individuals that are in competition with each other and that we should all strive to ensure the survival of our race. I agree that we are all competitve to a certain degree. But I think that the competitiveness is on a person to person basis, not race against race. A common misconception that people have about this book is that it is Satanic. There is not one single mention of Satanism or anything else Satanic in nature anywhere in this book. If anti-semitic thoughts are inherently Satanic, then many of the prominent religious leaders in America are also Satanic. I found it interesting that Hitler never says anything about killing Jews. You get the feeling that he is thinking that way, but he never directly says this.This book is not always easy to read. I often had to read a paragraph a second time in order to fully understand exactly what Hitler was trying to convey to the reader.Mein Kampf should serve as a lesson to all about what can happen when too much power is given to the wrong person."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Mein Kampf from a history lovers point of view, is a great read. However, if your not a fan of the history subject you may find this book to be increadibly boring, a continuous flow of long words and sentences before our time. Understanding the complete facts about the second World War, is to understand both sides. If you only keep yourself to a one sided story, your no better than any of those critics or movie makers that produce films that slander our country. Such as Ferinhight 9/11. Excuse my spelling as I'm sure I mis-spelled quite a few words in this writing. If you plan on reading this book, understand what your getting yourself into. Yes, you may find some chapters to be increadibly obscene and stupid. Yes, I had to force myself through a couple of chapters. But, I promiss if you read this book, it may very well bring you to a better understanding of what was happening politicly and personaly to the people of Germany the few years before the second World War.

Obviously the Jews get special treatment,and it gets as ugly as you think. The freemasons and other smaller organizations get their share too. But all that is no surprise. The early life story in his own words of this \\"ferocious genius\\" (as Churchill said) is certainly worth the price of the book, and most ofthe first part covers his days in the Great War, and in Vienna, with descriptions of this beautiful yet unforgiving and nasty metropolis just before and after the war, and his rabble-rousing in the army and in Munich from 1919-1923, when the book was written. He is obviously disease obsessed, part of the beginnings of his vicious anti-semitism, since he blames the Jews for spreading Syphilis. Obviously he is very well read on history, art, music, and architechiture, and in some passages, this book is astounding!. But as a record of some very lucid and very sick ideas from a genius/madman, this book is surely in a league of its own!"},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"In Mein Kampf, Adolf Hitler reveals himself as the embodiment of three of the worst and most destructive theories of he 20th century: Social Darwinism, ultra-nationalism, and racism, most maliciously expressed in anti-Semitism based upon a fantasticly constructed international conspiracy of Jews to rule the world. Though not the exlusive purveyor of these intellectually vacuous and dangerous ideologies by any means, he is the man who was able to put these theories into practice. The cost as history documents was sixty million lives in WWII, including most horrifically the murders of six million innocent Jews in the genocide of the Holocaust.Social Darwinism was the perversion by analogy of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution transposed onto the human condition. It had greater currency than some scholars will admit during the time Hitler wrote Mein Kampf. \\"Survival of the fittest\\" (a phrase Darwin never used) as Hitler espoused it eventually was used to justify conquest, slavery, and death for weaker or more peaceful peoples. Mercy for the less fortunate was \\"unnatural\\". Adding a touch of Malthus, Hitler justified conquest of other countries as a Malthusian imperative to obtain \\"Lebensraum\\"-soil for an ever-growing German peasant population.Ultra-nationalism and racism also justified the conquest of \\"lesser\\" people, like the Slavs of Russia and theBalkans. They justified a new march to a second war with the French, in his view Germany's greatest natural enemy, next to the Jews of international finance. The recurring theme throughout Mein Kampf is Hitler's relentless obsession of the position and assimilation of the Jewish population into German society. Never concerned with facts or proof, Hitler attributes any misfortune that befell the German people, from the loss of WWI, to hyper-inflation, to unduly burdensome war reparations, to criticism of his ridiculous theories to \\"the Jew\\" and Jewish involvement with international finance and purported control of the press.How could a man with such vapid intelligence obtain such great power? Read Hitler's chapters on the use of propaganda and the tactical approach to his formation of his storm troopers and you will see. Tbey demonstrate a street-wise cunning that negated his second-rate intellect. Nothing in the book, however, can replicate the charismatic nature of his speaking ability and its ability to stir the latent brutish forces that created world havoc from 1939-1945.Tbe high rating that I have given the book is based upon its historical value as a look into the mind of a political psychopath. It should be read to understand that reason and the intellect are necessities in the course of human relations, not revenge, racism, and emotion. Had Hitler not been able to translate his words into deeds, Mein Kampf would never have seen a second printing. It would have been consigned to the dust bin of history, as has Hitler's precious Third Reich."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"This is a very interesting book, writing by a very interesting man. Most people think of Hitler as just a horrid, well, thing really, not a person. But this book shows HIS point of veiw, and while he did do horrid things, he had his own problems. he lived a hard life, struggling for food adn shelter. He wanted to know, be educated. And this often times led to his being secluded, deep in his studies. I think maybe this slowly, but surely, drove him somewhat insane. And he somehow got dragged into goverment (how, I'm not sure as i havent finished it yet). it really lets you see life through his eyes, and while I'm not defending him, he had reasons for his wrongdoings. he was in turmoil his whole life. the book does have its low, boring points, but as a whole it is totally worth reading, very interesting to see Hitler's story through his eyes..."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Why? Throughout history their has been one genocide after another on this world. Each of them worse then the last and yet it seems that the Holocaust is the one that is most remember and hated. Why? The one thing that the Holocaust did good was that it open the minds of the people of the world to just how deep racial hatred can go and just how far a man is willing to go to achieve his ambitions of a \\"pure race\\". Hitler does ramble on a bit but he does touch on some very key issues that are profound in understanding how the minds of people work before WWII.His theory about \\"cultural bearing and Cultural founding and cultural destroyings races\\" are remarkable and are actually true given the examples that he has givin and so thought. He lable the Jew a culture destroying race because they had no country but had their own religion. Israiel had not been founded so the jews had no home country of their own and since they worship their own god and tought their own children they do have their own culture. But they reside in other countries and spread their culture so ineffect some of what Hitler was talking about was not all bull....He also focus on the fact that the jews had no country. That was his sole reason for labling the jews \\"parasites\\". Hitler has once again has simply explain the sole reason for every genocide in history. The Native Americans are a good example. Officially they had no country so when the white settlers move in they did not feel any moral pains as they mass murdered nearly 90 percent of the native in habbitants.Of all the things that hitler did wrong they can be dismissed by what he left behind. A legacy that has tought us why we do some of the evil things that we do. This book should not be throw aside because of its author."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"You can't attempt to read this book with a closed mind. I know what took place in WW2 was terrible but despite what american/allied propaganda will have you belive adolf hitler was not the monster he is made out to be. Both sides did horrific things. Don't get me wrong im not supporting Heinrich Himmler and nazi involvement in acts of antisemitism to put it lightly. What I am attempting to convey is what adolf hitler attempted when writing Mein kampf. if you read this book with an open mind it will surly make you re-evaluate your current outlook on capitalism communism and hopefully life itself. if nothing else you will at least walk away with a clearer perception of how the events of WW2 and Adolf Hitlers rise to power came to be."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"My five points are based on the book's historical significance. (Review based on first English edition--1939).Perusal of this malevolent classic allows one to clear up many misconceptions about Nazism. For instance, we sometimes hear that the German people came to support Hitler without ever understanding his positions. MEIN KAMPF lays this notion soundly to rest!Some commentators doubt if National Socialism had actually been a form of socialism. It is therefore instructive that Hitler supported trade unions (pp. 874-876), and that the annotators of MEIN KAMPF recognized the fact that the Nazi economy had been a Planswirtschaft (planned economy; p. 880).Traditional Christian theology, about Jews and deicide, is often blamed for the Holocaust. We learn instead that Hitler's pathological hatred of Jews had NOTHING to do with Christian theology. In fact, the only time that Hitler even touched on this issue was when he asserted that Jews crucified Christ for having opposed their commercialization of the Temple (p. 423). Indeed, Hitler saw Jews as a parasitic element that takes the hard-earned wealth of others. They did this through such things as becoming intermediaries in trade, and through usury (pp. 419-on). When the masses rebel against this exploitation (as through pogroms), the Jews ingratiate themselves to the rulers for protection. No matter how many times they are persecuted, Jews will always return to their ingrained exploitative ways (p. 427). Furthermore, Jews will, according to Hitler, resort to all forms of mendacity and slander in order to protect their privileged, exploitative positions. Such things as Jewish assimilation, philanthropy, and conversions to Christianity are nothing but disguises to further Jewish ends. Hitler was unfazed by the fact that the PROTOCOLS OF THE ELDERS OF ZION were inauthentic. To him, the Jewish reaction against this publication was itself proof of its authenticity (p. 424). Finally, whether themselves authentic or not, the PROTOCOLS were supposed to constitute a valid appraisal of Jewish attitudes and goals.Hitler unambiguously believed that only Germanic peoples invent things (pp. 397-398). The creativity of a society is directly proportional to the Germanic content of its stock and inversely proportional to the degree of \\"bastardization\\" with inferior races. The Fuhrer made countless racist statements against Slavs. Hitler repeatedly lamented the fact that the admixture of Jews and Slavs had polluted the Germanic element of his native Austria (e. g., pp. 138-140). The Fuhrer also contended that Slavs have no capability of self-government--their rulers must all be of Germanic origin (p. 951). Hitler was no white supremacist; he was a German supremacist par excellence!Proponents of Holocaust uniqueness sometimes claim that, whereas there was nothing that Jews could do to change their standing in the eyes of the Nazis, Poles could redeem themselves by undergoing Germanization. This is fallacious. Hitler said, \\"Here too one believed that one could bring about a Germanization of the Polish element by a purely linguistic integration into the German nationality. Here too the result would have been an unfortunate one: people of an alien race, expressing its alien thoughts in the German language, compromising the height and the dignity of our own nationality by its own inferiority.\\" (p. 590). (During the later German occupation of Poland, the \\"Germanization\\" of selected Poles was actually a re-Germanization of ethnic Germans who had previously become Polonized.)We sometimes hear the claim that the German people voted for Hitler, in free elections, without realizing the fact that he would start a major war. Perhaps, some say, Hitler would be, at worst, content with a little war to rectify the \\"injustices\\" of Versailles. In actuality, there is much more to MEIN KAMPF than the customary German self-pity regarding WWI and Versailles. Clear proof that the Fuhrer had long planned a war of massive conquest and extermination, against the Slavic peoples, is provided by his following statements regarding lebensraum: \\"Neither eastern nor western orientation should be the future goal of our foreign policy, but an eastern policy signifying the acquisition of the necessary soil for our German people.\\" (pp. 965-966). (Later, the Nazis spoke of \\"resettlement\\" of Jews and Slavs. In time, \\"resettlement\\" evolved into a euphemism for extermination.)"},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"This is a must read if you really want to see the source of the man behind the madness. It is clear that the man isn't exactly the best writer in town, so if jumbled thoughts and rants are your absolute pet peave then stick to the history books. If you are a fan of history, and interested in (I believe) the most influential man in the 20th century possibly world history, then this book is worth reading. Its not every day you get to read into the thoughts of world leaders, see into the rage that stirs their speeches and decisions. Hitler is probably the most evil man in history, and it pays to have documentation of his thoughts so that we can see another &quot;Hitler&quot; down the road!! A truely epic peice in terms of historical value, as far as literary value you could use his rambling pages to coat the bottom of your birdcage."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"I thought this was an excellent book, however, quite long. I was excited in the second half when they got to Hitler's thoughts of his rallys and his men defending his rally-goers."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Sometimes I just get the idea into my mind to read totalitarian ideology. Just like dystopian literature it can be enlightening to put your worldview up against those which flatly reject what one's society puts forth. After briskly reading through the Communist Manifesto I decided to tackle a work which had held my interest for some time. The work of course was Mein Kampf, the semi-autobiography/propaganda work by one of history's justifiably infamous despots.Actually the book was at times mental torture. It is long, tedious in places, and reading over too much of its content in one afternoon could get my head literally aching. That said the historical fascination drove me onwards. Although rather weary at the end I am rather glad I took the time to read it.Hitler discusses his early life, his failure as an artist, the shaping of his ideology, a few of his World War I experiences, and the rise of the Nazi party preceeding the failed coup at Munich. As the forward and page notes point out however, not all of this information is conveyed accurately by the author (big surprise).The book does not lay out a clear and carefully laid out explanation of Nazi ideology. This is not surprising. Hitler was not yet in power. His ideas may not have fully solidified if they ever did. Nazism like most large movements was far from monolithic but instead composed of the ideas of individuals from sometimes hostile viewpoints. There are some disturbing hints of things to come however. Hitler's racism and anti-semitism are raw, paranoid, and clearly set forth. So is a perverse utilitarian concept which would culminate in the forced sterilization or murder of the mentally handicapped. The enmity towards France and the goal of expanding German influence in the east present forshadows of the wars which were to come. Hitler's religious ideology remains rather an enigma. He does make a number of references to religion in his book but as Abraham Foxman points out in the introduction there is evidence Hitler was privately opposed to Christian belief. Even from the public veneer presented in Mein Kampf it seems clear that his religious beliefs (if he had them) were not what was really motivating him. Apart from anti-semitism, pro-German racism, and a somewhat more justified fear of Marxism, another strain of thought runs through the work. This was a particularly ruthless strain of Social Darwinism. Hitler clearly had a predatory mind which was extended to the worth of human beings. Hitler may have been insane; I do not know for certain. He was clearly evil though.So what can I say in summation. Should I recommend this book? That depends. If you have his sorts of tendencies, please do not read this book to reinforce them. If you are simply interested in history, Mein Kampf might be worth your time but remember that it is how Hitler wanted to present himself and is not entirely accurate. This book might be a pain to struggle through. You might find it disturbing. Hopefully you will. Nazism really was a revolutionary ideology but in nearly all the wrong ways. Just like totalitarian communism the result was the deaths of millions. This book is fascinating, informative, tedious, and frankly presents very evil ideas. It can and has influenced people in very terrible ways. If you choose to read do so at your own caution."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Mein Kampf gets the mandatory first star for existing, and the second star for being of historical value.After doing a great deal of reading on World War II, and having known all my life that Adolf Hitler wrote this book before / on his way to taking the reins of Germany, I figured it would be worth it to see just what it was that gained him so many followers and such a bottomless fund of royalties to fund his political ambitions.Even Hitler's Minister of Armaments Production Albert Speer said he couldn't bother to finish the book... I guess that says something.The book is not a horrible read in terms of style... And make no mistake, Hitler pretty much lays out what he is going to do when he comes to power. So it's pretty difficult to imagine how Mein Kampf could have existed for years and yet the mass of the German Reich was shocked upon the discovery of the ultimate treatment of 'the Jewish Question.'Anyway, Hitler's logic is completely untenable. But it is also presented in a way that I could see as very convincing upon a weak mind.For the first 50 pages or so, Hitler only makes one glancing reference to Jewry. But right after that point in the book, as if it had been painful to hold it in for even that long, he explodes in a nonstop tyrade against Jews in a way that is so over the top that it almost makes for comedy now.Hitler provides premise A, then presents fact B, distracts the reader for a minute or two and then proudly exclaims conclusion Z.That said, several of his observations on the nature and structure of politics are on point and the book serves to flesh out the social climate of Germany in the early 20th Century quite colorfully.I certainly don't want to be on record as recommending that anybody read Mein Kampf, but it makes for an interesting study in how an enormous number of people were politically seduced in an era before modern human rights. I guess it's kind of like reading Von Clausewitz or Sun Tzu...if they had rabies."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"What can one say. The person responsible for so much misery in the world. Who never contributed a single positive thing to the life of anyone. Why read his book? Well there is more here than meets the eye:1) It is really impossible to understand the historical angnst gnawing at the entrails of a future mass murderer without knowing what motivated him. Hitler is the repository of every hatred and scapegoat idea that ever oppressed the mind of a human being or a nation (see present day Serbia).2) It allows one to look at the future blue-print of destruction for Europe. Although nothing was inevitable about the Holocaust and destruction of European Jewry (until Hitler and his henchmen made it happen), it is amazing how much detail and rough blueprint emerges from his turgid prose.3) It is conspiracy theory par excellance and shows how conspiracy theorists are able to take simple facts and inuendo and then turn them into mass edifices of supposed belief --- it is in fact the very antithesis of logical, scientific thinking.4) It shows how, in extreme form (along with Stalin and Pol Pot et al), how people can be regarded by the leader as theory fodder: eager to advance a grand idea of German domination and racial purity (whatever that is?) ---- willing to pound people into theory and crush the lives of individuals, including women and children, under the wheels of history, all in the name of warped conspiratorial views of the world.5) It is useful as a litmus test in benchmarking populist of today, from Mr. Pym Fortune to Pat Buchanan to Neo nationalists in China, Russia and the new Naziism of Jean Mari LePen. Of course, all are not the same. Some are more malevolent than others, but Mein Kampf offers a test in warped thinking and clearly allows one to make a distinction between the ideas of a populist and those of a megolomaniac.----I have had a copy of this book since I was 11 at my house. Of course I did not know how to interpret it when I was young --- it was a mere book written by an evil man. It is still a mere book written by an Evil Man, but it allows us insight in unmasking Evil and knowing its various guises. Mostly it allows us to judge between when people are engaging in merely shoddy thinking and when their thoughts turn evil."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"to him what he said was very true, he really believed what he was saying. he was an intelligent and well respected bavarian soldier, who for some reason became infatuated with the \\"threats of Marxism\\" and the annihilation of all foreigners specifically the those of jewsih descent. he didnt make himself leader the people made him leader, so they agreed with him. he shouldnt bear 100 percent of the blame. its a very interesting read, one can follow the trasformation that transpires within hitler through the course of the book. when i was reading it, he was justifying everything he stated, i dont remember reading any statements he didnt back up with personal information."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Delivery was prompt.

It is a preface to events that involved the entire world. As such, almost any interpretation or opinion of it will carry some bias. Therefore, if you want to know what it said, there is little alternative but to read it.Mein Kampf is a large book. Its literary style leaves a lot to be desired - particularly in terms of repetition. I'd worry at even the most ardent Nazi finding it a rivetting read from cover to cover. But that's not the point - who would you trust to abridge it and edit it for stylistic faults, without in the process tainting it with their own subjectivity?Buy this book. Read it. Form your own opinion."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Well, I've read this book (or tried to) quite a few times and I will admit that it is interesting in spots especially when Hitler describes his beer hall battles with the Reds and the socialists.Ridiculous in some parts, insightful in others, it is overly wordy and I am sure that in many places, Adolf, lost in his torrent of words, even forgets his train of thought until, a few pages later, he seems to find it again. He does this more or less throughout the whole book. What anyone else could say in ten words, Adolf uses 30, 40 or even 50. A good editing could have chopped Mein Kampf at least in half.The political concepts are typical to a half educated mind with an extraordinarily narrow outlook. Of course, he outlined what he intended to do and eventually did and for this reason alone, you can try reading the book but if you want philosophical enlightenment or insight, read Houston Stewart Chamberlain's 'Foundations of the Nineteenth Century' or Alfred Rosenberg's great work, 'The Myth of the Twentieth Century'.I believe each better explains many of the points and philosophical arguments Hitler is trying to make."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"To understand this book, you must first know its historical context. To call this book stupid and the author a maniac is quite a benighted judgment. I suggest that you first read The Rise and Fall of The Third Reich by William Shirer before reading this book. It gives you much of the historical context, and although some of Hitler's ideas may have been unreasonable, certainly by reading this book we understand a very important time period in world history. As Kant once said, &quot;Dare to know!&quot; Use your own judgment and don't take the opinions of everyone else so seriously."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"The time is 11:11pm, and right now, as it is pitch black and cold out, the time to review this book feels just right....First off, I am going to make a category as to weather or not I recommend you read this book, please identify which category you best fit in.YOU SHOULD/CAN READ THIS BOOK IF YOU:- Have a basic understanding and basic, no lie complete truth education as to what really happened in the second World War. If you studied World War Two even briefly and your parents taught you right from wrong, you should have no problems reading this book.YOU SHOULD NOT READ THIS BOOK IF:-You are the faint of heart and cannot tolerate any forms of racial remarks or profiling.-You DON'T know a thing about World War II, because at times if you read this and feel like you are siding with Hitler, I would recommend you place the book down immediately and watch the History Channel or the Military Channel.As stated above, if you feel like after you read some of Hitler's remarks and say \\"Jeez, this guy is starting to make me side with him\\". Please place the book down and continue on to something else. Also, if you find yourself in that category, you can stop reading this review now. Thanks, and happy trails.Now, to the people who fit in the first category and want to read this book, please make note before reading:Technically, this is not Hitler's autobiography. While at some parts he does mention his past, family, upbringing and so on and so forth, the book and whole is his thoughts on politics and how Germany essentially got \\"screwed over\\" after the First World War. The book contains rants, political thoughts, autobiographical pieces, and a few others, but in whole, the book is rantings and political thoughts of a mad man. If you are studying Hitler, there are hundreds of biographies on the man. I would recommend reading one of those and then reading this to get the whole picture if you will.Also, this book was written in the mid to late 1920's, before any of the terrible events unfolded in World War II, so no, while Hitler clearly expresses his hate of the Jewish people, it does not mention the Holocaust or anything as the event had yet to begin. Hitler wrote this while in prison for his \\"political\\" beliefs (and I use the term \\"political beliefs\\" very sparingly considering the horrendous and inexcusable acts that occurred in Nazi Germany.Now, on to the review:First off, I would probably recommend a different version of Mein Kampf. While the Ralph Manheim translation which I own is okay, there are noticeable spelling errors in parts that could confuse the reader. I bought this copy because it was all they had at Border's when they were closing.Hitler was not a genius, contrary to popular belief of some. He did seem genius at times, but in all of the wrong places, like convincing a people of a religion to come to Germany to find work and instead they were killed. Not cool. Hitler rose to power because in the post-war Wiemar Republic, the economy was in absolute shambles (The Mark, the currency of Germany, worthless. And no, not like a penny worthless, it was literally sold as wastepaper rather than used as money.) The Treaty of Versailles bankrupted Germany and unemployment was rampant. According to many, Hitler was a great speaker, although I am sure if a lab mouse went up to the podium before Hitler and said \\"employment opportunities for all!\\" The people of Germany probably would have followed the mouse. Not that they are stupid in the least, but at a time when turmoil was the only thing around, if anybody had a plan, they were essentially tricked into following them, like they followed Hitler.Essentially, the book is just one big rambling of a mad man. Clocking in at about 380 pages, it is not very long, but literally if someone went on a big rant and wrote it all down, their rant would be like this book. Since you are reading this review because you have basic knowledge of the Second World War, you know what Hitler hated and his political views, and really they are all gathered in one place.I would not recommend reading this book in public, like the train station, airport, park, etc. as you are sure to get a look, even if you were just reading it to see how long one man's hate and sideways political views could go on. Read it in your study, with a nice pipe and a roaring fire, then maybe throw it in the fire afterwords.On a final note, it is not really that bad of a book if you have the basic knowledge to understand Hitler, but at times it is certainly stodgy, dull and generally outright boring. Read at your own risk.S.O."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"The five stars are given to this book solely for its historical significance.

This is fallacious. Hitler said, \\"Here too one believed that one could bring about a Germanization of the Polish element by a purely linguistic integration into the German nationality. Here too the result would have been an unfortunate one: people of an alien race, expressing its alien thoughts in the German language, compromising the height and the dignity of our own nationality by its own inferiority.\\" (p. 590). (During the later German occupation of Poland, the \\"Germanization\\" of selected Poles was actually a re-Germanization of ethnic Germans who had previously become Polonized.)We sometimes hear the claim that the German people voted for Hitler, in free elections, without realizing the fact that he would start a major war. Perhaps, some say, Hitler would be, at worst, content with a little war to rectify the \\"injustices\\" of Versailles. In actuality, there is much more to MEIN KAMPF than the customary German self-pity regarding WWI and Versailles. Clear proof that the Fuhrer had long planned a war of massive conquest and extermination, against the Slavic peoples, is provided by his following statements regarding lebensraum: \\"Neither eastern nor western orientation should be the future goal of our foreign policy, but an eastern policy signifying the acquisition of the necessary soil for our German people.\\" (pp. 965-966). (Later, the Nazis spoke of \\"resettlement\\" of Jews and Slavs. In time, \\"resettlement\\" evolved into a euphemism for extermination.)"},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"This book is really something that one should take the time for, it is not an easy read, especially not in German, and the book is also not very exciting, it is, after all, a political book. Some people seem offended that I own this book, when they see it on my shelf, some dare not say anything, afraid i might be some kind of neo nazi, but Mein Kampf is one of the best selling books ever published, and it had a great impact on those who read it during it's time of first publishing.People simply look at Hitler as being this disturbed man, who was just dangerous to everyone, and should never have been alive, but there is more to Hitler than hatred. He had the power to convince millions of people that he could change their economical, social and political situation, he influenced and inspired them. He was a brilliant man, although also said to be mentally ill, possibly schizophrenic.People are scared of young adults reading Mein Kampf and being influenced by it, but in order to prevent something like this from happening again, we should look at the situation at that time, we can read this book and learn from it, find out what drove Adolf Hitler to this. I believe this is a book more people should read and learn from, instead of fearing it and the man behind it.But beware, it's not an easy read."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"The edition of MEIN KAMPF I am reviewing here is the Murphy translation, different from the Manaheim translation which can be purchased in most book stores. It has this grainy, purple-colored picture of Hitler on the front in a Nazi uniform, and the spine is bright yellow with the title written in massive red letters. Most of the people who condemn this book so harshly probably did not read it, and have only a superficial, media-produced idea of what National Socialism/Nazism was all-about. Ho-hum--So self-righteous, so sanctimonious.The style of MEIN KAMPF is very drawn out and highly technical and detailed, presented in the form of an autiobiographical, philosphical, political, social and quasi-spiritual diatribe. The prevailing theme of much of the first part is Hitler's frustration with the military alliance between Germany and Austria-Hungary. He felt that the Germans should all live in one country, rather than there being a Germany and an empire ruled by Germans (the Austro-Hungarian Empire) over various ethnic groups in Eastern Europe. I don't consider myself any kind authority on this period of time in the late 19th and early 20th century in central Europe, but some type of understanding of the political structure in place in Austria-Hungary and Germany is necessary to understand what Hitler is talking about, otherwise it will just seem like endless rambling. Hitler writes about his expiriences in WWI, and praises the heroism of the German army in the conflict. Germany not only held off both Britain and France on the Western Front, but was also free to battle at will with its enemies on the east and south, and (until 1918 before Marxist inspired workers' strikes), maintain the upper hand. Hitler analyzes the use of propaganda between the two sides and concludes that the Allies had the upper hand in influencing morale for their cause. Britain was especially successful in portraying the Germans as the 'Huns' who committed terrible atrocites so that the Allied troops would not be as shocked going into the war as the German soldiers were, whose propaganda portrayed the Allies as silly weaklings, which was obviously not true. Hitler understood well the workings of propaganda and how it can be used as a soft-core form of government mind-control. There is nothing different from Hitler's description and use of it and how it is used by the news and entertainment media in America today.There are many anti-Jewish statements strewn throughout MEIN KAMPF, but they are not so much to be as shocking as many would think. The 'anti-Semitism' is more assumed than explained, but the explanation involves the Nazi theory of a three-tiered racial makup of mankind which determines human interaction between cultural and religious groups. The \\"founders of culture\\" are the mythical Aryans. All ancient cultural, religious and other developments can be traced to them, even though Hitler never explains who they are, or how they could be related to Germans. The \\"preservers of culture\\" are those who got culture from the Aryans, but stagnated after the Aryans interbreeded with those of lesser racial stock. The only apparent \\"preservers of culture\\" that Hitler mentions here are the Japanese. The Jews are the \\"destroyers of culture.\\" Hitler criticizes them for using their religion to justify a racial-preservation group tactic. Hitler does not cite any sources as to where he got this information, and MEIN KAMPF generally relies on the readers' percieved, innate, subjective insight regarding racial and social issues. Throughout are descriptions of the state controlled eugenic social policies that would be in place once the Nazis gained power in Germany.The last third or so of the book is dedicated to retelling the story of the National Socialist Movement and especially Hitler's personal perspectives and recollections on it. Highlited are the Nazi organizational sturcture and its struggles against the Marxists."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"I'm reviewing this particular edition of Mein Kampf, not the book itself or Hitler's arguments. If you just want to understand what Hitler's philosophy was, this is fine and inexpensive.HOWEVER, I bought this for research purposes, and have found that the translation is sloppy. Moreover, it is full of typos and I find it difficult to believe it was even proof-read before going to print. For example it has Hitler referring to a battle in \\"1948\\", when it is obviously 1848. Another example: \\"It would be a stake to think that the followers of various political parties...\\". Surely that should be \\"mistake\\", not \\"stake\\". Unfortunately this edition is riddled with errors such as this, which is only a reflection of lazy translation and proofing. As a result, I can't be 100% sure that it is accurate, so will have to cross-reference with another edition."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Here it is, straight from the man himself. Called everything from garbage to a Satanic Bible, Mein Kampf is the written words of one of history's most important figures, Adolf Hitler. \\"My Struggle\\" was taken down in prison where Hitler was incarcerated for his failed Munich coup in 1923. Hitler waxes philosophical about his early life and aspirations, government, and a new program to lift Germany to dominance. The book is kind of tough to read at times, but other passages are remarkably lucid. This is probably due to the fact that it is a dictated account. There is endless repetition and congealed passages that will make you shake your head in incomprehension. I think the best hope for reading this book is to try and come away with the general themes of what Hitler is trying to say. Try not to get bogged down in the details or you're a goner.Hitler begins the book by discussing his childhood. His father and him argued incessantly over what career Hitler should pursue. Hitler won by default (his parents died) and chose to pursue his dream of painting. He spent time in Vienna, where he began to form opinions on Marxism and Judaism. Long sections follow on Hitler's experiences in World War I, the Jews, and the failures of democracy. German foreign policy, along with its failures, is discussed in detail. Hitler never provides much evidence for his arguments, except for his condemnation of democracy, which is right on the money. Interspersed throughout his long discussions on politics and race are accounts of the rise of the NSDAP, or Nazi party. This is probably the most interesting part of the book, as Hitler outlines the growth of the party up until the Munich putsch.I suspect most people will read this book to find out what Hitler says about the Jews. Hitler does discuss the Jews, mainly by outlining how the Jews gain dominance over the gentiles throughout history. Hitler sees Marxism as a Jewish phenomenon designed to enslave the Aryan world. The international financial system is seen as the cause of World War I. This same system is also described as a tool of the Jews. Hitler believed that the Jews sabotaged the German war effort from behind the lines. Jews are referred to as parasites and less than human. In general, most of the book is not about Jews, but concerns politics. The copy I bought was in the history section under Germany/Austria.At times turgid and fascinating, you'll never forget reading Mein Kampf. I enjoyed this translation. I expected to see some raving monster. Instead, we see a political animal with some intense views. This book is must read for historians and World War II buffs."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"My review is about this particular translation and not necessarily the content. I have always had an interest in WWII and decided to finally read the book that Hitler wrote. I must say I wish I had done more research before buying any edition.I first bought this edition. I had no idea that there were different English translations at the time. This one is by Manheim. When I started reading it I was puzzled. It did not make sense to me. Not only was it so poorly written that many parts did not make sense, it also made no sense to me why some of the sentences would be structured in such an odd way. It also did not sound anything like Hitler to me, though I did really not know what he sounded like this certainly was not it. This sounded wrong to me. I had to look again and see if it was really Hitler's book it was so poorly written. It turns out it was NOT Hitler's book. This Manheim edition is not actually Hitler's words but an \\"interpretation\\" of his words by Manheim. The foreword sets the tone and makes it clear that the translation is not unbiased. Since purchasing this book I have done more research and I have seen claims that Manheim intentionally produced a poor quality translation to make Hitler look rambling and to make it hard to read. I tend to believe this, though it sounds conspiritorial to me, it does make sense. It would explain why such a bad translation was ever published. It is clearly harder to read than the other two major translations by Murphy and Ford.I find it hard to believe a publisher would even publish something this poorly copywritten. It has several obvious errors, such as claiming a battle occurred in 1945 when it should have been 1845 and the book was written in 1924 so it is obviously not 1945. You would think the publisher would fix something like this after publishing it since 1943 but it is only one of many errors in this edition which have never been fixed. Many parts are left in German which is never translated and overall the English is simply ghastly. It sounds like someone who spoke English as a second language and their first language was not German tried to translate it. At the end of almost every sentence I scratched me head and asked why in the world anyone would write a sentence like that. It is just terrible so I do not recommend Manheim's translation. There are also no historical notes in the book, just cryptic footnotes that are either in German, or make no real sense. Manheim's book was a waste of time and money. I gave up 100 pages into the book. I almost dismissed it as a bad book thinking Hitler was rambling but then I saw a forum post that compared different versions so I took another look at the different versions of Mein Kampf. Some people have claimed Manheim intentionally wrote this way to make Hitler sound disjointed and rambling...I would not go that far, but I would suggest he was unqualified to translate Mein Kampf.James Murphy also wrote a translation which is good and much easier to read, however it is also much shorter than the original German editions. I am not sure what was cut but I did not want to read Murphy's abridged version.I later found the Ford translation(also here on Amazon with the black cover and white drawing of Hitler in profile, so make sure you get that one) and it is much better. It is easier to read and has lots of historical notes which help to put Hitler's words in a historical perspective. If you want to actually understand Hitler's words, get the Ford translation instead.As for the book itself. I loved it!! I found it very compelling and an interesting perspective of history. I would not suggest anyone read it in isolation though. There are a number of other good books on Hitler and his life and career which you should read too to put everything in perspective. Just make sure you get the Ford version and not the older Manheim version which is unreadable.This is the one to getMein Kampf (The Ford Translation)"},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Many say this translation, The Manheim, though filled with anti-Hitler footnotes, remains truest to the original.Houghton Mifflin published a translation by Ralph Manheim in 1943 to avoid having to share their profits with Reynal & Hitchcock. They also wanted to offer a more readable translation. The Manheim translation was first published in England by Hurst & Blackett in 1969.There are numerous errors in this translation, however. And it doesn't identify a number of important references. Moreover, it omits examples or even mistranslates common sayings of Hitler.When Manheim was unsure of a word (for example Sheepshead meaning the Bavarian card game), he left it untranslated in the original German.Some passages are also missing from the Manheim translation, most likely due to the fact that he could not translate them or did not understand them.Finally, Manheim's translator's note in the front of his translation show his is a biased translation.Little needs to be said about the words of Hitler. I enjoy reading Mein Kampf. That certainly is not an endorsement of the man or his movement. Mein Kampf is an interesting look into the mind of this man and it is interesting how we can see some of the same characteristics running in numerous people in office today. If we don't know history, we're apt to repeat it.Indeed, Hitler might even have won a Nobel Peace Prize based on his promises and the excitement he created in people before they really got to know him had the prize been given in those days! Certainly such greats as JFK and Churchill gave him glowing compliments.Why did people follow Hitler? Knowing what we do now, it's easy to think the German people were stupid. The truth is the country had suffered a severe punishing war and hyperinflation -- money was worthless. They needed a real leader.Hitler promised everyone everything. He was just the \\"right\\" person for that particular time. If times had been different, he would not have risen to power in all likelihood.I find Hitler part genius, part psychopath.The book -- no matter what translation -- is a must-read. It's a classic. It's a book that gives you insight into one of the most important minds of the 20th Century and in all of history.Why should you read any translation of Mein Kampf? Sun Tzu said you must know your enemy. We read about those we regard as dangerous, or wrong or criminal in order to avoid that type of individual ever encroaching into power again. We also read to understand that person in relationship to the times in which he lived.Just as Hitler knew his dreaded enemy, the Communist Party and Karl Marx, we should know Hitler, the Fascist dictator. Hitler didn't take on an issue or an enemy without knowing it inside-out. In that regard, he was brilliant. He knew what he was fighting. He knew the enemy.I recommend Mein Kampf (The Ford Translation) to you. Although I do find the Manheim translation better than most previous to Ford. I also recommend Mein Kampf Official Nazi Translation to you.- Susanna K. Hutcheson"},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Adolf Hitler was one of the most loved and hated men of the20th Century. In \\"Mein Kampf\\" we learn about the author'schildhood, the collapse of Germany in 1918, the founding of his National Socialist German Worker's Party and the abortive Beer Hall Putsch of 1923 which sent Herr Hitler to Landsberg Prison where he wrote his famous book. The author goes into detail on policy questions which will later be realized just before and during the Second World War. The book is said to be very prophetic in that sense. Any rumors of the difficulty in reading the work are false; it is easy to read and highly interesting. In short, this book is a must for those wishing to gain a more thorough understanding of German National Socialism and its creator."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"According to the Preface, this book was not written for the purpose to make friends or influence people. The design from conception is to chronicle a movement, not create one.As a whole one can have an opinion as to the results of the book. However with out reading it the opinion has no chance to be informed. Another flaw with not reading this work is that you are relying on others opinions and inferences. Taking most of the statements and conclusions from this book and displaying them separately you would be surprised as to how many you would agree with.Just a sample of what is on the inside:\\"I know people who \`read' enormously, Book for book, letter for letter, yet whom I would not describe as \`well-read.' True they possess a mass of \`knowledge,' but their brain is unable to organize and register the material they have taken in... For reading is no end in itself, but a means to an end.\\"These are not platitudes but examples of observations of the time, which you can see are timeless.Once in a while the reading may seem redundant but it is the nature of writing for the time and place. So again this book is a must read. I have no preference as to translation."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"This particular version of Mein Kampf by Ralph Manhein is by far the best. It captures the true essence of Hitler's thought in a readable, accessable English. Part of this is due to the fact that it was written before the defeat of the Third Reich, before a great deal of politically correct babble entered the discourse about this important political work. Hitler's thoughts on International Judaism and the long-term threat it poses to the West come across clearly. In other translations, Hitler is made out to look like some sort of monster, while Manhein makes clear that he was simply a somewhat misguided German patriot. A must for anyone trying to understand the real history of the 1933-1945"},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"To berate this author's book, passing it off as simply \\"rambling,\\" is to deny passing on the message the Holocaust survivors want us most to deliver: \\"Always remember, and never forget.\\" To discount it as boring or confusing simply means the reader must educate himself with history, desire to learn about issues outside his own environment and current events, and most importantly - read more in order to get a better vocabulary so it won't seem so confusing.Upon first hearing that Hitler was a high-school dropout and before reading Mein Kampf, I figured it was his lack of education that gave way to his feelings - and actions - on racism. Throw in a little economic failure with a society desperate for WWI revenge, and you have the perfect recipe that needs only an uneducated schitzo like Hitler to concoct the horror that ensued. Oh, no, indeed. Rather, the opposite holds true: High school was far too simple for Hitler, who, unlike our own youth, thirsted for knowledge in the subjects our youth find tedious. It is when you WANT to learn and educate your SELF, rather than a school teacher assigning it to you that you truly learn and internalize anything.It was in Hitler's thirst for knowledge of history, culture, society and his internalization of it that he conceived applying his knowledge to an entire nation by \\"saving\\" them from destruction. Was Hitler moral? Not by our standards. Was he correct? Not by our standards. But it is only in lending yourself to different thoughts than your own in past time periods and economies that we will learn FROM it so as to STOP it dead in its tracks in the future.The most asked questions about the Holocaust, \\"HOW could he do what he did to so many people, and WHY?\\" starts HERE, with this book. A must read for anyone remotely interested in learning not just about Hitler, the Holocaust and Hitler's ideologies, but in responsibly educating oneself so as to possibly become a positive force in society's future. To think another \\"Hitler\\" cannot arise again is to have the attitudes and actions behind tossing this book aside, sticking one's head in the sand, and flipping on the television again so as not to miss out on one's daily vegetation into ignorance and complacency."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"This book is an excellent journey into the mind of Adolf Hitler. The author, Adolf Hitler, writes his struggle in shocking detail. Every reader in America should read this book to understand the mind of one of the most influencial leaders of all time. Regardless, of personal feelings about the man, he still was the one dictator to single-handedly transformed a country in shambles, to a counrty taking over the world. No politician has ever done what Hitler did. Adolf Hitler vividly depicts his life the way he saw it, not the way we all interpret it. If one reads this book one can fully understand the causes of World War II and understand fully where the Germans came from. Many readers will think differently after reading this book."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Hitler really was a very clever man. Although this book was written around 80 years ago, it is still relevant in today's corrupt and decadent world. Note especially his astute comments and observations on poverty and international finance.You could say that he foresaw the future that we are now living in."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Having read this book several times, I must admit that it is certainly one or perhaps the greatest books of the 20th century. As such, it comes as no surprise that its wide distribution rivaled that of the bible if not surpassed it for a period.While for many it may be difficult reading at first, some thinking that there are constant repetitions or odd sometimes mixed analogies, one needs only to realize that this type of artistic style merely reflects the newspaper literature of the time in this area. Obviously for the more fortunate, the original German version is the best read. Much is always lost in translation.If one realizes that this book was purchased by people all over the world at the time of its writing and people found great interest in its content, it comes as no surprise that this intense treatise is still of great interest to people all over the world today.This book written by the infamous Austrian author, Hitler, is a must read for everyone. Tis' nature, all will come out of this book with varying reactions. But I assume this is what the Austrian author had in mind. And he most certainly succeeded in this."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Mien Kampf is an interesting, Maciavelian look into the thoughts of one of the worlds most hated and loved men. Adolf Hitler expresses his excellent points and views on the twisted world we live in, it also dives into his past an experiences in this cruel world. Hitler talks of the flaws of society and how one person is good, yet people are bad. He disects his personal teenage and adult hood experiences and makes a point of it, such as nationalism, how History is an improtant factor and should be studied although we can never really find absolute &quot;truth&quot; (DON'T BE NHILISTIC! ), How society is heavily weighted towards the rich and how the hard working man or woman ends up with the short end of the stick. He explains his art of reading, and his massive intrest in politics. He also goes into trade unions and the politics wrapped and weaved within. He was an avid patriot of his home country, Germany, he talks and talks about his country, and the flaws in the war and the alliances within. He was a very educated and very deep in his thoughts, He was a very smart man, untill he decided to attempt to take over the world. after all he demonstrated once more that the greatest form of consealment is the broadest of publicity."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Hitler advances several historical and racial theories in this book, none of which he supports with any evidence--because they are in fact false. For example, his discussion of Jewish advisors to German princes, how the princes are gradually corrupted by the Jewish cousnelors, and how they then become hated by the population, how the Jews then suck the life out of the &quot;host nation&quot; has no historical support: Hitler doesn't even present one example of how and when this ever happened. Most of his racial theories are refuted by a simple observation: the eras of great creativity in European history, namely Classical Greece and Renaissance Italy, were produced by highly mixed peoples. Hitler, who adored but totally misunderstood Nietzsche should have read the philosopher better (in fact no evidence exists that Hitler ever read adequately Nietzsche himself): Nietzsche says &quot;All high culture results from a _mixture_ of races.&quot; But I'm not going to spend my time exonerating Nietzsche from the Nazi myth here: this task has already been accomplished by respected scholars, viz. Walter Kaufmann.As for Christianity, it is wrong to say Hitler wanted to build Germany on Christian principles or that the Holocaust, Nazism, etc., was caused by Christianity. &quot;One can be a German or one can be a Christian. One cannot be both,&quot; said Hitler. The Nazi success was possible because the Christian moral code had been all but destroyed and replaced by Prussian state-worship and Nazi race-worship. Hitler had to fight Christian groups and Christianity (he was _not_ supported by the Pope) and had to subvert them to a Nazi, un-Christian ideology before he could gain complete control. The reviews below my own which imply otherwise are uninformed and are following the propaganda of the Holocaust Museum and other groups who do not seek to inform, but to convince."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"you cant judge why a tyrant did all his actions without knowing the way he thinks so i have decided to read his book a big one i dont know when i'll start to read it"},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"I've always been interested in reading Mein Kampf but couldn't find an English copy that suited me as far as appearance goes. It's terrible to find a copy in English only to find a massive prologue and an entire back cover paragraph telling the reader how horrible Germans are and that everything Hitler ever did was bad.From reading thus far I've found that the man was very, very smart. Some of my ideas regarding the corruption in modern day western politics have been further explained by the begining chapters and I've actually learned quite a bit of history as well."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"I dont understand, to begin with, all the reviews of how difficult a read this book is. In the context of the times, any person interested in history will have a full understanding of Germany from the early 1900s to the time this book was written. Personally I think for the subject matter Hitler did in fact practice what he preached-\\"All propaganda has to be popular and has to accommodate itself to the comprehension of the least intelligent of those whom it seeks to reach.\\" With short sentences and alot of breaks this book flies by. Also he is repetitive to the point that even the slowest learners are pounded again and again, with slight variances to the same points, examples- The November criminals, parliamentarianism-which is my favorite, Jews and so on and so forth.Do you think that what he says has any significance not just in understanding the past but also the future? For example, his ravings against stock exchange and international markets. The idea that once a society does put money above all else, the government loses its real reasons for existing, which according to Hitler are not economic, but rather to protect the culture and nationality of a people. Once the government worships money as the true god, a country falls into decadence. Here, I will admit I agree with Hitler, which would automatically classify me as a \\"neo-nazi\\", but thats far from the case. I dont agree with the belief that the jews were at fault, I cant, because of my ethnicity, agree with the aryan race domination, but damn its hard to disagree with Hitler when it comes to social and governmental issues. His ability to classify all enemies into one group was either his genius or madness, or both. Now, communism, marxism, social democracy, parliamentarianism, the lost war and even syphilis are all due to one enemy-The Jew.This book is a must read, not only for its historical value but also to understand the future.This book was not written by the Hitler we all know today, but an ambitious Hitler before his rise to power. A clear picture develops of a man who was no longer a nobody, the Beer Hall Putsch gave him his first taste of fame and power. Also noteworthy are not only his analysis of historical events, but his predictions of the future of Germany and the world."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"My husband wanted to read this book for a long time.

It definitely lets the reader into the mind of Adolf Hitler and his life prior to when he became the Hitler we all know. After reading this, it is suprising anyone allowed him to get so powerful (remember, he became dictator legally in Germany). This is a LONG and dense book filled with hate but it's a book that must be read if one wants to understand the Holocaust, Adolf Hitler, and World War II. Any historian should definitely read this, as well as history buffs."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Mein Kampf is an interesting and powerful book to be sure. The book is not solely about the Jews, but I am writing my review in reference to Hitler's assertions therein, mostly because I am extremely disturbed by the content of many of the previous reviews. Hitler was a powerful figure, and obviously powerful still.I was patently shocked how many reviewers were taken in by Hitler's ongoing method of argument. Throughout the book, he makes his points by randomly refering to various notions, texts and occurences to prove his own inaccurate points. Because he stipulates various references, he manages to appear educated and convincing. This is particluarly true the case in Hitler's discussion of the Jews where he randomly refers to Jewish ideals and texts for his own end. What I found most interesting was precisly how little Hitler understood Judaism (although one uneducated reviewer asserts the oppposite), a faith, a philosophy, and ethnicity but not a race. What I found most alarming about many of the reviews was that people, even after all that has happened, bought into his various lines of reasoning on so many subjects, even those outside Judaism. His assertions, particularly about the Talmud, are are vague and highly misconstrued. Judaism is a philosphical religion, an as such is open to ongoing debate at all times even in the 21st century. I was floored by one reviewer who uses Hitler's own tactics to his make outlandish statments about the work of Talmud and Maimonedes, a topic on which he has no keen undertanding.For sure, Hitler is right about the Talmud in one respect: it is about life today, this moment and how to live it respectfully and well (although Hitler interprets this as a defect). While Christianity focuses on resurrection, Judaism focuses on the now, for tomorrow is uncertain and may not exist; for Jews, the afterlife, at best, is a shadowy thing.The fact of the matter remains that Judaism is the only religion in which God accepts ALL people so long as they are good; Judaism does not define goodness by Jewishness, but by goodness itself; belief in Judaism is not required. You do not have to be one of \\"The Chosen,\\" a term which Hitler throws around in incite his readers, to be worthy. (To be \\"Chosen\\" in Judaism actually means that you are one who has accepted the burden 613, often contradictory, laws. Those who are not \\"Chosen\\" must only accept 7, very easy and innately human laws of behavior.)Mein Kampf is an important book and is hard to rate because it's can't be subject to \\"good\\" or \\"bad;\\" it stands outside such clear distinctions. It simply IS. While reading Mein Kampf I can only suggest that you read critically and take his assertions on all subjects with a grain of salt. It is arduous, self-serving and covertly incomplete. If you are at all interested in Hitler mind, this book is an obvious go to. It has people repeating and thus validating his injustices even now."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"One of the most powerful books I have ever read, Mein Kampf gives the reader a personal look into the life of Adolf Hitler. His views were strong from when he was young, and all it took was for him to get into power to achieve his goals. The fact that such a man could do what Hitler did is so terrifying, and this book is a great look into all that this man was. It is a good histrical piece and very important to the people of the world."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"At my first attempt in reading this &quot;book&quot;, I could not follow it, keep interested, relate. I then read various books on WWI, Wilson, repatriations, and the BIS to get myself to be in the mind-set of the average German in 1931. I was then unable to put this &quot;book&quot; down. I was excited to read it, couldn't wait to get my hands on it, actually quoted from it. Now as I step back, I think I realized what happened in those days of Hitler's rise to power. The human mind is a very complex and persuadable thing. The pen is indeed mightier than the sword, and much more deadly. As a well educated, peace loving, follower of Schweitzer, I shudder everytime I think about this &quot;book&quot;. How many more &quot;Mein Kampfs&quot; are out there?"},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"When you read this book, you can understand why Hitler started the WWII. This book was written by Hitler, after WWI, while he was jailed. You must read this book with an open mind, because it explains, with details, the origin of hate Hilter felt to the jewish and russians. If you're a lover on History, you must read this book."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Mein Kamph is an ingenious work straight from one of the most intelligent minds (albeit twisted and warped) of our century. Most people will complain of the book's legnth, choice of language and topics, and its sometimes illogical arguments. But you must remember that this book is not a check list of how to do things. I compare it to The Polotics (Aristotle) and the The Prince (Machiavilli). It is more of a text book than literature. It offers Hitler's plans, ideas and suggestions. This Book can be very dangerous in the wrong hands, but very inlightening in the right ones."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"The translation is fine. The content is delusional, spacey, and generally badly written. My reason for reading the book is to try to understand how hitler's Germany could have existed.

From erudite consideration to all-out rant, it's an illuminating peek into his pre-war thought processes.The linguistic style is convoluted and it does take some stamina to get through 628 pages.This edition is marred by the editors sycophantic apologetic commentary. The books stands by itself as an historic artefact; there was no need to apologise for publishing it. Editors' time would have been better spent on explanatory and contextual notes.I've not researched the original content enough to determine whether the translation was accurate or not. Other reviewers believe it not to be, so you may want to consider another edition."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Want to know what went on in the mind of one of the worlds most famous tirants? Then go ask him. Oh no you cant, so read this instead.Its well written and shows a seriously twisted mind, and acts as a warning to what a twisted mind can achieve given the right circumstances and motivation.Dont buy this if you expect a cheap jew-bashing novel, but do buy this if you think you can handle a well built up argument as to exactly why Hitler believed what he did."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"A 350+ page anti-liberal, bigoted rant. It is riddled with deliberate mis-interpretations of the accepted scientific theory of evolution, natural selection, and 'survival of the fittest', circular reasoning, christian apologetics, outright racism, and baseless anti-Jewish propaganda. The only value this book has to a modern, free society is as a primary historical source and insight into the psyche of the original author. I bought this book as a supplement for my latest Open University module (Religion in History) which will take me halfway through a history degree. (The principal importance of the study of history is to avoid repetition of humanity's past mistakes.)"},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"This is a truly remarkable work of political philosophy. It's nice to have a new translation. Unless you know the original language, you might consider collecting all the different translations. What is fascinating about Hitler is how ambitious he was and how innovative he was. Imagine, your country is under control by rich people who beckon to the political action committees of a foreign nation, and some man comes along and tears it all down and restores your nation's dignity. I recommend this book to populist voters and independents who are in search of inspiration. Key to Hitler's success was determination and organization. His party also had an excellent public image. I'm sorry, but skin head hoodlums with tattoos on their face isn't going to attract people to conservative causes. Speakers attired in nice clothes, military or civilian, should be the status quo. Contrary to the revisionist history pumped in the media, Hitler was not a bad man nor a murderer nor a madman. Reading this book should make that clear. Aside from his oddball racial theories about evolution Hitler provides a sound thesis about how that foreign nation seeks to undermine all standards of the West: moral standards, artistic standards, business practice standards and so on. He is an inspiration for europeans of every nation who have been made the scape goat of other nationals shortcomings. Hitler was a true visionary whose vision of unadulterated european culture will inevitably come to pass in the future."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"During the Nazi Era, this book was the most un-read bestseller in Europe. Lots of people purchased the volume, but very few took the time to read it.Therein lies a tragedy; Hitler had outlined his entire diabolical program before it was carried out. In Mein Kampf, Hitler's evil blueprint was laid out in detail, but nobody knew much about it because they didn't take the time to read it.This book is putrid and evil, but revealing."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"I was disappointed that the cover did not match the one shown. Mine is black without any symbol. Not nearly as cool looking as the blue photo."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Adolf Hitler does an credible job of providing the reading about the history of his life, philosophy, and nation before he peacefully took power in the 1930's. The very fact that Hitler was an artist(his specialty was oil-painting), becomes understandably apparent after reading &quot;Mein Kampf.&quot; Simply put, this author creates a book that is a literary representation of art.The literary stile that Adolf Hitler uses reads like a novel. Some have said that his book may drag at certain points, I would only argue that Hitler's artistic nature becomes translated into an immeasurable literary genius. But in the sense that Hitlers literary composition may &quot;drag&quot; for some readers, I recommend the book &quot;Nature's Eternal Religion&quot; by Ben Klassen. Klassen's book provides a more modern perspective for the reader that most people in the 21st century just can't understand with works such as &quot;Mein Kampf.&quot;"},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"This book was great! I think people should really take the time to read and appreciate a book like this. Althouh this book was a mind scrambler and was written by a horrable human being, it really gives you the insight look in Adolf Hitlers' mind. Some parts were exaggerated if you ask me but i think everyone does. It's so amazing to read this book because you can sometimes agree with some of the points he made. I really think this book helps you find out a lot of our history. So i really think you should read it."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Actualy i did not read the book yet but for me as a son of holocost second genetion its very interesing to read how a person become a monster full of haterred to others but unfortunately is was extreme among all other people who hain power by deploying this dark and absurd thinking"},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"No matter what you think of Hitler's philosophy, this book is poorly written.

As a valuable historical text, this is insurmountable."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"An excellent look into the mind of Adolf Hitler. It works like a psychological study of one of the most infamous leaders in history. The autobiographical nature of the book tells the story of Hitler's life without the bias of a historian, just the first-person bias of Hitler."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Whether just badly written or badly translated, Mein Kampf is a tough read in English. The most interesting parts are the action plans Hitler had in mind for the National Socialists. His insights into the vapidness of the media and the political timidity of the average citizen are quite acute. But this is far outweighed by the unsupported theorizing on race and history and by the Jew-baiting. This was a man in a hurry, who couldn't spare the time to research or re-write this very rough draft, although in the end it did him ample service as it was."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Mein Kampf is exactly like what it is infamous for.

The problem with this whole&quot;Hitler in his own words&quot; thing is that this isn't an organized manifesto at all. It doesn't even qualify as a decent rant. It reads like what it is, a transcribed series of demented monologes dictated by *der Adolf* while he was cooling his heels in jail after the failed Munich *putsch*. Sure it's all in there, the Holocaust, the war, the whole schmeer, but who can wade through the morass of turgid prose to find it? Who would want to? Imagine reading a transcript of fifty drunken, disjointed, endless *speils* by your racist old uncle against Jews, bankers, Communists and whoever else he had decided to hate that day.

The tittle, when translated into English means My Struggle. Personally, my struggle was just getting through the first half of the book! I only hope that this look lost some of its meaning when it was translated from German. That would be a pretty good excuse for a book that was very confusing. Hitler uses analogies to explain everything. I wish he would have just come out and say what was on his mind. This would have saved me a lot of time. I have to admit, once you read through this book, it does start to make more sense. What he says explains why he hated the Jews so much. I just think that a 700 hundred-page book on Hitler's political views is a little too much. But, if you like long books about European politics, this is the book for you, but I wouldn't recommend it."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"When I read MEIN KAMPF(in the following MK) some weeks ago for the first time, I saw that all the trouble about this book is nothing but nonsense. MK is a book about the thoughts, ideology and fanatism of a man, whose horrible madness brought the second World War. I cannot understand, why a book like MK is a kind of bible for some people. It is terribly written, full of grammatical and orthographical errors; the most terrible German I have ever read. Because of being a history student, I can only see an advantage of reading this &quot;work of art&quot;; only to understand the ideas that made the ideology of the WWII. This book is worth to be bought only, when the background is known. Without the background, this book is nothing but dirt, just the thoughts of a madman. The only right way to use this &quot;thing&quot; is to read it together with books like Winston Churchill's &quot;The Second World War&quot; and the Hitler biographies by Joachim Fest or Ian Kershaw."},{"Title":"Mein Kampf","review":"This book has got to be the most influencial book that one can read.

The sections dealing with each Epistle begins with an explanation of the background of the Epistle, its believed audience, the literary types employed and the issues addressed in each work.The initial issue is the identity of the authors. While little is known about the author in either case, Kugelman presents the theories and the best conclusions that can be reached.The dearth of attention devoted to these Epistles may derive from their controversy. The status of either of them as inspired was a matter of dispute when the Canon was being defined. One could say that they barely made the cut. James became a subject of even greater controversy at the time of the Protestant Revolt due to the apparent conflict between James' emphasis on the importance of works and the Pauline emphasis on faith. The author does an excellent of comparing and contrasting the positions of each and concludes that there is no conflict and that, in their original meaning, their doctrines of salvation are complementary.Jude has interesting issues of its own, including its reference to apocryphal works, which raised questions of its Divine inspiration.Although these books get relatively little attention, no part of Scripture is unworthy of notice. This book helped me to gain a greater understanding of these two works. That makes it a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The World of Words","review":"This book is great.

This book was the worst Ravenloft book ever written - and that's saying a lot! No one I know liked it, so it is suprising to me that it is so 'hard to get.' I wish I'd never read it."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"I thought this book was one of the most depressing books I've ever read and I'm an avid reader. If this was the first Hamilton book I picked up I'd never read another. However I do know this is not the norm for her. I was left unsatistied and very sad about the fate of the characters that you had come to care about by the end (charachters were well written, just not the plot). Please don't waste your time with this one."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"I have been a long follower of the works of Laurell K. Hamilton, and she sure doesn't disappoint in this new world of hers.Death of a Darklord is just that, dark, and I highly recommend it.The characters are captivating and interesting, and the main characters development through the novel is intruiging, with a majorly surprise twist concerning her budding powers.I hope Laurell K. Hamilton continues on this world, since the ending is not as conclusive as I would have hoped, and I would love to see where the main character's developing."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"I'm not saying that this book couldn't have been great. I actually was interested in the heroine, in seeing where her magic would take her and how she would reconcile the distrust and outright hatred her foster family feels towards magicians. I was hoping for... more. Hamilton set up interesting characters and the world of the book is enough to draw a reader in. However, by the time the myriad of deaths happened (some of them too quick to be logical, like the zombie-fying of one of the characters and the all-too quick death of the heroine's brother), I could see it going downhill.Hamilton's style is different here and it's probably due to the formula she had to write in. I'm not saying she can't do third person well, but the narrative seemed... stale. And by the end of this book, I felt like I had watched an episode of Tales from the Crypt, vaguely disturbed, disgusted, and all too willing to toss the book aside. The ending was just so unsatisfying, especially since we don't even bother to follow up with the main characters! In the end, give it a pass. Unless you're a rabid fan of this world. Hamilton fans, you're in for a disappointment."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"I've never read any of LKH's other books, so for those who are saying that this book isn't typical of her writing makes me curious to read some of her other books. Back to this one though, I found the story interesting, and it kept me wanting to read it through to see how the story would be resolved. That's where my disappointment comes in. It doesn't GET resolved. I won't go into details for those who haven't read it..but it seems to me that it was leaving the story open for a sequel that didn't come. how can you leave that storyline, and the fate of all those characters up in the air like that? The main character of the book barely garners any mention in the last chapter. The entire story just sets you for this great resolution that never comes."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"Laurell Hamilton must have been more despondent than I realized about the death of her Baby Bird that she dedicated this book to. I loved the new characters and story line she developed but she dropped them and us cold in the final five chapters with no salve or warmth to make it okay.I despised it when Ann Rice dragged us along on her theological crisis after hooking us with her earlier books. I am not going to like it any better if Laurell Hamilton behaves similarly by the wonton destruction of her characters when she is grieving.I agree with another of the reviews. I hope she writes a sequel (and quickly) that provides the characters with some hope and relief."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"If you are looking for typical Hamilton, you won't find it here. It had intrigue and suspense and interesting plot twists. This is one of the few books of hers that I did not know what was going to happen in the end. A little dark. But a nice change from sex and angst."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"I am writing to warn first time readers of Laurell K.'s work. Do not read this one first! I am a huge fan and have been for years. I write the release dates of her new books on my calendar and MUST buy it on the day of release! This almost seems like a book intended for youth. (If not for the violence and gore.) I slugged through it for a week. I usually read her books, even the newest ones that topple 800 pages, in about 3 days. I had to make myself read this one. My advice for all of her fans is DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ON THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book! A young girl discovers she has the ability to control magic. The novel describes excactly what she feels when working with magic and what the magic does to her. I experienced that whats on the backside of the book is not the core of the novel; the magic itself is! Another great thing of the book is the beginning and the ending. The start of the book has (almost) nothing to do with the core of the book. Only in the end everything falls in place. If you like reading Ravenloft, this is the one!"},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"According to the back cover of the book, the story is about Jonathan Ambrose, mage finder and mage hater, having to investigate a plague of undead in a village. Well, he does, but quite at the end of the book. Instead, Laurell K. Hamilton focuses more of the story on the teaching of his stepdaughter trying to learn the ways of magic. She swears she is not evil, and all people, even her teacher, another mage, do too. But Jonathan is not completely convinced, and he may be very right... I expected more of the book, rather than reading about a girl having visions becoming a mage. The end is very open, actually the book does not quite have an end, and I suspect, I even hope, that a follow-up comes."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"I liked this book it started out slow!!!!!!!!

The book was a good read overall but the characters lacked the depth I've come to expect from this author."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"I've read the majority of this series and this one is by far the worst. It's painfully obvious that Laurell K. Hamilton has never played D&amp;D and has little to no idea how Ravenloft has been portrayed by her fellow authors. The first Ravenloft book that I read concerning Harkon Lukas was &quot;Heart of Midnight,&quot; which was excellent. In that book, Lukas was suave, sophisticated and subtle in his evil. Here, he's just plain bloodthirty and cruel, not at all how I pictured him after reading HOM. Maybe LKH is a decent author. I don't know, since this is the only novel of hers I've ever read. All I know is that she has no clue how to write for D&amp;D."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"LKH always keeps you in suspense, there's no doubt about it, but this one leaves you unsatisfied w/ lots of unanswered questions and one very unhappy ending.Maybe, however, this is just the way of the Ravenloft world...of this I cannot be sure."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"Still a magical world, Laurell K Hamilton has lead a new bunch of \\"people\\" into our brains. Do not buy this book expecting Anita, Jean-claude, Richard, Nathaniel, or any other sexy hunk. This novel is devoid of sex (or hardly the mention of it), but is jam packed with plot.\\"Who is making the dead walk....for what purpose....\\" are your guiding questions. The characters are a part of a brotherhood in either a time way distant without technology or a time gone past that hasn't invented it yet. The brotherhood is against magic in a cursed land, and for good reason, as many wizards and witches use their power for evil.The main characters work well together and are very likeable. The plot is interesting with many good points. It gets a little muddled and a bit too quick toward the end. I feel like it ends abruptly, with people dying off quickly, without much discussion. Its like switching a light switch (non-existant in Cortton) and bam....people are gone.This was a fast read and a page turner in some spots. Buy it because you are a loyal Laurell K Hamilton fan. If there is another in the works, lets hope that there is a little more sunshine thoughts while she writes this series....it would be nice if something for this un-merry band of people worked out."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"I have been enthralled with Laurell's books from the moment I laid my hands on Guilty Pleasures. I was so excited to know she was re-releashing an earlier book that I had yet to read. Death of a Dark Lord was a fabulous book. It captured Hamilton's awesome use of imagination into yet another realm of a slightly different fantasy."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"I have read Laurell K. Hamiltons Anita blakes series. when thirst for more of her writing I borrowed an old copy of this story from a friend.Her attention to detail and way of describing the emotions her character goes through are intense and well written out.

The plot continues to progress up to the point where the reader is excited to learn the end. \\"How will all these things be resolved?\\" the reader asks.At this point in the book, Laurell kills off nearly every relevant character without rhyme or reason. She completely drops every single plot line so that none of them are resolved, and instead decides to kill her characters in various stupid or unlikely ways, and ends the book in such a way that the first 9/10ths of the book are completely irrelevant.She does not even employ the plot build-up in the wanton destruction of the last chapters. It's as if she got tired of the book, and wrote \\"And then they all died. The end!\\" and gave it to a highschool goth to finish writing.However, after reading the first few pages again, it all becomes clear.She dedicated the book to her bird Baby, who apparently died halfway through the writing. It must have been so demoralizing that she could not bear life anymore, driving her to commit vicarious suicide via this tragedy of a book.The greedy b*****d who dredged this spectre up from her past and resold it ought to be fired."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"I am a huge Laurell Hamilton fan. But I litterally threw this book across the room when I was finished. Bad guys don't get what they deserve, good guys get what they don't deserve and way too many loose ends are all the things that ruined this book. Read everything else Ms. Hamilton has ever written, but don't waste your money on this one."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"This is a great purchase for readers who are fans of Ravenloft. The book explores several interesting topics that are mentioned in the game mechanics, but aren't discussed adequately in the other novels, such as Clerics from other realms who arrive in Ravenloft, healing and resurrection, and the corrupting influence of magic. The story isn't as compelling as some of the others in the series, such asI, Strahd: The Memoirs of a Vampire (Ravenloft),LORD OF NECROPOLIS (Ravenloft Books)orI, Strahd: The War Against Azalin, but it's a fun read anyway.If you're picking this up because of the author and not the world, you'll probably be in for a big disappointment and should look for something else. If you're looking for something along the lines of Hamilton's most recent Anita Blake novels, I'd recommend internet porn. If you're looking for something from when the Anita books didn't include scenes based on failed submissions to Penthouse, I'd recommend picking upDead Witch Walking (Rachel Morgan, Book 1)orMagic Bites (Kate Daniels Series, Book 1)."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"I dont even know where to start reviewing this novel. The negative feelings I have for it are overwhelming.First, you can forget about this novel fitting into the established storylines of the other novels in the Ravenloft series, particularly 'Heart of Midnight'. Reading this book it is painfully obvious that the author did not read the other ravenloft novels, nor familiarize herself with the basic 'physics' of the Ravenloft setting.Putting aside the issues of continuity, the first 3/4 of the novel are interminable. It was a struggle to read the whole book, but somehow I managed it out of love for the Ravenloft setting. To be fair, the story does pick up pace somewhat in the last quarter of the book, but that can harldy make up for the serious flaws that litter the book.This is a non-canonical Ravenloft book. There is no point in reading it if you are hoping for the same enjoyable reading experience you got with the other novels in the Ravenlof series. Rather, you should pretend it doesnt exist and spend your money on the worthier Ravenloft novels."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"This book through me for a loop. I have read and Love all the Anita Blake Series and Meredith Gentry Series, but this book was totally different, it was very dark and disturbing. Though it was well worded written, the characters lacked the vitality of her other books, it was just to mortifying to be enjoyed. If you love Anita Blake and Meredith Gentry I wouldn't suggest reading this book, it takes away from the spirit and Vitality of her other books, and characters. It has neither happy endings nor any happiness in between, it's depressing and sad. It also ended with finality, leaving far too many loss ends and questions about other characters and surroundings. It is almost as if she got tired of writing it and ended it halfway through the process."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"This one doesn't seem to be a typical Laurell K. Hamilton Book. I should point that out to those considering it. I finished in one day during a slow shift at work and I have to say I was thoroughly disappointed. Characters get introduced and then just when you sorta start caring for them they are brushed aside like bothersome ants. The end left me with a bad taste in my mouth that wouldn't go away. The only thing terrifying was that I actually made it to the end of this book. It was quite depressing left me quite unsatisfied. I wanted more but not in a good way. The ending left me feeling cheated especially after you learn what happens to the characters you tried so hard to start liking.If you want good Laurell K. Hamilton stuff go back to her roots and read the Anita Blake Series before the 'porn' takes control. Basically anything from Obsidian Butterfly and before that. Maybe she'll go back to writing about characters we care about and not this 'fluff'.

From the vast majority of the reviews I have read, readers are coming at this book from the wrong angle. This book was first released in 1995 as part of the Ravenloft world. This is NOT a new series, nor is it a new book. In fact, I believe this is one of, if not the first book she ever had published. So, fans of her Vampire Hunter series may be very disappointed if they are expecting that type of book. Wizards of the Coast is trying to capitalize on Hamilton's popularity with this re-release.The plot of this book is pretty linear and honestly not to imaginative either. There is a plague that makes the dead rise from the grave and attack a village. The heroes must go help and solve the issue. Pretty standard fantasy fare here. There is one subplot in this story about a young woman coming of age and realizing she has magic in her blood and trying to learn to control it. While her \`foster parents' are haters of magic and in fact make it a career to hunt mages down. There really isn't much suspense in this book, nor is the plot really that gripping... it just is. The first half of this book seems to drag quite a bit with the setup that Hamilton tries to do, yet in the end all that \`build-up' doesn't add all that much to the plot nor the over all story.The characters in this book are rather bland. That's not to say they are bad characters, but they have been written so many times, by so many different authors that most readers will be able to figure out what will happen. Also, there are several clich&eacute;d characters throughout this book, including the old mage who offers advice. This type of character has been done to death and authors need to think of something else for the next ten years. I was not very interested in the characters at all. You can get these same characters in many books and they really didn't add too much to the overall feel of the book.One of my main points of contention with this book is that this was originally the eleventh book in the Ravenloft series, yet the author does very little to no work on building the realm and explaining things about Ravenloft. In fact she leaves many things a mystery that could very easily confuse readers. The Ravenloft realm is intended to be dark, mysterious, and harsh. Yet, this book seems like a cookie cut out of any fantasy realm.With all that said, this is not a \`bad' book. It is a very easy read, but it doesn't contain a lot of substance. If you need a quick read that is not all that engaging this may be the right book for you. Casual fantasy fans should not have a problem picking this up, hard core fantasy fans may be let down for the lack of anything substantial happening in this book. Fans of Hamilton's Vampire Hunter series will most likely be disappointed as this is a very early work by her and she had yet to really hone her craft. While I wouldn't recommend this to many people, I would not tell them not to read this either. It's average at best."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"This book is terrible for a dozen reasons. It's shoddy - poor research into the mythology of Ravenloft, the characters are cursorilly touched on at best, and at worst main character traits ignored. If you are a fan of Harkon Lukas, the Dark Lords, and Ravenloft STAY AWAY from this mushy mess."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"I picked this up because I have read all of Hamilton's other work and really liked most of it. Though I think she went down hill when she decided half of her books should be describing intimate acts (see the second half of the Anita Blake series).This book did NOT meet my expectations. It started out well and I started to care about the different characters. The main character must begin to cope with her new found and poorly understood powers. Then it ended. I felt cheated."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"I have read almost every Hamilton book (the ones I haven't read are sitting in my \\"to read ASAP\\" piles) and I loved this book just as much as the Anita and Meredith books. I was lucky enough to walk by it at a Borders Express store and I snatched it up. I honestly reccomed this book to any who likes a good scifi/horror/romance book that is easy to read. I am a speed reader and I finished it in a matter of hours. It flowed wonderfully and the characters are interesting. Death of a Darklord surpassed my expectations. I am definitely going to buy this book for some of my friends."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"This is the first Ravenloft novel that I have read - I picked it up because it was written by LKH.While the charactisations are good, the story lacks the punch and drive of her other novels and she again explores the idea of a girl growing into magical powers (as in Anita Blake and Nightseer) and her subsequent possible descent into evil."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"i am a big fan of ms.hamilton's, so i was prepared to love this book as well. i do. however, it is a big departure from her usual sexy smut fest that i so enjoy. it is a more thoughtful, fantasy-based story than her vampire executioner novels, and darker than her merry gentry tales. still i really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"I have been a Laurell Hamilton fan for years. This is my first disappointment in her writing. Hard to believe she wrote this. It started off pretty good but went into a terrible spiral of fragmented death and destruction with no relief in the end. I was just glad it was over."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"The subject header, for me, sums up this book. It was interesting, and bit by bit warming me up to the characters.. but then there was the ending. Imagine taking a long, somewhat leisurely walk, up a gentle slope - only to pass through some shrubs and go tumbling off a cliff's edge.I don't think I can add anything that hasn't already been said in previous reviews. In particular, Jeannette M. Pepin's 1-star review perfectly reflects my own feelings.However, I will say this as a newcomer to Hamilton's works:This is the first book I've ever read by her.Death of a Darklord took a colossal swan dive at the end, but it didn't turn me off from this author. While the plot failed (and to a lesser extent, some of the characters), I did enjoy her writing. It wasn't beautiful prose, but it wasn't painful to read, either. Some of her descriptions were detailed well enough to leave me squirming with the intense imagery, but they never felt wordy or tedious. And it wasn't that I found the characters unlikable, but underdeveloped.Judging by fans' response, Hamilton seems to have invested a lot more energy into her later works and the Anita Blake series. I'll definitely be picking up more of her well praised novels in the future."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"It's hard to believe LKH actually authored this; it doesn't feel like her stylistically at all, perhaps because it's not her world, but even her characters seem uncharacteristically-LKH. So certainly, don't read this because you're a fan of LKH, as you will be likely disappointed as I was.I found her style here underdeveloped compared to her Anita & Merry series (though the writing is still readable), and the actual plot itself is quite weak, the characters thin, the overall story unsatisfying. It took effort to finish this book, and I found the world/setting poorly fleshed-out and somewhat confusing, though I can't fully blame that on LKH as this is part of series of which I have not read the prior books.The main flaws:-no character particularly appealed, no character even felt thoroughly real-not as much happens as I'd like and the ending is deeply unsatisfying-slow-paced; the mysteries don't adequately compel and create suspense-ugh, zombies (a personal dislike)Redeeming qualities:-it's short-some interesting concepts, from a fantasy/paranormal perspective-lots of people who are not me seem to really like zombies-a few interesting plot twistsI wouldn't recommend this (and have no wish to read other installments in this series), but I don't feel like I completely wasted my time"},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"Not her greatest stuff, Laurell should probably stick to vampires and faeries.

I have loved every other book that she has written for her other series. I was dissappointed in this book. I thought the charecters were underdeveloped, and the story line did not stay consistant enough to want me to read any other books in this series. There were two distinct story lines that did not get anywhere near resolved by the end and they were so confusing that it was not worth the read.

I have never seen so much dull, pointless exposition and interior monlogue in my life as I saw in these pages. I didn't even make it to the end--I was that bored by this novel.My opinion: go read one of P.N.

I had first picked up Guilty Pleasures, then read every Anita book that was out at the time (not many) and when I ran out, I bought this book.Wow.Ok, it was darker than I was used to at the time (probably nothing to me now, but . . .). I read it literally over night. I loved it. But I loved it for one really good reason:I threw it across the room when I was done.And not in a bad way. :) The ending was *so* not what I was expecting and I *love* that.Now, I am a LKH fan. Big time. I think the only other Ravenloft book I've ever read was Tanya Huff's (another fav). So when it comes to Ravenloft, I am not an expert at all. But LKH . . . even with all the crapy reviews she's been getting lately, she's still one of my all time favs and would have to really do a lot to change that.I thought the book was great. ::shrug:: :)"},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"Please God don't waste your time with this !

Hamilton spends a great deal of time with her charcters and the shady dealings between both monsters, magic, and men. It touches on all the basic rules of the land and provides a great ending plot that I should have seen coming but didnt. Over all it is the best Ravenloft book I have read so far out of four."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"This book was ridiculously bad, and it pushed into a place where I seldom go with novels. Skimming. The amount of pointless exposition, slowness of the plot, and plain stupidity on the part of the characters meant I didn't have the patience to read every word. It was a good decision.The magic and abilities possessed by the heroine (I've already forgotten her name) got ignored or misapplied. In the end there is no resolution; while it is the trend of Ravenloft fiction to leave the reader with terrible despair, that does not preclude a real ending. \\"I, Strahd\\" was so much better...Overall, don't read this. Don't buy it. It is a huge disappointment."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"I am so glad this wasn't the first LKH book I ever read or I never would have tried her other (much, much better) series, which I've quite enjoyed. Upon finishing the book -- the ending was a mess BTW -- I flipped through the remaining advertising pages hoping against hope that I was missing some pages. There has to be something more, an epilogue that makes sense of those last depressing scenes, some sort of reward for slogging through a book that had an identity crisis and couldn't figure out what exactly it was about! It was as if the poor writer was deciding on the plot via suggestions from a schizophrenic committee and was suddenly presented with a deadline of, hmm, now, and had to finish the book with whatever seemed to fit the preceding stories. I agree with other reviewers that I was thoroughly depressed after finishing the book and felt that I had just wasted both time and money. With some serious slash and burn editing and refining, the basic story could have been good. Unfortunately, this was allowed to grow like something you find months later pulsing with unholy life in your refrigerator. Definitely save yourself the pain and get her Merry Gentry series instead."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"***SPOILERSOkay, I feel entitled to be in rant mode because I just bought this book today and was determined to finish it before I went to bed. And for what? A pointless ending. The whole book seemed to be building around the trust between Jonothan and Elain and the end just suddenly sweeps all of the main characters to the side as if they were nothing (by either killing them off or ruining their lives). I mean, I'm glad Calum got his just reward in the end, but I felt like the whole body of the book was just....thrown away."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"I just finished reading this book, and I have to say, it doesn't read like an LKH book at all. I realize that this novel is supposed to be part of a larger picture, but I didn't get the picture at all.This story is about a young woman who is just starting to learn about the magic that she wields, and how this affects the people around her. But the book also has a cover plot about two guys who want to body swap. Personally, the book could have been far better if the cover plot were actually integrated into the story, and not just show up at the very beginning and at the very end of the story. This novel should have been two completely separate, and better developed books.If I had to describe this book, I would say, take the story structure of Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\", coat the outside of it with Anne Rice's \\"Tale of the Body Snatcher\\", fill the inside with any generic \\"beginner witch\\" story you like, and throw \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" on top for good measure. That about sums it up.If you had to read a novel by Laurell K Hamilton, I would highly recommend that you read her own series, Merry Gentry or Anita Blake."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"not even close to the standards set by the first of the Anita Blake series. A one-trick pony of a plot, lots of gore for no reason and shallow character development. It started in the middle of a story, never went anywhere, and didn't do much on the way. Dull, depressing and not entertaining."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"I was so disappointed in the conclusion of this book. After reading the Anita Blake series where this regular girl gets out of every unlikely and devastating situation it just seemed wrong. I expected the girl to come into her magic and do lots of things. It's almost pointless that she had magic in the first place cause she didn't do anything significant with it and yet the story revolves mostly around her. What a waste of a good idea."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"I like Laurell K Hamilton but this book was not one of her better books. Didn't like the end at all.I always give her books a 5 star but not this one."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"What was she thinking when she wrote the ending of this book? It was loosy. I love Laurell K. Hamilton her books are amazing i have read every book that she has written and they all were really good, but this book.. the beingging of the book was really interesting it had me wanting more. the plot was good and even the climax but were is the details? why didnt her healing work? what happened to the wife of ashe the undertaker? where did harkon come from why waz he so evil? what happened to all the main characters? all these questions are swimming in my brain and no way to get them answered. i still love Laurell she is one of my favorite aurthors but i wont be reading this book again and to all that are reading this reveiw do Not buy this book if you can rent it be my guest but the book had one of those horrible endings that make you mad. sorry but not worth the money."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"A lesson from this book is to look closely at the original copyright date - as in this one being 1995. This is a very early work by Ms. Hamilton and it shows. It's also an excellent lesson in greed and book publishers. The book was not particularly good and verges on amatuerish. The story line is not strong, in fact motivations of certain characters don't really makes sense.In the beginning of the story one character, Tereza, agrees to take along another, our heroine Elaine, who is dangerously weakened. Doing so doesn't make sense (especially since Tereza's character is suppose to be chock full of common sense).A main story line is the antagonist persuades an ill, but noble character to lure another into a trap. From the other action in the book it really isn't clear why our antagonist even needs to do this.Even in fantasy books, the \\"rules\\" must be consistent - whatever they are. Here things happen and you have absolutely no clue as to why. For instance, the main character Elaine heals others, toward the end of the book we find this 'healing' goes wrong. Why? To what end? This is never explained and needs to be because it is an important aspect of the story.This book was a nice second draft and should never have been reprinted. However, with Ms. Hamiltons current popularity the publisher went with it - too bad for Ms. Hamilton.Other than the nice cover artwork by Jon Foster and Matt Adelsperger - don't bother buying this book. If you feel compelled to check it out, do so from the library! Save your money."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"ended too quickly and with too much left unsaid.The first 200 pages or so were very interesting with great plot and character development. The characters were really well done, and their interaction with each other was very enjoyable.Then everything abruptly changed. The author dedicated the book to a pet she lost during the book, and I have to wonder if that happened around page 200. In the last 100 pages, suddenly, the rug gets pulled out from underneath the reader and everything is tied up very fast and messily.It really feels like this book should have been at least another 100 pages in length, with more in depth exploration of the characters and slower resolution to the conflicts that she'd developed. Instead, everything goes to hell in the course of 4 chapters or so.There is also no closure to the story of the main character. After things go to hell, before there is any attempt at recovery or damage control by the main character, we pick up with a couple of minor characters and the book then ends.All in all it started out as a very good read, but ended off leaving me feeling like I needed to read the last 100 pages again in a desperate attempt to try and glean some meaning from the car wreck it turned into."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"Laurell K. Hamilton (of Anita Blake fame) does a superb job with this foray into the Ravenloft world. The book is &quot;about&quot; a party of adventurers and their journey to save a village tormented by a plague of walking dead. But Hamilton chooses the right story, the self-discovery and slow spiral into evil of a would-be mage. She does a wonderful job of describing magic, much better than the typical TSR work, and her action sequences are about the best I've seen in this type of novel. The end is a bit weak, the young mage's story needs more closure than it has, but I truly enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"Laurell K. Hamilton, Death of a Darklord (TSR, 1995)Laurell K. Hamilton's Ravenloft novel, Death of a Darklord, has achieved an almost mythic status in Hamilton fandom (which is legion, of course), mostly because it's next to impossible to find. At least, I assume that's the reason it fetches outrageous prices on ebay and required librarians to dig into storage cabinets in back rooms to come up with a copy for me to borrow (it took them nigh on a year to locate even a single copy out of circulation but still owned by the system-- it's no longer in circulation because so many copes walked away, never to return). It's not because the book stands head and shoulders, stylistically, narratively, or any other way over any of the other Ravenloft novels.Of all the lines of fiction put out by TSR (now Wizards of the Coast) in the eighties and nineties, only the original run of Dragonlance-- the first ten or twenty novels set in the Dragonlance world-- rivalled the quality of the Ravenloft books. This was, of course, because TSR didn't go to the stock authors for these. They recruited names-- Hamilton, Gene DeWeese, Tanya Huff, Elaine Bergstrom, P. N. Elrod, Chet Williamson, etc. Sure, like everything else TSR, they were formulaic; after all, if you wanted a TSR contract, you played by their rules. But it's possible to do all sorts of things within formula, and good writers adapt. Williamson's novel, Mordenheim, is a standout in this regard. Hamilton's, however, is not.Some of the blame for the novel's predictability and lack of pace in its first half don't have at least something to do with a moronic copywriter, who left all the first half's suspense for dead after writing a couple of sentences. Yet, still, when one picks up a book by an author whose name is rapidly approaching the state where you have to put \\"hallowed\\" before it, you start expecting something roughly akin to what you'd get from an Elrod, a Williamson, etc., rather than a tale which sticks quite closely to formula.None of this is to say that the book isn't readable; it's just more reminiscent of the later Dragonlance novels, on the continuum of quality, than the earlier ones. Still, if you're a Hamilton fan, or a Ravenloft collector, you'll probably find the outrageous prices this goes for worth paying. Don't let me stop you. ***"},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"I generally avoid book series based on consumer goods, but I made an exception for Laurel Hamilton. I was extremely disappointed! I don't think I'm simply spoiled by the rich character development in her Anita Blake books. Hamilton does action &amp; tension well enough, but the plot...where was it going? Why introduce the reader to characters, then sloppily kill them off? It was like a really bad made-for-TV movie on paper. I finished the book only because I though Hamilton would redeem herself. She failed."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"Unless you are versed in the history of the land of the mists Ravenloft, you may not get as much enjoyment from this offering as you would expect.This is a departure from the standard Laurell Hamilton offering, even though the supernatural theme is prevalent. If you like Harkon Lukas, the Domain Lord of Kartakass, this novel reads well, capturing somewhat the essense of the depths of which such an evil being will go to achieve his goals.But unless you are grounded in the lore of Ravenloft, you may find some of the narrative in this novel a bit weak. It is not to par with some of her better efforts, such as GUILTY PLEASURES or THE KILLING DANCE. But to an avid gamer there is worth in this book from a resource background. The side story of the group transported to Ravenloft is most engaging, you do end up wondering what happens to them. The description of how wolfweres hunt and kill was eerily done and lingered in the mind long afterward. But as a whole, the story seemed unfocused and unfinished.I would like to see a further effort by the author that focused more on the Dark Lord Harkon himself and not so much on the side stories."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"I read all of her other books so far but what happened here?

Additionally several sub-plots are started towards the end of the book with no continuing development or resolution. At the end we are left in total despair for the hero's, who all face emotional and/or physical destruction, while the villain skates away clean.The last chapter almost feels like LKH went over the deadline for the story and was forced into an unintended ending.

I love \\"I, Strahd\\" - I am actually re-reading that book right now. (Go buy it as well, you won't be sorry.) I loved Knight of the Black Rose (again - go buy it.)I have read every book in the Ravenloft series (except for Tower of Doom because I don't have it.)

Death of a Darklord, in my humble opinion is, BY FAR, the worst book in the series.I found this book painfully boring to read, which is why it took me more than a month to finish a book which, based on the length, should only have taken an evening or two.Each time I would think about picking up the book to read a few chapters, it felt more like a chore than an enjoyable reading experience. Most people would probably just quit reading a book that they didn't find themselves getting into. But I don't like doing that. If I start a book, I always finish it, no matter how long it takes.The writing quality of this book was extremely poor in my opinion. You just never care about any of the characters. They could all have died off and no one would care. And the parts of the book that were supposed to be important didn't feel important due to the lack of descriptive detail.It was one of those books where nothing between the first couple of chapters and the last chapter even mattered. Normally an author will spend all of the book building up character development and making the reader interested in the characters and the situations. But in this book, you simply don't care.When the final chapters finally come around you are just left with a feeling of \\"what was the point\\"?By far THEE worst book in the RavenLoft series."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"Die Ex-Fans folgen der Autorin auf so eine unangenehme klebrige bis alberne Art und Weise, dass es mich sprachlos macht.

They are sent to the village of Cortton to cure the plague of undead that walks the streets. Along the way, they must contend with one of their own slowly becoming a wizard (their leader hates magic) and some newcomers to the land who seem to be able to raise the dead to true life, something unheard of in the domain.The beginning (most of the book) was slow, and the travel seemed to take-up most of the story, but once they got to the village, Laurell K. Hamilton showed me that she could write a good tale. The ending was near-perfect in its setup, and leaves the reader wondering what happened to more than one of the characters (however, if they know anything about Kartakass and Luk as in general, they could figure it out) and if there will be a sequel (here's hoping).In all, a good read."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"This dark and intriguing fantasy adventure romp set in the gothic/horror world of Ravenloft is a must-read for all Laurell K Hamilton fans.

Several plot twists and surprises will catch you off guard. It would be a 5 star book if it had a happy ending, but this IS Ravenloft after all..."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"This book arrived well packaged and in excellent condition. Product as described. I am pleased with the book."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"I found this book at a library, actually, and thought it was going to be great- I have quite enjoyed the pre-Anita and Meredith LKH, and have tracked down a few of her earlier books and found them to be good. However, this book did not hold to my- and her- standards.The beginning of the book actually reminds me, a bit, of Robin McKinley. The description of the character's blight with discovering magic, the buildup of tensions caused of each character's morality, and the unique and consistent characterizations, all were reminiscent of later, better works. It starts well, and LKH is a good writer, even now, which makes it even the more enticing, and disappointing.About three-thirds of the way through the book, it started to drag, a bit. I am not a fan of zombies, and that they were going to cure the plague of them wasn't sitting well with me. But even despite uncomfortable subject matter, the plot holes began appearing, and characters began dropping like flies with little to no reason. It started becoming downright depressing when Elaine tried to cure death, and though those scenes were heart wrenching, there is still something redeemable about a writer succeeding even in that. But with about fifty pages left, the plot was as murky as ever, and showed no sign of clearing up.It didn't. The book ended in such a clumsy, sad and tragic ending that I was sure that there would be a sequel. Unfortunately, there isn't one, and so the book stands alone- a tease, because while the beginning showed promise, the ending was terrible. I was left feeling vaguely uncomfortable. The reason it gets three stars is because LKH still can write, and her scenes at the end were as affecting as they were confusing."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"This is one of two books I have ever read that I regret reading. The other one involved incest and I think I dislike this book even more than the other. It's got some typical Hamilton elements: angry characters, gross, slimy and undead creations, and dark scary scenery. What is especially disappointing is the utter lack of anything remotely joyful, or happy, or even positive in the ending. Hamilton gives you all these characters, just begins to develop them so you start to care about them - then ruins every single one with the most depressing, unhappy ending possible.I was hopeful up until the very end because it seemed we were at the VERY least going to get a satisfying ending to the love story. Nope, killed that, too.Come on, Hamilton. Give us something!I'm sorry I read this book. It left me feeling depressed and disappointed. I wish I'd never picked it up. I wish I could erase it from my memory."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"I'm a huge Laurell K. Hamilton fan, but I found this book to be hard to get into, draggy and the characters to be not very interesting. I forced myself to finish the book and almost wish I hadn't. The ending sucked!I don't know this story was just really dark and unappealing.Would not recommend at all.The only reason I gave the story two stars is because it's obvious that Laurell is a good writer, even in the midst of a really bad story."},{"Title":"Death of a Darklord :Ravenloft 11","review":"I enjoy reading Laurell's books except for this one.

Well done Alvin Josephy."},{"Title":"Lassie Come-Home","review":"I thought this was an excellent book. Despite the one review below, this edition (hardcover, Lassie standing on the tip of a hill) does not appear to be abridged in any form (from the novel), nor is it what you might call an illustrated book-- there's a small sketch to accompany the start of each chapter, and a few full page drawings.I bought this book to read to my children. Like I said, it's a really great book, but not for children of young ages. Get them an abridged version. Here's why:1. Knight uses sophisticated language. It's in no way geared for children, and I found myself answering a lot of questions about what words meant, or just paraphrasing the content when things looked difficult.2. Regional dialect. The characters are all in Yorkshire or Scotland, and Knight writes their dialect accordingly. Sometimes, *I* had a hard time discerning what was being said.3. Subject matter. The main story is Lassie's journey, but there are numerous side plots that deal with a variety of more mature subjects, probably better suited for teenagers. The Carracloughs are dealing with the father not having a job, and the subsequent tension in the household. It's post WW1, and a veteran briefly discusses being in France, and there's a longer piece about a couple's son who was killed in the war. There's discussion of the euthenasia of dogs at a pound. Robbers attack a man and kill his dog. There are dog fights, boys cruelly throwing rocks at Lassie, somebody shooting at Lassie, Lassie's terrible conditions during her journey from weather and wear, etc...I read a little background about Eric Knight. He was a WW1 veteran (killed in a plane crash in WW2). In America, he had a small little dog which was killed by a car, where upon he got a collie named Toots, which he based Lassie's character on. Tell me he didn't write himself into his book as Rowlie the peddler!"},{"Title":"Lassie Come-Home","review":"This novel is great. I have loved it since I was a little boy. My father read it to me and my brothers every night for a few months. And when he finished, I read it again.When I pick it up now I am filled with fond memories of those months. And I must say that this book is one of my favorites.I, with all due respect, disagree with one of the other reviewers who reviewed this item and said it was not for kids. This is the perfect book for kids, and is perfect to read aloud. The drama is engrossing, but is not too intense for youngsters. It is the perfect dog book.A dog-lover myself, I have read a great many dog books. And this tops the list. Never before or since has an author captured so poignantly the affection between a boy and his dog. And never before or since has an author tried that affection with so many difficulties and set-backs. But, as we all know, in the end Lassie is there to greet Joe by the school gate. It's in the best three endings I've ever read (the other two being TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and A TALE OF TWO CITIES).This is a classic, and it's one of my favorites. I honestly cannot even begin to understand why a person would give this book anything but five stars. HIGHLY recommended."},{"Title":"Lassie Come-Home","review":"The book tells the amazing story of a Collie female dog, Lassie, whose owners are compelled to sell her because of financial troubles. After she breaks away from her new estate several times, she is taken to Scotland, a hundred miles away. But she doesn't give up. With her directional sense, she breaks away and keep running southward and southward, running into challenges that are virtually impossible for a dog.There is no other book that I have read so many times. It keeps exciting since the early childhood to nowadays. A must read."},{"Title":"Lassie Come-Home","review":"I purchased this book believing that I was getting a new edition of the classic Eric Knight children's book. This book is a picture-book version of that classic, and the text is considerably abridged. The pictures are absolutely lovely, but they cannot, in my opinion, make up for the loss of the wonderful details, the dialogue, and the glorious description that the original contained. I applaud the editors for wanting to bring back a classic, but they would have done well to consider what made the book a classic in the first place."},{"Title":"Lassie Come-Home","review":"Bought this for my niece.

It's about the most basic kind of friendship and loyalty, where an animal exhibits more of both than do the humans.

Finaly the Duke gets mad and moves to a very far away estate and Lassie is forced to travel thousands of miles to get home. This is a very good book especially for dog lovers. This book is a classic, I give this book a five star rating and hope that others like it to."},{"Title":"Lassie Come-Home","review":"What does it take to be a true dog owner and dog lover? Certainly more than a piece of paper or a pedigree chart. Besides, what is an owner compared to being a dog's one, true Master? Eric Knight's 1940 tale of a dog who risks everything to be reunited with the boy who loves her leaped into the hearts of readers the world over. Based on his youth in the mountains of Yorkshire the story opens with basic the conflict of man versus man, but unfolds into Dog versus the world: man, beast, and Nature. Raising the moral question of what truly makes a man a given dog's Owner, this animal classic inspired a 1946 movie (with Elizabeth Taylor as young Priscilla).Twelve-year-old Joe Carraclough adores his tricolor collie, Lassie, who though bred as a working dog with sheep, enjoys favored pet status in the family's humble cottage. But times are hard for these people; the mines are closed and Joe's father, desperate for work and the means to feed his family, reluctantly sells Lassie to the rich, blustery old Duke--who also has a keen eyes for dogs.After running away several times from the Duke's kennels Lassie is shipped400 miles up to the Duke's estate in northern Scotland. Yet each day around 4 pm the dog's strict Time Sense urges her to go meet the Boy at school. The story of her odyssey after she escapes the Duke's harsh kennel man proves emotional and fascinating reading; she combatsthe indifference of Nature and the worst cruelty of mankind, as well as experiences some instances of tender human compassion. Joe comes of age as he realizes the value of honesty in dealing with others, while cherishing not only his own, but Lassie's dream for happiness. For kids of all ages."},{"Title":"Lassie Come-Home","review":"While this is an abriged version of the original, the wonderful art-work is a great consolation. Get both if you can.

I find it appalling that many Americans do not know that the original Lassie of the story was British because I read the original \\"Lassie Come Home\\" short story (published in the December 1938 issue of the Saturday Evening Post) in school. This original story is a well-written, haunting tale of a poor Yorkshire family forced by economic times to sell their son's beloved collie (a tricolor dog, not a sable as portrayed in the movies and on TV) and of the dog's long torturous journey home during which she meets kind people--a couple who nurse her after she swims the river Tweed, a kindly peddler--and cruel--callous dogcatchers, bullying boys--as well as farmers protecting their livestock.

Young Joe Carraclough lives in Greenall Bridge, England, with his father Sam, a collier in the mines, his mother, and his collie named Lassie. Every day, Lassie is waiting for him at the gate outside of school. The Duke of Rudling has been wanting to buy Lassie for three years, but Sam wouldn't sell. However, Sam is now out of work, so he agrees to sell Lassie to the Duke. Lassie escapes a couple of times from the Duke's kennels at his estate near Greenall Bridge and returns to meet Joe at the school gate, so the Duke takes her to his other estate in the highlands of north Scotland.However, the Duke's granddaughter Priscilla sees that Lassie is not happy. The dog keeps trying to escape, and when she does get loose Priscilla chooses not to close the gate, letting Lassie escape. The rest of the book chronicles Lassie's attempt to head 400 miles south towards home, through the Scottish highlands, across the great loch, into the Scottish lowlands, over the River Tweed, and into northern England. Along the way she meets many individuals who either help or hinder her. More than once she is injured or becomes ill. She is chased in a Highland village, almost mistakenly killed by a couple of shepherds, captured by the dogcatcher in a Lowland town, adopted for a time by an elderly English couple, and taken in by a travelling peddler. But will she ever make it back to Greenall Bridge? Originally, Lassie was introduced by Knight in a 1938 short story published in the Saturday Evening Post which was then expanded into the novel.I grew up watching the Lassie television show, first with Jeff Miller played by Tommy Reddig, then with Timmy Martin played by Jon Provost, and finally with ranger Corey Stuart played by Robert Bray. Of course, none of these scenarios, all in the United States, came even close to the plot of the original novel, although a famous 1943 movie starring Roddy McDowell was made from the book, which we did as a bedtime read aloud and enjoyed. There are several references to smoking, some uses of the euphemistic word \\"drat,\\" and a few instances of disguised English colloquial cursing (\\"damme\\" and \\"by gad\\"). A few scenes of animal mistreatment occur, such as where the peddler's other dog Toots is killed by robbers, but nothing too graphic, and they simply show that some people are kind to animals whereas others are cruel. Dave Pratte noted, \\"Teaches value of love and faithfulness, but in the end, heroes practice deception in the name of honesty.\\" However, great emphasis is place on honesty, and the deception fools no one. Nathaniel Bluedorn said that it was one of his mother's favorites to read aloud."},{"Title":"Lassie Come-Home","review":"A lot of these boy/dog stories have sad endings, but not Lassie Come Home.

Adults and children alike will love it (Knight originally published it in a short-story version in \\"The Saturday Evening Post,\\" which, though a family journal, was aimed at a grown-up audience); even cat people (like me) can take great delight in it.Everyone knows the story: the beautiful collie Lassie, beloved by the Yorkshire schoolboy Joe Carraclough, is sold by Joe's father to the local Duke because the coal mine in which he has labored has shut down and he needs the money to feed his family. But Lassie is linked to Joe by a love-bond that recognizes no barriers. Three times she escapes and returns to him. Then, taken to the Duke's property far in the northern regions of Scotland, she flees again, and sets out on an epic trek homeward. Some of the people she meets hinder or seek to harm her; others give her care and help so she can get on the way again; one, the unforgettable peddler Rowlie Palmer, she travels with as almost a partner, and repays by saving his life. And in the end her faithfulness brings good fortune upon the Carraclough home, and all is well.Lyrically written and rich with the flavor of the English and scottish countryside, this book should be read aloud to every child in the land.

So Lassie is a long-haired collie, right? Hm... Should such a dog really be as incredible as the writer thinks? I frankly doubt it. If Eric Knight where in charge, then a rough collie should properly be the next president of the United States, huh? He is almost messianic in his description of Lassies virtues.

The insertion had gone smoothly. No reason to expect complications until Ian discovered a woman in a cave who he is convinced is the terrorist leader's lover, Yasmine. Ian is 34, single and content with his status having recently ended an engagement, due to his fianc&eacute;'s cheating. Never in a million years had he expected himself to be turned on by his filthy, smelly, shrew of a hostage.1013 A.D.: One by one Madrene Olgadottir's family members had vanished leaving her alone to defend Norstead. She was a fighter to the bone but had been no match for Steinolf the Vicious. After she'd refused to wed with him, knowing that to do so would bring her men out of hiding and ultimate end in their deaths, Steinolf had beaten the proud woman and had paraded her bound and naked through the keep. But even this rude treatment had not cowed her. She had wed once, and never would again. Defeated, Steinolf had sold her to a harem as a concubine. Over the next three years she'd been sold repeatedly, but thanks to her cunning she'd never been raped. Over time she'd perfected a ritual guaranteed to shrivel a man's \\"dangly parts\\". That's what she'd told the Troll who had discovered her in the cave she'd hidden in to regroup after escaping from the latest harem. Her only goal is to return home to Norstead to avenge herself on Steinolf. If agreeing to be the woman these barmy seals are looking for will get her as far as Baghdad then she would gladly pretend to be Yasmine.Ian is pretty sure they've made a big mistake once the woman is cleaned up. There's something familiar about her, like they've met before. This is confirmed when the real Yasmine is sighted elsewhere. However the big brass has plans to smoke out the terrorist cell by using their captive as bait and they want the confrontation to take place on home territory. The most expedient way to get Madrene to the U.S. is for her to marry a U.S. citizen. Given no choice, Ian bites the bullet knowing that the marriage can be easily annulled later.NOT! He hadn't counted on the strength of their mutual attraction. He finds Maddie irresistible and her ritual has absolutely no effect on his member, not that she really wants it to. But adjusting to this new world is going to take some doing, could it be true that she's time traveled more than a thousand years into the future? If not, can she convince Ian to help her raise an army to take back Norstead? Or will he take just her to a doctor and have her head shrunken? One thing for sure, she is totally head over hills in love with the Troll and the feeling is definitely mutual.If you've read the previous four titles in the series, you probably know it's only a matter of time before the family shrew meets up with her long lost Magnusson kin. It's sure to give poor Ian a headache especially when he realizes that his own sister has been keeping the huge family secret. But never fear as with all of Ms. Hill's Viking tales, love and laughter is guaranteed. Another hilarious keeper.Reviewed for PNR Reviews"},{"Title":"Hot & Heavy","review":"I had some problems with this book:1. The whole marriage thing was pretty far fetched.2.

EX: Maddie knows squat about the 21st century, has no clue about covert ops. Yet every time Ian tells her to do/not do something that he knows will be dangerous she pouts, is insulted, says it's because she's a woman and if at all possible does it anyway. Completely irresponsible, particularly as her acts can put people in a lot of danger. If she were a photographer & told Ian not to open the darkroom door she'd expect him to adhere to what she says because SHE KNOWS more about it.I would have given it a three but I enjoyed the follow up on the earlier stories in the series and I like Sandra Hill's writing style."},{"Title":"Hot & Heavy","review":"Over the past few years, Madrene's Viking family has steadily been vanishing; logical probability indicates that they are dead. Despite Madrene's valor, she finds her lands overtaken by invaders and herself sold into harem after harem as a slave. However, since she tends to have an unfortunate effect on her owners' ability to make use of her as a harem girl, she never stays anywhere long. Then, out of the blue, she finds herself free, and a thousand years in the future. Madrene does not know what has happened or what to make of this new world. When she is found by a group of Navy SEALS, they at first think she's a terrorist, but soon become otherwise persuaded. A marriage of convenience, or possibly inconvenience, is the only way to get her legally into the States, and Ian MacLean is chosen as the groom. He is sure that they'll be able to annul it after she's safely established as a citizen, but he hadn't counted on attraction bringing them into a real marriage. The only problem is, Ian is convinced he's married to a lunatic who might be a terrorist, [prostitute], or burglar, albeit a pretty one. There is no way she could be so innocent of all modern things, yet she is. None of it makes a bit of sense. The only thing either is sure of is that they are falling for each other, and it can't possibly work.**** Granted, this book is replete with places nitpickers can dismantle gleefully, such as how could a woman from the distant past, from the Viking lands, speak English? However, fans of Ms. Hill's broad humor will be pleased as she adheres to all her trademark mechanisms to create a story with zip and a heartwarming end. ****"},{"Title":"Hot & Heavy","review":"I was crazy about her fun viking series:The Reluctant Viking, The Tarnished Lady, just to name a few, but extremely disappointed with her too corny, far fetched books in:Bewitched,Truly Madly Viking, Love Potion. I missed Sandra so I took a chance on Hot and Heavy and wasn't disappointed in the least. This is a great book to bring to the beach...I read it in 3 days."},{"Title":"Hot & Heavy","review":"Navy SEAL Lieutenant Ian MacLean leads his commando team on Operation Rodent; the objective is to eliminate terrorist leader Jamal ben Hassan in Northern Iraq. The SEALS safely land near their target with Ian entering an empty cave to use as the rendezvous point.In 1013 Madrene Olgadotter is paraded naked and in chains by Steinolf the Vicious who has taken over her home Norstead. When she continues to display a vitriolic tongue, he sells her to a harem. Over the next three years she is sold nine times, but no one touches her as she curses her owners with a shriveled jewel. She escapes her last captivity in Northern Iraq and hides in a cave.Madrene surprises Ian and hits him with a rock. She binds him, but he easily escapes. He believes the sharp tongued beauty is Jamal's girlfriend while she thinks he is a caliph's slave. As they become acquainted during the dangerous mission, they fall in love, but neither is sure how much time she has although she will soon find her parents and siblings living comfortably in twenty-first century California.The latest Viking time travel-SEAL romance is a fun tale starring two protagonists who belong together even if their birth dates are over a millennium apart. Madrene is terrific as she curses males with a shriveling ease until she meets Ian who thinks she is crazy but seems to enchanted by her with an opposite spell that leaves him in a permanent state of hardness due. Readers will enjoy Sandra Hill's latest romantic thriller starring this time a female Viking warrior and the SEAL she tames.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Hot & Heavy","review":"Anyone who has read a Sandra Hill book will know what to expect from this one. Anyone who has not read a Sandra Hill book needs to read this one. For humor with a hot romance and a tongue in cheek attitude nobody does it better than Hill.Ian MacLean is a Navy SEAL, while on a mission to Iraq his team literally picks up a woman, who is thought to be the lover of a terrorist. This straight arrow, upstanding, by the book soldier is dumbfounded, confused and just plain maddened by the gorgeous female who simply wants to raise an army and lead them to recover her fortress which was taken over by a slimy underhanded Viking. Did I mention that was in 1013 A.D.?Madrene Olgadottir has just escaped from 2 years of captivity in assorted harems. Having used a mystic spell she developed to save her self from being ravished. Now when she has escaped her latest owner and aquired a few of his jewels, all she needs is an army. An army like the one that has captured her. Madrene is known in the Viking world as a \\"shrew\\" of which she is proud. Never one to let one word do when 20 sound so much better and relieve so much more stress, she does not find this new world of magic very hospitable.Getting to Bagdad tells her this is not where she wants to be. The only way to get her to the US is for someone (Ian) to marry her and get an annulment when they find out what she knows about the terrorist. As she knows nothing about this new world, she becomes very frustrated. OF course, Ian has some frustrations of his own. Not the least is how attracted he is to Maddie.The relationship, steadily encouraged by Ian's SEAL team, is on a train headed for disaster. When the terrorists finally come to get Maddie, Ian finally settles his feelings for the shrewish wench. Is there such a thing as being too honest? Have a good time, read this book."},{"Title":"Hot & Heavy","review":"Hot & Heavy by Sandra Hill has been by far the best book I have read this summer. I love Ms. Hill's books because there is such a great mixture of romance, comedy, and just a hint of danger. I have read all of Ms. Hill's viking stories and this one is has to be my favorite."},{"Title":"Hot & Heavy","review":"This is a GREAT Sandra Hill story which includes Navy SEALS, Vikings, time-travel, with a Cajun thrown in, plus action, plenty of humor, emotions and loads of typical Sandra Hill asides. She managed to include it all. I LOVED it, my husband chuckled his way through the book and now I am going to loan it to my girlfriend who I also got hooked on anything with Sandra Hill's name on it. I highly recommend this book to all and the same goes for all her books."},{"Title":"Hot & Heavy","review":"What the heck do you expect from Sandra Hill - anything less than excellence?As usual, an awesome Viking/Navy Seal adventure just waiting for you to buy it, take it home and treat it right - read it!! But pay attention: this is a fantasy so don't expect reality; suspend belief (such as \\"there is no such thing as time travel\\") and just ENJOY the book. If you don't like fantasy, don't buy then review the book in a negative; that's not fair. Warning: sex scenes are R but story line is hysterical and wonderful!"},{"Title":"Hot & Heavy","review":"I've read most of Sandra Hill's books and I've enjoyed the saga of the Eriksson and Magnusson families. The story of Madrene and Ian is a disappointment. Hey, try the drinking game (or if you're like me the chocolate chip cookie game). Have one each time she mentions the size of Madrene's breast or mentions the men (and women) who can't keep their eyes off them. You'll either be totally drunk or gain 15 pounds. The story had so much potential with the Navy Seals and a beautiful Viking warrior princess; but this one fell short. It had some funny parts; but overall the humour found in her earlier books was missing."},{"Title":"Hot & Heavy","review":"If not for the horrible ending, this would be a decent book. It was funny at times and set a good pace. However, here I must include the subplot that killed it for me - whatever you called it - that ruined the entire story for me. For it made we question whether the hero ever loved the heroine at all or it's just a bunch of bs.I kid you not. 3 pages. 3 pages before the freaking story ends.--------------------There is a fight between Ian and Maddie.Maddie says she has time traveled and Ian thinks she is crazy. (He gets angry and leaves. While Ian is running, Maddie leaves also but to a new place to leave and cope with Ian's conviction that she's either lying/crazy.)I understand this because love without respect/acceptance can only lead to trouble.So the jackass(hero) instead of looking for her - mopes around and apparently looks for her for a week after the moping. He gives up pretty quickly after that and goes on a date with another girl (a nurse called Laura Madison). In my mind I was thinking Author - did you really have to include this subplot?I mean if Ian really loved Maddie like he says shouldn't he have more integrity? Shouldn't he make a little more effort to look for his ladylove? And not just give up after a week? What sort of loyalty is that? That means if there's trouble he's just going to start another relationship because that's how much his love is. (not much) And to make matters worse, Maddie is the one who confronts this \\"new couple\\" and before he goes off to chase Maddie - he makes a comment to his date saying \\"We're not really married. (officially)\\" *snickers*Really author? This whole time you portray the guy as being in love but when things are convenient he hops on to the next train. What a load of crap.--------------------Disappointed to have read this. I will not be reading anything by this author again. Now, I need to go read a good story to diminish this disgust I feel."},{"Title":"Zofloya; Or, the Moor: A Romance of the Fifteenth Century (Gothic Novels II)","review":"This actually seems like two separate novels. The first section describes Victoria, a spoiled woman who's mother leaves her father for a libertine. The first Volume and a half describe her life and her attempts at becoming her own woman. But the telling is quick and boring. The second half tells of only a few months of Victoria's life, and her strange love for Zofloya, the moorish servant of her husband's brother. Fromt his point on, the novel becomes a harrowing tale of murder and revenge. Intensely violent, and very entertaining, the second half almost makes of for the rather lackluster beginning."},{"Title":"Zofloya; Or, the Moor: A Romance of the Fifteenth Century (Gothic Novels II)","review":"This was a required book for an undergrad class. The author is a great writer and the book was of decent quality."},{"Title":"Zofloya; Or, the Moor: A Romance of the Fifteenth Century (Gothic Novels II)","review":"This book fits loosely into the early goth/horror genre and gives an interesting insight into what a scare lover like myself might have been reading back in the day. The plot concerns a noble lady in Italy who wanders slowly further and further off the path of rightousness under the influence of the mysterious Zofloya, a moor in her service. The suspense builds very well until the true identity of Zofloya is revealed at the very end with dammning consequences for the noble lady. The language is very old fashioned and takes a little getting used to. In some ways this is a very slow book but if you're prepared to perservere with it the suspense builds and it ties itself up very well in the end.If you are a bit of a horror/gothic novel conissuer like myself and know quality dark lit when you read it you won't be dissapointed with this book, however other readers might find it a bit too slow and old fashioned for their tastes."},{"Title":"Zofloya; Or, the Moor: A Romance of the Fifteenth Century (Gothic Novels II)","review":"This was my first time ordering all of my books online for my college classes. I was a bit hesitant not being able to see the books before I purchased them, however, it turns out I didn't need to be. The book was in excellent condition, nothing to hinder my use of it for class. It was also much less expensive than I would have paid at the book store here. I haven't read the book yet, but it looks like it will be a great fit for the class."},{"Title":"Zofloya; Or, the Moor: A Romance of the Fifteenth Century (Gothic Novels II)","review":"Kim Ian Michasiw is the associate professor at my university (York U in Toronto!) and he's awesome. He brilliantly sets up his ideas in the introduction of this work and provides, as clearly as he can, something of a chronology (much is yet to be known about Dacre's life). The book is an interesting study in gothic literature and feminine writing circa Jane Austen.Eighteenth-century trash, actually. Lots of sex and violence, elegantly written. Also interesting in its portrayal of race and the sexualization of \\"The moor\\". A perverse work, actually."},{"Title":"What?

There is also a host of information on chosing fabrics, threads, how to begin on aida and linen, information on streatching, cleaning, and framing and dozens of patters and suggestions for thier use.

It is a compact way to make sure you are doing things the correct way to have your work turn out wonderfully!"},{"Title":"The Cross Stitcher's Bible","review":"I have been cross stitching for years, but that doesn't mean that I still can't learn a few things! This book is full of ideas and techniques to help any stitcher explore new methods and understand how to enhance their work.The beginning of this book shows how your materials can make a difference. Using linen instead of aidacloth can change the way the final product looks. There are also examples of how the resolution (number of stitches per inch) can impact the look as well. The author contrasts how backstitch around the stitching looks versus stitching without. She also shows different types of threads - Waterlillies and Watercolours thread, silk ribbon thread, varigated thread, metalic thread and blending filaments. There are examples of how beads can be used to enhance your work.I really like the section that shows different types of stitches (yes, there really is more than just the \\"x\\" stitch!) the queen stitch, the eyelet stitch, the counted chain stitch and more. These are some of the stitches I've seen on samplers but didn't know how to stitch. The author also includes an informative and detailed section on hardanger. I gave it a try and it's a joy to create!The book also contains a pattern library, which has some nice patterns.This is a fantastic resource book on every aspect of cross stitch. Every serious stitcher should keep a copy of this book on-hand."},{"Title":"The Cross Stitcher's Bible","review":"Don't be fooled into thinking this is just a cross-stitch guide, though much of the discussion is about cross stitch. Counted thread work of all kinds are included in this book. It's wonderful!If you love counted cross stitch, Hardangar, etc., this book is for you. Clear pictures and easy-to-understand descriptions of the stitches demonstrated make it a reference book of value. The reviews of different types of fabric and stitching fibers is an added joy. The design types are wonderful.Don't hesitate to get this marvelous book, you'll be glad you did!"},{"Title":"The Cross Stitcher's Bible","review":"This book is fine for beginners but doesn't have a lot of tips for an accomplished stitcher.

The Cross Stitcher's Bible is a resource for both experienced and novice stitchers. It does come in a spiral bound edition which I would recommend (I got the paper bound thinking it was the spiral version.)as it is easier to keep it open for reference. While some of her designs may seem a bit complex, you can easily simplify them if you want. You can't go wrong with her books."},{"Title":"In His Steps Today","review":"In His Steps Today is a challenging, thought provoking book. It is based on Charles Sheldon's book, In His Steps, about a minister who challenges his congregation to consider approaching every decision with the thought, &quot;What would Jesus Do?&quot; This book is written in a more modern setting and involves people who are doctors, car salesmen, computor programmers, and housewives. They are people we can relate to, in businesses that we deal with today. It makes you think about what you would do and how much of a stand you are willing to take for Jesus in all situations. The book has some very interesting stories. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in living for Jesus."},{"Title":"The Well Adjusted Dog: Canine Chiropractic Methods You Can Do","review":"Good, thorough explanation of chiropractic in relation to dogs. Good illustrations that help you understand the mechanism of the adjustment. As a chiropractor, I appreciate the detail Dr. Kamen goes into regarding adjustments; however, the typical dog owner may not be able to identify serious medical conditions that would be aggravated by performing a chiropractic adjustment versus a simple malalignment or &quot;subluxation&quot; that would respond very well. Good basic book to look at if you're thinking of taking your dog to an animal chiropractor. Great book to understand what it's all about and how your pet may benefit."},{"Title":"The Well Adjusted Dog: Canine Chiropractic Methods You Can Do","review":"This book has saved my dog's dignity on more than one occasion. There truly is nothing more gratifying than finding the trouble spot, based solely on observing my dog's behavior, and then being able to refer to this wonderful book for stretching and therapeutic techniques that allow my dog to feel wonderful, almost instantly. I have bought this book for at least 3 of my dog owning friends who swear by it."},{"Title":"The Well Adjusted Dog: Canine Chiropractic Methods You Can Do","review":"I expected so much more based on previous reveiws (and price). This small book (yes, it has 163 pages, but it's only 5&quot;x7&quot;) has line drawings that are so crude and childish they are useless. Utterly useless. Since this book is about canine chiropractic--knowing specifically where and how you touch the dog is vital to doing the adjustment correctly. You can't tell what the drawings are attempting to convey and have to go solely by the text which is more detailed than the pictures, but I feel the book really needed both to be of any use."},{"Title":"The Well Adjusted Dog: Canine Chiropractic Methods You Can Do","review":"I would highly recommend this book for anyone who has a dog suffering from bladder control problems and neck pain.

Kamen!"},{"Title":"The Well Adjusted Dog: Canine Chiropractic Methods You Can Do","review":"I was disappointed by this book, and I'm still not exactly sure why. It was definitely informative, and did show several good methods for adjusting my dogs. But it assumed a lot of technical and anatomical knowledge that I'm sure the majority of potential readers does not have, and in fact even with my own fairly in-depth canine knowledge I felt uncomfortable with many of the techniques, especially the one that starts with a disclaimer about how risky it is, says \\"do not attempt this at home\\" and then goes right on to detail how to do it.I guess my impression was that the book was really written by a vet for other vets, under the guise of being aimed at the general public. There is a lot of soapboxing in it, too, about how vets aren't allowed to practice chiropractic and chiropractors aren't allowed to practice on animals... and while this, if still true, definitely sucks - I didn't buy the book to read about it!"},{"Title":"The Well Adjusted Dog: Canine Chiropractic Methods You Can Do","review":"All of my friends are raving about Dr. Kamen's book."},{"Title":"The Well Adjusted Dog: Canine Chiropractic Methods You Can Do","review":"The lower back methods in the book are great."},{"Title":"The Well Adjusted Dog: Canine Chiropractic Methods You Can Do","review":"I was very interested and impressed with this book.

I agree with other reviewers that the jargon used in this book may be difficult to understand if you are not familiar with chiropractic. The only downside to the book is a little bit of ranting and conspiracy theory done by the author that gets a little old, but it is not that big of a downer. Altogether, this is an excellent book and provides some excellent information."},{"Title":"The Well Adjusted Dog: Canine Chiropractic Methods You Can Do","review":"As a show dog owner of an active dog that needed chiropractic care as a pup, I am pleased to know that I can now maintain my dog's health with maintenance adjustments.

I get the extreme hot summers but cooler winters than Tucson or Phoenix. I like this book mostly for plant culture. All the plant culture information most gardeners ever need is on-line, but desert gardening is bit counter-intuitive. It's helpful to have desert specific information. Most folks aren't planting their melons in March, but I am.For example: Owens'tomato growing information is right on. I know because I do it his way. I raise my tomatoes in the shade. That wouldn't work well way back East where I was raised. Last summer I had a great harvest despite a late visit from grasshoppers. I brought in 45 tomatoes to ripen indoors the day before our first frost of Oct 27. We enjoyed the last tomato of year December 6th---not bad.I'm talking real tomatoes you can slice and put on your sandwich, not just cherry tomatoes.I own two other desert gardening books: Mary Irish's Month-by-Month gardening in the Desert Southwest. This one is good for figuring out when to plant everything. And,Desert Gardening Fruits and Vegetables, The Complete Guide by George Brookbank. This book isn't organized as well as the other two books, but it was the first desert specific gardening book I bought. I've read it cover to cover several times and despite the poor black and white photos, it's my favorite of the three. I consider my desert gardening library complete with these three books."},{"Title":"Extreme Gardening: How to Grow Organic in the Hostile Deserts","review":"I live in Phoenix and have the opportunity of catching Dave Owens tips for gardening on Channel 3 on a weekly basis. Dave has so many tips for gardening that the only way to harness his knowledge is to purchase this book. I have come to find that these tips work not only for those of us living in the desert, but I pass them along to my Mother in Wyoming, and she has as much success as I do with them. Dave is an extremely knowledgable gardner and his book reflects that, the layout was very thought out and takes you step by step from the &quot;what do I need&quot;, to &quot;now I've got what I need, what do I do&quot; stages. Bravo, Dave!"},{"Title":"Extreme Gardening: How to Grow Organic in the Hostile Deserts","review":"David Owens has written a real winner with this book! He tells us which plants will survive in our harsh desert environment and how to plant and take care of them. The book is easy to follow and I'm having good luck with all the trees and vegetables I have planted using his guidelines.If you thought that gardening was not an option since you moved to the desert you need this book to show you the way!"},{"Title":"Extreme Gardening: How to Grow Organic in the Hostile Deserts","review":"I LOVE this book. It is the best, hands down, guide to growing veggies in Arizona. So many gardening books address other parts of the country and don't apply to the Southwest. I have 5 other \\"Southwest\\" gardening books and this is the first book I refer to. It combines organic gardening with gardening in the desert. If you are a newbie to southwest gardening and only want to read one book-get this one!"},{"Title":"Extreme Gardening: How to Grow Organic in the Hostile Deserts","review":"I just received this book and almost immediately saw advice to use Epsom salts as a source of magnesium. I've had soil tests run on samples from Tucson, western Washington State, and northern Virginia. For Tucson and western Washington the magnesium levels were VERY HIGH. For the Virginia sample the level was HIGH. Additionally, the Tucson sample had a very high level of Phosphorus. This is not a good thing -- having high or very levels of an individual element. Having essential elements in the correct proportions is important since an excess of one element may cause a deficiency of another element. I think not doing soil testing is false economy. Virgina Tech will do out-of-state soil testing for about $25 per sample. It will test for Phosphorus, Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium, Zinc, Manganese, Copper, Iron, Boron, and Sulfur salts. I have also used a private soil analysis company which included more such as Molybdenum, but that test cost bout $75. But, given the fact that it saved me money by not wasting money on things that were not needed and showed me what was needed, the cost of testing was a real bargain. The author makes no mention of soil testing. Of course, if you have accesss to lots of cheap high quality compost you can sometimes get away with a less scientific approach to gardening. But, please don't go dumping things like Epsom salts on your garden without knowing it needs it. Another handy thing to know is that most fertilizers will use Potassium Chloride (AKA Muriate of Potash). DO NOT buy these for vegetables. Potassium Chloride screws up the taste of many vegetables. Also, Potassium Chloride is not allowed on Organic gardens. Potassium Sulfate (Sulfate of Potash) is a naturally occurring compound and allowed on Organic farms. Potassium Sulfate costs about twice as much as Potassium Chloride. I think that is why most grocery store broccoli tastes bad. Unfortunately, I think many authors of garden books do not have the scientific background to give comprehensive advice. BTW, everything is chemicals. Although I try to be as \\"Organic\\" as possible, I hate it when the organic folks use the word \\"chemical\\" the way Republicans use the term \\"left-wing liberal press\\". I myself am quite comfortable with math and chemistry. I am sure I will get some good information from this book. I'll double check all its advice though."},{"Title":"Extreme Gardening: How to Grow Organic in the Hostile Deserts","review":"This is a great book for any gardening endvor using organic means.

Have purchased another as a gift. Gardening in the desert is not always easy- but with Dave's guide, I have grown watermellons, pumpkins, tomatoes, zuchinni, roses, citrus, cucumbers, cantalope, strawberries, carrots, beans, and so much more. I could not have been as successful without this book. I recommend this book all the time."},{"Title":"Extreme Gardening: How to Grow Organic in the Hostile Deserts","review":"I live in Las Vegas. I was excited to find a book on desert gardening. But this book was a disappointment.It is limited in content. A handful of veggies, fruits, flowers and herbs. Nothing that explains the difference one finds with desert gardening. The only thing that made it a desert gardening book was advice on planting time. This could have been accomplished on a single page. I know, because I had already downloaded a single page with the same data, for free, from an Arizona gardener.I've paid less for more information.

It was definitely a good place to start. It gives a lot of great information about setting up and planning your garden. It also has a lot of great hints about keeping things organic and conserving resources.My biggest gripe with the book is the layout. Now, that I have read it a zillion times, I wish that some of the info were arranged more in a quick-reference style. I'm sure this book was done as a low-cost self-publish sort of thing, but what would be great would be a companion laminated quick-reference. I still take this book to the nursery with me when I buy plants and I end up having to thumb through the thing. A spreadsheet layout would be great so that when readers want to plan their garden layout, all the information (like the \\"protect it\\", \\"plant it\\", \\"water it\\" stuff) is available side-by-side.Aside from that, this book has led to many successful harvests and enjoyable hours in my backyard."},{"Title":"Extreme Gardening: How to Grow Organic in the Hostile Deserts","review":"We are blessed with a long growing season but have difficulties with soil and timing of which plant to grow and when.

I thought I had met all the pests in my area! NO. That's OK, Dave has nifty organic recipes to help eradicate those who would eat your garden before you can. I love the fact that a ring-bound version is available and have referred to this book at least once a day since I got it.

Nothing grew like it should rather just shriveled up and died. Thought I had lost my touch until I read this book. Wow! what a differance, knowing how to amend your soil and keep enough water close to the plant to keep it alive in the desert. So far everything I've learned from this book has worked and It wasn't dull and drab talk about how to only be organic. Hell who cares if it grows and I can eat it.

But I came away with a great appreciation for baseball in far simpler times. The author's love and affection for his boyhood hero and his undying devotion to our national pasttime leaps from the pages.A must read for anyone who loves baseball and heroes."},{"Title":"Mel Ott: The Little Giant of Baseball","review":"Author Fred Stein has provided us with a well written biography about Mel Ott, one of the greatest players in the storied history of the New York Giants baseball team. Milton Shapiro wrote a biography of Ott in 1959 on a more juvenile level and it was long overdue for another more detailed biography of Master Melvin. Ott arrived at the Polo Grounds in the mid 1920's for a tryout on the recommendation of Harry Williams, a friend of Giants' manager John McGraw. McGraw didn't want anyone tampering with Ott's batting stance in the minor leagues and wanted to keep a close watch on the young teen ager. After gradually breaking Ott into the lineup and with the added confidence, Ott became one of the most popular players ever to play with the Giants. The book covers the story of Bill Terry's succeeding McGraw as Giants' manager as well as Ott's career as Terry's successor at the helm. It may be true that Ott didn't have the disposition to be a manager. When he acted up over an umpire's decision, his ranting just didn't appear to be real. I read with great surprise that Ott didn't attend his Hall of Fame induction at Cooperstown in 1951 because he was managing the Oakland Oaks in the minor leagues. I remember very well when Ott broadcasted Detroit Tigers' baseball games with Van Patrick from 1956 through 1958 and enjoyed him very much. His death in November of 1958 was a great loss to all of baseball and to those who followed the Tigers on the radio. Many athletes may be great on the field, but are a disappointment off the field. Ott didn't disappoint those who looked up to him. The book is easy to read and should be enjoyable for anyone from teen agers to adults. Thanks, Fred Stein for a great effort. I only wish the book was available in hard cover."},{"Title":"Mel Ott: The Little Giant of Baseball","review":"This book really showed me how good Mel was as a player and as a person. He was my great uncle, and although I never got to meet him (since he died before I was born), this book provided me with a great opportunity to learn more about him and how he lived his life. I recommend this book to any Mel Ott enthusiast or just about anybody who likes baseball, as it tells about one of baseball's best players and best people."},{"Title":"Mel Ott: The Little Giant of Baseball","review":"Mel Ott, in this day and age, seems to be a forgotten superstar. I think there are a number of reasons for this: the team he played for moved from its home of more than 70 years, from the place Ott played to a city across the country, where it developed its own heroes; he died at much too young an age, he was never a controversial figure in baseball, and the records he set, especially the league records, were largely eclipsed - a normal happening over time - by someone who played on the same team that he did, so he didn't even get to own the team records that he set.Thus, Fred Stein has done us all a favor by writing this book to remind us of the talent of Mel Ott, and of the temperment, sportsmanship and manners of the man. He traces Ott's life from his roots in Louisiana up to New York City, the development of his talent, the foresight of John McGraw to educate and protect him from anyone who would change his batting style, through his many years of stardom and his managerial efforts. There was not much of the book devoted to after he was released as manager of the Giants, such as his work on the farm system or his time as a Tigers broadcaster, but in the big picture of Ott's life, these are only footnotes to the greatness of his career.One other item that did bother me: at the end of the book, the author interviews a writer who, in the course of his work, interviewed Carl Hubbell and found him to be \\"dull,\\" and had the opportunity to sit at the same table with Dizzy Dean, Frank Frisch and Rogers Hornsby, whom he described as a \\"boor,\\" a \\"chatterbox,\\" and \\"mean,\\" I believe the descriptions were. The writer and Stein are entitled to their opinions about these people, and they may well be truthful and honest in their assessment; except for Rogers Hornsby, I hadn't heard the other gentlemen described in these terms, not to say that they may or may not be of which they are accused. I do know that by this stage of the book (almost at the end), Mel Ott does not need to be compared to these gentlemen; Stein has already completely made his point that Ott is polite, kind, entertaining, a fine interview, etc. There's no need to elevate Ott at the expense of lowering these ex-players. Ott and his personality can stand by itself; if you want to call someone a \\"boor\\" or \\"dull,\\" write a book about them and how they got to be that way; all of these fellows would make interesting topics in biographies (by the way, there are good books about Dean and Hornsby out there).Also, something interesting that Stein did not mention but would have been a point of coincidence is the number of ex-Giants in that era that died from auto accidents. Besides Mel Ott, other teammates include Carl Hubbell and Frank Frisch; there may be more, but I'd have to investigate. It's not often that a number of teammates and stars pass away from the same cause."},{"Title":"Mel Ott: The Little Giant of Baseball","review":"Fred Stein did a terrific job of bringing Mel Ott to life with great stories of his entry into baseabll at the age of 16 and his subsequent rise to become a Hall of Famer . The Postal Service recently honored Mel Ott by issuing a commemorative stamp and named him one of the all time great sluggers. Stein depicts the era in which Ott, Terry and Mcgraw as manager of the NY GIants, played, as one of the most exciting times to witness the greats in action. Well done and a must for any baseball enthusiast."},{"Title":"Sensuous Magic 2 Ed: A Guide to S/M for Adventurous Couples","review":"It used to be Patricia. Now it's Patrick. I don't think we have any right to question this author's self identity. It is a wonderfully informative book, especially for beginners, and is not restricted to male/female relationships, like so many books on sex/sexuality are. I have read all of Patrick's books and recommend them highly."},{"Title":"Sensuous Magic 2 Ed: A Guide to S/M for Adventurous Couples","review":"It's Patricia Califia. Not \\"Patrick.\\" I read the book more than 10 years ago and just referred it to an online friend, only to discover Patricia had a sex change, apparently.In any event, the book is excellent. Too bad it must carry a male name to sell, it seems. However, we females know who truly are the sexy ones."},{"Title":"Sensuous Magic 2 Ed: A Guide to S/M for Adventurous Couples","review":"This second edition of this book takes the material in the previous edition, updating it in certain spots and adds new material. As another reviewer has pointed out, this book is not a &quot;how to do BDSM manual,&quot; instead it covers more of the emotional and mental aspects of doing BDSM. And each of the chapters finishes with an erotic SM story, one that fits the topic just discussed in the chapter. Topics the author covers include myths about SM and demystifying them, communication &amp; negotiation, impact play, developing role preferences, different SM relationships, finding community, and even a chapter on edge play. Although some of this chapter some might feel is not necessarily edge play. Your mileage may vary.Califia also takes a realistic attitude about doing SM throughout the book, pointing out for example that what may really hot in your mind (like a full on 24/7 D/s relationship) may not be practical when it comes to things like doing shopping or picking up the dry cleaning, or holding down a 9 to 5 job every day. Or that your Top may have a bad day or not be perfect at all times. Reality rears its ugly head.Califia even includes a glossary of terms in the back, a resource guide, and further reading material. While the book is aimed primarily toward people new to BDSM, there's enough material here that even so-called &quot;veteran&quot; SM players will enjoy reading. Califia is a long time community member and his experience shows in the writing of this book."},{"Title":"Sensuous Magic 2 Ed: A Guide to S/M for Adventurous Couples","review":"Whenever someone asks about information about the SM Community, I have two required readings...Sensous Magic and the Leatherman's Handbook by Larry Townsend.I think Pat does an outstanding service to the community with thispublication. This first edition was very difficulty to obtain, so with this second edition, a new generation will benefit from her knowledge. As she says..if we don't take care of ourselves, who will."},{"Title":"Sensuous Magic 2 Ed: A Guide to S/M for Adventurous Couples","review":"Sensuous Magic is my favorite intro to BDSM book. The book covers all of the basic areas of BDSM in a way the both demystifies and normalizes. Patrick Califia approaches the topic in a way that emphasizes the emotional and spiritual aspects of BDSM play first, and the technical aspects second. Our brains are our biggest turn ons and he knows it. And, he manages to tuck erotica into each chapter - hot, hot, hot.One of the other things that i love about this book is the inclusion of all genders and sexual orientations. Mr Califia knows how important that is on a very personal level. He used to live as a woman, and now identifies as a man. The perspective of someone who has lived in multiple parts of the gender contiuim is valuable, especially when playing with power.If you don't have this book, and you are thinking about BDSM play, you need it.Happy playtime!"},{"Title":"Sensuous Magic 2 Ed: A Guide to S/M for Adventurous Couples","review":"The original 1993 edition of this book by Pat Califia is now replaced by this new edition by Patrick Califia (same person by the way). The chapters are increased from 6 to 10 and more information is included while everything else is updated. There is a lot of basic information here but this isn't a how-to book -- its focus is more on the mental and emotional and social aspects of starting out in SM (or BDSM if you prefer). So if you are starting out because you or a parnter knows you are interested, this book will help you figure out what next steps to take, how to discuss things, where to find resources and community; it will not teach you to tie knots or flog."},{"Title":"Sensuous Magic 2 Ed: A Guide to S/M for Adventurous Couples","review":"I can't believe it took me so long to find this book, although I think I understand why: allegedly, Califia's works have been some of those most seized by customs outside the US as pornographic, and maybe that's the reason why there's no real explicit reference to sex or kink in the title or description of this book. Which is a damned shame, because it's literally the best beginner book on BDSM you could possibly read and yet you probably won't come up with it unless you're looking, like I was, specifically for his work.I came to know Califia's work through essays in other books - his piece \\"Jessie,\\" inComing to Power: Writing and Graphics on Lesbian S/M, 2nd Revised and Updated Edition, was one of my absolute favorites from that book, and his essays on fisting and masochism inThe Ultimate Guide to Kink: BDSM, Role Play and the Erotic Edgewere hot, funny, and dead-on accurate.So, our boy nails it yet again, so to speak. Here's what's awesome about Sensuous Magic: IT'S ACTUALLY WRITTEN FOR BEGINNERS but doesn't treat 'em like they're stupid, either. It contains information about BDSM based on how people actually do it, and how you'll probably actually do it. And the interludes of fantasy/erotica are an absolutely brilliant touch - definitely inspiring.I have read many, many books on BDSM, and this is absolutely, without a doubt, the first one I would hand to someone who I wanted to educate about that particular lifestyle. It literally could not have been done any better."},{"Title":"Sensuous Magic 2 Ed: A Guide to S/M for Adventurous Couples","review":"This was my first book about BDSM. It's a well written book and allowed me to get a good foundation about lots of things. I really enjoy Patrick as an author (I have a number of his books) and I really like how his book is suitable for both straight AND gay/lesbian/queer folk. Regardless of what community you belong to this book is for you.I've checked out lots of other books on the market, gotta say most of them, and I would recommend this one the most for those people who are starting out. It's not overwhelming with information and presents things in a straightforward manner. Once you have a handle on things you can delve into the other books but I find some one them don't get to the soul of the experience, or throw too much info at you and it's difficult to wrap you head around what's going on.Once you have an idea of the idea and foundation of BDSM then pick up one of the technique books. This isn't really one of them, though it has lots of good resources in the back. This is a good resource book about the lifestyle and what to expect."},{"Title":"Sensuous Magic 2 Ed: A Guide to S/M for Adventurous Couples","review":"While I am not totally into this alternative lifestyle, I do think it's really good reading.

As Mark Muller writes, only by abandoning ethno-nationalism for nationalism, which strikes at the heart of Turkey's entire existence since 1920, can Turkey deal successfully with the Kurds. Discovering such a lesson is well worth reading this book.

Rather than analyzing the dynamics of why a church experiences a worship war, he instead describes differing worship styles among various congregations. He only gives a passing treatment of why a worship war begins within a church body, and what can be done to diffuse it or to discourage it.I recommend \\"America's Worship Wars\\" by Terry York instead of this title by Towns. Towns provides interesting reading, but the best treatment by far is given by York."},{"Title":"Putting an End to Worship Wars","review":"Dr. Towns is writing to the everyday church member in America, to tackle the growing problem of churches fighting over Worship \\"styles\\". He is trying to show his readers that there are several styles of worship that are biblically and culturally appropriate.

The maps ,color plates and pictures are all very good quality. Sir Horace Smith - Dorrien the commander of the BEF's 11 Corps emerges as an outstanding commander that most sucessfully navigated the \\" fog of war \\" in the defense postioning and fighting his Corps at Mons and Le Cateau against the far superior numbers of the German 1st Army. The German 1st and 2cd Armies had their chances to destroy the 11 Corps but the inexperience of their commanders Von Kluck and Von Bulow, faulty attack tactics by their infantry, exhaustion due to hard marching and stout defensive stands by a well trained British infantry firing up to 30 aimed shots per minute allowed the 11 Corps and BEF to survive and ultimately play a critical role in winning the battle of the Marne less than a month later. It is a pity that Smith - Dorrien was hated by the incompetent BEF Commander in Chief, Sir John French because his command insight and audacity was vital in the preventing German victories AND YET it was Smith - Dorrien who was ultimately was relieved of command due to French's anger and jellously. The British made some costly mistakes - inefficent communications left battalions and companies to be surrounded by overwhelming numbers and fighting their field artillery in the open resulted in 24 field guns being lost at Le Cateau {and 36 pieces overall} due to more effective German indirect artillery fire. The German army displayed reckless courage and took heavy casualties but also showed that they could and did} adjust their tactics to use their superior #s to envelope british defensive positions. Still, the long service / professional BEF acquitted itself with a military competence that was sorely lacking in the Kitchener \\" new army \\" that fought at the Somme in 1916. The narrative is an \\" easy read \\" and even the minor actions are mentioned even if briefly . This is a lucid, informative if brief telling of a legendary battle. I give this book 4 stars and recommend it to both the casual reader and World War 1 enthusiast."},{"Title":"Bataan: Our Last Ditch : The Bataan Campaign, 1942","review":"This text provides a detailed account of the Bataan campaign.It appears to be the only such treatment of forgotten period of American military history.

Whitman, an Airborne Infantry officer in the US Army, is also a fantastic researcher who has painstakingly produced a fantastic book. \\"Bataan\\" gives a nice \\"map level\\" view of the war, showing where each unit deployed and fought.

He succeeded in writing the finest single-volume combat book of America's first great land battle of WWII. In the years both before and after \\"Bataan: Our Last Ditch\\" was written, most authors have only glossed over the actual combat that took place over four brutal months, and instead they tend to focus on the Death March and the prisoner experience. While those \\"chapters\\" of history remain critical reading to Americans of all ages, Whitman's offering is instead a very disciplined and highly detailed account of the fighting before April 9, 1942. While a must have for any true WWII student, the book should also appeal to more casual readers. \\"Our Last Ditch\\" is a great testament to the Americans and Philippine Scouts who did so much to buy critical time in the early days of the Pacific War and fought valiantly to defend the Philippines. Whitman correctly identifies the Philippine Scouts as being among the finest soldiers in the US Army and provides numerous examples of their heroism under American command. There is also a healthy amount of information on the poorly equipped Philippine Army units that also did their share to defend their homeland, as well as the role played by the Marines, Navy Sailors, National Guard and Air Corps in the battle. Whitman ends his narrative on April 9th, intentionally leaving the Death March to other authors and choosing not to get into the final stand of the Americans on Corregidor. Instead, he offers a pure, if not somewhat formal at times, battle history of Bataan. Indeed, these men need to be remembered not simply as POWs or victims of atrocity, but also as Warriors with a capital \\"W\\"."},{"Title":"History of Folk Cross Stitch with 278 Coloured Charts","review":"Oh so many appealing designs. Where do they come from? Are they just pretty or do they mean something?Heinz Edgar Kiewe was a brilliant man who was really into the textile arts; he owned Art Needlework Industries, Ltd. in Oxford England, a company that designed tapestries, carpets and stitch kits and patterns. He was also a diligent historian and studied the research findings of Emil Sigerus from pre-WWI. Sigerus had tracked these folk designs all over the world beginning with the Bible to Saxon times to the contemporary Austro-Hungarian Empire. From Europe to Africa to the Far East. Kiewe presented a time-line for the patterns from 1920 B.C. to 1919 A.D....almost 4 millenia!! He identified each individual pattern's origin and meaning or symbolism. He took pains to note the first-known appearance of the design and on what article it was found such as clothing, pillows, art and even crowns. There is a detailed discussion of the cross stitch itself: was this \\"t\\" the cross of Jesus or was the \\"T\\" shape of the caduceus the correct shape?I'm being so detailed about this expressly because we all first learned how to do cross stitch and it is widely derided as too simplistic. When we realize we're following in ancient paths of embroidery, the nobility of cross stitch is revealed. There should be no snobbery."},{"Title":"The Anatomy of Power","review":"For prof. Galbraith there are three sorts of power (condign, compensating and conditioned) and three sources of power (personality, property and organization).With these elements he sketches a historical evolution of the West from feudalism to capitalism, integrating as diverse aspects as politics, economics, religion, the family, the military, advertising, media and education.This book was written in 1983, in a sometimes cynical tone, especially in the comments on politicians, businessmen and the military. It contains positive and negative elements.The author predicted the omnipotence of the military and the intelligence organizations, as well as their obsessive need for a specific enemy.He saw the rise of the organizational power, but not the fact that the influence of the transnational corporations would dwarf state and trade union power (see N. Hertz - The silent take-over).A mistake is his underestimation of the power of the media and their message controlled by the powerful.Also, the Darwinian aspect of power is not commented on.But, this small book is still a very worth-while read."},{"Title":"The Anatomy of Power","review":"Prof. Galbraith has surpassed himself in this book. Breaking power up into categories, he delves into sources of power, the evolution of power, projection and counter-action. The book is tightly written and the author provides plenty of historical examples to back it up. Written in the 1980s, it reflects the understanding of the time; specifically, Prof. Galbraith probably over-estimates military power and under-estimates the power of the press and the global corporation. But this takes little away from the deep insight in the book. One of the most powerful ideas in the book is that conditioning power, power which allows one to control how others think is the most insidious when it is hidden by a \\"solvent\\". One can extend this idea to understand how military power hides behind a facade of nationalism, and corporate power hides behind the efficient market hypothesis. By understanding how conditioning power, allied with the press works, we can get a 'under-the-hood' understanding of how modern society works.

Still, it is a mixed bag overall; some poems are gems and some are absolutely ignorable."},{"Title":"Things That Are Most in the World","review":"Just today I used this book to teach a decoding lesson to my first graders. They were captivated by the lively illustrations and quite entertained by the clever humor. This book lends itself well to a quick, low maintenance, yet creative activity. We began to make our own book in a similar fashion. Students completed the sentence, &quot;The _____est thing in the world is ______.&quot; They came up with some very creative responses and then illustrated them. We are looking forward to putting our book together right away and sharing it! This book could be used at different levels up through 3rd grade to target a variety of skills."},{"Title":"Things That Are Most in the World","review":"My daughter, who is about to turn 3, decided this would be a great book to take home from the public library. And the ONLY reason she wanted to take it home was because of the slice of pizza on the front cover. It easily became a quick favorite that she wanted me to read to her quite often. She affectionately refers to this as simply, \\"Pizza book!\\" So, Pizza book it is!But thankfully the pizza wasn't the only thing that caught her attention. Because this is to help kids develope their own examples of ______est words, it has lots of great illustrations. So, there's a dragon eating a slice of pizza on the front cover, right? Get to that in a book and it turns out that \\"The HOTTEST thing in the world is a fire-breathing dragon eating a pepperoni pizza.\\" Or, (one more example simply because I won't tell the whole book) is a little boy who fell asleep while doing his homework. There is an earthworm (or a bookworm) who has just taken a big bite out of his sandwich. And so the example in that one is, \\"The QUIETEST thing in the world is a worm chewing peanut butter.\\" Lots and lots of crazy, but hilarious pictures. Is it meant to be a little silly? Yep. But can it be used to teach kids a thing or two when it comes to helping their vocabulary? You bet!So, with my daughter's great urgency, I would definitely recommend \\"Pizza book\\" or as it is really called, \\"Things That Are Most In The World.\\" It is a nice break in the day, and you and your kiddo will laugh and point at some of the CRAZIEST things you've ever seen. You'll have a lot of fun!"},{"Title":"Things That Are Most in the World","review":"Great books to help teach primary kids the concept of adjectives (describing words, word choice).

At first glance you would say this is the greatest low fat, salt, sugar and cholesterol cookbook of all time. But wait, on page 566, one of many, is a recipe with 630 calories, 38 carbs, 40g of fat and 24g of Saturated Fat considered to fit this criteria. In my mind this is way too much for this type of cookbook. Where is the low salt listing for this item. And where is the low cholesterol listing. I entered the ingredients into my nutritional calculator and find that it has 128mg of Cholesterol and 660mg of sodium. Looking throughout the book salt and cholesterol is not listed on ANY recipe. How do we know what recipes fit the low salt and/or low cholesterol criteria.It's obvious that this cookbook is not what it appears. It is a compilation of low fat AND low sugar and COULD contain low salt and low cholesterol recipes. The latter two types we really don't know.Having stated the above, I still think this cookbook has value. Thus I gave it 3 stars.

This cookbook claims in 2 inch type to have 1000 LOW FAT recipes. It does NOT. In fact, almost *NONE* of the recipes are low fat -- yes, previous reviewer, they don't taste low fat because they are, in fact, mostly HIGH FAT! These recipes call for whole milk, multiple tablespoons of butter, sour cream, and get this: \\"full-fat cheese.\\" A typical recipe from this book has 20 - 30 g of fat per serving (and one even has 49g fat/ 614 calories -- that's 441 calories out of 614 from fat!). Given that the medical community recommends a max of 65g per DAY, well, eat one of these you get rice cakes for the rest of the day.As someone who must eat low-fat for health reasons, I can't eat anything from this cookbook.

I really enjoyed looking through it and of course looked it up on Amazon to see all the info.I will say that I bought mine used, for about $5. The book is VERY heavy - like a physician's desk reference or something large and somewhat cumbersome. But the pictures are beautiful and each page is laid out with a gorgeous color photo of the recipe, then the full recipe, nutritional information, and step by step photo instructions, therefore each page IS a recipe card.The recipes are different, unusual, and yet the ingredients don't seem to be bazaar or far fetched from what I have seen. And the directions look far more simple than each beautiful photo display of the finished product appears.I don't know why it is titled as it is.

In \\"Kennedy's Commandos\\" the ladies take on survival training camp and teach some hard-nosed military men a few new tricks. In \\"Sins of Touch\\" the girls unravel the threads of a topsy-turvy case involving stalking, extortion, and the shooting of a male stripper.What worked for me:I particularly enjoyed reading about the Girls' hijinks in the short story \\"Kennedy's Commandos\\", which was a pleasant introduction to the various women involved in this cadre of detectives.As far as size goes, it wasn't really an issue in these stories. Some of the ladies presented were larger, some were smaller. Some were old and some were young. All were intelligent, funny, and passionate about their work.What didn't work for me:There were some editing oversights which made for a slightly bumpy read.The large cast of characters in \\"Sins of Touch\\" was at times difficult to keep track of, and provided less opportunity to develop a rapport with individual Gumshoe Girls as in the less-populated \\"Kennedy's Commandos\\".Overall:Editing issues aside the stories were enjoyable, quirky, and worth having a look at.

Iris was sure of it-until she was thrust into the life of this powerful by lost and lonely man.Sort of Sound of Music with one child and no humor.

I've now read all but one of the Hannay adventures (this one, plus &quot;39 Steps&quot; and &quot;Mr. Standfast&quot;) and thoroughly enjoyed them all. &quot;Hostages&quot; moves a bit slower and doesn't have quite as much &quot;local flavor&quot; as the others; but it's a fine book, with much to recommend it and much to remember.I enjoyed especially the respectful portrait of Hannay's wife, every bit as smart and tough as he -- quite surprising in an era (and culture) that I had assumed would be somewhat chauvinistic -- and a real relief from other spy stories in which the women simply scream helplessly until The Man comes along. Mind you, I have no political agenda -- and indeed am quite conservative about gender roles; but I just find it so much more sensible and realistic when women characters act like human beings!&quot;Hostages&quot; is also remarkably prescient about the onset of WW2, and how Hitler would try to rule the world not merely through brute force but through propaganda and mass hysteria. There is also some fine thematic development here, esp. the notion that a spy mission may achieve &quot;success&quot; without &quot;victory.&quot;But the best thing about the book is its final chapter; as in &quot;Standfast,&quot; &quot;Hostages&quot; has a split climax; the main conflict is resolved about 35 pages before the end of the book, and then there's a further, more nitty-gritty, down-to-earth duel at the end. Fantastic!These books are great for folks looking for good old-fashioned adventure like James Bond, but without the girls and the violence.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Three Hostages","review":"This is Buchan's fourth novel featuring Richard Hannay, hero of The Thirty-Nine Steps, and if you can pretend you are a somewhat naive reader in the 1920s and just sit back and enjoy the ride as if it were an old movie serial, you'll probably enjoy it very much. The story is set after World War I, with Hannay settled down, married and with a son. Manipulative evil still prowls the world, however, and Hannay's old spy boss Bullivant calls him out of retirement to deal with one threat in particular. As you can guess from the title, there is hostage-taking -- three times over -- and enigmatic clues to decipher and underlings to ferret out. Espionage jack-of-all-trades Sandy Arbuthnot is in on the action, as is Hannay's wife Mary, and an old wartime acquaintance of Hannay's makes an appearance as well. Admittedly, portions are melodramatic and hokey by today's standards, but it's still a rollicking good read, right up to the final confrontation between Hannay and his nemesis du jour."},{"Title":"The Three Hostages","review":"The story is pretty good, but paying 4 dollars for an ebook that is filled with the same errors and lack of pagination as the free Project Gutenberg version is ridiculous. What a waste of money..."},{"Title":"The Three Hostages","review":"I have enjoyed many of John Buchan's novels: The Thirty Nine Steps, John McNab, Huntingtower (especially amusing), The Island of Sheep. But this Richard Hannay novel is rather strange, involving the use of hypnotism as a means to gain political power. Most of his novels are rather far-fetched, but fun. I'd give this one a miss though. Really out-there!"},{"Title":"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince?","review":"Lucy Norton might actually have a wicked stepmother, or so she seems to believe. While her bratty stepsister practically get away with murder, she gets in trouble for the smallest things. Her father is hardly ever home to know the difference, and merely takes what she says as over reacting. Lucy believes that her life has seriously gone down the drain, until the day she sees Connor Pearson. Every Cinderella gets a prince, right?If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince? is a cute, quirky, short read. It caps out at 283 pages, and I flew through them in a matter of mere hours. I've always had a love for modern day fairy tales, and this one is no exception. At first I thought this book was going to be a lot about how Lucy was just a drama queen, and for awhile, it really was. I had to read on to get the full picture.As far as I'm concerned, the way Lucy's stepmother treated her in this novel was quite wrong. I personally would have labeled her as a wicked stepmother myself, and it wouldn't have hurt to throw a bucket of water of her head to see if she melted. Her bratty daughters were no exception, as they were only nice when it benefited them. And for Lucy's father?, her blood related father?, he rarely listened to his daughter. I understood why Lucy was as dramatic as she was, and I probably would have acted the same way had I been in her shoes.Melissa Kantor easily gave the impression of a modern day Cinderella story, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. A few other great things about this story are the life lessons that Lucy learns along the way. It's not only a modern fairy tale, but a coming of age novel about a girl growing into herself, and understanding her place in the world. I'd highly recommend this title to those of you who enjoy a good modern day retelling of one of your favorite fairy tales, as well as fans of other works by Melissa Kantor."},{"Title":"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince?","review":"I probobly never would have known this book existed if i hadn't been wondering through a book store in my downtown area. Just looking at book after book is hard, trying to find something cute, but sassy...a good read for a 13 year old girl. I picked up this book and it may have been the sparkly cover that intreged me, but somehow I knew I had to have it. I started reading this book and it seemed pretty good and really funny. As it when on, it got a little boring and predictable. Also, their is some teen drinking in it and some suggestive content probobly a little old for young children. It's an all around good book with a picture perfect ending and a cute novel any pre-teen girl could relate to."},{"Title":"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince?","review":"For some teens, high school life isn't exactly easy --- especially when you're \\"the new kid.\\" Staying silent in class is customary, not making eye contact in the halls is well-advised, and eating alone at the lunch table is a given. For many of these less outgoing newcomers, blending into the background is the safest route to take in order to avoid calling attention to any differences that might stick out or invite judgment from the hipper, trendier, cool crowd. Feeling invisible or lonely is hard to handle in your teenage years, but being the brunt of the in-crowd's ridicule is significantly worse --- it's torture.When sixteen-year-old Lucy Norton and her newly-remarried father relocate from San Francisco to a posh suburb of Long Island to live with the new stepfamily, Lucy's life is turned upside down. She is friendless, virtually homeless (her new \\"room\\" consists of an air-mattress on the floor in an unfurnished basement), and is faced with the difficult challenge of getting along with her two spoiled, teeny-bopper younger stepsisters and her impossibly shallow, constantly redecorating stepmother. On top of that, her once attentive father has no time for her between his weekly trip back to the West Coast for work and his newly acquired \\"perfect\\" family. The more time she spends in her new environment, the more Lucy begins to feel like poor, pathetic Cinderella --- overworked, under-appreciated, and hopelessly alone.As in every quintessential fairy tale, however, Lucy's life suddenly changes for the better. With just one haphazard comment in the lunchroom about sports, she captures the attention of the hottest guy in school (the star of the varsity basketball team, of course), and manages to make two best girlfriends in the process. From that moment on, her life consists of shopping and gabbing with the girls; going to \\"it\\" upperclassmen parties; making out with Connor Pearson, her Prom King boyfriend; and working on her self-portrait in the art room while simultaneously chatting up her mysterious and talented, but seriously off-putting classmate, Sam Wolff. Despite constant aggravation from her wicked stepsisters and evil stepmother, Lucy has transformed herself into the most popular chick at school in just a few short weeks, and has packed a social calendar worthy of any classmate's envy. What more could Cinderella ask for?But, as Prom approaches and Lucy starts to feel like the time spent with Connor consists solely of wandering hands and sports talk, the fairy tale romance that she once believed was possible seems cracked. Could it be that the connection she had hoped to feel with Connor might be better suited with someone thoughtful, intelligent and quirky --- like Sam Wolff? What would everyone say if she broke up with the jock to date the art freak? Would her much sought-after and cool reputation survive if disconnected from the popular group's influence?With plenty of trendy lingo, girlie gossip, and prom talk to go around, Melissa Kantor's second novel is a lighthearted and humorous read, perfect for fans of The Princess Diaries series. Although a bit predictable at times and maybe a smidgeon too fluffy to satiate some early teens' tastes, IF I HAVE A WICKED STEPMOTHER, WHERE'S MY PRINCE? nonetheless delivers enough fun and charm to make the reading experience a purely enjoyable one.--- Reviewed by Alexis Burling"},{"Title":"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince?","review":"I didn't have high hopes upon starting the book, but I was still disappointed. Lucy, the heroine, is rude to the people around her, and openly hostile to her family. The \\"wicked stepmother\\" situation is bad, but the heroine is unsympathetic in her responses. When her father steps in to try to help, she just makes it worse and shows no remorse. I have no idea how the author managed to put in a happy ending. She also spends the book balancing two boys, but gains the first too easily. As for the second, I'm unclear as to when she became interested in him. I've read poor romantic fiction before, but this is pretty bad. Perhaps, if the book focused on how Lucy grew up and started learning to be civil to the people around her, it would've been a better book; the author never suggests that Lucy is in the wrong, and the happy ending doesn't even seem deserved. Typical high school angst, not fitting in, school hero skyrockets shy girl to popularity, but one of the weakest books of the genre."},{"Title":"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince?","review":"i think this book is exelent and a great book. my daughter read it, she's 13, and she loves it...."},{"Title":"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince?","review":"I started this book last night and stayed up until almost 2 in the morning reading it. Yes, it's that good.I love how Lucy starts out as mega uncool and then goes straight to the top in what seems like overnight. With just one comment about basketball, she has the attention of the hottest, most sought after guy in the school who just happens to be big on basketball and the star player. At the same time, she makes two best friend. After that, though her life at home stays horrible, she spends her time gabbing with her friends, going to the A-list parties, shopping for dresses, and kissing her new boyfriend.But then, on one date, Lucy realizes something isn't right. It seems their relationship is just about touching and basketball. Soon after, she begins having feelings for another guy, but she can't dumb her guy or she'll lose everything she gained, won't she?This story is fun, unpredictable, and sweet. It really tells the life of the new girl and it's an amazing read. I definitely recommend reading it!"},{"Title":"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince?","review":"As you can probably tell from the title, \\"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince?\\" is a Cinderella story- with a twist. Lucy Norton hasn't been having the best year since her dad got remarried and she had to move from California to New York. She has given up on making friends at her new High School, Glen Lake, and her home life isn't any better. With her dad in California finishing up a big case,her evil stepmother Mara, and her two annoying stepsisters,Emma and Amy (a.k.a. the princesses) are in charge. Lucy is forced to live in the unfurnished basement and is often ordered around and ignored even when her dad is home.Things start looking up for Lucy when an inadvertent slip of the tongue catches the attention of the most popular guy in school, Connor Pearson. Soon she is adopted into his crowd and busy with prom details. Meanwhile, she has to deal with her parents and Sam Wolff. Sam is a seemingly cocky and amazingly talented senior in her art class. She tries to befriend him but her first attempts seem useless. Eventually, the problems with her parents are resolved and she realizes Prince Charming isn't all he's cracked up to be. Luckily, she gets a happy ending with an unexpected prince. Although the plot line is predictable,Melissa Kantor, a teacher in New York and author of The Breakup Bible, did a wonderful job. This book makes you believe in fairytales and happily ever afters."},{"Title":"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince?","review":"I started this book with not too many hopes, I was just passing the time really. I was enjoying the book up until about the last two chapters. The story switched paces far too abruptly for my taste. It didn't develop the relationships between Lucy and her two 'beaus' well enough. Suddenly she realized that she actually didn't like her boyfriend when in fact one chapter ago she was perturbed that he would be looking at another girl. Then in the last chapter she just goes off with the actual guy she likes. It never concludes anything, I have a pit in my stomach from reading this book. I feel like it is not complete and there should be some finality to the story, the author gave the impression of a conclusion, but nothing concrete. Overall I found this book entirely disappointing."},{"Title":"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince?","review":"This was a satisfactory book with funny dialogue. What I really enjoyed was how I could relate to the character being the new girl in school and the author articulated the awkwardness of not having any friends in a class or not knowing how to join in on a converation well.The book was a fairy tale. It's one of the things that I didn't really like. Lucy's instant rise from friendless to being best friends with the most popular girls in school and being the girlfriend of the hottest guy is really unrealistic. It just doesn't happen like that in real life. Also the cruelty of her stepmother and her father's refusal to listen to her when they were supposedly very close was a bit strange. When you then add the ending where everything suddenly seems dandy and Lucy goes from toying with the idea of asking her boyfriend to kill her stepmother to hugging her stepmother lovingly, well it's a bit much. Dare I say it was almost too corny for me.But hey it's supposed to be a kind of a modern day cinderella fairy tale so I shouldn't have have expected realism and it ended happily ever after.This book was an easy read, it probably took me about 2-3 hours in one sitting to read it. I wouldn't buy it. I got it from the library and enjoyed it to a certain degree but would never want to read it twice."},{"Title":"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince?","review":"\\"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's my prince\\", a current day Cinderella story, is filled with humor and today's problems that teenagers face. This book is so unpredictable you won't believe it! Lucy starts off as the average new kid, in a big school, with no friends but a secret crush. Her mother died but her new stepmother and sisters are there. He dad is always gone to work. Does this remind you of Cinderella? When I was reading this book I was laughing so hard when she told her corny jokes that no one understood, such as: Who is going to win the basket ball game? I think the bears are Lucy answers. Really Lucy is a sports fanatic. I also laughed at how her quantity time with her step mom and dad was furniture shopping.Some of the problems deal with drugs and drinking at her thirteen year old little sister's party. Other problems are girl problems like what am wearing to prom, and does he really like me? Lucy thinks she loves Conner, but will he be her prince in the end? Let's just say that this is the most unpredictable book I've ever read and love it. The way Melissa Kantor writes pondering thoughts like \\"Conner Pearson knows who I am, I found myself thinking. He knows my name. Of course, my name was just about the only thing he did know about he, but it was something. After all, what did Prince Charming know about Cinderella besides her shoe size?\\" Makes you want to keep reading forever.I hope you enjoy helping Lucy go through all the problems, and laughs in her real life Cinderella story. I know I did."},{"Title":"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince?","review":"Somehow, I get drawn to Cinderella-like stories. And I have to say, this is the best one yet. It is like a modern Cinderella, except the end is more closed than the actual Cinderella. I think Lucy is a kind of wannabe throughout most of the book: she wants to be cool, and she wants to be an artist. But in the end she does what she actually needs to do in order to be these things, because throughout most of the book she was following the wrong path. I'm happy that she doesn't go out with Connor, too, because he sounds like the typical High School popular jerk."},{"Title":"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince?","review":"This book was an atypical version of Cinderella. I enjoyed it. Sophomore Lily has just moved to New York City because her father, who is rarely around anymore, has just married a wicked woman and forced Lily to move in with them. Lily has it all. As a talented artist she has zero to no friends. She tries to make friends with Sam Wolff, a junior who is also an amazing artist, but is unsucessful. She somehow manages to catch the eye of the senior basketball captain. She becomes the popular 'it girl' but its not exactly what she expected. A visit to the prom changes everything for Lily. This fun-loving, young, spirited novel kept me entranced. It wasn't all that I expected but I loved it! A true cinderella story."},{"Title":"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince?","review":"Melissa Kantor's If I Have A Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince? may have a strange title but the plot is indeed absorbing: teen Lucy's father remarries and their move from the West Coast to Long Island. Lucy gains two bratty stepsisters and a stepmother she isn't wild about - plus a new school with romantic complications. Humor and authentic drama blend in her struggle to adjust."},{"Title":"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince?","review":"This book If I have a wicked stepmother, wheres my prince? by Melissa Kantor is one of my favorite books that i have read. It is a comedy but also has A LOT of romance in it as well. It is a teen novel that i would think any teenage girl would love because in someway it relates to us! Even if you dont have all the life problems that Lucy may have such as your mom died and your dad marries a evil women with two annoying daughters, or you are not the most popular girl in school this book is still a little of what we are in it and also what we want!"},{"Title":"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince?","review":"Wow. thanks for perpetuating the stereotype of the wicked stepmother, right off the bat from your title to your storyline. hopefully the author never marries a man who has children...or maybe she should, so she can be labeled with a stereotype whether it applies to her or not."},{"Title":"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince?","review":"I am glad I purchased this online.

Probably the first thing that comes to mind is Cinderella. And you are not far off. The main character in this enjoyable book feels as if she is being treated like a Cinderella; even her new friends think so.When Lucy's mother died, leaving behind her husband and young daughter, it meant it was just the two of them for several years. Then her dad remarried and moved them to live in another city with his new wife and her two younger daughters. Lucy was relegated to a room in the basement, a very inadequately furnished room, and her dad was hardly ever home because he was still working in the city where they had lived before Lucy's life was turned upside down.Lucy felt unfairly treated, being expected to do chores the other girls were not asked to do and not treated very nicely. She felt like a .. well, the way Cinderella may have felt. Then she falls for a boy and things just get more complicated.This is a story that holds the reader's interest, and I think especially young teen girls will like it. I found myself thinking at times, this girl is being so emotional and self-centered ... like a teenage girl with the jealousy, the angry outbursts, the drama. But that simply means Melissa Kantor hit it right on. Being on the other side of all that hormonal craziness it is easy to see what should have taken place, and I kept hoping someone would see through everyone's foolishness and set things right. (Even the stepmother was exasperating.)I won't tell you what happened. ** Possible spoiler alert ** What I will say is .. there is some of the normal temptation stuff, but it's the drinking that becomes the issue for awhile. It is handled well by the author, Melissa Kantor.This is an easy book to read, interesting and engaging, and not simply a young person's book. Why not branch out and see what our young people are reading these days? :)"},{"Title":"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince?","review":"Well i request this from netgalley and i got it for review. It's a retelling of Cinderella, I'm pretty sure you guys all know the fairy tale story :) I love love re tellings. And this one is one of them. It got published a few years ago soo yeah. I was definitely hooked to this book. I couldn't even put this book down. It took me two days to read it since I was reading other books too. I can totally feel like characters madness. This book makes me mad in a good way. I totally HATE the stepmother.So it's about a girl name Lucy. Her mother died when she was really young and after a couple of years. Her father re marries and they have to move into the stepmother's house. She lives in the basement, the freak?! Anyways, she's not popular at school.Everyone.. I mean everyone likes this guy, Conner Pearson. He's the hottest guy in high school and he's single. Suddenly one day Lucy talks about Basketball and Conner overhear her talking. Then he join the conversion and they both starts liking each other. After that day, Conner and Lucy started dating. Then everyone starts noticing her and wanting to be friends. Lucy believes that Conner is her prince.Her stepmother is soooo annoying UGH. She's like 'I want this...Oooo I want this too' It makes me mad! It's weird since i never felt mad about a book before. And her dad believes everything her stepmother says. She twist everything Lucy said. Her dad is sooooooooooo freaking blind -_____- I hate how she has to hold in her anger every time she gets 'in trouble' by her stepmother. But I do like how they treat her at the end.Lucy loves drawing. So does her mother. She's in art class and she's the second best in the class. The best is Sam Wolff, he's the type of guy who doesn't talk at all, but that's at first. Lucy thought he was mad and stuff but after what he did to her, which i'm not going to tell you because i don't want to spoil it :) Sam and Lucy has a friend relationship......kinda.I think you should totally read this book! :)"},{"Title":"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince?","review":"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother Where's My Prince by Melissa kantor5 STARSWell if the purpose of this book is to make me feel for Lucy it was successful.My emotions where all over the place even shed a bunch of tears.Lucy's father got remarried and they moved from San Francisco to New York to live in her stepmother's house.

She did try to talk to a boy Sam in art class but he was rude. One day she heard these boys talking about a NBA basketball game who was going to win. Lucy made a remark about they being so wrong. Next time she saw them they told her good call on the game. Then Connor Pearson started to ask her out. Connor was popular and on the basketball team. Lucy than became popular and had friends and lots of others waved or talked to her in the halls.The only problems I had with the book was all the drinks they had and was no big deal. champaign, wiskey.beer seemed like the adults did not care either.

She lost her mother at a very young age and now, as a freshmen in high school, her father has remarried. The thing is, though, he couldn't marry a woman who lived in the same city or even the same side of the United States! No! He chose to marry a woman with twin divas who lives on the opposite side of the country!!! THEN - after they move he only comes \\"home\\" on the weekends, leaving her with the new wife and stepsisters all week long. Ugh! And the kicker? She may as well be invisible since no one at home, let alone school seems to know that she even exists.Ugh, what a miserable existence, until..... Connor Pearson.... Oh, yes, you heard right! Connor Pearson, only the most popular guy (SENIOR!) in school noticed her. Okay, so it wasn't HER so much as her knowledge and opinion in basketball that he noticed. But from that minute on, at least her school life came, well, to life! Suddenly everyone wanted to be her friend and Connor? Well, he's now her BOYFRIEND (squee).Hmmm... if everything is going so great with one of her lives, what does that mean? Does that mean that her glass slipper is about to fall? And when it does, which life will it fall from and who will take notice?If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince? was an overall cute read.What I liked:The title is what caught my attention - great humor and spunk in the title.I loved how Lucy was always drawing similarities between her life and Cinderella's.I liked the artistic side of Lucy and how she also applied it to Basketball and her relationship with her dad.I have a soft spot for nerdy guys, so Sam was right up my alley.What I didn't like:How shallow and one dimensional the secondary characters were. I imagine this was by design since that's basically how they treated and interacted with Lucy - but I don't remember Connor ever referring to Lucy by name?As the book progressed, it seemed as though Lucy's character regressed into a more childish character: more tantrums, more spoiled behavior, etc.The ending was very quick to happen - realization, confrontation, and tie it up in a pretty (Happily Ever After) bow.All in all, as I said before, a cute read. Thank you, Ms. Kantor!"},{"Title":"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince?","review":"When Lucy moves from San Fransisco to New York because of her dad's marriage to her step-monster Mara, Lucy's dad still commutes back and forth for work, Lucy is left alone with Mara and her twin daughters and relegated to sleep in the basement without furniture. When Lucy catches the attention of a popular basketball star, it seems like her life is truly a fairy tale come true. As Lucy gets to know Sam, a fellow artist, she must decide if she wants a fairy tale or real love.This book is a light, fun read, but I felt the end was rushed. The storyline is interesting although predictable, but the characters never really grabbed my attention. I liked Lucy but didn't really care about the other characters, including the \\"prince\\" who captures her heart.I received this book in exchange for my review.

She is treated badly by her stepmother and her father is away most of the time and doesn't have any friends at her new school. When the school basketball star (the prince) asks her out she is very excited and finds her life changing.I loved this book. It was sweet and fluffy and a nice fairytale adaptation. I loved Lucy who grows from an unconfident shy girl into a girl who is finally able to express her needs to fix both her social and family life. I tore through this book reading it very quickly and was sad when it ended.Appropriateness: Lucy's boyfriend drinks excessively on several occasions (and this is used to make him seem less than perfect). Lucy drinks a glass of wine at an art show but does not drink when her boyfriend does. She's rebellious at times but not in a destructive manner (running off to an art gallery opening instead of going home) This is a perfect book to use as a starting point for what to do if your teen does go to a party where alcohol is served or if their boyfriend or friends are drinking as Lucy is fairly immune to peer pressure when she knows something is wrong. I would recommend this book to readers 12+ (with an encouraged parental discussion with the middle school crowd)"},{"Title":"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince?","review":"I would have never read this book if it weren't for my friend who recommended it for me. This book, \\"If I have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince?\\" is a fascinating and interesting book that anyone in there pre-teens to teenage years or anyone in that is a young adult should read it. It has everything you could want in a comedy/romance book: humour, comedy, romance, anguish, and family. When 16 year old Lucy Norton goes the hardships of her life, what with have a wicked stepmother and two evil little stepsisters, she seems to be suffering a lot, and all lone.

Very light and enjoyable. So why only three stars? I like the book, I really do, but I HATE the main character! Lucy Norton in NO WAY deserves to be compared to Cinderella. The character of Lucy is incredibly annoying! And usually, I can look pass annoying characters but with Lucy, that was impossible. The thing I hate about her the most is that she has no back bone. The girl is as spineless as a squid and is a huge brat. I have no sympathy for her at all. None. Especially because a LOT of the things that were going wrong for her, she the power to prevent but like I said, the girl has no frikin back bone! She allows herself to be in the \\"misery\\" that she's in when in reality, she actually doesn't have it that bad at all but complains about it all the time. So I find it absolutely ridiculous that she compares herself to Cinderella. Like I stated earlier, I DO like the book and it was enjoyable despite the predictable plot. I liked that it was relatable to a lot teens out there and that the high school life depicted was quite realistic. But I can't stand how incredibly annoying and weak the main charcter was. Lucy Norton is pathetic."},{"Title":"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince?","review":"Lucy Norton's new life seems like the stuff of fairytales--in the worst possible way. Because of her father's remarriage, she's had to move from one coast to the other to live in a Long Island suburb. As if the move weren't bad enough, Lucy now has a wicked stepmother, two bratty stepsisters, and a whole bunch of chores. But if Lucy is the new Cinderella, then isn't she supposed to get the prince (okay, star basketball player), dance at the ball (or prom), and live happily ever after? Because at the moment, that looks impossible. But if Lucy plays her cards right and sticks things through, she may find happiness and get the guy of her dreams after all.If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince? is a fantastic story of when fairytale crashes into reality. There are several things fairytale (especially Cinderella) references are used for in this novel, especially for comic comparison, to heighten the reader's sympathy for Lucy's plight, and as a source of character growth. All three of these points work extremely well, and because of them, Kantor establishes a perfect balance between seriousness and humor. This is extremely important because it makes the main characters and their circumstances more believable. As for the actual plot itself, it is sweet but somewhat predictable. I could foresee who Lucy would end up with early in the story and how that relationship would play out. It was still cute and enjoyable to read about though. There were a couple of changes at the end of the story I didn't quite buy into such as Lucy's new friends' loyalty and her stepmother's change of heart. In the grand scheme of things, though, this novel remains a sweet, funny, and heartwarming story.This novel will be enjoyed by fans of Shrinking Violet by Danielle Joseph, Miss Match by Wendy Toliver, and other young adult romances. I look forward to reading more from Kantor."},{"Title":"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince?","review":"When Lucy's father remarries, she's moved cross-country into her new stepfamily's home. She's shuffled into the basement where she has no furniture (stepmom Mara is \\"looking for the perfect furniture\\" still), and has to endure the Princesses, twin twelve year olds who constantly disparage Lucy's lack of style, and is a complete loner at school. Things couldn't be worse.But then Connor Pearson begins to notice her, and they connect through their shared love of basketball. Slowly Lucy begins making new friends, and it feels as if things are looking up, despite her less than ideal family situation. But is Connor Lucy's Prince Charming?If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince is a quick and easy read with plenty of humor, romance, and excitement. Kantor portrays the family drama in the novel quite well, highlighting the frustrations and struggle that stepfamilies face, which plays into the Cinderella theme. But despite the play on words, that's about as far at the book wanders toward the fairy tale. Lucy's story can easily stand on her own as she makes new friends, explores her artistic talents, and struggles to be the daughter her father expects her to be. Though the resolution of the book is a bit cheesy, it will satisfy readers. If I Have A Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince makes a nice, fun summer read.Cover Comments: I like the purple color scheme, and the font. The sparkly star is unexpected and a really neat touch in that it really stands out. I also like how the fluffy dress brings in the fairy tale element, but the converse shoes keep it modern."},{"Title":"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince?","review":"I received this book as a gift in my Christmas stocking and left it sitting on my shelf for a long while due to skepticism about how entertaining it might actually be. Then, one morning I grabbed it on the run since it's my rule to never leave the house without a book in my bag. I started reading during my lunch break and found that I was very disappointed to have to quit reading and go back to work when my hour was up.Lucy Norton has recently been uprooted from her home and friends back in San Francisco and replanted on Long Island, where she's currently living with her stepmother and twin stepsisters while her father finishes up some work on the west coast. She's a shy girl who hasn't quite found her niche in the new school she's attending, until her love of basketball draws the attention of the senior star of the high school team.You can pretty much guess where things will lead from there. But, I'm happy to say that there are a few nicely added plot twists to keep the story from becoming trite. Ms. Kantor also has an excellent way of phrasing things that makes for a very humorous read.My one complaint is that I would've liked to see a little more character development. But, it could also be argued that the author was purposely trying to keep the characters flat, as they are in the most famous of fairy tales.This certainly isn't the Brothers Grimm. But, it's definitely a great read for a rainy weekend or a day at the beach. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince?","review":"This book was written in a very easy-to-relate, lighthearted way, highly reminiscent of everyone's favorite The Princess Diaries! The metaphors in this were extremely effective, and I'm really not one to say that lightly. When they were used, they were used in such a way so as not to be distractive, but to genuinely contribute to the writing. They don't seem forced in the slightest. The characters frustrated me for a while, and I was unable to see where they were coming from (particularly the basketball loving, popularity seeking main character), but soon, I did grow to tolerate them, some more than others. One thing I really loved about this book was that the main romantic interest was not incredibly obvious from the start. He was introduced subtly, although in the end, he seamlessly blends in to the rest of the story. Kantor not only breaks the cliches, she addresses them quite clearly before doing so, written in a very 'in your face' manner. I didn't like the title, and it wasn't actually the length of it that disturbed me--it was the fact that while, yes, she was looking for a prince, for the majority of the book, she was convinced she already had a 'prince' and the focus was more on the stepfamily than anything. Still, I loved it. I didn't agree with everything the characters said or did, but in the end, everything was adorably charming and thoroughly lovable.Rating: 4.5/5"},{"Title":"If I Have a Wicked Stepmother, Where's My Prince?","review":"The book called, \\"If I have a wicked stepmother where's my prince?\\" is a well written book by Melissa Kantor.

The one comment I have that made it a 4 Star instead of a 5, is that I didn't find it believable that Lucy went from practically being ostracized to hanging out with the most popular girls and having the attention of the hottest guy. It happened too quickly. I'm not even sure how it happen. The transition was a bit abrupt for me.

Scheler's response is multi-faceted but centers on Nietzsche's failure to understand the nature of Christian love. Christianity is not a destructive enterprise trying to bring everyone down to the same low level of its impotent faithful, who must put their trust in the next world because they can get nowhere in this one. Rather, it attempts constructively to bring everyone UP to a new level of human flourishing. Christianity's preoccupation with the poor, weak, and marginalized stems from a recognition, through divine love, of the miracle of God's creation and infinite possibilities present even in them. The following quotation well represents Scheler's position (and Nietzsche's perspectival error): &quot;Those people [modern nihilists] saw something bug-like in everything that lives, whereas [St.] Francis sees the holiness of life even in a bug.&quot; (p. 70). This monograph is certainly not the last word on Nietzsche's famous anti-Christian polemic, and it contains many avenues of argumentation that are not described here; but it is fair to say that it articulates a capable response to the core of his arguments. And like the Texas Cottonwood tree, when the core of the trunk rots, the result is obvious during the next storm."},{"Title":"Ressentiment","review":"In this slim but brilliant volume Max Scheler explains how the egalitarian philosophies of the modern secular age springs from the systematic resentment of those who are materially, intellectually, or even spiritually better off than oneself. Although it may pass itself off as deriving from noble humanitarian sentiment, the emotional disposition that underlies egalitarianism is the very negation of true Christian charity, which is the loving affirmation of the unique person, whatever its circumstances in life. Once you understand the irrational well springs of egalitarian thought, it is no surprise to find that the movements it has inspired down through history have typically ended up perpetrating the worst crimes against the person. All forms of totalitarianism begin with egalitarian sentiment --- and that is a fact about egalitarianism, not totalitarianism. The paradigm example is perhaps the French Revolution. After the optimism of new beginnings, the ideals of libert&eacute; and fraternit&eacute; became drowned in the blood of the revolutionists' victims in their ruthless pursuit of &eacute;galit&eacute; at the expense of all else. Egalitarianism has now come to be seen as a political end in itself in mainstream democratic thought, and although the desire for equality may appear never so benign, what is conceived in darkness will bring forth darkness."},{"Title":"Bible and Government: Public Policy from a Christian Perspective","review":"Bible And Government: Public Policy From A Christian Perspective by John M. Cobin (a devout Evangelical Christian, father of six homeschooled children, and Visiting Professor of Economics and Public Policy, George Mason University) is a sharply written, critical account of the expansion of American governmental power and the threatening implication said power has for Christians and the Christian community in particular. Professor Cobin offers noteworthy and insightful evaluations on public policies ranging from speed limits to food stamps, all with an eye to what Christianity demands in terms of obeying the government. Bible And Government is a thoughtful and thought-provoking read with ideas imminently worthy of serious consideration by students of Public Policy, Political Economy, and Christian Social Issues Studies."},{"Title":"Bible and Government: Public Policy from a Christian Perspective","review":"As a student of classicl liberal Economics and traditional Christianity I was extremely pleased to find a book that crosses the gap between Biblical thought and Government policy. The first half of the book was provocative and would be hugely beneficial for Christians and non-Christians alike to read. However, suddenly, on Pg 102, Dr. Cobin makes a ridiculous and shocking claim (with no evidence to back it up) that Greek Orthodox Christians belong to the Satan's Kingdom. Although it may be true that certain doctrines in any church have strayed from Biblical Christianity, it is going way to far to declare the entire Greek Orthodox Faith to be under the domain of Satan. With statements such as this, which try to rip apart denominations from Christainity, I question whether Dr. Cobin is in fact himself under the domain of Satan."},{"Title":"Bible and Government: Public Policy from a Christian Perspective","review":"This is an excellent book.

Both marriages are abyssmal failures until Mark and Laura are mercifully widowed. In steps Mark's aunt and Laura's godmother Lady Maria who first manages to make Laura the surrogate mother for Mark's orphaned son, then later suggests that for the boy's sake it would be best if Mark simply married Laura. Needless to say--given their pasts--neither Mark or Laura are eager for marriage, but once they agree they find themselves surprisingly well suited.Despite their happiness, rumors abound that Mark was responsible for his first wife's death and so when soon after their marriage Laura begins having suspicious accidents, society begins to gossip that he is trying to rid himself of his second wife as well.It's a fairly normal Regency/Gothic plot to have a heroine marry a hero with a bad reputation and then find herself wandering through the second half of the novel attempting to decide if her husband is trying to kill her. Thankfully, Wolf avoided that plot and instead took the delightful turn of the heroine wising up to the fact that someone is setting her husband up to look like a killer thereby allowing Laura and Mark to stand together. The couple then sets out to solve the mystery of who is the true villian and why he wants her dead and Mark blamed for it.Some nice non-standard twists in the plot and a likable and intelligent hero and heroine make this an enjoyable romance. A good read."},{"Title":"A Double Deception","review":"I love the early Regencies that Wolf wrote before moving to her longer, more \\"successful\\" novels set in the same era...this novel involves some of the same characters like David and Catherine from A London Season which adds to the enjoyment.I found her usual irony in the set up of what each expected from the marriage and a well-plotted (although I thought predictable) mystery...just a good read..."},{"Title":"A Double Deception","review":"Lawks a mercy! My heart went out to the noble (and sexy) Mark, slandered, maligned, and set up to look like a wife-murderer, twice over (hence the title). But THIS time the calvary cometh, for Mark's new wife, Laura, is not gonna stand for it! This loyal lady overcomes her fears and trusts her heart, standing by Mark despite what everyone says, and despite the evidence. The final chapter, at the king's coronation, brought an end to this sometimes gothic tale with laughter and high spirits: \\"We're hungry!\\"A superior bit of character development. And the author portrayed the child, Mark's five-year-old son Robin, realistically.As for the intrigue, not so complex: Early in the story I predicted who the villain was. Just followed the bread crumbs.... .. . . .One more HUGE plus: I got to spend time with several characters fromA London season (Regency romances). Wolf seamlessly integrates Jane, David, and even Anne into solving the mystery. One of the best cross-text character integrations I have seen. Jane was totally true to character.A few incidents of religious cussing, but they did not feel gratuitous, and some tame love scenes."},{"Title":"A Double Deception","review":"Just love these early novels of hers...have a paperback copy stored someplace--was happy to see they had E-books tooread it in 2-3 hours...most main female characters are similar in traits but plots are always a little unique from other authors'...there is something about reading a Wolf that reminds me of Laura Kinsale...well-drawn, not predictable all the time, good secondary characters...and the ability to put a reader in the moment...wish all of her Regencies/early historicals were available..."},{"Title":"A Double Deception","review":"Can't say uch (pro or con) as my wife bought it ,using my credit card, and she has not read it yet."},{"Title":"A Double Deception","review":"The book arrived in nasty dirty condition, a first w/amazon, and I order a lot of books.I wouldn't have read it even if had been in better shape."},{"Title":"Diccionario Avanzado Italiano - Espanol / Espanol - Italiano : Dizionario Italiano - Spagnolo / Spagnolo - Italiano (Italian and Spanish Edition)","review":"DEFINITELY WORTH BUYING..

The action scenes were as real as real life and there were unexpected turns in the plot around every corner. You get attached to the characters in the book and you feel like you have known them for years. The details that they go into are amazing you feel like you could solve the case with all the information they give you. This book is definitely a must read for people that like investigation/action books."},{"Title":"Duty Bound","review":"The mismatched FBI agents Sutton and Tanner (from Solemn Duty, a good read) are back in another enjoyable adventure. Stolen money, drug lords, the FBI and independent contractors all head for a big crash. All of Scott's books are good reads!"},{"Title":"Duty Bound","review":"This book, I think, was a good book. But it was not what I have come to expect for Col. Scott. I have the greatest respect for his earlier stuff, but this was just not right. He went from real-life, the hero may not come home to the hero being saved and coming though as the ultimate good-guy. It was too much like a movie and not like reality. Please Col. Scott, go back to your earlier style!!!"},{"Title":"Duty Bound","review":"&quot;Duty Bound&quot; was the first Scott book I've ever read, and it was so good it inspired me to go out and read the rest of his books. The tense action sequences, witty banter between the characters, and intriguing plot made this a really good read. A tip: fans of the tv show &quot;The X-Files&quot; will probably enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Land God Gave to Cain","review":"Hammond Innes' golden era is generally considered to be his books from the late 1940's to the early 1970's. 'The Land God Gave To Cain' was written right in the middle of this outstanding run, and showcases clearly why he was such a good writer. Although firmly in the adventure/thriller mould, Innes' works were always more like \\"proper\\" novels, especially in their well-drawn characterisation, and their realistic and detailed descriptions of unusual environments. This book is a fantastic example of \\"classic Innes\\", working well on three levels; an intriguing adventure mystery, a powerful character drama, and an extraordinary piece of descriptive writing about the harsh environment of the Labrador.The book opens with the death of Ian Ferguson's father, a man who was physically and mentally disabled during the war, and lived for nothing but his amateur \\"ham\\" radio. On receiving an SOS from a Canadian expedition, Ferguson Senior desperately struggled to his feet and cried out for the first time in years, and the effort killed him. But there are several bizarre implications of this message; firstly, that nobody else in the world received it, and secondly, that the lone survivor of the expedition has already reported the remaining men dead. How can a dead man send a radio message, and how could a radio signal travel to England but remain unheard only a hundred miles away? And why would a survivor abandon his mates and report them dead if they were obviously alive? Ian's determination to prove his father right sees him travel to the Labrador Railway, where he battles unsympathetic authorities and the harsh environment to follow in the footsteps of the expedition and uncover the truth.Innes does a great job in bringing to life the bleak, frozen wasteland of the Labrador, as well as those who inhabit it. We follow Ian \\"up the line\\" from the relatively civilised Seven Islands to the frontier virgin wilderness near the Lake Of Lion, with each location being more remote and hostile than its predecessor. But it is not only the intense cold and remoteness that Innes focusses on, he gives the Labrador depth by exploring its spiritual significance and almost mystical beauty.But what really makes this story are the characters. Ian Ferguson is once again the \\"everyman\\" protagonist who gets drawn into an extraordinary situation through a combination of luck and stubbornness. Darcy, who has spent years in the Labrador and is the only person on the line who believes Ian, combines tough resourcefulness with a reverent respect for the country and its people. But the two standout characters are Bert Laroche and especially Paule Briffe. Laroche is the lone survivor whom Ian believes left the other members to die, or possibly even murdered. And Paule is perhaps the most tragic character of all; daughter of the expedition leader and fianc&eacute;e of Laroche, she is torn between hoping her father is alive and hoping her fianc&eacute;e's is not a killer.The dramatic tension in the book builds as Innes assembles all these characters, then traps them together in an environment from which there is no escape. Laroche is clearly hiding something, and his attempts to prevent Ian from finding the Lake of Lion become increasingly desperate, while Paule's doubts begin to grow. The combination of mystery and drama result in an incredibly powerful and poignant climax, in particular the confrontation between Paule and Laroche, and the final discovery of what really happened to the members of the expedition.In all, this is just a great book, that works well as an adventure novel and as a piece of descriptive writing. If you're new to Hammond Innes and want to get a handle on his quite unique style, this is as good as place as any to start. And for long-time fans, this is definitely one of his best and most well-written books.Five stars."},{"Title":"The Land God Gave to Cain","review":"This book is so good, I can't put it down. The journey the main character goes on , throughout the book keeps me glued to the book for hours. I have read this book over and over again, and still am supprised at things that happen , as if I were reading the book for the first time. I can actually feel the cold of Labrador and the emotions of the people involved in the novel."},{"Title":"The Land God Gave to Cain","review":"I forced myself to read to the end of this indifferent slow-paced book because I'm particularly interested in Labrador, one of the most remote parts of Canada. The plot is pretty hackneyed -- Ian Ferguson, a young English engineer, learns his paralysed father (and amateur radio ham) has died. It turns out the father had been following the travails of an expedition looking for gold in distant Labrador, thousands of miles across the Atlantic, and had picked up radio signals indicating the explorers' plane had crashed. As we learn later on, Ferguson's father (Ian's grandfather) had been murdered when looking for the very same gold seam decades earlier. The grandfather was shot dead by a French-Canadian called Laroche, who happens to be the grandfather of one of the Canadians and the only survivor of the plane crash. he reluctantly agrees to accompany the younger Ferguson into the centre of Labrador to find out what happened to the expedition. For me this was a plot contrivance far too far and I fought my way through to the end of the book, not really caring about the characters. At the start of the book Innes explains that he spend a lot of time in Labrador making sure he got the details right. Unfortunately, no one told him that the plot is just as important."},{"Title":"The Lost Continent (Ace Science Fiction Classic F-235)","review":"Very collectible Ace first edition paperback with Frank Frazetta artwork on cover and title page. In this Burroughs tale, we have a stand alone story that is not part of any series. America in the 22nd century is an armed fortress that has cut itself off in protectionism from the rest of the world for 200 years due to the wars in Europe. So much time has passed that the people think that Britain and Europe are nothing but legends. And so Jefferson Turck decides to explore the myths by taking a trans-oceanic journey in his \\"aero-sub\\" in order to rediscover England if it is really there. He finds the ruins of the United Kingdom where one of the greatest civilizations in history has been set back much more than the 200 years that have passed, due to the final destruction of complete and total war, and danger is at every turn. Nice post apocalypse story."},{"Title":"The Library Of Flute Classics (Library of Series)","review":"I am a music educator. The flute solos are wonderful. I love the fact that the book can be used for both solo and duet playing since it comes with a second separate solo book for flute. I am primarily a pianist and enjoy all of the accompaniment parts to the solo flute. This collection is outstanding. There are 55 duet pieces by 29 different composers. Included in this collection are some of most well-known compositions from Bach, Mozart, Bizet, Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert, Tchaikovsky, etc. I recommend this book highly to all of my advanced students - those playing at least 3-4 years. These selections range from intermediate to a bit more challenging. There are a few unfamiliar melodies which are absolutely delightful. I would also like to add that this book is bound together with a durable spiral binding which makes it stay firm on the piano or music stand. The print is also quite legible and easy on the eyes. This book is a very good value."},{"Title":"The Library Of Flute Classics (Library of Series)","review":"Great selection of intermediate songs for the flute with beautiful piano part as well.

I liked the twist (Ella's obedience spell) to the classic story of Cinderella, except the end was very, very similar to the original story. I still like the book, though. Also, Ella's emotions and surroundings are depicted vividly. I've read some other reviews about this book, and amid the compliments there are a few that say how they disliked the &quot;unoriginal ending&quot;, they thought it was for little kids, or they complained that it was a &quot;girls' book&quot; (how sexist!).

You see, when she was born a farie named Lucinda bestowed a &quot;gift&quot; upon her, except the gift is more of a curse. She gave Ella the gift of obedience. She is forced to follow every order placed upon her. When Char proposes to her, she must refuse, or put him and the kingdom in danger. But ,her wicked stepsisiters (what you thought they wouldn't be in here?) are ordering her to say yes. Does she fight this and save the one she loves? You bet!

The book is wonderful, with a charming and romantic, but also exciting and adventurous plot. This book is the best for young and teen girl readers, who can understand Ella, more than an adult, but I would most definatley recommend this book for adults as well.

These are just some of the surprises one will encounter while reading Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine. It is the tale of a young girl named Ella who is under the spell of obedience and must obey every order given to her. As you read, you will follow her adventures through the forest of the ogres and the land of the giants. Ella Enchanted is just as exciting as it is well written. Levine does a great job capturing the imagination of audiences of every age. Though it is grouped as young adult literature, it never fails to strike the awe in the older audiences as well. This is a book that will make you look forward to every page and make you never want to put it down. With every chapter comes new adventures of Ella and her wonderful unicorn, apple. This book is a must read for people of all ages and definitely deserves 5 out of 5 stars for creativity and imagination."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"The book Ella Enchanted is a great adaptation of a classic fariy tale. The story is about a girl named Ella who at birth was given the gift of obedience by a fariy, which turns out not to be such a great gift. After her mother dies, her father remarries and Ella gains two stepsisters. They discover that Ella has to obey them and they boss her around. Meanwhile Ella is falling in love for Prince Char. This book is well written and the characters are well developed. Gail Carloson Levine takes the idea of recreateing a story heard many times, which is potentially boring, and gives it her own twists, which makes it new again. Will Ella end up with the prince and live happily ever after? Read Ella Enchanted and find out."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"An AWesome book!It's a story about a girl who had a blessing/curse by a fairy to always be obediant, and has a hard life with twists and turns that you normally wouldn't expect in a book. At first I didn't know that it was a Cinderella book. Pick this book up at your local library, I promise you'll enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I read this book a couple of years ago, because I love Cinderella and any story having to do with her, and absolutely fell in love with this book! I borrowed it from a friend of mine, and was sorry when I had to return it. The plot is very clever, and has a very happy ending. I am so excited that it's going to be made into a movie now! I really recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is a great book that every girl should read. It is a wonderful refreshing twist on the Cinderella Story. Sure Ella had a curse put on her at birth, she has a fairy godmother, an evil step mother and sisters, and she falls in love with a prince, but she can think and take care of herself. The book follows Ella on her journey to find Lucinda, the fairy who cursed, or blessed in her opinion, Ella with obedience. She runs into ogres, gnomes, and even giants along the way, but her determination keeps her going. If you read it once you will read it again, it's that good."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"The book \\"Ella Enchanted\\" was very interesting. It was about a young girl who was given the gift of obediance by a fairy named Lucinda. Throughout the book there was humor, respect and adventure. The characters are well described by the author. I am able to picture the images of the characters. The characters are well described by the author. The descriptive words in this story were amazing.There were a lot of unexpected twists to this story. If you have not read this story you do not know what you are missing."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I wouldn't have thought to buy this book if I hadn't heard an interview with the author on the radio. She read from \\"Ella Enchanted\\" and I was hooked. I should say I am *not* the target audience-I'm an over-30 woman who illustrates for children myself, and I still reread my favorite stories from my childhood, rarely picking up new YA novels-because usually from a skimming in the bookstore I don't find ones well-written enough to bother buying. This one is happily different. It's not perfect, but it IS well above average in its writing quality, the author has a way with characters that takes it out of the two-dimensional realm of all too many fantasies, and she's got a great, often very original imagination. Somehow she manages to paint both a fantasy world and the inner life of a very frustrated, willful teen girl equally well. I'm sure this is and will continue to be many girls' \\"favourite book\\".That said, I'll add one caveat: I have to agree with another reviewer who mentioned their disappointment with the portrayal of the \\"ugly stepsisters\\": basically, to fully get across their inherent meanness and \\"ugliness\\", they're depicted as not only stupid(really, in the case of the younger one, borderline \\"developmentally disabled\\"), but-horror of horrors!-FAT. That is to say, \\"piggish\\" in every sense of the word. There are scenes of Ella, the heroine, nauseated at the sight of these two wolfing down food, dribbling it on their double chins and staining their clothes by their pure gluttony. All well and good, maybe-but this is supposed to be very much a \\"modern\\" fairy tale, in the sense of turning the cliches on their heads, and it's a real shame that Ms. Levine's imagination failed her here. She might have chosen to play AGAINST the \\"Grimm's fairy tale\\" type, and have the stepsisters be ugly only on the INSIDE-certainly it's unfortunate in a book for young girls to equate obesity with stupidity and greed and everything ugly. Same goes for the portrait of the stepmother. Actually, in my experience, this sort of status-conscious, elitist person is always rail-thin(to the point of anorexia), hardly \\"plump\\"-but that's much more grotesque to Levine, apparently.Otherwise, a swell book."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I read this book twice when i was in fourth grade and kept it as my favorite book for years.

It was the first fantasy I had ever read, and it made me LOVE this genre. I've re-read it at LEAST 3 times. You should read it."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I bought this book out of a suggestion from my friend. It's an excellent book, and took me only a week to finish (in fact, I just finished it within the last 10 minutes!). The story is very imaginative, with many fairytale creatures. The one bit of criticism I have is that towards the end (the last 5 chapters or so) it takes a turn towards the obvious. It is a retelling of Cinderella, but at the end when she gets a pumpkin coach, mice for footmen, and so on, you can tell exactly where the story is going. Looking back, it is interesting how much it is like the story of Cinderella, but you didn't know at the beginning. However, it is a praiseworthy book, and I would definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is probably one of the best books I have ever read! I don't even have to hesitate to give it 5 stars. Ella Enchanted deals with a young girl who was cursed at birth with complete obedience to anyone who gives her an order. Lucinda, the fairy was the one who cursed her. As she grows up she learns that her family's cook, Mandy, is her fairy godmother! Something that was very surprising to me when I was reading it. When her mother, Lady Eleanor dies from cold when Ella was 15 she meets the charming Prince Charmont (Char) and falls in love with him. Only her father could get in the way by sending Ella to Finishing School with her soon to be step sisters Olive and Hattie. Hattie learns of Ella's obedience and takes advantage of her. Making her do all of her dirty work. While at the finishing school Ella looses her clumsy ways and learns how to be a real lady. Finally Ella can't stand being under Hattie's rules when she decides to run away to find Lucinda, and try to get her to take back the curse. All of this was an exciting adventure for me. Ella's love for Char is one of the best love stories I have ever read. It really draws you into the book and you find it hard to put down!All of the fantasy elements really added a little something to the book. Magic, hypnotizing ogres to save you life, faries and curses! I won't give away the books GREAT ending though.

The heroine's full of spunk, manages to hold her own against her nasty aunt and silly stepsisters, and even battles it out with evil giants! Feisty Ella's definitely NOT your average damsel in distress. If you've read the Princess Diaries or The Witch Of Blackbird Pond, where the heroines stay true to themselves and win the day (and the boy) you'll definitely enjoy this.

As soon as I started reading, I was drawn in again for a wonderful ride. Even though I knew how it would end, my memories had faded so that the twists and turns surprised me once more.

When Ella was a baby, a spell was put on her so she would always have to be obedient, so anything anyone told her, she had to do. All the fairies liked to keep their identities a secret, every fairy, except one. That one fairy, Lucinda, puts spells on people that she thinks are wonderful, but truthfully they're not.One of my favorite scenes is when Ella runs away from finishing school and attends a giant's wedding. Of course, Lucinda was there and her gift to the two giants was that they would always have to be together. The giants wouldn't be able to be out of each other's sight. While all the giants are mourning over the gift, Ella returned to her home in Frell.Another one of my favorite scenes was when after Ella had written a fake letter to Prince Char telling him that she had married someone else, she attended the three balls being held for Char. Wearing a mask she caught Char's attention even though most of the girls had knights walking around looking for a new servant or maid. When Sir Stephen saw Ella he dragged her over to Char where he had her try on the slipper. When it fit, Char told her to marry him. Ella being obedient almost said,\\" yes\\", but then stopped and thought about it, If word of her obedience fell into the wrong hands, she could be forced to kill Char. Crying and tasting blood from biting her tongue, she tried to stop herself from saying,\\" yes\\", then Hattie told her not to marry Char. But Mum Olga told Ella to marry him, then Olive told her to marry Char and then give her lots of money. Ella has a fairy godmother, but who is it? Will Ella ever break the curse that has been cast upon her?

I know I was a big fan of the movie with Anne Hathaway... and that cute guy that played Prince Charmont. But do not let that deter you from reading this gem of a story. The movie only gives you a glimpse (and a small one at that) as to what is really between the covers of Ella Enchanted.Although geared for younger readers, I was taken by this un-traditional retelling of Cinderella, and can definitely say that it can be enjoyed by older readers as well. I loved the fantasy elements which were clever and sometimes even downright funny. Ella is a great heroine - she is witty, strong-willed, determined and resourceful.But what I truly enjoyed about this story is how women in general are portrayed. In your average fairytale you normally find your princess who is in some sort of peril and in need of a prince who rides in at the nick of time and saves the day. That is not the case here. All women are portrayed as strong, independent, opinionated - no matter if it was the sweet Ella, the deliciously evil stepsisters, Lucinda the fairy with her creative \\"gifts\\", or even Mandy, Ella's cook/fairy godmother.All in all, this was a very enjoyable story and one that can be enjoyed whether big or small, young or old. This is a fantastic retelling of a wonderful fairytale and one that I highly recommend"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"My daughter has to read Newberry books for school. I found a few here on Amazon and this is by far her favorite ever."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"The fact that 12 years after reading this book at the age of 9, I have recently named my new dog Ella should be an indication as to how much I adored this book as a child. When I was a fourth grader, I read this book three times I loved it so much, and it holds a special place in my heart the same way reading Jane Eyre did when I was 18. It was *the* childhood novel that inspired me to become an avid historical romance reader (Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters) today. I highly recommend this book to any little girl who is even remotely interested in fairies, princesses, classic fairy tales, or the Renaissance Festival :D Its story flowed naturally, and was entirely appropriate for my reading level at that time. I was completely absorbed in the characters and the world of \\"Frell\\" that Gail Carson Levine created, and my imagination was along for the ride and could vividly picture each description and fantasy she incorporated. Not to mention, it had an excellent moral lesson on a traditional simplistic fairy tale; the Cinderella of this story isn't waiting to be rescued, she refuses to marry the prince in order to save *his* life and has to find the power and strength within herself to overcome her greatest obstacle.As an aside in comment to the film, I know Gail Carson Levine liked it, but when I saw it I was horrified. It was nothing like how I imagined Ella Enchanted, far too modern and corny. When I saw Ever After as a child, a year after reading Ella Enchanted it was much more the beauty and loveliness that I imagined should be Ella Enchanted. So if you have a little girl reading Ella Enchanted, let her watch Ever After! I'm sure she would enjoy it.Also, if you can, I would get the original cover art of the novel. It is the version I still have, and I would stare at the little castle in the background for hours imagining that world. The illustration completely influenced how I imagined the novel, and the newer ones don't compare. (Original cover is a painting/drawing of girl in a green dress, castle shown through the window, with the Newberry Honor award)"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Overall: B for Adults/A+ for young adultsGeared towards young readers, this is a wonderful reinvention of Cinderella--complete with glass slippers, fairy godmothers and a prince. That being said, Ella is far from the meek Cinderella. At birth, she is afflicted with a curse that keeps her constantly obedient to anyone's demands. Despite this, she manages to fight ogres, befriend a prince and keep her evil stepsisters at bay. I loved that Ella is an updated role model for young girls; she presents an independent personality and the ending emphasizes how believing in and being yourself is incredibly valuable.This was a quick read (GoodReads says 240 pages in paperback) and it felt like the proper length. Since the intended audience is fairly young (I'd say 9-12 though GoodReads puts it at 9-14), the text is uncomplicated but not too simplistic.Audiobook Details:The reader, Eden Riegel, sounds quite young but does an above average job with the reading. She does voice intonation, though the different voices are not as clearly identifiable as other readers and some even sound quite similar to each other. The reading contains some background music in parts and this is probably my least favorite feature since it reminded me of midi music from the mid-90's. The first few times the music played, I kept looking around the room to see if one of my kids' toys was going off.Run time--5 hours, 34 minutes"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"She really did. This is one of my absolute favorite books. I first read it as a kid when it came out, and fell in love, completely and totally. Re-reading it today brought back so many memories.

However, there is one nagging plot gap that's bothering me today: why doesn't Ella have someone order her not to follow anymore orders? I know the story wouldn't exist if if were that easy, but I just felt that should have been addressed somewhere.

Ella's father ends up marring the two girl's mother, making them Ella's stepsister. Mum-Olga,Ella's stepmother, makes her work. Ella sneaks to the three balls held by the royal family.

Enjoyed all the modern medieval-modern inclusions... the wooden bicycle, the wooden escalators at the shopping mall. Loved Eric Idle's narrator rhymes.

So after loving the movie, we sought out the book at the library. YAWN!!!! SNORE!!! Do yourself a favor and skip the book and rent the movie instead!! You'll enjoy every minute of it.

My favorite book of all time. I've read this book countless of times and it never gets old. Recommended!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"It was such a great fairy tale ,so good that it barely left my hand. Gail Carson Levine has astonished me yet again."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"First, the good things about this book:I picked up the book after seeing the movie only to find that they were somewhat different, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. To start off, I loved the idea of having Ella being cursed to obey every command. It was the question I asked the first time I read the fairytale, \\"Why did she always do what her stepmother said?\\" And that question was thoroughly answered in this novel. I liked the character of Ella and her rebellious spirit. Levine definitely presented to us a new and different take on Cinderella, one much more spirited than the ridiculously innocent and proper Cinderella we are accustomed to. I especially liked her bravery, a surprising characteristic in the female protagonist of a romance novel, and how she was able to save herself from danger instead having prince Charmont save her. Speaking of the prince, I'm surprised to say I liked him in spite of hating practically all other \\"re-invented\\" versions of Prince Charming in every other princess story. Charmont was charming without being brash or flirtatious; he was honest, steady, and true to his word, without being a cliched knight in shining armor. I enjoyed watching the blooming friendship and eventually romance between Char and Ella; the character development was more than I expected and added depth to the story. I also rather enjoyed the \\"villians\\" of the story in the forms of Olga, Ella's father Sir Peter, Hattie, and Olive. Though they are easy to hate in the traditional fairy tale, they are even more despicable in the book. SPOILER ALERT AHEAD. One of the things I liked most about this book was that Lucinda, Ella's fairy godmother, got a taste of her own medicine, which I feel the book needed (though this was not included in the movie).However, one thing I felt the book needed towards the end of the story was an assassination plot to kill Prince Char. After Char proposes, Ella feels she can't marry him because someone would use her to kill him or some how ruin the kingdom. At the time there doesn't seem to be any such danger present, considering her step-family adores him and the entire kingdom loves him. I felt a plot to kill the prince, such as in the movie, would be the perfect danger to round out the last third of the novel and add some excitement and a legitimate reason for Ella to lie to Char about her feelings. The only other thing that really bothered me was the mention of Angulen's pottery. It is stated that his works are very valuable and of much importance, and the novel puts much influence on them, yet they have absolutely nothing to do with the plot in any way.Overall, it is a good book for those within it's target demographic. With a fiery Cinderella and prince who actually is charming, I feel this is a good retelling of the classic Cinderella story."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book was an assignment in 6th grade and my twinboys both loved the book; had a hard time putting it down.The class would play sections of the movie after the readings.The move, of course, if somewhat different but gave my boysan idea of how movies are made from books. I was impressed.I thought for sure this would be too 'girly' for them. They are 11and loved it."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This is a very creative book with a heroine who isn't just doing a Disney princess faint over a man. Unlike many of the YA/children's books being published more recently, it is actually well-written and not painful to read aloud to a kid. In college all my friends and I reminisced over reading this book in late elementary through middle/high school."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I believe I was in the third grade the first time that I read Ella Enchanted. I bought it at a book fair. I'm not typically one to read a book more than once, but I read Ella Enchanted so many times that the paperback binding is barely holding the pages together anymore. I lent it to about every girl friend I knew. It was the book that I read when I was happy, it was the book I read when I was fighting back teara, it was the book I read when I needed comfort, it was the book I read when I still fantasized about becoming a fairy...and really this list is never ending so I'll stop there. It's a perfect gift for an elementary schooler that loves to read, and they'll definitely getting tons of mileage out of it.The movie does not even remotely do the text justice."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Still as good as I remember. Glad I decided to get it. Will also be purchasing it for my Kindle when it comes out in December. That way I always have it handy."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"\\"Ella Enchanted,\\" is an interesting tale of a girl named Ella. Ella of Frell was cursed with the gift of obedience at her birth. She is complied to obey all given order's to her without having any ability to deny theses demands. Ella embarks on a quest to attempt to break this curse put upon her and live happily ever after. The tale gives our audience a sense of courage and determination. The story being based off of Cinderella, makes for an interesting twist to this story. If you love fairy tale plot lines, I would highly recommend this book for you. For me, it brought back all the wonderful memories I've had reading fairy tale books as a child. The author does a fantastic job in making the reader feel as if they are apart of the story."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"A fun, whimsical take on the Cinderella story, Levine breathes fresh life into the familiar characters, giving them depth and a new world to live in. This breezy read takes us to the fanciful kingdom of Frell, where it is not unusual to fall prey to silver-tongued ogres or to attend a giant's wedding. Elves live among the trees, Gnomes can see into the future and Fairies in disguise show up for weddings and births.Ella our heroine is a character worth admiring. She is strong, competent and independent, all of the characteristics that attracts Prince Char to begin with (and even her self-centered absentee father can't, help but admire her for it to). Prince Char, future ruler of Frell, is tired of fawning courtiers and stuffy manners. He finds Ella very refreshing and sees the value in her authenticity and intelligence.There is no love at first sight in this book - thank goodness. Instead, Ella and Char have a very balanced relationship and I appreciate how in creating a strong character in Ella Levine doesn't fall into the trap -that a lot of writers or TV shows do- of making Char weak or an object of ridicule who needs Ella to take care of him and save him from his own incompetence. Their relationship is what it should be, filled with mutual respect and admiration, the forgiveness of each other faults and the willingness to put another's need before your own.While I'm usually not into the idea of happily-ever-after (yeah, I will resist the urge to go on an unrealistic expectations rant) Levine is a very gifted story teller and I look forward to when I can share Ella's story with my girls."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"When I first picked up this book I had no idea how good it would be. As I read it I was moved into a world of spells, giants, princes and castles which I will never forget. And now it is one of my favorites, and I would suggest it to any one who's into fanasty, comedy and romance."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I loved this book! (Though I have to stay, Amazon says the reading level is ages 9-12, and I was almost 14 when I read it!) I thought it was beautifully written, and I couldn't put it down! I read it in a little more than a day. I loved the Cinderella ending, and I never expected it. Though I should have, considering her name is Ella (CinderELLA) and his name is Prince Char (Prince CHARming, though technically his name was Charmont). This is one of my favorite books that I have ever read!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book is excellent! It has just the right amount of fairies, royalty, spells, and all those other touches that make a fairy tale perfect. I've always loved &quot;Cinderella,&quot; and I was ecstatic when I discovered &quot;Ella Enchanted.&quot; This book is great for all ages and types. I know three people who like completely different types of books, and yet they all liked &quot;Ella Enchanted.&quot; I think that Gail Carson Levine has done a wonderful job of creating a novelized version of &quot;Cinderella.&quot; A must-read for everyone!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"To anyone out there reading this review, I just want you to know I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Since I am 16 years old, some might say that I am to old to be reading this book, and its meant only for children. I, however, disagree. Ella Enchanted is a wonderful, delightful book that should be enjoyed not just by children and young adults, but by people of all ages. Although I find most Newbery award winning books boring, this was not the case with this book. Ella, the main character, is a Cinderella for the 90's. She is a unique character, and a role model for all girls. This book is better than any CLASSIC I have ever read."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I would say Ella Enchanted was one of the best books I ever Read. I strongly recommend this book to anyone!!!!!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted, by Gail Carson Levine, is a fascinating fairytale about a fifteen-year-old girl. This Newbery Honor Book is a wonderful book for all ages, and is easy reading. It is one of those books that you never want to put down. Many features of this book resemble the story of Cinderella. Ella, the main character, has to overcome many challenges in her young life. One of those challenges being that she has to obey any order that is given to her. A powerful fairy gave this challenge to her. If she doesn't obey this curse, she will get a terrible headache, or start feeling very ill. So, obliviously, she has to be very careful not to tell anyone about this weakness because they could easily take advantage of her. This book revolves around how she lives her life, and the effects of the curse. I think others would enjoy this book because it is fun, and enjoyable to read. Isn't that what reading is all about?"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I read a lot of books about different sujets this summer from 'Go Ask Alice' to 'Dealing With Dragons' and this has to be my favorite one! It's the best fairy tale I've ever read because it tells a well known story that I've heard a million times and makes it politically correct by showing Ella's courage through the dangerous perils she faced. It also explains the reason the prince fell in love with her. Does anyone one think that a well-educated prince will fall in love witha girl beacause she's pretty and she can dance well? He fell in love with Ella because of her knowledge and skills. She could speak most of the many languages in the kingdom and she learned to charm giants. Dispite her mask the prince could still fall in love with her. Ella is one of the bravest heroines I've read about. She overcame the impossible through her love of the prince. This book deserves 5 stars!!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This rich and delightful retelling of Cinderella provides a saucy heroine, a rational explanation of her slavish ways with her wicked step-family and a fresh love story to boot. Lucinda, a foolish fairy, bestows the gift of obedience on Ella at birth, which turns out to be a terrible burden. All is more or less well until her mother unexpectedly dies, and Ella is shipped off to finishing school with her cruel and demanding step-sisters-to-be. Ella runs off to find Lucinda in hopes of lifting the curse and has many adventures, but the curse stays in place. Full of fairy tale elements, Ella, who is a linguistic genius, manages to do her best despite the peril she finds herself in as a result of uncompromising obedience. The romance between Ella and Char, the prince, is clever and endearing. As the traditional elements of the tale unfold, those readers who enjoyed original versions will adore this new and improved offering."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella, a girl about 12 or 13, gets stuck with a blessing that turns out more like a curse! She has to obey anything anyone says. For instance if someone said \\" Ella, give me your whole wardrobe for free\\" she would have no choice but to, because her curse makes her. In this rich story, Ella has to deal with cruel people who make her give up things she loves, do bad things, even one who told her to kill someone! This book is so much better than the movie!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is awesome. I love it. The second you pick it up you'll have a seriously hard time putting it down. It's about Ella, a girl growing up in the fictional land of Kyrria. She's like mostly every other maiden, except for one thing: She's under a fairy curse to make her 100% obediant until the day she dies. Someone could tell her to cut off her own head and she'd have to do it. After her mother suddenly dies when she is 15, all the sudden Ella finds herself at her mother's funeral, where she meets the young prince Charmont of Kyrria. At the funeral reception at Ella's manor in Frell, she meets Hattie, the biggest brat in Frell, Olive, who's head is filled with more empty space than Frell, and Dame Olga, Ella's step mother to be. Before she knew it, she found herself off to finishing school where she meets Areida, an Ayorthaian girl who's parents own an inn. Before she leaves, her cook and fairy godmother Mandy gives her a magic book to help her thru her troubles. At finishing school, Ella is pretty much faced with a whole army of Hattie clones. After Hattie discovers Ella's curse of pure obedience, Ella has to wait on her hand and foot. But when she runs away from finishing school in hopes of finding Lucinda[The Fairy who cursed Ella when she was a baby] at a wedding and asking her to lift the curse at Uaaxee's[a giant] farm. After a few intresting incidents with some elves, a tribe of perticularily greedy ogres, and strange enough Prince Charmont she finally gets there, and amazing enough on time. But When Ella finds Lucinda, Lucinda tells her to be happy to be so obediant. So she is happy to be obediant, obeying orders left and right. When she finds her father, who is also at the wedding, he tells her that he is in great dept and must sell everything and marry Ella off to a rich man. After Ella goes back to her manor and Mandy tells her to stop being happy about being obediant, she slumps back into being frustrated, miserable, and sometimes furious about her curse. Since her father hasn't been able to marry Ella off, Ella's father Sir Peter must marry Dame Olga, Hattie and Olive's mother. Now Hattie and Olive are actually Ella's evil step sisters. Since Ella's return from finishing school, Prince Charmont has come visiting regularly. As Hattie's greatest ambition is to be queen, she forbids Ella from coming out of her room while Hattie puts her to sleep with her dull conversation, and she never gets to see him before he leaves for Ayortha. Now, Ella's father has left, Char has left, and Ella is being forced by her evil step mother to be a scullery maid in the kitchens, and to top it all of, Lucinda has resolved that she cannot remove Ella's curse. It seems the only comfort she has is writing to Char, but then by Hattie's orders, she has to tell Char she is married and she cannot write to him anymore. But finally when Prince Charmont comes back from Ayortha, it is announced that the Prince will be holding three balls, and he will be picking his wife. This books winds an epic retelling of the classic fairytale Cinderella. Gail Carson Levine shows us that with a pair of glass slippers, a few elves, a fairy godmother, a few friends, a pumpkin and a serious amount of luck we can all find our happily ever after."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I read a lot of books about different subjets this summer from 'Go Ask Alice' to 'Dealing With Dragons' and this has to be my favorite one!

I loved this book and would reccomend it to any fairy/fantasy lover!&quot;"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted was the best book I ever read! It is a fasinating story of a girl in relation to Cinderella. She is very selfwitted to leave her Finishing School after her father, Sir Peter sent her there. She is a charming fantasy character along with her other friends like the Dragons and enemys like the ogres. She keeps herself from marring the prince at first intill breaking the spell. A charming story for young,adventure lovers."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This really is an enchanting, delightful novelization of the Cinderella tale, complete with a spunky, intelligent heroine. I found the writing a little simplistic at my age (I'm in my 30s) but I highly recommend it for teenagers. Really, though, anyone who enjoys fairy tale novels will think this worth a read. It compares fairly well to Robin McKinley's Beauty, The Blue Sword and The Hero and the Crown, although the writing in those books is a couple of levels more complex. Give those a read too if you haven't yet!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"We all loved this book. Ella Enchanted, despite her curse of obedience, is brave, generous, independent and funny. We loved it when Ella gave Hattie the flowers to smell, making her tell the truth, and we were touched when Ella found out who her fairy godmother was. We cried when Ella and Prince Char were dancing and he whispered a poem in her ear. Ella showed her cunning when she tricked the ogres and got Prince Char's men to tie them up. Ella has to make some tough decisions. Read this book - laugh and cry - and find out how Ella breaks the curse. You will read it under the covers with a flashlight."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Amongst all the Cinderella tales out there this one shines like a star. Finally a Cinderella who is clever, brave, and witty, and still has an excuse as to why she lets the Evil Stepmother and Co. boss her around. Why? Well one ditzy fairy named Lucinda who is convinced that being blessed (ahem cursed.) with obedience is a wonderful thing. This tale has everything from the original tale of Cinderella (glass slipers, diapearing Coach, Evil Stepmother and company) and still has room for a host of new characters like elves, gnomes, ogres and giants. Best of all is Prince Charmont, who is a dashing, hansome, young prince who achieves somthing that no other Cinderella prince up to this point has achieved: realism and wit. I enjoyed this book and would recomend this to anyone."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted was such a teriific book. My friend made me read it and I'm glad she did. I'd recomend this book to anyone! Read it! My favorite part was when Ella escaped finishing school, and was captured by the ogres. The book is really exciting because you never know what is going to happen next. This book is a lot better than the origonal story, Cinderella. I also liked the fact that it was based in the middle ages, one of my favorite time periods. The mix of fictional characters, such as elves, centaurs, giants, and ogres was great. Good job Gail!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"What an &quot;enchanting&quot; book! The story was fresh and new, and I could easily relate to the characters. Ella even reminded me of myself.

This really is the best I recomend you buy it even if you never read anything else in your life. It is funny and sad and heartwarming in a realisticaly fantastical way. Even adults will love it, I guarentee. Just get it from the library if you don't have fifteen bucks, but if you love it as much as I do you'll have to buy it. I never even realized till the end it was about Cinderella, but that just made it all the better. This is my absolute most favorite book and from me that's saying a lot."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I love it! I love it! I love it! I love it! My god, I love it! Ella Enchanted is my most favorite book ever. Because of this I'm looking forward to the movie Ever After, though I hoped that they'd base the movie after Ella Enchanted. Their loss. I cry every time I read this book, I don't know why. It has such a wonderful ending! I love it! Goodness, I'm talking nonsense. But I still love this book. You can't every put it down. Ella is such a wonderful person, kind, nice, spunky, and very real. Most authors make their characters perfect, but Ella has real thoughts. Char sounds like the type of rare guy who acts like a human-being and is the girl's ideal prince."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is the best book I have ever read in my whole life!!! It's about a girl, Ella, who was put under a curse at birth by that fool of a fairy Lucinda. Her curse is that she has to obey any command given to her, which means she is always in danger. Then her mother dies and she is left to be cared for by her greedy father. Who promptly sends her to finishing school where she makes a friend. Then she escapes, tames orges, goes to giants weddings, all the while charming Prince Charmont aka. Char. Later her father marries and she gets two evil but dull stepsisters which she is practically enslaved by. Throughout the whole book Ella prevails in whatever sort of scrape she gets herself into charming and enchanting the reader with her courage, humor, and all around fun loving personality.

I have read this book at least 8 times starting from the time I was in middle school and I'm 22 now. If you ever need to get away from life or just need a quick fairytale break then this is for you. I laughed out loud and cried tears of anger and tears of joy. Read it you won't regret it!Ps. If you have seen the movie don't judge this story by that, because it isn't anything like the book.

Ella's mother dies so all she has left is her father, Mandy, and Prince Char. Her father is always trading away from home, Mandy is her servant and fairy godmother, and Prince Char is her best friend. In this story Ella struggles with the curse while going through bad and good adventures.I liked this book a lot because it tells of a young girl with all her challenges and how she solved them. I sometimes wonder what it would be like to be in her position. I think this book is suited for middle school students."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I love Gail Carson Levine's re-imagining of the tale of Cinderella.

Levine uses many inventive literary devices to advance the story and character development. Very imaginative."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted was probally the best book I read. The book had humor and some sad parts. I read it over and over again. I liked the book because it told about how obidiance would take over your life. Ella had that problem. She was giving a gift from a magical farie Lucinda. You would think that that would be a good thing but, it turned out to be a curse. The book explains how her daily life deals with the \\"Curse\\" and how she deals with the hardships that come with the \\"Curse.\\" She falls in love with the Prince of Frell and he likes her but both are to shy to tell, each other at first. But that all changes when Char (The Prince) goes away to Kyrria a distancecastle for a year. Ella's Stepmother figures her secret out which is the \\"Curse\\" by Hattie her daughter and makes her work as a maid. Char was sending her letters and he told how he loved her. [She figured out because when Ella's mother died her dad sent her of to finishing school and she went with Dame Olga's children Hattie and Olive. And Hattie figures out and she tells her mom.Ella ran away from finishing school. And her dad married Dame Olga.] She can't marry Char till she breaks the curse.

That breaks the curse and they marry and live happily ever after."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I think that this book was a page-turner. That's because Gail Levine wrote the story so that I didn't want to stop reading. I would like to read another book written by Gail Levine because it might have the same writing as Ella Enchanted or it might be different. This book I would recommend to other girls. I would do that because Ella Enchanted is written from a girl's perspective and I think girls would like the book better. One of the many exciting parts is when ogres attacked Ella and prince Char rescued her. If are a person who likes fantasy and stories about fairies you will like Ella Enchanted."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"If you like fantasy then this book is defiantly for you. This book is about a young girl named Ella. When she was young a horrible fairy named Lucinda put a spell on her the spell was when someone commanded her to do something she had to do it.

Ella begins her journey to get rid of this horrible course when she finally reaches the end of her journey she is commanded to kill the prince or chop off her own hand luckily she stops the curse just in time"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Do not be fooled by the movie. the movie should not even be named Ella Enchanted. This book has romance, but not anything too mushy. Ella and Char play with each other, not knowing their feeling. It's like a dance where they laugh and play games. You be pulled into the sorry emotionally and by the end you'll be telling the book what to do. Enchanting and wonderful. Read it and it will become part of your library."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ms. Levine did a great job on this book. The plot was well set out, and the characters well described.

I hope you like it too."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I was really impressed with this book.

In fact, when I bought it at the bookfair, I kept it for a year before finally deciding to read it. When I did, I was hooked. I loved imagining Ella's journey through a land of ogres and elves and unicorns. I instantly fell in love with the book and I could not put it down. The romance story really moved me.

This is a modern look on the fairy tale Cinderella. It really puts it in a new perspective. Like, it makes the old Cinderella look about as interesting as old clothes. And it answers all those unanswered questions. Like, why wasn't Cinderella recognized at the ball? Because it was a masked one!When Ella of Frell is cursed by the fairy Lucinda that she will always be obedient, Ella lives in a danger that she will be ordered to do something that will harm her. Ella is friends with only her lovable cook Mandy and her mother, lest someone should find out her secret. When her mother dies, Ella meets two utterly repulsive sisters, Hattie and Olive. Hattie figures out that Ella must obey everyone and makes Ella her personal slave when they go to finishing school together. However, Ella also makes a more pleasant friend, the Prince Charmont (by the way, Charmont is French for charming! ). Ella and Charmont meet again when Ella runs away from finishing school, when Ella saves herself from ogres. But when Ella meets her conniving father, she is devastated to learn that Hattie and Olive will become her stepsisters! Ella becomes the slave of the two girls and their fat mother. She correspondes to Char(mont) secretly. But when Char tells her that he loves her, Ella doesn't know what to do.

Then Ella and Prince Charmont fall in love, get married, and live happily ever after."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted was one of the books that I read at the University this semester in my Children's Literature class. I enjoyed the book when I started reading it because it makes you think about what life would be like if you were under and obedience spell, but what disappointed me was the ending. It seems like the beginning of the book was full of details and that Gail Carson Levine needed a quick ending to this 232 page book. I think it ended somewhat like Cinderella. As I look back on the book, I see some similarities; Olga, her step-mother, Olive and Hattie, her step-sisters (Hattie is the one who knows about the spell and uses it to her advantage), dancing at the ball with Char (the Prince), and ending up happily ever after with him."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Though I will admit it was a little slow starting out. Let me give you some backround. When Ella was born a spell was put on her, a spell that commanded her to do whatever she was told. After her mother dies Ella is determined to find the witch who casted the spell and ask her to put away the spell. will Ella even find the witch? Thar is for me to know and you to find out!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"well i have not read the book but i have watched the movie. i am very picky about movies but this one exedid my expectations. i have 8 words for you, GET THE MOV IE OR THE BOOK NOW."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Yes - for sure.

When Ella was born, a fairy named Lucinda gave Ella what she thought was a gift but it feels like a curse. You might think always being obedient would be O.K, right? Well, it's not. If someone told you to hurt or kill yourself, you would have to do it. When Ella was young, her mother gets sick and dies. Ella misses her mother very much. When Ella is older, her father remarries and Ella gets a horrible new step-family. Ella's new step-family finds out that Ella is always obedient and makes her be a maid while her father is away. Ella's father ships Ella and her new step-sisters, Hattie and Olive, to finishing school. Ella can't stand it because she wants to find Lucinda to try and get the curse taken away, so she decides to run away from the awful finishing school in Jenn. Ella travels to the Elf Forest and makes friends with the elves. When Ella leaves the elves, she is captured by ogres and taken to the Fenns. Then, Ella persuades the ogres to let prince Char and his knights tie them up. One of Char's knights escorts Ella to a giant's wedding at Uaaxee's farm, where she tries to find Lucinda. When Ella returns to Frell, she goes to prince Char's three royal balls at the castle. Throughout the story, Ella tries to break the spell, but if you want to find out if she succeeds, you'll have to read this book yourself!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella EnchantedElla Enchanted is a book I would classify as four stars. In the beginning it is kind of confusing because the author tells that Ella's mom dies but doesn't tell how. It was also confusing because the book says Ella has black hair and the front page has Ella with red hair. It is kind of boring but if you keep reading it will get interesting. It would be a sad book for sentimental people because the people are mean and they don't always speak with truth. I liked it because the character gets the gift of obedience which makes her life miserable and makes her do funny things. I think it is not original because it is similar to Cinderella because a fairy godmother made a carriage from pumpkins to Ella. She and Prince Char found some glass slippers that would only fit her. The book is romantic. People who don't like romantic things wouldn't like the book because it has two love cards and kisses and they would think it is gross. If you would like to experience the story in a different way you could see the movie which has more action. I liked this book a lot and would recommend it to you."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"i absolutely ADORE this book. i fell in love with it for the first time when i was 12. i am 18 now, but the storyline and the characters are endearing to me every time i read it i must have read Ella enchanted about five times. the romance between ella and char is innocent, but it captures my heart every time. I was very disappointed when i saw the movie. I dont think the movie captured the essence of Ella and the magic that Levine bestowed in her book. If I could, I'd create a movie that is true to the book and its characters. Even though it is a children's book, it is still accessible to adults (though i am still kind of a child at heart- i LOVE fantasy stories)1000000% RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Possibly one of the best Cinderella stories ever written. The movie makes this book look pathetic, but if you read it you'll have one the best literary experiences of your life. Ella's story, told in first person, is full of excitement and adventure, none of this \\"I'm too smart for the prince\\" idea that you see in the movie or the vicious uncle and snake...no possible idea where the movie writers would have come up with that. She is truly on of the greatest heroines that i have had the opportunity to read about. I first read this book when i was 10 and now i am in college and I still love it.

It was the gift of obedience. When Ella was born, she wouldn't stop crying, s after the gift had been given, Lucinda gave Ella her first command, \\"Stop crying now,\\" was the order, and Ella stopped immediately.The gift wasn't just for when Ella was a baby, it was forever. This wasn't the only \`gift' that Lucinda cast on special occasions. At weddings, she might give the gift of a couple never being able to separate.When a very unexpected and sad thing happened in Ella's life, she was sent off to boarding school with her father's friends (mean) daughters. The older daughter; Hattie, noticed Ella's obedient behavior right away, and took advantage of the fact that no one else knew that they could boss Ella around.While at school, Ella decides that she just can't handle the toll that the curse was taking on her. Ella heard about a giant's wedding that Lucinda was going to be attending, and decides she must go find Lucinda to put an end to the awful curse.Ella has no idea what she's in for when her father marries Dame Olga, bringing along her two daughters, Hattie and Olive, from boarding school. Hattie and Olive are delighted to order Ella about as often as they please.And when Ella's father goes away for work (after him and Dame Olga were married), Ella and her evil stepmother and stepsisters put her in the position of a scullery maid. Ella works in the kitchen with Mandy, the cook who Ella knows quite well.Join Ella as she travels with her curse to fight ogres, go to weddings, obey horrible commands, go to balls, love, and more.If you read Ella Enchanted, you may even recognize the story line, from another fairy tale. This recognizable story line includes a ball, a fairy godmother, a prince, and maybe even a pair of glass slippers.Gail Carson Levine (the author of Ella Enchanted) does an amazing job of making you feel like you're right there with Ella. Gail Carson Levine adds an amazing amount of detail to her story, and that detail paints a perfect picture in your mind, of what Frell may really have looked like.This is a very good choice of book to read for anyone who is looking for a change in what they're reading. We're used to novel type stories, and this book brings out the fantasy/fairytale type of book we've all been secretly longing for. The magical element of the book is the best. It's like going back in time to when you were little and your parents would read you a nice fantasy book/fairytale.Although the detail of the book brought a certain element, it also distracted from the book slightly. It is really hard to fallow a book with to much detail, and at some parts of Ella Enchanted, it was really confusing because of all the detail.This book being in the fantasy/fairytale type of mode it's in, makes it a little old. The story takes place a while ago, and uses some language you might expect to find in your history book. It is not so hard to understand though, we're just not used to it.I would deffinately suggest reading Ella Enchanted. Gail Carson Levine has a great imagination, and you almost feel like your fighting right there along side Ella, fighting ogres or giants, or whatever the thrill is that day.I will admit, that it might not be appropriate for anyone to much older than about 13, because it is directed more at kids, as I found out. But it is the perfect book to read by the fire, and you'll never want to put it down once you pick it up."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Ella Enchanted is an engaging version of Cinderella about a strong girl with a unique problem.

Reading it made me feel happy, sad, and a little mad. Sometimes I don't want things to happen in a book but it already happens. The main character is Ella. Her father is a king. As for her mother well, her mother died. The book was mostly about Ella told in her point of view. Ella's father has a cook named Mandy who helps Ella with everything. The tough part about being Ella is, she was cursed a spell on. You may think it's a spell that turns you into something else, but Ella's spell was much more complicated. She was cursed with the obidience spell. When Ella was a baby and her mother was alive, a fairy named Lucinda cursed a spell on her. Ella's mother and Mandy were taking care of her one day when Lucinda dropped by. Lucinda heard Ella's constant crying and she was angry. So, Lucinda cursed Ella with an obidience spell. Ever since then, Ella had to do whatever anyone said her to do. Her spell was so dangerous, that if you told her to stab herself she would have to do it. This book was excellent but you'll have to find out what happens in the end. Will Ella's curse go away or will she do something so bad that she will sentenced to something worse?

The problem is she must break the curse in order to be with him. Her situation becomes worse when her father marries a disgusting woman with two daughters who are vague and evil. She is still determined to break the curse and love Prince Char, but at this point it doesn't look to well for Ella.

Char kept asking her to marry him but she kept refusing because anytime someone gets married that same fairy is there to give the newly weds a gift which was always bad. but anyway when she finally found the fairy, the fairy refused to take it away because she thought that the gifts were wonderful until Ella told her to become obediant. when the fairy came back she realized that her gifts were horible but she still wouldnt take her gift back. all she said was that there is a way to break it yourself.so what was Ella to do? marry the prince? was she ever going to be released from this spell and live a normal life? read Ella Enchanted or go to the movies to see it and find out.my opinion of this book is that it was great. i cant wait to see the movei. it had fairy tales, it was fiction and it was adventurous. i would recommend this book to anyone.from JESSICA C."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"(...)

Lucinda is a crazy fairy who thinks that all of her curses are gifts. Lucinda decided to give Ella the \\"gift\\" of obedience. Ella had to grow up following orders, whether she wanted to or not. Ella's mom died one night when Ella was very young so she lived with her father. Ella's dad was a king so, therefore, Ella was a princess. Before Ella's mom died, Ella didn't see her father often because he was so busy. She was so upset when her mother had died but, she was not alone. She had a great friend living with her, the cook. The cook's name is Mandy. After Ella's mom died Mandy told Ella that she was her fairy godmother. Mandy was also Ella's mom's fairy godmother, too. Ella was born part fairy due to her very small feet which made her very clumsy. Fairies seem to trip themselves all the time.One day Prince Charmont arrived in town. He bumped into Ella and they met for the first time. Ella fell in love with him right away. Ella has many great friends but, there are also a few people that she hates. Dame Olga and her two daughters, Hattie and Olive. Hattie is the oldest and the most selfish in the family. She makes Ella do horrible things.One night at dinner Ella's father told her that she should be sent to finishing school because she is so clumsy. At finishing school Ella would learn how to be a proper young lady. Ella didn't want to go especially because Hattie and Olive would be going too. Before Ella left, Mandy gave her a magic book that could show what people are doing; it could show people's diary entries and letters. One night Ella found her father's invitation to a giant's wedding. Fairies always go to giant's weddings and Ella knew that if fairies were going to be there then maybe she might find Lucinda and ask her to take the \\"gift\\" back. Ella escaped finishing school to go to the wedding. On her way to the wedding through the woods she was faced with ogres. She didn't care, she just didn't want to be obedient anymore. Along her journey she met an elf and became good friends. Also, Ella had a fight with three ogres. They ordered her to get into a pot and be boiled. Was Ella going to die right when the adventure began to have her \\"gift\\" taken back? Was she going to ever see her love again, Prince Char?This was an amazing book.

There was even a moment our two where I noticed myself shaking from the pure joy of this read. Ella Enchanted is exciting, with nearly every chapter ending in cliffhanger. It is funny, Ella's curse of obediance and her extraordinary wit providing most of the laughs. It is dark at times, which any great fantasy must be.

This meant that Ella had to do everything she was told to do. So growing up was difficult, if someone said go kill yourself she would have to do it.

Eventually she met a prince... and you know the story.Throughout the book Ella is tried many times over but never gives up. You have to read the book to find out all the interesting and exciting things she has to go through while still trying to deal with her curse.Overall I enjoyed this book a lot and I had fun reading and seeing what was going to happen to Ella next. Ella is a brave girl and I enjoyed reading about her."},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book is SO GREAT! I love reading, and I've read lots of books, but this is one of my favorites. It's like a classic fairy tale, a twist on Cinderella. But this is better in some ways, she doesn't just meet the Prince at a ball and then live happily forever. She has to go on a quest, and her curse of obediance makes it really interesting. It was so life-like when her step-sisters were treating her mean I was actually mad!

Ella Enchanted is a version of the classic fairytale Cinderella. Complete with a prince, a mean step-mother, and 2 step sisters. One who's mean, and one who's just plain stupid.Watch Ella battle trolls, save a gnome, and witness her ever-lasting fight against the curse that keeps her a prisoner in her own body.I wont give anything away, but I think you'll like the ending.

She has to obey any order, even if it is to kill herself. She is determined to break the curse in which she can't be with her love Char.It takes a lot for a book to grab my attention, and this book did it. It had the strong heroine, the nasty villians, an adventure, and of course, Char, the wonderful prince.It is similar to Cinderella i a way, but is far superior. It is such a magical tale, i want to tell the world about it.I loved this book!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book is fantastic in that it illustrates the power of independent thinking for young adolescent girls, an audience that faces many pressures to conform to societal norms.Levine's deviated enough from the classic fairytale to keep and hold my interest throughtout the entire book.

She meant to bestow a gift. When I cried inconsolably through my first hour of life my tears were her insperation. Shaking her head simpathetically at Mother, the fairy touched my nose. 'My gift is obedience. Ella will always be obedient. Now stop crying, child.' I stopped.\\"When Ella is older her mother dies leaving her with her greedy father whose job is being a merchant. I won't give away who her fairy godmother is, but she has one. Once her father sees how clumsy his daughter is he sends her off to finishing school, but don't think any finishing school can hold her. After a series of adventures, including one with Char (her love), also known as the prince, she returns home only to find out that her father is to be marryed to an extremely rich lady with two daughters, one of which has discovered Ella's obedience and uses it to her advantage. Her new stepfamily pushes all of the work on Ella; her only joy is writing to Char.To find out whether Ella stays trapped under the rule of her stepfamily forever or finally lives happilly ever after you will have to read the book. This is one you definately DON'T want to miss. I have read this book about three times including just reading parts of it. Once you start it you can't put it down, even after you're done! Literally!"},{"Title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I didn't read \\"Ella Enchanted\\" until I was sixteen or so, and I fell in love with it. Anyone who's steering clear of this book because of its \\"12-14\\" age bracket is missing out! \\"Ella\\" clears up some questions one might have had about the original \\"Cinderella\\" tale, such as, Why on earth did Cinderella tolerate the rotten treatment she received from her stepfamily? Gail Carson Levine explains it: she was under a spell to be obedient! Also, the love story is much more satisfying and (sigh!) romantic than the typical, \\"love at first sight at the ball\\" storyline. We watch Ella and Char (get it? prince CHARming?? ) fall in love, are given the reasons each has for loving the other, understand why Ella ran away from the ball (it wasn't because she was afraid of her dress turning into rags). Gail Carson Levine took a story that people loved for the basic fairy-tale premise and added the details, personalities, and information to make it one that people love for the story's sake, not just because it is a \\"Cinderella story\\"."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},S={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],C={key:0},B={key:1};function W(n,a,s,u,r,i){const c=w("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[a[1]||(a[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",S,[(e(!0),t(f,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),g(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",B,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",C,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const q=d(E,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-ca6a7360"]]),O=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/9.md","filePath":"quotes/9.md"}'),x={name:"quotes/9.md"},P=Object.assign(x,{setup(n){return(a,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(q)]))}});export{O as __pageData,P as default};
