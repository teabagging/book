Still today, power-sharing between Sunni, Shi'i, Christian and Druze groups is a precarious balance, greatly affected by and in turn affecting events across the Middle East. But even during times of conflict, Lebanon's communities have managed a modicum of coexistence: agreeing on the importance of maintaining the Lebanese state and sharing the fear of being the player left standing in a macabre game of musical chairs. Tracing the origins of the civil war, Theodor Hanf shows that it was primarily a surrogate war over Palestine which escalated into a conflict between the diverse Lebanese communities. Hanf's central theme is the problem of conflict and conflict regulation between these groups, a theme which continues to have resonance over two decades since the end of the civil war. This highly influential book - now available in a paperback edition - delves into vital issues, such as how conflicts were peacefully regulated before the war, and how the country came to be a battlefield for proxy wars and analyses the prospects for permanent coexistence.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=iElYzAEACAAJ&dq=Co-Existence+in+Wartime+Lebanon:+Decline+of+a+State+and+Rise+of+a+Nation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Laduma!: Soccer, Politics and Society in South Africa","description":"In South Africa there are times when nothing is more important than soccer (football). Laduma! is an immensely informative and vital account of the history of the game in South Africa. In explaining how soccer - a sport imported with colonialism - came to be a mainstay of black sporting experience, it explores the Africanization of the game with the introduction of rituals and magic, and the emergence of distinctive playing styles. Using archival research, interviews, newspaper and magazine articles, advertisements and photos, Laduma! chronicles the impact of indigenous sporting traditions such as stick fighting, the rise of Orlando Pirates, the emergence of rivals Moroka Swallows, and the power struggles between different football associations and white authorities. Soccer influenced class and generational divisions, shaped masculine identities, and served as a mobilizing force for township and political organizations. Laduma! embodies sporting history at its best and will be of interest to ardent soccer fans as well as more serious scholars of African history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GYgTAQAAIAAJ&dq=Laduma!:+Soccer,+Politics+and+Society+in+South+Africa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The beginning of Christianity","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a0mtlEI29bAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gospel in the feasts of Israel","description":"In The Gospel in the Feasts of Israel, Dr. Buksbazen will lead you into an exciting encounter with ancient Israel's festive occasions and masterfully explain how they interact with and illuminate the teachings of Jesus, the writings of the New Testament, and the message of the gospel.

The modern student is often unable to crack open a kabbalistic text due to insufficient knowledge of the Hebrew language or a lack of basic information. Leonard R. Glotzer carefully guides the nonspecialist through a primary text of Kabbalah, the result being not a book about Jewish mysticism, but a book of Kabbalah itself. The structure of The Fundamentals of Jewish Mysticism is based on the author's translation of Sefer Yetzirah, known as The Book of Creation, one of the oldest and most important of kabbalistic texts. Many kabbalistic ideas appear for the first time in The Book of Creation, and it has served as a point of departure for all subsequent kabbalistic works. The importance of The Book of Creation is reflected in the fact that some of the greatest names in Jewish history have written commentaries on it, including Saadia Gaon, Nachmanides, and Rabbi Elijah, the Vilna Gaon. Many Jewish sages have commented on The Book of Creation in their own writings, among them Yehuda Halevi and Abraham ibn Ezra. Glotzer, observing that for many students today these commentaries are too difficult to understand, has provided us with a commentary on these commentaries and gives enough background and history to make The Book of Creation a wellspring of inspiration. By offering us a modern translation of The Book of Creation as well as translations of large parts of its major classical commentaries, Glotzer clearly illustrates his view that \\"Kabbalah is more of a process than a result.\\" In addition, he presents the different approaches of the kabbalists throughout the centuries and the reasons why they differ, along with clear discussions of the major schools of Jewish mysticism, including the schools of the Ari (Yitzchak Luria) and Moses Cordovero. The Fundamentals of Jewish Mysticism is an important contribution to the ongoing pursuit of Jewish mystical knowledge. It is sure to become a crucial text for beginners and specialists alike.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3bbXAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Fundamentals+of+Jewish+Mysticism:+The+Book+of+Creation+and+its+Commentaries&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Open Shutters: Poems","description":"Mary Jo Salter s sparkling new collection, Open Shutters, leads us into a world where things are often not what they seem. In the first poem,  Trompe l Oeil,  the shadow-casting shutters on Genoese houses are made of paint only, an  open lie.  And yet  Who needs to be correct / more often than once a day? / Who needs real shadow more than play?  Open Shutters also calls to mind the lens of a camera in the villanelle  School Pictures  or in the stirring sequence  In the Guesthouse,  which, inspired by photographs of a family across three generations, offers at once a social history of America and a love story. Darkness and light interact throughout the book in poems about September 11; about a dog named Shadow; about a blind centenarian who still pretends to read the paper; about a woman shaken by the death of her therapist. A section of light verse highlights the wit and grace that have long distinguished Salter s most serious work. Fittingly, the volume fools the eye once more by closing with  An Open Book,  in which a Muslim family praying at a funeral seek consolation in the pages formed by their upturned palms. Open Shutters is the achievement of a remarkable poet, whose concerns and stylistic range continue to grow, encompassing ever larger themes, becoming ever more open.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZZlRAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces: Applications in statistical signal processing (Benchmark papers in electrical engineering and computer science)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pxwZAQAAIAAJ&dq=Reproducing+kernel+Hilbert+spaces:+Applications+in+statistical+signal+processing+(Benchmark+papers+in+electrical+engineering+and+computer+science)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Set theory and topology","description":"Introduction to Set Theory and Topology describes the fundamental concepts of set theory and topology as well as its applicability to analysis, geometry, and other branches of mathematics, including algebra and probability theory.

Operations on sets which are analogous to arithmetic operations are also discussed. The chapters that follow focus on the mapping concept, the power of a set, operations on cardinal numbers, order relations, and well ordering. The section on topology explores metric and topological spaces, continuous mappings, cartesian products, and other spaces such as spaces with a countable base, complete spaces, compact spaces, and connected spaces. The concept of dimension, simplexes and their properties, and cuttings of the plane are also analyzed.

Ogilvie brings together a team of skilled and exceptional communicators to blend sound scholarship with life-related illustrations. The design for the Preacher's Commentary gives the reader an overall outline of each book of the Bible. Following the introduction, which reveals the author's approach and salient background on the book, each chapter of the commentary provides the Scripture to be exposited. The New King James Bible has been chosen for the Preacher's Commentary because it combines with integrity the beauty of language, underlying Hebrew and Greek textual basis, and thought-flow of the 1611 King James Version, while replacing obsolete verb forms and other archaisms with their everyday contemporary counterparts for greater readability. Reverence for God is preserved in the capitalization of all pronouns referring to the Father, Son, or Holy Spirit. Readers who are more comfortable with another translation can readily find the parallel passage by means of the chapter and verse reference at the end of each passage being exposited. The paragraphs of exposition combine fresh insights to the Scripture, application, rich illustrative material, and innovative ways of utilizing the vibrant truth for his or her own life and for the challenge of communicating it with vigor and vitality.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o0daTy6_cwIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Washington County, Ohio Marriages, 1789-1840","description":"The marriages in this book consist of a complete list of 3,600 brides and grooms, with places of residence, marriage dates, names of officiating ministers, and page references to the original record books for the period 1789 to 1840.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lBzHrAzXuHUC&dq=Washington+County,+Ohio+Marriages,+1789-1840&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Marital Compatibility Test: Hundreds of Questions for Couples to Answer Together","description":"All those little differences that seem trivial when you're falling in love can become major issues once passion cools with the reality of living together.

All these activities involve partnering with others. Partnering is necessary and comes naturally for most of us. These partnerships satisfy not only functional needs but social and personal needs. However, partnering can have its difficulties. Psychologists have studied the difficulties in partnering that healthy, normal people encounter. They found that how we perceive the world, how we make decisions, and how we interact with others are preeminent pieces of the puzzle. Concepts of psychological type and psychological temperament emerged from this work. We can use psychological type in our own personal growth to know, accept, and specialize in who we are. Additionally, psychological type can help with partnering by facilitating communications, acceptance and understanding, and providing insight about the diversity and differences we encounter. Psychological type comprises two attitudes and two functions. Using these four variables, there are sixteen unique psychological types into which we all fall. When partnering one-on-one, if you combine 16 possible types with 16 other psychological types, then you come up with 256 unique psychological type partnerships possible. It is now clear why there is so much diversity present when people interact. Two hundred and fifty-six unique partnerships is a great deal to understand and master. It would be helpful to have a comprehensive reference manual that summarizes all of these combinations. This book provides this material, along with hints on how to deal with the most common type-based behaviors and the use of temperament specific language to improve communication. This book then proposes how to use psychological type, psychological temperament, and team skills to improve our most important interactions. Last, this manual proposes a general-purpose problem solving process and provides an objective means of measuring how the interaction is going. Satisfying interactions are possible even with those whom we previously had great difficulty enjoying. Much of our difficulty is created by the diversity we encounter and our naive approach in handling this diversity. This book lifts the shroud of our ignorance on these subjects. It is now up to us to care about our relationships sufficiently to take the time and effort to tend them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UDgXVf9snXUC&dq=After+the+Black+Sox:+The+Swede+Risberg+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Papa was a preacher","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5MpoPQAACAAJ&dq=Papa+was+a+preacher&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What They Don't Teach You at Harvard Business School Notes from a Street-Smart Executive","description":"This business classic features straight-talking advice you ll never hear in school.

The author of five collections of literary journalism pieces called cr nicas, he is perhaps best known for his analytic and often satirical descriptions of Mexico City?s popular culture. This comprehensive study of Monsiv?is?s cr nicas is the first book to offer an analysis of these works and to place Monsiv?is?s work within a theoretical framework that recognizes the importance of his vision of Mexican culture. Linda Egan examines his ideology in relation to theoretical postures in Latin America, the United States, and Europe to cast Monsiv?is as both a heterodox pioneer and a mainstream spokesman. She then explores the poetics of the contemporary chronicle in Mexico, reviewing the genre?s history and its relation to other narrative forms. Finally, she focuses on the canonical status of Monsiv?is?s work, devoting a chapter to each of his five principal collections. Egan argues that the five books that are the focus of her study tell a story of ever-renewing suspense: we cannot know  the end  until Monsiv?is is through constructing his literary project. Despite this, she observes, his work between 1970 and 1995 documents important discoveries in his search for causes, effects, and deconstructions of historical obstacles to Mexico?s passage into modernity. While anthropologists and historians continue to introduce new paradigms for the study of Mexico?s cultural space, Egan?s book provides a reflexive twist by examining the work of one of the thinkers who first inspired such a critical movement. More than an appraisal of Monsiv?is, it offers a valuable discussion of theoretical issues surrounding the study of the chronicle as it is currently practiced in Mexico. It balances theory and criticism to lend new insight into the ties between Mexican society, social conscience, and literature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ShzDkA2LGIQC&dq=Carlos+Monsivis:+Culture+and+Chronicle+in+Contemporary+Mexico&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"World Congress on Intellectual Capital Readings (KMCI Press)","description":"An impressive collection of the latest cutting-edge work in the dynamic field of intellectual capital.

Success is the covenant right of every believer, but it never becomes a reality until the promise is processed. Everything is at the state of rest or inertia until the relevant force is applied according to Newton's first law of motion. This law applies also to prophetic statements. Success is guaranteed for you as a believer based on the prophecy of Scriptures, but the prophecy must be processed otherwise it'll remain a mere proposition. We have a responsibility to make our ways successful. It's a partnership with God as we engage the forces of success as prescribed in the precepts, concepts, principles, instructions, and lines of Scriptures. In your journey to significant success, you must be conscious of the truth that God has completed His own part of the work. It is entirely your responsibility to determine the height of your success in life. And you can only do this by the knowledge and application of the forces or laws of success as enshrined in the Scriptures. In this book, The 15 Vital Forces of Success, these laws of success have been uniquely captured and packaged into fifteen easy to comprehend modules and designed as the Ds of Success Desire, Dream, Decision, Details, Demand, Dare, Direction, Diligence, Determination, Dedication, Dependence, Discipline, Development, Dealings, and Delivery. In the book, you'll discover the mysteries or forces behind success and the missing link to your success also how to effectively engage with them for maximum delivery.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KpMuEAAAQBAJ&dq=Success+Forces&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Nation by Rights: National Cultures, Sexual Identity Politics, and the Discourse of Rights (Queer Politics Queer Theories)","description":"How sexuality and sexual orientation intersect with gender, race, ethnicity, and religion in the ongoing formation of national identity Modern nations and nation states constitute themselves through the construction of others, located outside the bounds of the imagined community.

The dynamics of identity politics frequently have been studied from the perspective of these \\"outsider\\" groups. But how does this dynamic play out in the construction of the \\"national imaginary\\"? How do nations themselves respond to identity politics, especially the politics of sexuality and sexual orientation?

An unflinchingly honest memoir of her experience as a M tis woman in Canada, Maria Campbell's Halfbreed depicts the realities that she endured and, above all, overcame. Maria was born in Northern Saskatchewan, her father the grandson of a Scottish businessman and M tis woman--a niece of Gabriel Dumont whose family fought alongside Riel and Dumont in the 1885 Rebellion; her mother the daughter of a Cree woman and French-American man. This extraordinary account, originally published in 1973, bravely explores the poverty, oppression, alcoholism, addiction, and tragedy Maria endured throughout her childhood and into her early adult life, underscored by living in the margins of a country pervaded by hatred, discrimination, and mistrust. Laced with spare moments of love and joy, this is a memoir of family ties and finding an identity in a heritage that is neither wholly Indigenous or Anglo; of strength and resilience; of indominatable spirit. This edition of Halfbreed includes a new introduction written by Indigenous (M tis) scholar Dr. Kim Anderson detailing the extraordinary work that Maria has been doing since its original publication 46 years ago, and an afterword by the author looking at what has changed, and also what has not, for Indigenous people in Canada today.

Dusty, the family's dog, is enjoying all the fun, too, as he sniffs out all the Christmas fare lying around the room. \\"It's now time to get ready for bed,\\" Mother says. \\"You too, Dusty.\\" Sarah asks to stay up so she can see Santa.

Sarah hears a Clink clunk clunk sound coming from the parlor across the hallway. She opens one eye to peek out, and there, standing in the parlor across the hallway, is Santa Claus. She peeks out over the covers and sees him with a big button in his hand. \\"Looks like Santa popped his button, Dusty,\\" she whispers. Sarah runs out to tell her parents about what she's seen, but they both laugh and say it's only a dream. Sarah tries to convince them that it isn't a dream and describes the scene again in full detail as they take her back to her bedroom to tuck her in for the night.

Board of Education. Benjamin Rome, the ten-year-old son of a chicken farmer in one of the county's small townships, struggles to comprehend the furor that surrounds him, even as he understands the immorality of racial prejudice. Within his own family, opinions are sharply divided, and it is against this charged backdrop that Ben spends the summer working with his friend Burghardt, a black farmhand, under the predatory gaze of Ben's grandfather. While the elders of Prince Edward focus on closing the schools, life ambles on, and Ben grows closer to his pregnant sister, Lainie, and his troubled older brother, Al, while also coming to recognize the painful and inherent limitations of his friendship with Burghardt. Evocative and written with lush historical detail, Prince Edward is a refreshing bildungsroman by bestselling author Dennis McFarland, and a striking portrait of the social upheaval in the American South on the eve of the civil rights movement.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tnbtzgEACAAJ&dq=Prince+Edward:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teasure Island","description":"Treasure Island, published in 1883, popularized the now familiar characters of pirates and brought them to rum-swilling life.

Through the prism of the lives of Leon Blum, Albert Camus, and Raymond Aron, Judt examines pivotal issues in the history of contemporary French society antisemitism and the dilemma of Jewish identity, political and moral idealism in public life, the Marxist moment in French thought, the traumas of decolonization, the disaffection of the intelligentsia, and the insidious quarrels rending Right and Left. Judt focuses particularly on Blum's leadership of the Popular Front and his stern defiance of the Vichy governments, on Camus's part in the Resistance and Algerian War, and on Aron's cultural commentary and opposition to the facile acceptance by many French intellectuals of communism's utopian promise. Severely maligned by powerful critics and rivals, each of these exemplary figures stood fast in their principles and eventually won some measure of personal and public redemption. Judt constructs a compelling portrait of modern French intellectual life and politics. He challenges the conventional account of the role of intellectuals precisely because they mattered in France, because they could shape public opinion and influence policy. In Blum, Camus, and Aron, Judt finds three very different men who did not simply play the role, but evinced a courage and a responsibility in public life that far outshone their contemporaries. \\"An eloquent and instructive study of intellectual courage in the face of what the author persuasively describes as intellectual irresponsibility.\\" Richard Bernstein, New York Times","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=iHm-k5i0hUYC&dq=The+Burden&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Explorations in personality","description":"Explorations in Personality, published by OUP in 1938, established an elaborate agenda for understanding our subjective human nature that is as relevant to students of personality psychology today as it was to its audience then. An antidote to the now fashionable strategy of representing a person as a dot on a scatter plot or burying the individual in an amalgam of statistics, it advocates 'whole person' research and bubbles with suggestions about how to perform such studies. IN addition, it actually executes with empirical and experimental rigor and ingenuity the kind of detailed, engrossing case study approach it recommends, recounting the results of a three-year long study of fifty college-age individuals. This book is, in short, a classic. This reissue, enhanced by Dan McAdams' foreword, which will provide a contemporary evaluation of Murray's achievement, will thus be of great interest to students and researchers in personality psychology in general, and personologists in particular.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0zdBlMoUZ9gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love in the Balance","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=AODStgAACAAJ&dq=Love+in+the+Balance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: An A+ Audio Study Guide","description":"Huck and Jim travel down the Mississippi from St. Petersburg to Cairo.

Bad News is the story of Anjan Sundaram's time running a journalist's training program out of Kigali, the capital city of one of Africa's most densely populated countries, Rwanda. President Kagame s regime, which seized power after the genocide that ravaged its population in 1994, is often held up as a beacon for progress and modernity in Central Africa and is the recipient of billions of dollars each year in aid from Western governments and international organizations. Lurking underneath this shining vision of a modern, orderly state, however, is the powerful climate of fear springing from the government's brutal treatment of any voice of dissent. \\"You can't look and write,\\" a policeman ominously tells Sundaram, as he takes notes at a political rally. In Rwanda, the testimony of the individual the evidence of one's own experience is crushed by the pens e unique: the single way of thinking and speaking, proscribed by those in power. A vivid portrait of a country at an extraordinary and dangerous place in its history, Bad News is a brilliant and urgent parable on freedom of expression, and what happens when that power is seized.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6dJhCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Comedy Incarnate","description":"In Comedy Incarnate, No?l Carroll surveys the characteristics of Buster Keaton s unique visual style, to reveal the distinctive experience of watching Keaton s films.

Hoe komt het dat de betekenis van succes en verdienste de afgelopen decennia zo sterk veranderd is, en wel zodanig dat arbeid sterk aan waardigheid heeft ingeboet en veel mensen het gevoel hebben dat de elites op hen neerkijken?  - Michael J. Sandel Bestsellerfilosoof Michael Sandel maakt de balans op van de democratie. Veel mensen voelen zich niet meer vertegenwoordigd door de bestuurlijke elites en wenden zich tot populistische leiders en partijen. Het probleem is dat onze samenleving mensen met een hogere opleiding onevenredig beloont en de rest terzijde schuift. Dit is de tirannie van verdienste. Sandel gaat na in hoeverre de aanklacht van  het volk  tegen de elites terecht is. Waarom zou iemand met een universitaire opleiding meer over het algemeen welzijn mogen zeggen dan een persoon met een vmbo-diploma? Is dat rechtvaardig? 'De tirannie van verdienste' is een belangrijk boek voor iedereen die de democratie aan het hart gaat.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lWj-DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"O My America!: A Novel (Library of Modern Jewish Literature)","description":"A delightfully funny and moving novel about the singular life of a cantankerous Jewish-American writer and anarchist troublemaker, as remembered by his daughter In 1972, sixty-four-year-old Ezra Slavin's heart gives out at an anti-war rally. A contentious and irascible Jewish-American writer, anarchist, and inadvertent guru to discontented youth, he leaves behind a large extended family of ex-wives, lovers, and children, most of whom had cut all ties with the infuriating intellectual provocateur years earlier. Out of the entire family, only one daughter, Merry, a journalist, can remember her father with her own critical, conflicted understanding, a saddened sympathy approaching love. As the day of his memorial approaches, she attempts to make sense of the puzzle of Ezra's life before all of its disparate, discordant elements come crashing together at the service. The award-winning author of Other People's Lives, Johanna Kaplan creates a vivid cast of unforgettable characters who reveal the disparity between Ezra's long-suffering, neglected family, his admiring friends, and the youthful hangers-on--and, most notably, in the outrageously enigmatic Ezra himself. At once hilarious and poignant, O My America! offers a fascinating evocation of a time and place in America, a satiric history of the immigrant Jewish experience, and a wonderful portrait of an exasperating yet endearing anti-hero pursuing his unique vision of the American dream.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=la7SXkA38ksC&dq=O+My+America!:+A+Novel+(Library+of+Modern+Jewish+Literature)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great songs of Madison Avenue","description":"Radio and television commercials.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=F0vkAAAAMAAJ&dq=Great+songs+of+Madison+Avenue&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Consumption (Key Ideas)","description":"This book analyzes the main post-war features of consumption.

It means learning the hard lessons the mountains teach. Steve House built his reputation on ascents throughout the Alps, Canada, Alaska, the Karakoram and the Himalaya that have expanded possibilities of style, speed, and difficulty. In 2005 Steve and alpinist Vince Anderson pioneered a direct new route on the Rupal Face of 26,600-foot Nanga Parbat, which had never before been climbed in alpine style.

In essence, it states that the primes are distributed as harmoniously as possible--or, equivalently, that the Riemann zeros are located on a single vertical line, called the critical line. In this book, the author proposes a new approach to understand and possibly solve the Riemann Hypothesis. His reformulation builds upon earlier (joint) work on complex fractal dimensions and the vibrations of fractal strings, combined with string theory and noncommutative geometry. Accordingly, it relies on the new notion of a fractal membrane or quantized fractal string, along with the modular flow on the associated moduli space of fractal membranes. Conjecturally, under the action of the modular flow, the spacetime geometries become increasingly symmetric and crystal-like, hence, arithmetic. Correspondingly, the zeros of the associated zeta functions eventually condense onto the critical line, towards which they are attracted, thereby explaining why the Riemann Hypothesis must be true. Written with a diverse audience in mind, this unique book is suitable for graduate students, experts and nonexperts alike, with an interest in number theory, analysis, dynamical systems, arithmetic, fractal or noncommutative geometry, and mathematical or theoretical physics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zyF_Td9jOIkC&dq=Quantum+Fields+and+Strings:+A+Course+for+Mathematicians+(2+Volume+Set)+(v.+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The river war, an account of the reconquest of the Sudan,","description":"Retelling in military detail of the operations directed by Lord Kitchener of Khartoum on the Upper Nile from April 1896 to November 1899.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BARECgAAQBAJ&dq=The+river+war,+an+account+of+the+reconquest+of+the+Sudan,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Angelic Force: A Modern Medium's Communication with the Spirit World","description":"A compelling, candid portrait of a modern psychic medium, Angelic Force describes the many challenges Raphael faces in her work and describes the many ways she has touched and changed people's lives by bringing messages from the other side and by teaching others to open their minds to their own psychic abilities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gCQqAQAACAAJ&dq=Angelic+Force:+A+Modern+Medium%27s+Communication+with+the+Spirit+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pakistani Folk Tales: Toontoony Pie and Other Stories","description":"Offers a collection of twenty-two tales from Punjab and Bengal, including \\"Four Friends,\\" the origin of the Grimms' \\"Bremen Town Musicians.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=a48BAAAACAAJ&dq=Pakistani+Folk+Tales:+Toontoony+Pie+and+Other+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oryx and Crake","description":"By the author of THE HANDMAID'S TALE and ALIAS GRACE * Pigs might not fly but they are strangely altered.

The Game Design Reader is a one-of-a-kind collection on game design and criticism, from classic scholarly essays to cutting-edge case studies. A companion work to Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman's textbook Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals, The Game Design Reader is a classroom sourcebook, a reference for working game developers, and a great read for game fans and players. Thirty-two essays by game designers, game critics, game fans, philosophers, anthropologists, media theorists, and others consider fundamental questions: What are games and how are they designed? How do games interact with culture at large? What critical approaches can game designers take to create game stories, game spaces, game communities, and new forms of play? Salen and Zimmerman have collected seminal writings that span 50 years to offer a stunning array of perspectives. Game journalists express the rhythms of game play, sociologists tackle topics such as role-playing in vast virtual worlds, players rant and rave, and game designers describe the sweat and tears of bringing a game to market. Each text acts as a springboard for discussion, a potential class assignment, and a source of inspiration. The book is organized around fourteen topics, from The Player Experience to The Game Design Process, from Games and Narrative to Cultural Representation. Each topic, introduced with a short essay by Salen and Zimmerman, covers ideas and research fundamental to the study of games, and points to relevant texts within the Reader. Visual essays between book sections act as counterpoint to the writings. Like Rules of Play, The Game Design Reader is an intelligent and playful book. An invaluable resource for professionals and a unique introduction for those new to the field, The Game Design Reader is essential reading for anyone who takes games seriously.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=aZv6AQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Game+Design+Reader:+A+Rules+of+Play+Anthology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Major Piston Aero Engines of WWII","description":"\\"The frenzy of technological invention and improvement that accompanied each large-scale conflict during the twentieth century has been one of the most important factors in driving the spectacular scientific advances made during the last hundred years. The half-way point of the century saw the horrors of the first truly global battle--World War II. At that time the piston aero engine was at its zenith and the world's airforces were almost entirely propeller driven. It is a period that provides the most interesting study of these engines and the aircraft they powered because the rapid change to turbojets that occurred in the post-war era saw the demise of the piston engine on almost all types of military aircraft and large airliners. This book looks at the design and development of the most famous engines used by the combatants during this great air war. Each type is studied and evaluated in historical perspective and many famous aircraft are illustrated to demonstrate installation and differing usage. One Merlin makes a Spitfire, two a Mosquito, and four a Lancaster. Engines made in America, Russia, and Germany could boast the same versatility and are described here in detail.\\" --Book jacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=F5MgAQAAIAAJ&dq=Major+Piston+Aero+Engines+of+WWII&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Homeowner Associations: A Nightmare or a Dream Come True?","description":"Do you thrive or barely survive in a community governed by an association?

The fairy tale in particular--set in enchanted lands and populated with a variety of human and supernatural beings, both good and evil--holds a very special place in the Jewish tradition. For in the fairy tale, where good and evil engage in a timeless struggle, we have a clear reflection of the Jewish world view, where faith in God can defeat the evil impulse. In Elijah's Violin, Howard Schwartz offers a sumptuous collection of thirty-six Jewish fairy tales from virtually every corner of the world. At once otherworldy and earthy, pious and playful, these celebrated tales from Morocco and India, Spain and Eastern Europe, Babylon and Egypt, illustrate not only their Jewish character but also their universality of themes. Invoking the biblical tale of David and Goliath, we read as King David defeats the giant by hovering above its spear in King David and the Giant. In the romantic tale of The Princess in the Tower, a variant of Rapunzel, we watch as the cautious King Solomon recognizes the vanity in trying to prevent Providence from taking place. And we see the religious nature of the quest for Elijah's violin in the title story. The successful completion of the king's quest enables the violin's imprisoned melodies, emblematic of the Jewish spirit, to be set free. Throughout this richly illustrated collection, one can find the quests and riddles of the traditional fairy tale along with the divine intervention that characterizes the Jewish fairy tale. Skillfully translated, these stories will captivate children and adults alike in which romance and magic become enchantingly entwined with faith, duty, and wisdom.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=meZcCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pooh's Great Big Lift Flap Book (Great Big Board Book)","description":"Bold and inviting illustrations along with more than sixty flaps to lift help retell the best parts of four classic Winnie the Pooh stories.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QhXDPAAACAAJ&dq=Pooh%27s+Great+Big+Lift+Flap+Book+(Great+Big+Board+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nubian Passion: A Collection of Five Sensual Romance Short Stories","description":"Nubian Passion is a collection of five short stories, which incorporate love, romance, and sensuality into non-traditional interracial tales.

In addressing these topics, contributors cover the entire range of neuropsychological syndromes in which problems with awareness of deficit are observed: hemiplegia and hemianopia, amnesia, aphasia, traumatic head injury, dementia, and others. On the clinical side, leading researchers delineate the implications of awareness of deficits for rehabilitation and patient management, and the role of defense mechanisms such as denial. Theoretical discussions focus on the importance of awareness disturbances for better understanding such cognitive processes as attention, consciousness, and monitoring.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xze89PCLaWMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Against Gravity","description":"Against Gravity is a stunning sci-fi thriller from Gary Gibson, author of the Shoal Sequence.

Along the way, familiar images and concepts are juxtaposed to create a literary terrain that is both engaging and unsettling: the Bible and Black Elk Speaks converse; Glancy's dispute with a local bakery is played out as if on a world stage of warring nations; eggs and cultural identity implicate each other; and lost Native languages speak powerfully through their silences to modern Native writers. The creative twists and darting metaphoric excursions engendered by this journey provide an intimate glimpse into the process and problematics of language for modern Native authors.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KE6ffj8ToH0C&dq=The+Cold-and-Hunger+Dance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On Bended Knee","description":"From New York Times bestselling author Celeste Bradley comes Book 6 of The Wicked Worthingtons Series. At last! The story of healing the war-torn heart of Lysander Worthington! Lysander Worthington has existed in a dark place since he came back from the war. His heart seems like a locked chamber, hidden even from his beloved family. Life seems like a constant battlefield. When Lysander encounters an enraged farm animal in a remote Yorkshire village, his battle instincts take over! Isolated doctor's widow, Gemma Oakes, has a habit of taking in the bent and the broken. When a handsome stranger rides into her village and proceeds to destroy their festival, Gemma believes she can help this beautiful, damaged man cleanse his heart of war. Lysander's darkness appeals to Gemma's nurturing spirit, while his beautiful body mesmerizes her senses. Lysander has kept his secret for so many years, but Gemma's inner strength and open heart tempt him to speak at last. Among the beloved, misfit inhabitants (not all human!) of Yew Manor, can Lysander and Gemma trust enough to understand broken hearts can mend, and shattered souls love again? Praise for the Wicked Worthingtons Series \\"A charming and very romantic story with lots of laughs along the way.\\" --Fresh Fiction \\"I adored this story and the wonderful hero and heroine who shed all their inhibitions and fears.\\" --Smexy Books \\"An exciting and sweet historical love story.\\" --Feminist Fairy Tale Reviews \\"A laugh-out-loud funny novel.\\" --Harlequin Junkie Under the covers... If you've perused the earlier books in the Wicked Worthingtons series, you'll recall that Lysander Worthington is a shadow of a man, a dark presence in the cheerful Worthington household. The war has set him apart from his loving family and he doesn't know how to reach out to them. To write this book, I had to balance the usual lighthearted Worthington humor and hijinks with an earnest look at traumatic damage. As a storyteller, I hope I've both delivered an entertaining and romantic (and sexy!) story and also have done justice to the difficult and tragic effects of PTSD. I learned so much while looking into this devastating disorder. This is a thing that can happen to any of us, at any time in our lives, not just a distant ordeal that happens to soldiers in far away lands. Blessed healing to any heart and mind suffering in such a dark place.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9vaKDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Great War Through Keystone Stereographs","description":"World War I stereoview sets remained popular for many years after the war ended. In the United States, the most commonly encountered World War I stereographs were produced by four companies: Keystone View Company, Underwood & Underwood, and W.E. Troutman of this country, and Realistic Travels of England. Of those four, Keystone was the largest and in business the longest time. It produced over 800 war stereographs, most a part of one or more of the seven principle war sets. The Great War Through Keystone Stereographs describes these sets from the first one in 1915 to the last one in 1932. It includes photos of over 120 stereoviews and complete title lists for each set. While Keystone stereoviews are the most common in this country, not all Keystone cards are common. . The Great War Through Keystone Stereographs provides for the first time a sound basis for estimating their market value. Anyone who looks at Keystone war stereographs card on eBay will find that dealers and collectors alike betray considerable ignorance of their scarcity, with common cards being offered (and purchased) at $25.00 and rare cards and sets going for a song. As we approach the centennial of the Great War, stereocards about it are likely to become increasingly popular. The collector who owns this book will avoid overpaying and will be able to find bargains. . The Great War Through Keystone Stereographs is far more than a catalog. The chapters on each set offer serious students of the war and photography insight into Keystone's editorial decisions as they continually tried to improve the quality of their coverage of the Great War. It also establishes previous unknown links among producers of stereographs of the period and makes sense of the baffling number patterns apparent in any group of cards. It is an indispensable a reference to historians and dealers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dlfWAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Great+War+Through+Keystone+Stereographs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rock folk;: Portraits from the rock 'n' roll pantheon","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XeLOngEACAAJ&dq=Rock+folk%3B:+Portraits+from+the+rock+%27n%27+roll+pantheon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Boomernomics: The Future of Your Money in the Upcoming Generational Warfare","description":"Offer an analysis of the escalating competition among the world's growing economies and explain how Americans can survive and thrive in spite of it","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GkLpnAYPyakC&dq=Boomernomics:+The+Future+of+Your+Money+in+the+Upcoming+Generational+Warfare&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nurturing Readiness in Early Childhood Education: A Whole-Child Curriculum for Ages 2-5 (2nd Edition)","description":"B> This is a conceptual and practical guide to creating a whole child curriculum organized into three parts: Child Development, the PLAN curriculum, and the environment.

In Turkey, no secular party has approximated the high levels of membership and intense activism of women within the Islamist Refah (Welfare) Party. Rethinking Islam and Liberal Democracy examines the experiences of these women, who represented an unprecedented phenomenon within Turkish politics. Using in-depth interviews, Ye?im Arat reveals how the women of the party broadened the parameters of democratic participation and challenged preconceived notions of what Islam can entail in a secular democratic polity. The women of the party successfully mobilized large groups of allegedly apolitical women by crossing the boundaries between the social and the political, reaching them through personal networks cultivated in private spaces. The experiences of these women show the contentious relationship between liberal democracy and Islam, where liberalism that prioritizes the individual can transform, coexist, or remain in tension with Islam that prioritizes a communal identity legitimized by a sacred God. Ye?im Arat is Professor of Political Science and International Relations at Bo?azi?i University, Istanbul. She is the author of The Patriarchal Paradox: Women Politicians in Turkey and the coeditor (with Barbara Laslett and Johanna Brenner) of Rethinking the Political: Gender, Resistance, and the State.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BWl6CxzfnA4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Don't Push Your Preschooler","description":"Parents are given advice on the importance of patience and understanding in raising preschoolers","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HPApAQAAMAAJ&dq=Don%27t+Push+Your+Preschooler&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Air Disaster (Vol. 3)","description":"This work concentrates on the landmark propliner accidents of the 1950s and 1960s.

As the trade developed in the 1970s, most of the efforts went to interdicting the flow of the drug to the United States; little attention was given to decreasing the evergrowing American appetite for cocaine. This failed policy allowed the cocaine trafficking to flourish in the 1980s, resulting in untold deaths in both countries and countless dollars being spent in a futile effort to win the \\"drug war.\\" The author supervised the antinarcotics operations of the American Embassy in Bogot as the deputy chief of mission and charg daffaires during the late 1970s. This work provides for the first time an insiders account of the formative years of the American drug policy and the failure of the U.S. and Colombian governments to form an alliance against the cocaine traffickers during this critical period. The earlier history of the U.S. and Colombian relations is covered, providing background to the failed drug policy.

Topics include boardroom maneuvering, cheating scams, \\"creative\\" financing, power plays among partners, and intense rivalries between casinos. Among the featured characters are Bill Harrah, the Houssels family, Donald Trump, Warren \\"Doc\\" Bayley, Jimmy Contratto, Jake Kozloff, Bob Maheu, and Si Redd. Dixon's career gave him an extraordinary perspective on gaming. Admitted to the Nevada bar in 1949, he became counsel to casinos and to groups launching gaming operations in Las Vegas, Reno, and Lake Tahoe. By 1957 he was the principal attorney for William F. Harrah and Harrah's Clubs, and by the late 1960s he was on the board of directors of Harrah's, the Showboat, and the Tropicana. Following Bill Harrah's death, Dixon was elected chairman of the Harrah's board, where he engineered the 1980 merger of Harrah's with Holiday Inns. Upon his retirement from Holiday, he returned to the Showboat board of directors and guided that company's successful expansion into Atlantic City. Playing the Cards That Are Dealt explores four decades of casino gaming history in the United States through the career of one of the industry's most prominent figures.\\"--Publisher.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=aACQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Playing+the+Cards+That+Are+Dealt:+Mead+Dixon,+the+Law,+and+Casino+Gaming+:+From+Oral+History+Interviews+With+Mead+Dixon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Against The Grain","description":"In this provocative, wide-ranging book, Against the Grain, Richard Manning offers a dramatically revisionist view of recent human evolution, beginning with the vast increase in brain size that set us apart from our primate relatives and brought an accompanying increase in our need for nourishment. For 290,000 years, we managed to meet that need as hunter-gatherers, a state in which Manning believes we were at our most human: at our smartest, strongest, most sensually alive. But our reliance on food made a secure supply deeply attractive, and eventually we embarked upon the agricultural experiment that has been the history of our past 10,000 years. The evolutionary road is littered with failed experiments, however, and Manning suggests that agriculture as we have practiced it runs against both our grain and nature's. Drawing on the work of anthropologists, biologists, archaeologists, and philosophers, along with his own travels, he argues that not only our ecological ills-overpopulation, erosion, pollution-but our social and emotional malaise are rooted in the devil's bargain we made in our not-so-distant past. And he offers personal, achievable ways we might re-contour the path we have taken to resurrect what is most sustainable and sustaining in our own nature and the planet's.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=woam4BS6TaYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jack Welch (Business Masterminds)","description":"CEO of General Electric for 30 years, Jack Welch was declared the greatest manager of the 20th century.

He has recorded his own feelings about meeting the challenges of war, his love of flying, and the camaraderie of his flying mates--both in the air and on liberty--along with the factual details of battle that contribute important dimensions to the overall story of the air war. Added to these stirring memories are his entertaining descriptions of the mobilization and training of carrier pilots and his recounting of the high incidence of non-combat fatalities and the change in the composition of the air group in response to the Kamikaze threat. Such a book not only will appeal to aviators everywhere but also will prove to be a thrilling read for those interested in World War II and air combat.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bZvzAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Louise de la Vallire (World's Classics)","description":"Featuring D'Artagnan and the now ageing Musketeers, Louise de la Valli re is the middle section of The Vicomte de Bragelonne, or, Ten Years After.

Removing the Taliban government in Afghanistan, thereby eliminating al Qaeda's sanctuary and training camps, has broken an important link in the process that once provided al Qaeda's leadership with a continuing flow of recruits. Toppling the Taliban also demonstrated American resolve and international support, and it underscored the considerable risk run by governments that provide assistance to terrorists. Having achieved its initial goals in Afghanistan, the United States is now in a second, more complex phase of the war, where it must continue its efforts to destroy al Qaeda and at the same time attempt to combat terrorism as a mode of conflict. Al Qaeda, along with its associates and its successors, will fight on, drawing upon a deep reservoir of hatred and a desire for revenge. It must be presumed that al Qaeda will exploit all of its ability to cause catastrophic death and destruction there will be no self-imposed limits to its violence. It can also be presumed that the organization will continue its efforts to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction (WMD); that it will attack U.S. targets abroad where possible; and that it will attempt to mount attacks within the United States. Al Qaeda constitutes the most serious immediate threat to the security of the United States.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Tsy2wwEACAAJ&dq=Countering+Al+Qaeda:+An+Appreciation+of+the+Situation+and+Suggestions+for+Strategy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On the Incarnation (De incarnatione Verbi Dei)","description":"\\"Jesus became what we are, that he might make us what He is.\\" Athanasius Athanasius (c. 297 - 373AD), a fourth century theologian and Bishop of Alexandria, stood contra mundum (\\"against the world\\") in defense of the biblical doctrine of Christ.

It was a name that no white person asked to know during Hollis's tour of duty in Anzio, his unacknowledged difference as an Omaha Indian adding to the poignancy of his uneasy fellowship with foreign and American soldiers alike. Stabler?s story?coming of age on the American plains, going to war, facing new estrangement upon coming home?is a universal one, rendered wonderfully strange and personal by Stabler?s uncommon perspective, which embraces two worlds, and by his unique voice. ? Stabler's experiences during World War II?tours of duty in Tunisia and Morocco as well as Italy and France, and the loss of his brother in battle?are at the center of this powerful memoir, which tells of growing up as an Omaha Indian in the small-town Midwest of Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, and Oklahoma in the 1920s and 1930s. A descendant of the Indians who negotiated with Lewis and Clark on the Missouri River, Stabler describes a childhood that was a curious mixture of progressivism and Indian tradition, and that culminated in his enlisting in the old horse cavalry when war broke out?a path not so very different from that walked by his ancestors. Victoria Smith, of Cherokee-Delaware descent, interweaves historical insight with Stabler?s vivid reminiscences, providing a rich context for this singular life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fk-8q7EGz7YC&dq=No+One+Ever+Asked+Me:+The+World+War+II+Memoirs+of+an+Omaha+Indian+Soldier+(American+Indian+Lives)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Questions That Matter: An Invitation to Philosophy","description":"This classic text-reader introduces readers to the fundamental, timeless, and pressing questions of philosophy.

From savory pies to sweet buns, from crusty loaves to birthday cake, from old-world apple pie to peanut cookies to custard tarts, these recipes capture the age-old rhythm of turning simple ingredients into something wonderful to eat. HomeBaking rekindles the simple pleasure of working with your hands to feed your family. And it ratchets down the competitive demands we place on ourselves as home cooks. Because in striving for professional results we lose touch with the pleasures of the process, with the homey and imperfect, with the satisfaction of knowing that you can, as a matter of course, always have a full cookie jar or some homemade cake on hand to offer. Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid collected the recipes in HomeBaking at their source, from farmhouse kitchens in northern France to bazaars in Fez. They traveled tens of thousands of miles, to six continents, in search of everyday gems such as Taipei Coconut Buns, Welsh Cakes, Moroccan Biscotti, and Tibetan Overnight Skillet Breads. They tasted, interpreted, photographed and captured not just the recipes, but the people who made them as well. Then they took these spot-on flavors of far away and put them side by side with cherished recipes from friends and family closer to home. The result is a collection of treasures: cherry strudel from Hungary, stollen from Germany, bread pudding from Vietnam, anise crackers from Barcelona. More than two hundred recipes that resonate with the joys and flavors of everyday baking at home and around the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XH_8AgAAQBAJ&dq=Baking+Bread+At+Home:+Traditional+Recipes+from+Around+the+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Introduction to Solid Modeling","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CJVRAAAAMAAJ&dq=An+Introduction+to+Solid+Modeling&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The homosexual revolution","description":"In the vein of Taylor Branch s classic Parting of the Waters, Supreme Court lawyer and political pundit Linda Hirshman delivers the enthralling, groundbreaking story of the gay rights movement, revealing how a dedicated and resourceful minority changed America forever. When the modern struggle for gay rights erupted in the summer of 1969, forty-nine states outlawed sex between people of the same gender. Four decades later, in 2011, New York legalized gay marriage and the armed services stopped enforcing Don't Ask, Don't Tell. Successful social movements are always extraordinary, but these advances seem like something of a miracle. Linda Hirshman recounts the long roads that led to these victories, detailing the remarkable and revolutionary story of the movement that has blurred rigid gender lines, altered the shared culture, and broadened our definitions of family. Written in vivid prose, at once emotional and erudite, Victory is an utterly vibrant work of reportage and eyewitness accounts and demonstrates how, in a matter of decades, a focused group of activists forged a classic campaign for cultural change that will serve as a model for all future political movements.  Remarkable for its emotional punch as for its historical insight.

In this volume, Peter Simpson presents a complete philosophical commentary on the Politics, an analysis of the logical structure of the entire text and each of its constitutive arguments and conclusions. Unlike other contemporary works on the Politics, Simpson's philosophical commentary is not, save incidentally, a discussion of philological and historical questions, a speculative elaboration of Aristotle's arguments, or a comparison of the philosopher's ideas with those of other ancient and modern theorists. Such treatments, argues Simpson, must be grounded in a thorough understanding of the philosophical content of the work--a point that underscores the need for this thorough and accurate analysis. Keyed to the ancient Greek text as well as to Simpson's own innovative translation of it (UNC Press, 1997), this book will stand as a valuable commentary on the philosophical argument in the Politics and will serve as a sound basis for future study of Aristotle's political thought.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HAOtCQAAQBAJ&dq=A+Philosophical+Commentary+on+the+Politics+of+Aristotle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Urdu (Teach Yourself) (Urdu Edition)","description":"Teach Yourself makes learning Urdu easy The languages spoken by the people in the India and Pakistan region are plentiful and diverse, just like their speakers.

Even before his birth, his life was threatened: it was rumored that his father, Henry, had tried to make the pregnant Mary miscarry by forcing her to witness the assassination of her supposed lover, David Riccio. By the time James was a one-year-old, Henry was murdered, possibly with the connivance of his mother, Mary was in exile in England and he was King of Scotland. By the age of five, he had experienced three different regents as the ancient dynasties of Scotland battled for power and made him a virtual prisoner in Stirling Castle. In fact, James did not set foot outside the confines of Stirling until he was eleven, when he took control of the country. But even with power in his hands, he would never feel safe. For the rest of his life, he could be caught up in bitter struggles between the warring political and religious factions who fought for control over his mind and body.

Implicit learning is defined as the acquisition of knowledge that takes place independently of the conscious attempts to learn and largely in the absence of explicit knowledge about what was acquired. One of the core assumptions of this argument is that implicit learning is a fundamental, \\"root\\" process, one that lies at the very heart of the adaptive behavioral repertoire of every complex organism. The author's goals are to outline the essential features of implicit learning that have emerged from the many studies that have been carried out in a variety of experimental laboratories over the past several decades; to present the various alternative perspectives on this issue that have been proposed by other researchers and to try to accommodate these views with his own; to structure the literature so that it can be seen in the context of standard heuristics of evolutionary biology; to present the material within a functionalist approach and to try to show why the experimental data should be seen as entailing particular epistemological perspectives; and to present implicit processing as encompassing a general and ubiquitous set of operations that have wide currency and several possible applications. Chapter 1 begins with the core problem under consideration in this book, a characterization of \\"implicit learning\\" as it has come to be used in the literature. Reber puts this seemingly specialized topic into a general framework and suggests a theoretical model based on standard heuristics of evolutionary biology. In his account, Reber weaves a capsule history of interest in and work on the cognitive unconscious. Chapter 2 turns to a detailed overview of the experimental work on the acquisition of implicit knowledge, which currently is of great interest. Chapter 3 develops the evolutionary model within which one can see learning and cognition as richly intertwining issues and not as two distinct fields with one dominating the other. Finally, Chapter 4 explores a variety of entailments and speculations concerning implicit cognitive processes and their general role in the larger scope of human performance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1QCDQgAACAAJ&dq=Implicit+Learning+and+Tacit+Knowledge:+An+Essay+on+the+Cognitive+Unconscious+(Oxford+Psychology+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Luftwaffe Fighters' Battle of Britain","description":"Previously published as two seperate works: Luftwaffe fighters' Battle of Britain and, Luftwaffe bombers' Battle of Britain. 2000.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_X0NJgnvas4C&dq=The+Luftwaffe+Fighters%27+Battle+of+Britain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gabriel Club","description":"Gabriel s Torment (Regency Club Venus 2) is the 2nd book in Amazon #1 & USA Today Bestselling Author, Carole Mortimer s, hot new Regency romance series, Regency Club Venus.

In particular, cellular biology is, besides population dynamics, a field where tech niques of mathematical modeling are widely used. This is reflected by the large number of journal articles and congress proceedings published every year on the dynamics of complex cellular processes. This applies, among others, to metabolic control analysis, where the number of articles on theoretical fundamentals and experimental applications has increased for about 15 years. Surprisingly, mono graphs and textbooks dealing with the modeling of metabolic systems are still exceptionally rare. We think that now time is ripe to fill this gap. This monograph covers various aspects of the mathematical description of enzymatic systems, such as stoichiometric analysis, enzyme kinetics, dynamical simulation, metabolic control analysis, and evolutionary optimization. We believe that, at present, these are the main approaches by which metabolic systems can be analyzed in mathematical terms. Although stoichiometric analysis and enzyme kinetics are classical fields tracing back to the beginning of our century, there are intriguing recent developments such as detection of elementary biochemical syn thesis routes and rate laws for the situation of metabolic channeling, which we have considered worth being included. Evolutionary optimization of metabolic systems is a rather new field with promising prospects. Its goal is to elucidate the structure and functions of these systems from an evolutionary viewpoint.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=c_MGCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Intuition: How To Use it In Your Life","description":"Develop your intuition, recognize its signals, and put it to use in every facet of your life with the help of this book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=p-kHAAAACAAJ&dq=Intuition:+How+To+Use+it+In+Your+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Organizational Communication: An Introduction to Communication and Human Relation Strategies","description":"Entrepreneurship is very important for both entrepreneurs and economic development.

In the midst of a less-than-hopeful battle, Saul-who should have been leading-rested beneath a pomegranate tree as Jonathan seized the divine moment that would impact the future of Israel. Through this story McManus artfully illustrates the eight characteristics of an adventurer's heart, what he calls \\"the Jonathan factor.\\" Using powerful examples from his own life and ministry, along with fresh biblical teaching, McManus asserts that God crafts divine moments specific to each of us-priceless opportunities for us to actively engage in God's big-picture plan. Apathy and apprehension prevent us from being all we are meant to be for God's kingdom.

Follow me and go on a mission.  And didn t say . . .  Follow me and go to heaven.  The main thesis of the book is derived from Matthew, Mark, and Luke. In these Synoptic Gospels, Jesus never mentions heaven, except when speaking of God the Father. Being a this-world incarnation of God, he emphasizes life on earth and not the new environment after death. Our Lord explains that the mission will always involve both words and actions. The words should make two things clear: (1) the one who calls is the man Jesus who is the true revelation of God and (2) one s relationship with God is a reflection of Jesus s perfect relationship with the Father. The actions should be in the selfless lifestyle of Jesus himself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iJp8DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Learning Paradox","description":"In The Learning Paradox, neuroscientist, educator, and Harvard professor, Felipe Fregni discusses how our brain architecture, combined with our current educational system, may result in superficial and short-term learning.

A Baedeker of Decadence presents thirty-two international works of literary decadence written between 1884 and 1927. George C. Schoolfield, a world authority on the decadent novel, offers an entertaining and wide-ranging commentary on this highly significant literary and cultural phenomenon. Schoolfield tracks down the symptoms of decadence in narrative works written in more than a dozen languages, providing synopses and passages in English translation to give a sense of each author's style and tone. Schoolfield throws new light on the close intellectual kinship of authors from August Strindberg to Bram Stoker to Thomas Mann, and on the ingredients, themes, motifs, and preconceptions that characterized decadent literature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xcRiBvoQcDMC&dq=A+Baedeker+of+Decadence:+Charting+a+Literary+Fashion,+1884-1927&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Living Reminder Service and Prayer in Memory of Jesus Christ","description":"How service is prayer and prayer is service In this rich and deceptively simple book, beloved writer Henri Nouwen speaks--from the heart and from his own experience--of the joys and challenges of religious service.

These stereotypes are profoundly disturbing, the authors argue, for they both reflect and create a hatred and thus further fracture an already fractured society. In Spreading Misandry they show that creating a workable society in the twenty-first century requires us to rethink feminist and other assumptions about men. The first in an eventual three part series, Spreading Misandry offers an impressive array of evidence from everyday life  case studies from movies, television programs, novels, comic strips, and even greeting cards  to identify a phenomenon that is just now being recognised as a serious cultural problem. Discussing misandry  the sexist counterpart of misogyny  the authors make clear that this form of hatred must not be confused with reverse sexism or anger and should neither be trivialised nor excused. They break new ground by discussing misandry in moral terms rather than purely psychological or sociological ones and refer critically not only to feminism but to political ideologies on both the left and the right. They also illuminate the larger context of this problem, showing that it reflects the enduring conflict between the Enlightenment and romanticism, inherent flaws in postmodernism, and the dualistic (\\"us\\" versus \\"them\\") mentality that has influenced Western thought since ancient times. A groundbreaking study, Spreading Misandry raises serious questions about justice and identity in an increasingly polarised society. It is important for anyone in interested in ethics, gender, popular culture, or are just concerned about the society we are creating. \\"Spreading Misandry . . . does make a convincing argument that, since the 1990s, . . . Men, have become society's official scapegoats and held responsible for all evil . . . Women are society's official victims and held responsible for all good.\\"--Independent on Sunday, 4 August, 2002","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JGocoMfjt_oC&dq=Spreading+Misandry:+The+Teaching+of+Contempt+for+Men+in+Popular+Culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Neurotica: The Darkest Art of J.

What happens when fire strikes the manufacturing plant of the sole supplier for the brake pressure valve used in every Toyota? When a hurricane shuts down production at a Unilever plant? When Dell and Apple chip manufacturers in Taiwan take weeks to recover from an earthquake? When the U.S. Pacific ports are shut down during the Christmas rush? When terrorists strike? In The Resilient Enterprise, Yossi Sheffi shows that companies' fortunes in the face of such business shocks depend more on choices made before the disruption than they do on actions taken in the midst of it and that resilience benefits firms every day, disaster or no disaster. He shows how companies can build in flexibility throughout their supply chains, based on proven design principles and the right culture balancing security, redundancy, and short-term profits. And he shows how investments in resilience and flexibility not only reduce risk but create a competitive advantage in the increasingly volatile marketplace.Sheffi describes the way companies can increase security reducing the likelihood of a disruption with layered defenses, the tracking and analysis of  near-misses,  fast detection, and close collaboration with government agencies, trading partners, and even competitors. But the focus of the book is on resilience the ability to bounce back from disruptions and disasters by building in redundancy and flexibility. For example, standardization, modular design, and collaborative relationships with suppliers (and other stakeholders) can help create a robust supply chain. And a corporate culture of flexibility with distributed decision making and communications at all levels can create a resilient enterprise.Sheffi provides tools for companies to reduce the vulnerability of the supply chain they live in. And along the way he tells the stories of dozens of enterprises, large and small, including Toyota, Nokia, General Motors, Zara, Land Rover, Chiquita, Aisin Seiki, Southwest Airlines, UPS, Johnson and Johnson, Intel, Amazon.com, the U.S. Navy, and others, from across the globe. Their successes, failures, preparations, and methods provide a rich set of lessons in preparing for and managing disruptions.

In a series of celebrated books, the eminent photographer and sociologist Camilo Jose Vergara has observed and recorded the evolution of America's inner cities for over twenty years, documenting the effects of time, commercialism, culture, and neglect on the built environment, with an aesthetic vision that has been hailed by the New York Times as \\"persuasive and moving.\\" Here, in a unique collaboration with Timothy Samuelson, Chicago's leading architectural historian, Vergara probes the power and resonance of one of America's greatest cities. Unexpected Chicagoland includes over two hundred stunning color photographs, accompanied by a fascinating original narrative of the hidden history of Chicago's renowned architectural past. Vergara's photographs are a treasure trove of historically and visually interesting buildings and environments, most of them on the abandoned urban fringes. Included are examples of rarely-seen work by some of the greatest architects of the twentieth century, such as Louis Sullivan, Frank Lloyd Wright, and William Burley Griffin, as well as dazzling examples of Art Deco design. Unexpected Chicagoland presents an authentic and gritty view of the metropolis at a time when the public's understanding of all American cities has become increasingly sanitized and homogenized. The book itself, in a large format and exquisitely designed, is packaged to be a lasting visual treasure. Over 200 color photographs throughout.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rBp0QgAACAAJ&dq=Chicagoland+Atlas+1998+(Serial)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Becky Bradway.

First published in 2000, Chris Kraus's second novel, Aliens & Anorexia, defined a female form of chance that is both emotional and radical. Unfolding like a set of Chinese boxes, with storytelling and philosophy informing each other, the novel weaves together the lives of earnest visionaries and failed artists. Its characters include Simone Weil, the first radical philosopher of sadness; the artist Paul Thek; Kraus herself; and  Africa,  Kraus's virtual S&M partner, who is shooting a big-budget Hollywood film in Namibia while Kraus holes up in the Northwest woods to chronicle the failure of Gravity & Grace, her own low-budget independent film. In Aliens & Anorexia, Kraus makes a case for empathy as the ultimate perceptive tool, and reclaims anorexia from the psychoanalytic girl-ghetto of poor  self-esteem.  Anorexia, Kraus writes, could be an attempt to leave the body altogether: a rejection of the cynicism that this culture hands us through its food. As Palle Yourgrau writes in the book's new foreword,  Kraus's rescue operation for aliens like Weil from behind enemy lines on planet Earth is a gift, if, in the end, like all good deeds, it remains as Weil herself would be the first to insist a fool's errand.

In Los Angeles he established a newspaper and was its city editor for three years. Due to overwork, Lummis was forced to retire and therefore returned to New Mexico where his adventures included living with the Penitents and adoption by the Isleta Indians.

Essays of a Catholic is a book as provocative now as it was when it first appeared in 1931. Hilaire Belloc s observations about our civilization s demise are all the more urgent today, because they are proving to be prophetic. We are troubled witnesses to many of the evils he predicted as we watch the working out of the destructive trends and forces that he warned would lead to disaster. What key insight led to Belloc s keen discernment of the times? He recognized that the Catholic Church has inspired and formed our great Western civilization. As the influence of that mighty institution wanes, then as society slowly abandons what it has learned from her the night? descends on our way of life as we have known it. In its stead emerges a new paganism, and with it, a new barbarism. In these essays, Belloc sharpens our awareness of the calamitous effects of this waning influence of the Catholic Church in society. There is hope for the future of our civilization but only if we as a people embrace once more the liberating truth of the Catholic faith. The great Hilaire Belloc was one of the foremost Catholic historians of the past two centuries.

During the Dark Ages, the progress of Western civilization virtually stopped. The knowledge gained by the scholars of the classical age was lost; for nearly 600 years, life was governed by superstitions and fears fueled by ignorance. In this outspoken and forthright book, Lee McIntyre argues that today we are in a new Dark Age that we are as ignorant of the causes of human behavior as people centuries ago were of the causes of such natural phenomena as disease, famine, and eclipses. We are no further along in our understanding of what causes war, crime, and poverty and how to end them than our ancestors. We need, McIntyre says, another scientific revolution; we need the courage to apply a more rigorous methodology to human behavior, to go where the empirical evidence leads us even if it threatens our cherished religious or political beliefs about human autonomy, race, class, and gender. Resistance to knowledge has always arisen against scientific advance. Today's academics economists, psychologists, philosophers, and others in the social sciences stand in the way of a science of human behavior just as clerics attempted to block the Copernican revolution in the 1600s. A scientific approach to social science would test hypotheses against the evidence rather than find and use evidence only to affirm a particular theory, as is often the practice in today's social sciences. Drawing lessons from Galileo's conflict with the Catholic church and current debates over the teaching of \\"creation science,\\" McIntyre argues that what we need most to establish a science of human behavior is the scientific attitude the willingness to hear what the evidence tells us even if it clashes with religious or political pieties and the resolve to apply our findings to the creation of a better society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=koJWw1r5l2MC&dq=Darc+Ages&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christ our penal substitute","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UnYwAAAAYAAJ&dq=Christ+our+penal+substitute&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Judy","description":"For the past thirty years Judy Pfaff's challenging and imaginative installations have set the pace during a dynamic and changing period in contemporary art.

Minette Ginoux, a young Arlesienne, befriends him when he arrives during a February snowstorm and quickly becomes his confidant. The friendship deepens, but dark clouds threaten this arcadia as Minette discovers Vincents secret moods and habits which shock and repel. The arrival of Paul Gauguin precipitates a string of disasters affecting them both when conflicts erupt between the two men. Set in a land of idyllic natural beauty, the novel describes the art of van Gogh at its most compelling and reveals a young girls deepest feelings for the artist. Aunt Titi, sister Colette, handsome Etienne Martin who is seeking a wife, the townspeople of Arles, mingle in a rich and suspense- filled drama celebrating the struggles of a gifted yet tormented painter. READING GROUP GUIDE for Seeking the High Yellow Note, Vincent Van Gogh in Provence 1. Seeking the High Yellow Note is a novel about the artist Vincent Van Gogh told by Minette Ginoux, a young girl living in Arles with whom he shares a friendship. Set in Provence, during his most productive artistic period, the novel describes the setting and his works in rich detail. Discuss some of the reasons why Van Gogh flourished as a painter in this setting. 2. Through Van Goghs interaction with Minette and the people around him, the personality of the artist is revealed. Vincent tells Minette of his previous failed attempts to succeed in a relationship with women. (See p. 51). Why do you think he was successful in forming a friendship with Minette? 3. It becomes quickly apparent to the reader how dependent Vincent became on the support of his brother Theo, both financially and emotionally. Would you describe such a close bond with a sibling usual or unusual within the bonds of family? Why? Do you think Vincent could have painted as he did without his brothers support? 4. The arrival of Paul Gauguin is fully described in the book (p. 81). What did Gauguin contribute to Van Gogh in furthering his painting? What responsibility does he bear for Vincents decline and illness? Discuss differences in painting techniques of the two artists. 5. Follow the development of the friendship between Minette and Etienne Martin, the young joiner from Nimes. At what point does she give up the possibility of Vincent as a suitor? (See p. 75). Vincent painted The Girl with Coffee Tinted Skin (Minette) and The Young Frenchman of Modern Times (Etienne). Discuss the friendship of Vincent and Etienne. 6. When Vincent speaks of The High Yellow Note in his painting, what does he mean? (p. 126). 7. The book is meant to give a picture of life in Provence in the late 1800s. What was your feeling about farm life as described by Minette on the Martin mas, or farm? Minette and her sister Colette worked as waitresses in the cafe of their Aunt Titi in the town of Arles. How was their life different from that of young girls today? 8. In 1889 Vincent voluntarily entered the asylum at Saint Remy, hoping to receive treatment for his illness. Minette paid one visit to him during this time (p. 175). How would you describe the asylum and the treatment Vincent received there? What caused Vincents illness? Several possibilities have been mentioned, but no conclusions drawn (p.183). 9. Vincent Van Gogh sold only one painting during his lifetime, The Red Vineyard, now in the Pushkin Museum, Moscow. (See p. 99). What do you think was the reason for this? Why did sales of his paintings begin so soon after his death? What was the effect of his death on Minette and Etienne? On Theo Van Gogh?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8wPFi8oZttkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alaska (From Sea to Shining Sea, Second)","description":"Drawing on anthropology and ethnohistory as well as the  new military history  Indian Wars of Mexico, Canada and the United States, 1812-1900 interprets and compares the way Indians and European Americans waged wars in Canada, Mexico, the USA and Yucat n during the nineteenth century. Fully illustrated with sixteen maps, detailing key Indian settlements and crucial battles, Bruce Vandervort rescues the New World Indian Wars from their exclusion from mainstream military history, and reveals how they are an integral part of global history. Indian Wars of Mexico, Canada and the United States: * provides a thorough examination of the strategies and tactics of resistance employed by Indian peoples of the USA which contrasts practices of warfare with the M tis (the French Canadian-Indian peoples), their Canadian-Indian allies, and the Yaqui and Mayan Indians of Mexico and Yucat n * presents a comparison of the experience of Indian tribes with concurrent resistance movements against European expansion in Africa, exposing how aspects of resistance that seem unique to the New World differ from those with broader implications * draws upon concepts used in recent rewritings of the history of imperial warfare in Africa and Asia, Vandervort also analyzes the conduct of the US Army in comparison with military practices and tactics adopted by colonialist conquests worldwide. This unique and fascinating study is a vital contribution to the study of military history but is also a valuable addition to the understanding of colonialism and attempts to resist it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=H-SAAgAAQBAJ&dq=Alaska+(From+Sea+to+Shining+Sea,+Second)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dinarzad's Children: An Anthology of Contemporary Arab American FictionAn Anthology of Contemporary Arab American Fiction","description":"In het christelijk deel van het door burgeroorlog verscheurde Beiroet maken twee bevriende jongemannen een verschillende keuze ten aanzien van vluchten of meevechten.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_GZPXwAACAAJ&dq=Dinarzad%27s+Children:+An+Anthology+of+Contemporary+Arab+American+FictionAn+Anthology+of+Contemporary+Arab+American+Fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peoples, languages, and religion in northern Ghana: A preliminary report","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5nIUAAAACAAJ&dq=Peoples,+languages,+and+religion+in+northern+Ghana:+A+preliminary+report&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Genetics: A Conceptual Approach","description":"With Genetics: A Conceptual Approach, Ben Pierce brings a master teacher s experiences to the introductory genetics textbook, clarifying this complex subject by focusing on the big picture of genetics concepts and how those concepts connect to one another.

The romance between the sailor prince and the young princess brought a splash of colour to a nation still in the grip of post-war austerity. When they married in Westminster Abbey in November 1947, there were 3000 guests, including six kings and seven queens. Within five years, as Queen Elizabeth II, she would ascend to the throne and later be crowned in front of millions watching through the new medium of television. Throughout her record-breaking reign, she relied on the formidable partnership she had made with her consort. Now, after 70 years of their marriage, acclaimed royal biographer Ingrid Seward sheds new light on their relationship and its impact on their family and on the nation. In My Husband and I, we discover the challenges faced by Prince Philip as he has had to learn to play second fiddle to the Queen in all their public engagements, but we also get a revealing insight into how their relationship operates behind closed doors. As the years have gone by, there have been rumours of marital troubles, fierce debates over how to bring up their children, and they have had to deal with family traumas - from scandalous divorces to shocking deaths - in the full glare of the public eye. But somehow, their relationship has endured and provided a model of constancy to inspire all around them. This book is not only a vivid portrait of a hugely important marriage, it is a celebration of the power of love.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3NUNtAEACAAJ&dq=The+Queen+And+I&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women and Children First: A Provocative Look at Modern Canadian Women at Work and at Home","description":"A provocative look at modern Canadian women at work and at home.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=O1Bw6gpTsysC&dq=Women+and+Children+First:+A+Provocative+Look+at+Modern+Canadian+Women+at+Work+and+at+Home&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Miss Van Sketchbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=eSUFAAAACAAJ&dq=Miss+Van+Sketchbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hydrogeology of the surficial aquifer system, Dade County, Florida (SuDoc I 19.42/4:90-4108)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Stovold's Mornington Crescent Almanac 2002","description":"As certain as the changing of the seasons, as predictable as the thud of boots on bruised shins giving way to the hearty crack of willow against trouser, as sure as 'eggs is eggs' is ungrammatical, the arrival of STOVALD'S ALMANAC heralds the eagerly awaited halfway point of the playing season.

And without their disappearance, good intentions notwithstanding, nonaboriginal Canadian writers will continue to portray Native characters as part of a dead and dying culture.

Such an account is inspired by Paul's lyrical claims in Philippians 2:6-11 that Christ Jesus, though God in nature, 'emptied himself' or 'made himself nothing' by becoming human. The biblical support for such a view can be found throughout the four gospels and the book of Hebrews, as well as in other places. A kenotic account takes seriously the possibility that Christ, in becoming incarnate, temporarily divested himself of such properties as omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence. Several of the contributors argue that this view is fully orthodox, and that it has great strengths in giving us a picture of a God who is willing to become completely vulnerable for the sake of human beings, and one that is completely consistent with the very human portrait of Jesus in the New Testament. The proponents of kenotic Christology argue that the philosophical accounts of God's nature that have led to rejection of this theory ought themselves to be subjected to criticism in light of the biblical data. Some essays test the theory by raising critical questions and arguing that traditional accounts of the incarnation can achieve the goals of kenotic theories as well as kenotic theories can. The book also explores the implications of a kenotic view of the incarnation for philosophical theology in general and the doctrine of the Trinity in particular, and it concludes with essays that examine the validity of the ideal of kenosis for women, and a challenge to traditional Christology to take a kenotic theory seriously.

Shaw s Cleopatra is a kittenish girl with a streak of cruelty, while his Caesar is a world-weary philosopher-soldier who is as much a stranger in Rome as in the barbaric court of Egypt. With wit, irony, and an undertone of melancholy, Caesar and Cleopatra satirizes Shakespeare s use of history and comments wryly on the politics of Shaw s own time. This is the definitive text prepared under the editorial supervision of Dan H. Laurence. The volume includes Shaw s preface of 1900.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WpseAQAAIAAJ&dq=Caesar+and+Cleopatra,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"IEC 61131-3 Programming Methodology: Software Engineering Methods for Industrial Automated Systems","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NVliPQAACAAJ&dq=IEC+61131-3+Programming+Methodology:+Software+Engineering+Methods+for+Industrial+Automated+Systems&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Steel Ghosts","description":"Sent to Pennsylvania to revitalize a long-abandoned steel mill, Tom Kruvener plans to bring new industry to his old hometown, only to discover that the dead control the old factory and his well-intentioned efforts are about to unleash the forces of evil on an unsuspecting town.

He stands for values not often found in world politics - courtesy, good taste, intelligence, decency, and, above all, responsibility. But who is this man, and how did he come to think and believe as he does, what formed him, how did he come to play such a pivotal role in his country? For the first time, in this personal and often touching portrait, Eda Kriseova, a longtime colleague and confidante, tells Havel's life story in its entirety. Havel was born and raised in the spirit of the first Czech Republic, the era between the two world wars that was a period of growth, both as a sophisticated economy and a democracy in which many political philosophies flourished. One grandfather was a diplomat with a visionary plan for Central European cooperation. The other was an urban developer pivotal in building Prague into a modern world capital. Because of his upbringing, Havel was never swayed by communism - he was a political renegade from the very beginning. Kriseova describes Havel's political baptism, when he addressed a congress of the writers union in the early sixties and attacked their values, his career as a playwright, and, after the Prague Spring is crushed in 1968 by Soviet tanks and his writing is banned, his emergence as a dissident. His role in Charter 77, the years in prison, the years out of prison but under house arrest, constantly harassed, are an eye opening look at what it was like in Czechoslovakia under communism. The days of the Velvet Revolution and those that led to it are depicted vividly - we share in the euphoria Czechoslovakia felt as it became a free country again. Kriseova has told Havel's story with the help of his family and closest friends. Their contributions, especially those of film director Milos Forman and the actor Pavel Landovsky, help create a portrait that is at the same time flattering and rings with honesty.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hVrNxQEACAAJ&dq=Vaclav+Havel:+The+Authorized+Biography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bounty Hunter (The Deadliest Profession #1)","description":"Imagine yourself parachuting from a plane straight into a raging forest fire, or racing against the clock to disarm a ticking bomb while enemy forces lurk around you.

The natives were entirely indifferent whether they worked or not, but by paying high wages and giving any quantity of mutton, we were able at this time to get a certain amount of precarious labour for digging and camp work. The whole lot, including my maid-servant, went in for every week-end to the village, and it was always a matter of anxiety to know whether they would ever return. -from Chapter XII Western anthropology's first in-depth look at an isolated culture is also a daring adventure story of around-the-world travel. In February 1913, archaeologist Katherine Routledge set sail on a custom-built yacht-with a small crew and the support of British Association for the Advancement of Science, the British Museum, and the Royal Geographical Society-for Easter Island, where she embarked up the first effort to catalogue the island's mysterious statues, interview the natives, and document their culture, folklore, and traditions. Her scholarship is impeccable-this 1919 work is still considered foundational-but her lively writing and her practical perspective make this a delightful read that thrill armchair travelers and amateur ethnographers alike. British archaeologist KATHERINE ROUTLEDGE (1866-1935) studied at Oxford University.

What she found was an extended family riven by the seismic changes in Chinese society and a village turned inside out by emigration, neglect, and environmental despoliation. Combining family memoir, literary observation, and social commentary, Liang s by turns lyrically poetic and movingly raw investigation into the fate of her village became a bestselling book in China and brought her fame. For many months, Liang walked the roads and fields of her village, recording the stories of her relatives especially her irascible, unforgettable father and talking to everyone from high government officials to the lowest of village outcasts. Across China, many saw in Liang s riveting interviews with family members and childhood acquaintances a mirror of their own lives, and her observations about the way the greatest rural-to-urban migration of modern times has twisted the country resonated deeply.

But this compelling volume puts the spotlight on five strong and intellectually gifted women who, because of their absolute and unconditional commitment to the advancement of Protestant Christianity, paid the cost of their reforming convictions with martyrdom, imprisonment, and exile. Anne Boleyn (1507-1536) introduced the Reformation to England, and Katharine Parr (1514-1548) saved it. Both women were riveted by early versions of the \\"justification by faith\\" doctrine that originated with Martin Luther and came to them through France. As a result, Anne Boleyn was beheaded. Katharine Parr narrowly avoided the same fate. Sixteen-year-old Jane Grey (1537-1554) and Anne Askew (1521-1546) both dared to criticize the Mass and were pioneers of Protestant views concerning superstition and symbols. Jane Grey was executed because of her Protestantism. Anne Askew was tortured and burned at the stake. Catherine Willoughby (1520-1580) anticipated later Puritan teachings on predestination and election and on the reformation of the church. She was forced to give up everything she had and to flee with her husband and nursing baby into exile. Paul Zahl vividly tells the stories of these five mothers of the English Reformation. All of these women were powerful theologians intensely interested in the religious concerns of their day. All but Anne Boleyn left behind a considerable body of written work - some of which is found in this book's appendices. It is the theological aspect of these women's remarkable achievements that Zahl seeks to underscore. Moreover, he also considers what the stories of these women have to say about the relation of gender to theology, human motivation, and God. An important epilogue by Mary Zahl contributes a contemporary woman's view of these fascinating historical figures. Extraordinary by any standard, Anne Boleyn, Anne Askew, Katharine Parr, Jane Grey, and Catherine Willoughby remain rich subjects for reflection and emulation hundreds of years later. The personalities of these five women, who spoke their Christian convictions with presence of mind and sharp intelligence within situations of life-and-death duress, are almost totemic in our enduring search for role models.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1zQKcL9l-fsC&dq=Five+Women+of+the+English+Reformation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Into the Dragon's Lair (Dungeons & Dragons: Forgotten Realms Adventure)","description":"The Red Dragon's Lair, the fantasy adventure...

Using census, regional, and local data, and in-depth interviews with the residents of Gary, Sandra L. Barnes argues that many people incur costs resulting from the dual dilemma of being poor and residing in a poor urban area. She explores how factors such as race/ethnicity, neighborhood type, and location influence residents  views, coping strategies, and unconventional approaches toward making ends meet. Well written and accessible, this study of Gary s poor urban neighborhoods offers broad findings that apply to other similarly impoverished Rust Belt cities. Sandra L.

In fact, LSTs weren't given the honor of a name at all, they would only be known by their hull number. Mosier's Raiders is the story of one of these ships, the USS LST-325, a veteran of the invasions of Sicily, Salerno and Normandy. Drawn from extensive interviews with the men who served aboard her, Mosier's Raiders is not just the story of a ship; it is about a group of strangers coming together as a team, and the bond of brotherhood that carried them through the worst war had to offer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gTxT8bd5oyMC&dq=Mosier%27s+Raiders:+The+Story+of+LST-325&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Repairing Antique Clocks: A Guide for Amateurs","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=J9dqNgAACAAJ&dq=Repairing+Antique+Clocks:+A+Guide+for+Amateurs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Big Book of Home Learning : Getting Started: Introduces All Major Home School Methods & Answers Your Most Frequently Asked Questions","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=96YHerC3jcgC&dq=The+Big+Book+of+Home+Learning+:+Getting+Started:+Introduces+All+Major+Home+School+Methods&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ip Man - Portrait of a Kung Fu Master","description":"\\"From stories shared by his son, this book paints a portrait of the famous Wing Chun Grand Master, Ip Man, providing a set of fifteen principles as a guide to mastery.\\"--Back cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vojCzgEACAAJ&dq=Ip+Man+-+Portrait+of+a+Kung+Fu+Master&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guerra y Paz","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=8m__jgEACAAJ&dq=Guerra+y+Paz&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blessed Kateri Takakwitha: Mohawk Maiden","description":"This is the inspiring story of Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha, a holy young Indian woman who was converted to Christianity by French missionaries during the 1600s.

Second, professional services are highly personalised, involving the skills of individuals. Such firms must therefore compete not only for clients but also for talented professionals. Drawing on more than ten years of research and consulting to these unique and creative companies, David Maister explores issues ranging from marketing and business development to multinational strategies, human resources policies to profit improvement, strategic planning to effective leadership. While these issues can be complex, Maister simplifies them by recognising that 'every professional service firm in the world, regardless of size, specific profession, or country of operation, has the same mission statement: outstanding service to clients, satisfying careers for its people and financial success for its owners.'","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2VpMK-uoJVMC&dq=Managing+the+Professional+Service+Firm&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond Chaos: The Underlying Theory Behind Life, the Universe, and Everything","description":"We are surrounded by order that-until now-physics has been unable to explain. The spread of veins in the back of our hands mirrors the spread of branches on a tree; fern fronds bear a resemblance to the outline of fjords; the best-loved classical music echoes the patterns of our heartbeats. The theory of Universality is using fractal patterns to explain much of the world around us. Could it be that the same laws that govern systems in their critical states also govern some of the most unpredictable events such as earthquakes, avalanches, the growth of cities and stock market crashes-even the way businesses are run and the way fashions come and go? Is there a common principle, a universal affinity that binds us to the forces of nature? A consensus is emerging on how complex structures grow and sustain themselves; phenomena that were once thought to be unique now appear to have a great deal in common. Mark Ward examines these theories, explores how they fit into an age-long quest to discover how the universe works, delves into their possible limitations and asks what we can do with this new knowledge. While identifying patterns does not mean that we can always predict what will happen next, some of the trends scientists are noticing prove that life is not a series of random events.

In 1964 Advent brought out The Issue at Hand, a collection of Atheling's critical essays on stories in the science-fiction magazines.Now we present a new volume which concentrates on science-fiction books. As before, Atheling's rapier skewers literary malefactors of many kinds, including some well-known authors whose great popularity is all the more puzzling because there seems to be so little reason for it.To be sure, Atheling does not stint praise where it is due--see especially the chapters on Budrys and Sturgeon--but it is in the nature of criticism that the sins and errors be dealt with in greatest detail. As Atheling puts it:\\"There is no such thing as destructive criticism. That is just a cliche people use to signal that their toes have been stepped on. After all, the whole point of telling a man he is doing something the wrong way is the hope that next time he will do it right.\\"Simply saying that a given book is bad may serve the secondary function of warning the public away from it, if the public trusts the critic. But if you do not go on to say in what way it is bad, your verdict is not destructive criticism, or any other kind of criticism; it is just abuse.\\"A good critic is positively obliged to be harsh toward bad work. By a good critic, I mean a man with a good ear, a love his field at its best, and a broad and detailed knowledge of the techniques of that field. The technical critic (not, please, the scientific or technological one), should be able to say with some precision not only that something went wrong--if it did--but just how it went wrong.\\"In writing, as in any other art, there is a medium to be worked in, and there are both adroit and clumsy ways to work with it. The writer should know the difference between what is adroit and what is clumsy. If he does not, it is the function of the technical critic to show it to him. Technical critics are, or should be, invaluable to the writer who is serious about the lifelong task of learning his craft.\\"Such a critic is also useful to the reader. Here his work usually takes the form of explication du texte: he uses special knowledge to unearth and expose some element in the work of art which the ordinary reader probably did not know was there.\\"Advent has also published More Issues at Hand, and The Tale that Wags the God, further collections of Blish's critical essays.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cfuozgEACAAJ&dq=More+Issues+at+Hand:+Critical+Studies+in+Contemporary+Science+Fiction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A summary of abundance and density estimates for selected lake trout populations in the Alaska Range, and an examination of trends in yield (Fishery manuscript)","description":"Report estimating abundance and density of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) from seven lakes (Paxson, Sevenmile, Twobit, Glacier, Tangle Lakes, and Butte) in central Alaska, south of Fairbanks.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NsPAtgAACAAJ&dq=A+summary+of+abundance+and+density+estimates+for+selected+lake+trout+populations+in+the+Alaska+Range,+and+an+examination+of+trends+in+yield+(Fishery+manuscript)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Astrologik: The Oracular Art of Astrology","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cOzGoQEACAAJ&dq=Astrologik:+The+Oracular+Art+of+Astrology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Let's Play Jazz...and More!

For lack of knowledge of the DNA double helix, scientists were unable to understand the genetic roots of cancer, and subsequently they were unable to develop effective methods of treatment. In the early 1950s, scientists were on the verge of discovering the DNA double helix and unveiling cancer as a genetic disease. Stumped by the uncertainty regarding the shape of the DNA bases, the structural and functional \\"soul\\" of DNA, the male-dominated scientific establishment - from James Watson and Francis Crick to Linus Pauling - proposed models of DNA that were, in effect, inside out. In contrast, a woman, Sister Miriam Michael Stimson, OP, an Adrian Dominican sister and chemist, dared to imagine a solution to the DNA base problem. Using potassium bromide (KBr) to prepare the DNA bases for analysis by infrared spectroscopy, Sister Miriam Michael successfully developed a chemical method that affirmed the structure of the DNA bases and of the double helix itself. The Soul of DNA recounts, for the first time, the role of Sister Miriam Michael Stimson, OP, in the discovery of the DNA double helix","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6qhYvgAACAAJ&dq=The+Soul+of+DNA&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hidden Beauty of Everyday Life","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=c_EwTZT2IPoC&dq=The+Hidden+Beauty+of+Everyday+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Turks Today","description":"Eighty years have passed since Mustafa Kemal Ataturk founded the Turkish Republic out of the ruins of the Ottoman Empire and set it on the path of modernisation.

It is an open country which attracts millions of tourists, thousands of foreign businessmen and hundreds of researchers. They enjoy Turkish hospitality and experience its rich landscape and history, but many find it hard to form an overall picture of the country. In this sequel to his acclaimed biography of Ataturk, Andrew Mango provides such an overall portrait, tracing the republic's development since the death of its founder and bringing to life the Turkish people and their vibrant society.

First, we must notice the place from which this Sermon was preached. \\"As in other things, so in this, our Lord Jesus was but ill-accommodated: He had no convenient place to preach in, any more than to lay His head on.

Enamoured of British institutions, Continental Europeans turned to the imported masonic lodges and found in them a new forum that was constitutionally constructed and logically egalitarian. Originating in the Middle Ages, when stone-masons joined together to preserve their professional secrets and to protect their wages, the English and Scottish lodges had by the eighteenth century discarded their guild origins and become an international phenomenon that gave men and eventually some women a place to vote, speak, discuss and debate. Margaret Jacob argues that the hundreds of masonic lodges founded in eighteenth-century Europe were among the most important enclaves in which modern civil society was formed. In France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Britain men and women freemasons sought to create a moral and social order based upon reason and virtue, and dedicated to the principles of liberty and equality. A forum where philosophers met with men of commerce, government, and the professions, the masonic lodge created new forms of self-government in microcosm, complete with constitutions and laws, elections, and representatives. This is the first comprehensive history of Enlightenment freemasonry, from the roots of the society's political philosophy and evolution in seventeenth-century England and Scotland to the French Revolution. Based on never-before-used archival sources, it will appeal to anyone interested in the birth of modernity in Europe or in the cultural milieu of the European Enlightenment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=w9y1pF-Na3UC&dq=Living+the+Enlightenment:+Freemasonry+and+Politics+in+Eighteenth-Century+Europe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"FULFILLED PROPHECIES THAT PROVE THE BIBLE","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=nqIuPYAzrUAC&dq=FULFILLED+PROPHECIES+THAT+PROVE+THE+BIBLE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Skeletal Radiology","description":"Trusted by thousands of radiology residents, students, and clinicians, the \\"pink book\\" continues to be the perfect first book for essential, easily accessible information in skeletal imaging.

The Complete Civil War collects every article written about the war from 1861 to 1865, plus select pieces before and after the war and is filled with the action, politics, and personal stories of this monumental event. From the first shot fired at Fort Sumter to the surrender at Appomattox, and from the Battle of Antietam to the Battle of Atlanta, as well as articles on slavery, states rights, the role of women, and profiles of noted heroes such as Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee, the era comes alive through these daily first-hand accounts. More than 600 of the most crucial and interesting articles in the book? Typeset and designed for easy reading Commentary by Editors and Civil War scholars Harold Holzer and Craig Symonds More than 104,000 additional articles on the DVD-ROM? every article the Times published during the war.

Symonds and Holzer have found an ingenious new way to experience the most dramatic event in our nation's history.\\" -- Doris Kearns Goodwin \\"Harold Holzer and Craig Symonds have included not only every pertinent article from the pages of The Times, but enhanced and illuminated them with editorial commentary that adds context and perspective, making the articles more informative and useful here than they were in the original issues.

Now Ellie is plunged into a complex and emotionally devastating legal war for custody of her children against a vindictive man bent, not merely on winning, but on her complete destruction.

However, when Ellie learns of what her young daughter has endured at the hands of her own father, in spite of the odds, Ellie knows there can only be one outcome....she has to save her children.

Tolkien schreef op drie?ntwintigjarige leeftijd nu voor het eerst in Nederlandse vertaling Het verhaal van Kullervo gaat over een gedoemde jongen. Kullervo, zoon van Kalervo, is een ongelukkige weesjongen met bovennatuurlijke krachten en een tragisch lot en is misschien wel het meest duistere en tragische personage dat Tolkien ooit heeft geschapen. Kullervo is grootgebracht in de hoeve van de duistere magi?r Untamo, die zijn vader vermoordde, zijn moeder ontvoerde en hem drie keer probeert te doden. Kullervo overleeft door de liefde van zijn tweelingzus Wanona en wordt beschermd door de magische krachten van de zwarte hond Musti. Wanneer Kullervo als slaaf wordt verkocht, zweert hij wraak op de tovenaar. Het verhaal van Kullervo was volgens Tolkien  de kiem  van zijn  pogingen om zelf legenden te schrijven . Dit bijzondere boek wordt nu voor het eerst in Nederlandse vertaling gepubliceerd, en bevat naast notities van de auteur ook Tolkiens lezingen over de Kalevala, het Finse epos dat als basis diende voor een deel van zijn werk.

They become personal and invaluable, and what's more they are free gifts - there for the taking' Simon Armitage Two years ago former Poet Laureate Andrew Motion had the idea of setting up Poetry by Heart - a nationwide annual competition for secondary schools which asked contestants to learn two or three poems and be judged on their recitations, first at school level, then regional, then in a national final held at London's National Portrait Gallery. It's proved a huge success, with hundreds of schools participating in the first year, and numbers up by 20% in the second. Coinciding with the start of the third year of competition, and published on National Poetry Day whose theme coincidentally in 2014 is Recitation, this Poetry by Heart anthology brings together the pool of poems - 200 altogether - from which contestants make their choices. Specially picked by Motion and his three co-editors, these poems make up a treasure house - of almost-unknown poems and familiar poems from the mainstream; love poems and war poems; funny poems and heartbroken poems; poems that recreate the world we know and poems written on the dark side of the moon. And all chosen with a view to their being recited out loud. From William Wordsworth to Wilfred Owen, Emily Bront? to Elizabeth Bishop this wonderfully enjoyable anthology will be enjoyed by all ages and includes the best poets from the past to the present day. In a groundbreaking feature, the book includes QR codes which allow readers to use their mobile phones to listen to recordings of the poems - many of them specially recorded by the poets themselves. Sir Andrew Motion was Poet Laureate from 1999 till 2009, and is Professor of Creative Writing at Royal Holloway College, London. Jean Sprackland'sTilt won the Costa Poetry award in 2008.

This volume combines both skills as it is a collection of his homilies on all the important themes of the spiritual and moral life, and on his favorite saints, men and women of history who were \\"inflamed with the love of Christ\\". In his always descriptive, profound and witty style, Knox covers a very wide variety of pastoral themes for Christian living and growth in spiritual perfection. Themes such as \\"The Fatherhood of God\\", \\"The Sermon on the Mount\\", \\"The Gifts of God\\", \\"The Triumph of Suffering\\", \\"The Divine Sacrifice\\", and dozens more. In his \\"occasional\\" sermons on saints and Christian heroes, he shows how these heroes of history struggled with many of the same spiritual battles that modern believers encounter daily, and overcame them with faith, courage, character and virtue. These are the shining witnesses of the truth and charity we all seek to emulate.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1pHfpalXVUwC&dq=Pastoral+and+Occasional+Sermons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strengthening Parents & Families During the Early Childhood Years","description":"This book provides early childhood educators with perspectives and tools that will enable them to strengthen parents and families during the child's earliest year of development. The 25 chapters are divided into 6 parts or themes. Part one focuses on understanding families as learners from an ecological and empathetic perspective, with the premise that families can be sources of strength for adults and children when they are supported and nurtured. Part two examines the process of relating to the special needs of families from a supportive, yet realistic, framework. This section describes a proactive approach to developing positive and equitable relations with families experiencing special needs. Part three, on parenting and the family learning process, emphasizes the critical role that parents play in the development of healthy families. Focusing on parent education and family support, part four examines ways that early childhood professionals can provide educational and related support resources for parents and families. Part five addresses the important topic of communicating with parents and families, discussing the attributes of effective communication and the processes involved in using these attributes. Finally, part six pulls together the various aspects of supporting parents and families into a workable plan of action. The theme of involving parents and families is used to articulate the essential concepts and practices for achieving success in the development of family involvement programs.

Perhaps its most striking feature is the pope's endorsement of capitalism, properly understood, as the economic system most compatible with human freedom and most efficient in meeting human needs. Notable as well were his comments on the fall of Communist regimes in 1989 and the role of the workers' movement in that struggle. A condensation of Centesimus Annus, accompanied by the pope's own public comments on it, starts off this stimulating collection. Twenty-three essays follow, by Catholics and non-Catholics, Americans and Europeans, political theorists, theologians, social scientists, lawyers, and journalists. They show a wide variety of reactions--positive and negative--to John Paul's vision of a new worldly order.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=T-RJmVzM434C&dq=A+New+Worldly+Order:+John+Paul+II+and+Human+Freedom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essentials of the Faith: A Guide to the Catechism of the Catholic Church","description":"Father McBride's eloquent style reveals the essence of the Catechism in a way is sure to inspire a desire to know the teachings of the Faith more completely and to live them more fully.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tAGbgxK2N9gC&dq=Essentials+of+the+Faith:+A+Guide+to+the+Catechism+of+the+Catholic+Church&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simple Blessings: 14 Quilts to Grace Your Home","description":"Wrap up in, cuddle in, and snuggle under--enjoy the best of what quilts bring!

Each failure to create societies of abundance or give birth to  the New Man  inspired more searching for the path to the promised land: revolution, communes, social democracy, communism, fascism, Arab socialism, African socialism. None worked, and some exacted a staggering human toll. Then, after two centuries of wishful thinking and bitter disappointment, socialism imploded in a fin de si cle drama of falling walls and collapsing regimes. It was an astonishing denouement but what followed was no less astonishing. After the hiatus of a couple of decades, new voices were raised, as if innocent of all that had come before, proposing to try it all over again. Joshua Muravchik traces the pursuit of this phantasm, presenting sketches of the thinkers and leaders who developed the theory, led it to power, and presided over its collapse, as well as those who are trying to revive it today. Heaven on Earth is a story filled with character and event while at the same time giving us an epic chronicle of a movement that tried to turn the world upside down and for a time succeeded.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a65qDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The True Story of Alice B. Toklas: A Study of Three Autobiographies","description":"In this original and intriguing study, Anna Linzie examines three mid-twentieth-century texts never before treated as interrelated in a book-length work of literary criticism: Gertrude Stein's The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas (1933) and Alice B. Toklas's The Alice B. Toklas Cook Book (1954) and What Is Remembered (1963). Taking these three texts as intertexts or as an assemblage of the true story of Alice B. Toklas, Linzie challenges assumptions about primary authorship and singular identity that have continued to limit lesbian and feminist rereadings of autobiography as a genre and of Stein and Toklas as writers and historical figures.The True Story of Alice B. Toklas explores how the concept of autobiography as a primarily referential genre is challenged and transformed in relation to autobiographical texts written about the same person, the same life, but differently, by different writers, at different points in time. The concept of one true story is deconstructed in the process as Linzie modifies Homi K. Bhabha's  almost the same but not quite/not white  for the purposes of this particular study as  almost the same but not quite/not straight.  The investigation moves simultaneously on the planes of textuality and sexuality in order to provisionally articulate a  lesbian autobiographical subject  in Linzie's reading of these three texts.Linzie's study fills a gap in literary criticism where Stein's companion and her work have been more or less neglected, conceptualizing the Stein-Toklas sexual/textual relationship as fundamentally reciprocal. The True Story of Alice B. Toklas provides a new critical perspective on Toklas as indispensable to Stein's literary production, a cultural laborer in her own right, and a writer of her own books. Making a significant contribution to recent lesbian/feminist reconceptualizations of the genre of autobiography, this study will fascinate Stein and Toklas scholars as well as those interested in queer and autobiography studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XGqCcEtct2oC&dq=The+True+Story+of+Alice+B.+Toklas:+A+Study+of+Three+Autobiographies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bible and Healing: A Medical and Theological Commentary","description":"Physician and theologian John Wilkinson looks at the question of healing and health, examining both Old and New Testament teaching and experience, as well as the history of healing in the church from apostolic to modern times.p","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rzUSAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Bible+and+Healing:+A+Medical+and+Theological+Commentary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mouse, the Cat, and Grandmother's Hat, The","description":"This is Grandmother's hat.

This is Stark's engrossing memoir of the end of a long tradition of young men going to sea in the Great Age of Sail, and the final rounding by a commercial sailing ship of fearsome Cape Horn -- the veritable Mount Everest of sailing. Stark vividly chronicles the Pamir's journey through the world's stormiest seas as he worked brutal four-hour watches on decks awash with the huge swells of the Southern Ocean, and scrambled up ice-coated rigging to manhandle sails on masts that were up to twenty stories high. Stark experienced the shipboard life of the seventeenth century in 1949 on a vessel longer than a football field. Contrasting the romance and realities of life on the sea, and poignantly evoking the passionate love affair he left behind, Stark wrote a thrilling narrative that brings closure to the era of Cape Horn merchant sailors that began more than three centuries before.

Author Jim Anderson, a runabout renovator from Minnesota's Land of Ten Thousand Lakes, leads readers through the whole renovation process. For those who think a project like this may be more than they can handle, renovating an old runabout is actually less complicated and expensive than adding on a deck or redoing a room--two of the most popular projects for home handymen. And Anderson's sense of humor and gift for providing simple solutions make Runabout Renovation as fun to read as it is easy to understand. The backyards of North America house literally millions of rundown runabouts ripe for renovation. With Jim Anderson's help, you can own a better boat than you can buy new, for a quarter of the price or less. And like a beautifully restored '57 Chevy, it'll have class. Low-cost alternatives for the powerboater on a budget. Although more people own boats ranging in length from 14 to 24 feet than all others combined, most books published about boat repair and restoration are directed at the \\"big boat\\" or yacht owner. In addition, many marine dealers and technicians never seem to have the right answers or the time to spend on people who own \\"little boats.\\" Hence Runabout Renovation, a complete guide to finding and fixing up old fiberglass speedboats. You'll learn how to: Choose and survey a boat Make cosmetic repairs and repaint your boat Replace the floor Reupholster and carpet the interior Build a new transom Upgrade electrical and mechanical systems . . . and much more. There's even a section on repairing aluminum boats, and one on installing and repairing horns, lights, bilge pumps, live wells, and other speedboat accessories. \\"Considering the tens of thousands of fiberglass powerboats that exist today, one wonders why Jim Anderson's Runabout Renovation is so late in coming. Whether you're shopping for a used or new boat, or trying to maintain the value of a boat you already own, this book will prove indispensable.\\"--Richard Lebowitz, Editor, Boating World","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=J82NuXDkCKQC&dq=Runabout+Renovation:+How+to+Find+and+Fix+Up+an+Old+Fiberglass+Speedboat&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The little gingerbread man,","description":"RUN, RUN as fast as you can.

The first comprehensive account of the epoch-making Six-Day War, from the author of Ally now featuring a fiftieth-anniversary retrospective Though it lasted for only six tense days in June, the 1967 Arab-Israeli war never really ended. Every crisis that has ripped through this region in the ensuing decades, from the Yom Kippur War of 1973 to the ongoing intifada, is a direct consequence of those six days of fighting. Writing with a novelist s command of narrative and a historian s grasp of fact and motive, Michael B. Oren reconstructs both the lightning-fast action on the battlefields and the political shocks that electrified the world. Extraordinary personalities Moshe Dayan and Gamal Abdul Nasser, Lyndon Johnson and Alexei Kosygin rose and toppled from power as a result of this war; borders were redrawn; daring strategies brilliantly succeeded or disastrously failed in a matter of hours. And the balance of power changed in the Middle East and in the world. A towering work of history and an enthralling human narrative, Six Days of War is the most important book on the Middle East conflict to appear in a generation. Praise for Six Days of War  Powerful . . . A highly readable, even gripping account of the 1967 conflict . . . [Oren] has woven a seamless narrative out of a staggering variety of diplomatic and military strands.  The New York Times  With a remarkably assured style, Oren elucidates nearly every aspect of the conflict. . . . Oren s [book] will remain the authoritative chronicle of the war. His achievement as a writer and a historian is awesome.  The Atlantic Monthly  This is not only the best book so far written on the six-day war, it is likely to remain the best.  The Washington Post Book World  Phenomenal . . . breathtaking history . . . a profoundly talented writer. . . . This book is not only one of the best books on this critical episode in Middle East history; it s one of the best-written books I ve read this year, in any genre.  The Jerusalem Post  [In] Michael Oren s richly detailed and lucid account, the familiar story is thrilling once again. . . . What makes this book important is the breadth and depth of the research.  The New York Times Book Review  A first-rate new account of the conflict.  The Washington Post  The definitive history of the Six-Day War . . . [Oren s] narrative is precise but written with great literary flair. In no one else s study is there more understanding or more surprise.

These men and women used a Cosmic Force which is in the universe and which anyone may use, when he once learns how to focus this higher power within his own mind. There are stupendous miracles such as healing the sick; causing the blind to see; making the crippled walk, but these are not the only miracles with which we are concerned in this Metaphysical study. There are the little, every-day miracles, which you may begin to perform immediately that relate to your health, to your work, to increasing your income, to finding happiness in love and marriage and to healing your mind of confusion, discord, and unhappiness, so that you may find inner peace and security. You will learn in this study that you too may become a miracle-worker; that you may wave the mental wand of Faith and create out of the substance of your thoughts and inner dreams the concrete things that you desire in your life. You may tap the power of this higher Cosmic Mind and create magnificent works, even as did the geniuses of the past who used this Miracle-working power. Beethoven used this higher mind within to create beautiful music, even though he was deaf; Edison tapped this power of the higher Cosmic Mind within and created over three hundred inventions, from the motion picture camera to the electric light bulb, which bless our lives today. Edison used the power which we shall study together, and there is no reason why YOU may not achieve greatness through this self-same Metaphysical power. Lincoln was a miracle-worker, and although a martyr, like Gandhi and John F. Kennedy, he brought the miracle of unity and greatness to a strife ridden nation. J.P. Morgan was a financier and industrialist, but he used the Metaphysical Miracle power which we shall study together to build one of the great financial empires of all time. This miracle power is not dead today; it is still being used by men like Paul G. Getty and Howard Hughes, Ford and Rockefeller to create wealth that not only benefits the ones who create it, but also blesses the world through the public libraries they endow, the research foundations they create and the artistic gifts and treasures which they give to our great art galleries and museums. The Miracles of Lourdes are well known, and I have stood in the sacred Grotto and I have seen the discarded crutches, wheel chairs and braces that the sick have left there when their miracles of healing came and they walked away healed by a miracle power that worked for them, but which does not seem to work for others. The spectacular miracles that the Master Metaphysician Jesus performed, and which we see at places like Lourdes, are not the only evidences that this Metaphysical Miracle Power exists and may be tapped by ordinary mortals; there are other evidences in our own age that this power is alive today and may be used to heal millions of still unborn persons and to save the lives of hundreds of millions today. Salk used this higher Miracle Power to develop his vaccine for polio; Fleming developed penicillin through this higher intuitive mind; Mme. and M. Curie discovered radium by listening to the inner Cosmic Voice that guided them; and Pasteur certainly was a miracle-worker unequalled in history for the perception that caused him to perfect the use of vaccines in the treatment and prevention of disease.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lcxwEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Big Book of Home Learning : Preschool and Elementary (vol. 2)","description":"Preschool and elementary, volume 2.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pu9yT07GHcAC&dq=The+Big+Book+of+Home+Learning+:+Preschool+and+Elementary+(vol.+2)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Incubus (Puffin Teenage Books)","description":"Voices in my head.

Over the course of seven months in 1988, eleven women disappeared off the streets of New Bedford, Massachusetts, a gloomy, drug-addled coastal town that was once the whaling capital of the world. Nine turned up dead. Two were never found. And the perpetrator remains unknown to this day. How could such a thing happen? How, in what was once one of America s richest cities, could the authorities let their most vulnerable citizens down this badly? As Carlton Smith, a Pulitzer Prize finalist for his coverage of the Green River Killer case, demonstrates in this riveting account, it was the inability of police officers and politicians alike to set aside their personal agendas that let a psychopath off the hook. In Killing Season, Smith takes readers into a close-knit community of working-class men and women, an underworld of prostitution and drug abuse, and the halls of New England law enforcement to tell the story of an epic failure of justice.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IUswDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Never Preach Past Noon: A Leigh Koslow Mystery (Leigh Koslow Mysteries) (Volume 3)","description":"Tenth in the USA-Today bestselling Leigh Koslow mystery series Frances Koslow was ecstatic to have her humble abode chosen as stop #3 on the Holiday House Tour.

She continues the narrative in her own humorous, poetic voice, describing a victim's relentless search for success, love, and acceptance -- while combating bureaucratic red tape, aphasia, bilateral hand impairment, and loss of memory. Readers will:Learn why TBI is a \\"silent illness\\"? for students as well as soldiers and athletes.Discover coping strategies which enable TBI survivors to hope and achieve.Experience what it's like to be a caregiver for someone with TBI.Realize that the majority of teachers are sadly unprepared to teach victims of TBI.Find out how relearning ordinary tasks, like walking, writing, and driving require intense determination. \\"This peek into the real-life trials and triumphs of a young woman who survives a horrific car crash and struggles to regain academic excellence and meaningful social relationships is a worthwhile read for anyone who needs information, inspiration or escape from the isolation so common after traumatic brain injury.\\" -- Susan H. Connors, President/CEO, Brain Injury Association of America \\"Kelly Bouldin Darmofal's account is unique, yet widely applicable: she teaches any who have suffered TBI and all who love, care for, and teach them--insights that are not only novel but revolutionary. The book is not simply worth reading; it is necessary reading for patients, poets, professors, preachers, and teachers.\\" -- Dr. Frank Balch Wood, Professor Emeritus of Neurology-Neuropsychology, Wake Forest School of Medicine Learn more at www.ImLostInMyMind.com From the Reflections of America Series at Modern History Press www.ModernHistoryPress.com","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a3htBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alana's 12-Step Guide to Fun Golf","description":"Provides step-by-step on how kids can make the most of a day at the golf course.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qAxUAAAACAAJ&dq=Alana%27s+12-Step+Guide+to+Fun+Golf&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ferroelectric crystals (International series of monographs on solid state physics)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TKEsAAAAYAAJ&dq=Ferroelectric+crystals+(International+series+of+monographs+on+solid+state+physics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"So Dear To Wicked Men","description":"So Dear to Wicked Men is a debut mystery novel introducing Nick and Julia Lambros, who trade in their aprons for detective gear when a customer is poisoned in their restaurant.

In his analysis, Burke highlights the different, discursive strategies, broadly identified as liberal and communitarian, used by the Supreme Court to justify the outcomes of various cases, and he argues that no particular strategy of justification is inherently politically conservative or liberal and that no conception of political representation is unassailable. Therefore, it is unlikely that the Supreme Court will articulate a stable measure of fair representation. The Supreme Court offers one more forum in the deliberation over what is fair representation; however, it is not likely to provide minority communities with a legal answer to the problem of political underrepresentation. As such, this book tells the uncertain story of the creation of political fairness by the Supreme Court. The language used to characterize what is fair and representative, and the theoretical designs which the rhetoric reflects, allows us to formulate concepts of fair representation as legal standards evolve. By placing the debate over fair representation in not only political and legal but also philosophical terms, we are better able to understand the inevitable tensions that drive the concept of representation into new, ill-defined, and contentious areas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QgpsWB4hISEC&dq=The+Appearance+of+Equality:+Racial+Gerrymandering,+Redistricting,+and+the+Supreme+Court+(Contributions+in+Legal+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strip Search: Revealing Today's Best College Cartoonists","description":"Strip Search is one of the favorite spots on the UExpress website.

Beginning with Abraham's reception of the three visitors and his intercession before Yahweh on behalf of Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 18) and continuing through the end of the Joseph story (Gen. 50), the overarching theme of Hamilton's commentary is Yahweh's faithfulness to his promised word and his covenant commitments to those whom he has chosen to receive that promised word. Special features of this commentary include its serious attention to important matters of biblical translation from the Hebrew language into English, copious footnotes that direct readers to further and more extensive sources of information, and frequent references to the New Testament writers' reading of Genesis.

Escaping the cold, frantic world of New York public relations, Paul Higgins moves his family to rustic, undeveloped southwest Florida, where peace and quiet are assured. That is, until a celebrated author moves into the neighborhood and Higgins devises \\"the hard unsell,\\" a series of ingenious and hilarious public relations efforts to discourage people from moving to Flat City and to scare off tourists, investors, and developers in the process. Keasler's 1958 novel is remarkable both for its humor and for its early portrayal of the dilemma of Florida growth, a theme later explored in depth by John D. MacDonald and elevated to satirical heights in Carl Hiaasen's Tourist Season. Between the land boom and the explosive growth beginning in the sixties, Keasler captured in the figure of Paul Higgins the aspirations of millions who seek Florida as an escape and the fanatical opposition to development of those other millions who have already arrived and desperately want to close the door behind them. Novelist and journalist John Keasler wrote nearly 7,000 humor columns during his 30-year career at the old Miami News, and he also covered the major historical events of the time, including Kennedy's assassination and Neil Armstrong's trip to the moon.

Reading with Oprah explores the club's revolutionary fusion of books, television, and commerce and tells the engaging and in-depth story of the OBC phenomenon. Kathleen Rooney combines extensive research with a dynamic voice to reveal the club's far-reaching cultural impact and its role as crucible for the clash between \\"high\\" and \\"low\\" literary taste. Comprehensive and up-to-date, the book covers the club from its inception in 1996, through the Jonathan Franzen contretemps, the surprising suspension in 2002, and, after the club's return in 2003, the progression from \\"great books\\" to memoir. New material includes an extensive look at the James Frey scandal and Oprah's turn to contemporary fiction, including The Road and Middlesex. Through close examination of Winfrey's picks and personal interviews with book club authors and readers, Rooney demonstrates how the club that Barbara Kingsolver calls \\"one of the best possible uses of a television set\\" has, according to Wally Lamb, \\"gotten people of all ages to read, to read more, and to read widely.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=k6dGEAAAQBAJ&dq=Reading+with+Oprah:+The+Book+Club+that+Changed+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Down by the Station (Classic Books with Holes)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YLjnzAEACAAJ&dq=Down+by+the+Station+(Classic+Books+with+Holes)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Eve of the French Revolution","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=j9NnAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Revelation: A Message of Hope for the New Millennium","description":"The interfaith movement, which began with the 1893 World?s Parliament of Religions in Chicago, has grown worldwide. Although this movement has been largely unknown to the public, it now provides a spiritual face for globalization, the economic and political forces leading us all from nationalism to ?One World?. The most ambitious organization in today?s interfaith movement is the United Religions Initiative (URI), founded by William Swing, the Episcopal Bishop of California. Investigative reporter Lee Penn, a Catholic ex-Marxist, exhaustively documents the history and beliefs of the URI and its New Age and globalist allies, the vested interests that support these movements, and the direction they appear to be taking. The interfaith movement is no longer merely the province of a coterie of little-heeded religious idealists with grandiose visions. The URI?s proponents have ranged from billionaire George Soros to President George W. Bush, from the far-right Rev. Sun Myung Moon to the liberal Catholic theologian Hans K ng, and from the Dalai Lama to the leaders of government-approved Protestant churches in the People?s Republic of China. The interfaith movement, including the URI, is being promoted by globalist and New Age reformers who favor erosion of national sovereignty, marginalization of traditional religions, establishment of ?global governance?, and creation of a new, Earth-based ?global spirituality??in effect, a one-world religion. Therefore, the URI and the interfaith movement are poised to become the spiritual foundation of the New World Order: the ?new civilization? now proposed by Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union. In The Reign of Quantity and the Signs of the Times, French metaphysician Ren  Gu non spoke of the ?anti-tradition? (the forces of materialism and secular humanism) finally giving way to the ?counter-tradition? (the satanic inversion of true spirituality), leading to the regime of Antichrist. The ?anti-tradition? weakens and dissolves traditional spiritualities, after which the ?counter-tradition? sets up a counterfeit in their place. Since Gu non?s time, as is well known, anti-traditional forces have greatly advanced worldwide. It is less well-known that counter-traditional movements have also made great strides, and now stand closer to the centers of global political and religious power than ever before. The ?counter-tradition? is making inroads on the political and cultural Right, as much as it is doing on the Left. False Dawn painstakingly documents these trends, and speculates on their future development. In so doing, the author takes investigative reporting to the threshold of prophecy, and gives us a stunningly plausible picture of the global religious landscape of the 21st century. This extraordinary project is the literary equivalent of turning over a flat rock.

Such courses are taught in various disciplines, e. g. , civil engineering, chemical engineering, reservoir engineering, agricultural engineering and soil science. In these disciplines, problems are encountered in which various extensive quantities, e. g. , mass and heat, are transported through a porous material domain. Often the porous material contains several fluid phases, and the various extensive quantities are transported simultaneously throughout the multiphase system. In all these disciplines, management decisions related to a system's development and its operation have to be made. To do so, the 'manager', or the planner, needs a tool that will enable him to forecast the response of the system to the implementation of proposed management schemes. This forecast takes the form of spatial and temporal distributions of variables that describe the future state of the considered system. Pressure, stress, strain, density, velocity, solute concentration, temperature, etc. , for each phase in the system, and sometime for a component of a phase, may serve as examples of state variables. The tool that enables the required predictions is the model. A model may be defined as a simplified version of the real (porous medium) system that approximately simulates the excitation-response relations of the latter.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eZ7sCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cryptozoic!","description":"In the year 2093, human consciousness has expanded to the point that man can visit the past using a technique called 'mind-travelling'.

Widely considered the first female presidential chief of staff, Marguerite  Missy  LeHand was the right-hand woman to Franklin Delano Roosevelt both personally and professionally for more than twenty years. Although her official title as personal secretary was relatively humble, her power and influence were unparalleled. Everyone in the White House knew one truth: If you wanted access to Franklin, you had to get through Missy. She was one of his most trusted advisors, affording her a unique perspective on the president that no one else could claim, and she was deeply admired and respected by Eleanor and the Roosevelt children. With unprecedented access to Missy s family and original source materials, journalist Kathryn Smith tells the captivating and forgotten story of the intelligent, loyal, and clever woman who had a front-row seat to history in the making. The Gatekeeper is a thoughtful, revealing unsung-hero story about a woman ahead of her time, the true weight of her responsibility, and the tumultuous era in which she lived and a long overdue tribute to one of the most important female figures in American history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PY7tDAAAQBAJ&dq=Gatekeeper&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Envoy to New Worlds (Jaime Retief Series #1)","description":"This reference tracks the development of speculative fiction influenced by the advancement of science and the idea of progress from the eighteenth century to the present day.

In a New Orleans supermarket parking lot in the fall of 1984 ,two disparate lives become inextricably bound for the next fourteen years. The first, the life of Delores Dye, a white housewife and grandmother. The second, a young black man with a gun in hand. Moments following their maybe not so chance encounter, Mrs. Dye lay dead on the sunbaked macadam, and the killer had made off with her purse, her groceries, and her car. Four days later, following a tip, authorities arrested a known drug dealer and father of five named Curtis Kyles. Kyles would then be tried for Mrs. Dye's murder an unprecedented five times, though he maintained his innocence throughout each trial. Convicted and sentenced to death in his second trial, he would spend fourteen years on death row. After a fifth jury was unable to reach a verdict, New Orleans Parish District Attorney Harry Connick, Sr., finally conceded defeat and dropped the murder charge. But the case slowly yielded a deeper drama: The crime turned out to have been the side effect of an intricately plotted act of revenge. That police and prosecutors may have been complicit in the vengeance that framed Kyles cuts to the heart of a system of justice for Southern blacks in the era since lynch mobs were shamed into obsolescence. A compellingly written legal drama that has at its heart passionate intrigue and justice gone awry.

'He wrote for the day, the moment; but these are just the writers whom posterity is apt to put into its pocket.' Considered by contemporary critics to be Trollope's greatest novel, The Way We Live Now is a satire of the literary world of London in the 1870s and a bold indictment of the new power of speculative finance in English life. 'I was instigated by what I conceived to be the commercial profligacy of the age,' Trollope said. His story concerns Augustus Melmotte, a French swindler and scoundrel, and his daughter, to whom Felix Carbury, adored son of the authoress Lady Carbury, is induced to propose marriage for the sake of securing a fortune. Trollope knew well the difficulties of dealing with editors, publishers, reviewers, and the public; his portrait of Lady Carbury, impetuous, unprincipled, and unswervingly devoted to her own self-promotion, is one of his finest satirical achievements. His picture of late-nineteenth-century England is a portrait of a society on the verge of moral bankruptcy. In The Way We Live Now Trollope combines his talents as a portraitist and his skills as a storyteller to give us life as it was lived more than a hundred years ago.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WveaCk4onIEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bizans'ta kayp zaman: Baska bir Istanbul'un oykuleri (An roman) (Turkish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cYHC85dWm5IC&dq=Bizans%27ta+kayp+zaman:+Baska+bir+Istanbul%27un+oykuleri+(An+roman)+(Turkish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maris","description":"In combiantie met zijn twee schilderende broers is Willem Maris herhaadelijk onderwerp geweest van tentoonstellignen en publicaties.

So when, much to my dismay and perplexity, my child began to display chronic problem behaviors I blamed myself. To make matters worse, the counselors we sought out for help blamed me also! As I searched for answers during this difficult time, however, I discovered many things about myself, my son, human nature and God that profoundly changed my views on parenting and religion. My discoveries also led to a better understanding of God's unconditional love and enabled me to give this most precious of all gifts to my first born child.

Among the Founders who brought the fledgling government into being were those who sought to establish order through the reconstruction of racial and gender hierarchies. In this effort they enlisted  the fair sex, &#; white women. Politicians, ministers, writers, husbands, fathers and brothers entreated Anglo-American women to assume responsibility for the nation's virtue. Thus, although disfranchised, they served an important national function, that of civilizing non-citizen. They were encouraged to consider themselves the moral and intellectual superiors to non-whites, unruly men, and children. These white women were empowered by race and ethnicity, and class, but limited by gender. And in seeking to maintain their advantages, they helped perpetuate the system of racial domination by refusing to support the liberation of others from literal slavery. Schloesser examines the lives and writings of three female political intellectuals ;Mercy Otis Warren, Abigail Smith Adams, and Judith Sargent Murray ;each of whom was acutely aware of their tenuous position in the founding era of the republic. Carefully negotiating the gender and racial hierarchies of the nation, they at varying times asserted their rights and demurred to male governance. In their public and private actions they represented the paradigm of racial patriarchy at its most complex and its most conflicted.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=aAcVCgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Babysitter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quit Your Job Often and Get Big Raises!","description":"A real world practical guide to dramatically increase your wages, as told by an average working stiff who quit four jobs in five years and tripled his pay!

But in this inspirational and practical memoir, Paula Penn-Nabrit shares her intimate experiences of home-schooling her three sons, Charles, Damon, and Evan. Paula and her husband, C. Madison, decided to home-school their children after racial incidents at public and private schools led them to the conclusion that the traditional educational system would be damaging to their sons  self-esteem. This decision was especially poignant for the Nabrit family because C. Madison s uncle was the famed civil rights attorney James Nabrit, who, with Thurgood Marshall, had argued Brown v. Board of Education before the U.S. Supreme Court; to other members of their family, it seemed as if Paula and C. Madison were turning their backs on a rich educational legacy. But ultimately, Paula and C. Madison felt that they knew what was best for their sons. So in 1991 when Evan was nine and twins Charles and Damon were eleven the children were withdrawn from the exclusive country day school they d been attending. In Morning by Morning, Paula Penn-Nabrit discusses her family s emotional transition to home schooling and shares the nuts and bolts of the boys  educational experience. She explains how she and her husband developed a curriculum, provided adequate exposure to the arts as well as quiet time for reflection and meditation, initiated quality opportunities for volunteerism, and sought out athletic activities for their sons. At the end of each chapter, she offers advice on how readers can incorporate some of the steps her family took even if they aren t able to home-school; plus, there s a website resource guide at the end of the book. Charles and Damon were eventually admitted to Princeton, and Evan attended Amherst College. But Morning by Morning is frank about the challenges the boys faced in their transition from home schooling to the college experience, and Penn-Nabrit reflects on some things she might have done differently. With great warmth and perception, Paula Penn-Nabrit discusses her personal experience and the amazing outcome of her home-schooling experience: three spiritually and intellectually well balanced sons who attended some of the top educational institutions in this country. What we learned from home schooling: -Use your time wisely. -Education is more than academics. -The idea of parent as teacher doesn t have to end at kindergarten. -The family is our introduction to community. -Extended family is a safety net. -Yes, kids really do better in environments designed for them. -Travel is an education. -Athletics is more than competitive sports. -Get used to diversity. -It s okay if your kids get angry at you they ll get over it! -from Morning by Morning From the Hardcover edition.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uPqibuNwL3MC&dq=Morning+by+Morning:+How+We+Home-Schooled+Our+African-American+Sons+to+the+Ivy+League&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Der Fuehrer: Hitler's Rise to Power","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_lUTAQAAMAAJ&dq=Der+Fuehrer:+Hitler%27s+Rise+to+Power&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Getting into a Residency: A Guide for Medical Students","description":"Completely updated, the 9th edition will continue to be vital to medical students by providing a step-by-step guide through the process of selecting a medical specialty and obtaining a residency position.

Fortunately his Dogmatics in Outline first published in English in 1949, contains in brilliantly concentrated form even in shorthand, the essential tenets of his thinking. Built around the assertions made in the Apostles Creed the book consists of a series of reflections on the foundation stones of Christian doctrine. Because Dogmatics in Outline derives from very particular circumstances namely the lectures Barth gave in war-shattered Germany in 1946, it has an urgency and a compassion which lend the text a powerful simplicity. Despite its brevity the book makes a tremendous impact, which in this new edition will now be felt by a fresh generation of readers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jWSmDwAAQBAJ&dq=Dogmatics+in+Outline&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Just For Fun: The Story of AAU Women's Basketball","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=R0rCTsqz18oC&dq=Just+For+Fun:+The+Story+of+AAU+Women%27s+Basketball&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Three harbours","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BxEEAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Just Dessert","description":"Project Just Desserts is a story about a small boy, who always begged his parents to allow him to eat only desserts and sweets at mealtime.

Each chapter radically dissents from one or more mainstream opinions about deviance. The first chapter examines the alleged causes for the decline of American poolrooms and finds them wanting, traces the rise and fall of poolrooms to historical changes in America's social structure, and cogently dissects the recent poolroom revival. The second chapter, reports a field study of a deviant occupation, pool hustling, describing the hustler's work situation and career from recruitment to retirement. In revealing how pool hustlers, although dedicated wholly to a vocation that merely breaks unenforced gambling laws, frequently supplement their income by means of outright felonies, the author develops a new theory of \\"crime as moonlighting.\\" The third chapter sharply criticizes our criminology textbooks for avoiding the study of uncaught adult criminals in their natural environments. It demonstrates such research to be both necessary and practical with career felons as well as moonlighters. The author describes field techniques he has used with career felons, offers new findings gleaned by means of these techniques, and answers moral objections to such research. The forth chapter presents the first genuinely empirical study of the beat delinquent sub-culture, in which the author corrects some journalistic views such as that most beats are exhibitionists and some sociological ones such as that \\"retreatist\\" drug-users can meet neither legitimate nor criminal success norms. The final chapter, on the sociology of pornography, holds that the courts are wrong to claim that naturalistic erotic art is non-pornographic, and wronger still to claim that hard-core pornography is, in Mr. Justice Brennan's words, \\"utterly without redeeming social importance.\\" The author's unusual blend of","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Jx4uDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Body Scan: Managing Pain, Illness, & Stress with Guided Mindfulness Meditation","description":"After two serious spinal injuries, Vidyamala Burch found herself facing the loneliness of disability and chronic pain with few skills or resources to turn to.

Kaplan buigt zich in zestien scherpe en weldoordachte artikelen over de buitenlandse politiek van de Verenigde Staten in de laatste twintig jaar. Hij onderzoekt de rol van de VS in de globale politiek en door welke tijdloze principes en factoren deze gevormd dient te worden. Centraal staat het artikel waar het boek mee opent en waar het zijn naam aan ontleent:  De terugkeer van de wereld van Marco Polo , over de geopolitieke situatie in Eurazi? en het Amerikaanse militaire antwoord hierop. Op basis van zijn jarenlange ervaring als buitenlandcorrespondent voor onder andere The Atlantic schetst Kaplan een uiterst helder en gedetailleerd beeld van een wereld die steeds instabieler lijkt te worden en de manier waarop de VS zich daaraan dient aan te passen. Hij maakt zich sterk voor de tijdloze beginselen en eigenschappen die Amerika's rol in de wereld zouden moeten bepalen, zoals erkenning dat de westerse democratie niet voor iedereen zaligmakend is, besef van het verschil tussen Amerikaanse belangen en Amerikaanse waardes, bewustzijn van de psychologische belasting van oorlog en het belang van een sterke vloot. Robert D. Kaplan schreef vijftien boeken over buitenlandse politiek en reizen, waaronder De verovering van de Rockies en Duister Europa, waarvan wereldwijd vertalingen zijn verschenen. Van 2009 tot 2011 maakte Kaplan deel uit van het Defense Policy Board van het Pentagon, onder leiding van minister van Defensie Robert Gates. In 2011 gaf Foreign Affairs hem een plaats in de  Top 100 Global Thinkers .  Robert D. Kaplan is de best in the business.

Just how childlike golf players become is proven by their frequent inability to count past five.' As an earnest golfer for over forty years, John Updike wrote frequently about the game. In Golf Dreams, Updike directs his inimitable style, his humour and shrewd insights towards a sport that, in turns, enthralled and infuriated him. This gathering of his pieces covers everything from the peculiar charms of bad golf and the satisfactions of an essentially losing struggle to the camaraderie of good golf and its own attendant perils. Praise for Golf Dreams: 'John Updike has anatomized the greatness of golf with an eloquence only Wodehouse, in a lighter vein, has matched. It makes for a lyrical book which is also thought-provoking . . . his lowest handicap was 18, but, in this delightful book, he has not dropped a stroke' Max Davidson, Daily Telegraph 'A stylish celebration of golf's propensity to transmogrify perfectly normal people into gibbering wrecks; not just 28-handicap novices but superstars, too' Jeff Randall, Sunday Times 'There's a crafty pastiche of golf coaching manuals . . . and there's a delicious rumination on the dazzling green luxury of televised golf. There are high, arching flights of fancy concerning swing thoughts, the moral aspects of golf, the etiquette of the gimme . . . It is a treat both for Updike fans and for golf nuts' Robert Winder, Independent on Sunday John Updike's first novel, The Poorhouse Fair, was published in 1959. Other novels by Updike include, Marry Me, The Witches of Eastwick, the Rabbit series and Villages. He has also written a number of volumes of short stories such as My Father's Tears and Other Stories and a poetry collection entitled Endpoint and Other Poems. His criticism, essays and other non fiction appeared in magazines such as The New Yorker and The New York Review of Books. He died in January 2009.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FnQFKtXD5g0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sin","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GctKAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Aesthetic Understanding","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ko1tQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Aesthetic+Understanding&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Murder Most Puzzling: A Literary Mystery","description":"When professor of poetry Dr. Margaret Jameson, a.k.a.

How are national identities forged from countries made up of peoples with different and often conflicting cultures, languages, and histories? How successful is this process? What is lost and gained from the emergence of national identities? Natividad Guti?rrez examines the development of the modern Mexican state to address these difficult questions. She describes how Mexican national identity has been and is being created and evaluates the effectiveness of that process of state-building. Her investigation is distinguished by a critical consideration of cross-cultural theories of nationalism and the illuminating use of a broad range of data from Mexican culture and history, including interviews with contemporary indigenous intellectuals and students, an analysis of public-school textbooks, and information gathered from indigenous organizations. Guti?rrez argues that the modern Mexican state is buttressed by pervasive nationalist myths of foundation, descent, and heroism. These myths expressed and reinforced through the manipulation of symbols, public education, and political discourse downplay separate ethnic identities and work together to articulate an overriding nationalist ideology. The ideology girding the Mexican state has not been entirely successful, however. This study reveals that indigenous intellectuals and students are troubled by the relationship between their nationalist and ethnic identities and are increasingly questioning official policies of integration.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HinRCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cut and Assemble Victorian Houses","description":"Printed in full color on heavy cardboard stock 4 authentic Victorian houses in H-O scale: Italian-style villa, Octagon, Second Empire, Stick Style.

It was fitting that Miranda Heath s first glimpse of the forbidding home at Bascomb s Point was in the fury of a thunderstorm. Despite her late father s caution to steer clear of his friend Obadiah Bascomb s New England mansion, Miranda, destitute as she was, had no choice but to accept the old captain s charitable request. Besides, her father and Obadiah s adventurous past was as much a part of her heritage as their legendary ship, the Sea Jade. But it s beyond Miranda s imaginings when she finds herself swept up in an impetuous marriage with a friend of the Bascomb family, a virtual stranger to her. More victim than bride, and at the mercy of her imposing new mother-in-law as well as Obadiah s mysterious wife and a threatening housekeeper, Miranda fears the invitation to the isolated house was more a matter of revenge than rescue. She has no way of knowing that buried in her own past is the key to a tragic mystery that s been left to her to solve if she s to make it out of Bascomb s Point alive.

B. Yeats's  An Irish Airman Foresees His Death,  each of us is challenged to  balance with this life, this death.  As we share a common fate, we also share loss and sorrow. At their most mournful, with praise and love and raw emotion, poets throughout time have put their grief to paper. The elegy and its inherent drama---the inevitable struggle between love and death---are showcased in The Sorrow Psalms, a collection of twentieth-century elegies edited by poet Lynn Strongin. Divided into five thematic sections, the elegies convey the impact of death and its aftermath; focus on the loss of family, lovers, and dear friends; contend with the loss of a child; deal with violent death; and seek to look beyond death to find some kind of resolution. The traditional stages of grieving---denial, anger, depression, and acceptance---are evident, either singly in the expression of one profound emotion or all at once, in these elegies. Strongin's introduction on the origins of the elegy and its evolution through the twentieth century explains what elegy has been and what it can be.  There is a river of sorrows that flows, which our creative spirits have mapped,  she writes. As they evoke and exalt the dead and give expression to the deepest emotions, the resonant elegies collected here offer comfort to those who personally or collectively grieve the passing of loved ones.

It also enables the student to focus on the formulation of the problem (e. g. the appropriate governing equations and boundary conditions) rather than on the algebraic manipulations, with a consequent improvement in insight into the subject and in motivation. During the past 10 years I have developed files in Maple and Mathematica to facilitate this p- cess, notably electronic versions of the Tables in the present Chapters 19 and 20 and of the recurrence relations for generating spherical harmonics. One purpose of this new edition is to make this electronic material available to the reader through the Kluwer website www. elasticity. org. I hope that readers will make use of this resource and report back to me any aspects of the electronic material that could benefit from improvement or extension. Some hints about the use of this material are contained in Appendix A. Those who have never used Maple or Mathematica will find that it takes only a few hours of trial and error to learn how to write programs to solve boundary value problems in elasticity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q3nTBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Responsive Therapy: A Systematic Approach To Counseling Skills","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JM99AAAAMAAJ&dq=Responsive+Therapy:+A+Systematic+Approach+To+Counseling+Skills&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Palomino","description":"Samantha Taylor is shattered when her husband leaves her for another woman.

Joe Kapp; Super Bowl Quarterback and CFL Hall of Fame Inductee THE ULTIMATE GAME puts the sport of professional football in a futuristic setting and tells a tale of what technology could one day allow. Its a positive, exciting thrill-ride for all ages. Its a frightening and intriguing look at how the game could be manipulated. Dan Pastorini; Pro Bowl Quarterback I cheer Kevin (Bakko) for writing a fast moving, fun, futuristic novel that thoroughly entertained me. And he found no need to load the book with the smut that has been filling most sports books to date. Phil Villapiano; Super Bowl Champion Linebacker If John Grisham and Issac Asimov got together to write a novel about pro football this is what they would write. You have to read it to believe it! Jeff Nixon; Former Player, and Editor / Natl Advocacy Committee Member of Fourth and Goal Assists Kevin Bakko does a great job of conveying the spirit of the players and their drive to be the World Champions of NFL football.

Now comes their quest for an unprecedented third consecutive trip to the championship game. Yet accomplishing this extraordinary feat will not be left to either dutiful preparation or divine providence. A glory-driven head coach (Walt Griffin) and a narcissistic neuroscientist in need of human guinea pigs (Dr. John McLane) have combined forces to reach the final phase of their respective lifes ambition. But murder, mayhem, and the pursuit of answers to gut-wrenching questions are driving veteran All-Pro quarterback Rod Mackenna to make sense of the resulting toll that has been taken by his team, his teammates, and his long but no longer unrequited love interest. On the day of the Super Bowl with the final piece to an unimaginable puzzle firmly in his grasp Griffin and McLane catch Mac within the confines of the clandestine command center used by their band of former gridiron heroes to control the active players, on-the-field, like a macabre video game. Only the threat of harm to his (now) fiance keeps Mac on the sideline with a bogus injury as the final contest of the season kicks off.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MXglrdweSvQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lost and Found (Bluford High Series #1)","description":"After a mysterious stranger starts following her and a threatening note is left on her desk at Bluford High School, Darcy Wills must race against time to save her missing sister.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2GclNDZ8WmEC&dq=Lost+and+Found+(Bluford+High+Series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women Against Women: American Anti-Suffragism, 1880-1920 (Scholarship in Women's History, 4)","description":"This study reinterprets a crucial period (1870s-1920s) in the history of women's rights, focusing attention on a core contradiction at the heart of early feminist theory. At a time when white elites were concerned with imperialist projects and civilizing missions, progressive white women developed an explicit racial ideology to promote their cause, defending patriarchy for \\"primitives\\" while calling for its elimination among the \\"civilized.\\" By exploring how progressive white women at the turn of the century laid the intellectual groundwork for the feminist social movements that followed, Louise Michele Newman speaks directly to contemporary debates about the effect of race on current feminist scholarship. \\"White Women's Rights is an important book. It is a fascinating and informative account of the numerous and complex ties which bound feminist thought to the practices and ideas which shaped and gave meaning to America as a racialized society. A compelling read, it moves very gracefully between the general history of the feminist movement and the particular histories of individual women.\\"--Hazel Carby, Yale University","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TH2k5C1fiokC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Light Plane Maintenance Library Volume Six Basic and Advanced Light Plane Maintenance Rules and Inspections","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1X1vnQVvcw8C&dq=The+Light+Plane+Maintenance+Library+Volume+Six+Basic+and+Advanced+Light+Plane+Maintenance+Rules+and+Inspections&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Norton Reader: An Anthology of Expository Prose, Tenth Shorter Edition","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3jwhAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Woodall's Eastern Campground Directory, 2002","description":"This guide includes the same features as the North American edition, but lists RV parks and campgrounds, RV service centers and tourist attractions in all states east of the Mississippi; plus Arkansas, Iowa, Louisiana, Minnesota, and Missouri--31 eastern states in all plus eastern Canada.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4Z4NAAAACAAJ&dq=Woodall%27s+Eastern+Campground+Directory,+2002&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Golden Virgin (Pocket Classics)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VOro0sfUCikC&dq=The+Golden+Virgin+(Pocket+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baby Hugs A Very First Touch and Feel Book (Touch and Feel (Priddy Books))","description":"This board book introduces babies to words and pictures through quality fabric and paper novelty elements to heighten the learning experience and increase sensory awareness.

There would have been wars, but no religious wars. There would have been moral codes, but no Commandments. Had the Jews been polytheists, they would today be only another barely remembered people, less important, but just as extinct as the Babylonians. Had Christians presented Jesus to the Greco-Roman world as ''another'' God, their faith would long since have gone the way of Mithraism. And surely Islam would never have made it out of the desert had Muhammad not removed Allah from the context of Arab paganism and proclaimed him as the only God. The three great monotheisms changed everything. With his customary clarity and vigor, Rodney Stark explains how and why monotheism has such immense power both to unite and to divide. Why and how did Jews, Christians, and Muslims missionize, and when and why did their efforts falter? Why did both Christianity and Islam suddenly become less tolerant of Jews late in the eleventh century, prompting outbursts of mass murder? Why were the Jewish massacres by Christians concentrated in the cities along the Rhine River, and why did the pogroms by Muslims take place mainly in Granada? How could the Jews persist so long as a minority faith, able to withstand intense pressures to convert? Why did they sometimes assimilate? In the final chapter, Stark also examines the American experience to show that it is possible for committed monotheists to sustain norms of civility toward one another. A sweeping social history of religion, One True God shows how the great monotheisms shaped the past and created the modern world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pf1ZDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Brew: Ingredients, Methods, Recipes, and Equipment for Brewing Beer at Home","description":"Fully revised and expanded, How to Brew is the definitive guide to making quality beers at home.

Praise of Folly, written to amuse his friend Sir Thomas More, is Erasmus's best-known work. Its dazzling mixture of fantasy and satire is narrated by a personification of Folly, dressed as a jester, who celebrates youth, pleasure, drunkenness and sexual desire, and goes on to lambast human pretensions, foibles and frailties, to mock theologians and monks and to praise the 'folly' of simple Christian piety. Erasmus's wit, wordplay and wisdom made the book an instant success, but it also attracted what may have been sales-boosting criticism.

Steck develops a comprehensive, Catholic theology of animals based on an in-depth exploration of Catholicism's fundamental doctrines trinitarian theology, Christology, pneumatology, eschatology, and soteriology. All God's Animals makes two central claims. First, we can hope that God will include animals of the present age in the kingdom inaugurated by Christ. Second, because of this inclusion, our responses to animals should be guided by the values of the kingdom. As Christians await the final liberation of all creation, they are to be witnesses to God s kingdom by embodying its ideals in their relations with animal life. Because the kingdom's fullness is yet to come and because our world remains marked by the wounds of sin, however, Christian treatment of animals will at times require acts that are at odds with the kingdom s ideals (for example, those causing suffering and death). Steck examines each of these ideas and explores all of their complexities.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NNi0DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"LIFE: The War in Iraq","description":"Discusses the events that led the United States to war in Iraq and Afghanistan, examines military life and the effects of the war, and looks at the children who work to support their families and attend school whenever they can.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ruR8uQAACAAJ&dq=LIFE:+The+War+in+Iraq&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gcse Maths: Level C","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=q6uiOQAACAAJ&dq=Gcse+Maths:+Level+C&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Should Health Screening Be Private?

H. Lawrence and Virginia Woolf's critiques of the social order and longings for change. Looking at various social spaces from homes to nations to utopian space brought into the here and now the book shows the ways in which these writers criticize and deconstruct the contemporary symbolic, physical, and discursive spatial topoi of the dominant socio-spatial order and envision a more liberating and inclusive human geography. In addition, the book calls for the need to redress the tendency of some spatial theories to underestimate the political potential of literary discourse about space, instead of simply and mechanically appropriating some theoretical concepts to literary criticism. One of the central findings in the book, therefore, is that literary texts can perform subversive interventions in the production of social space through their critical interaction with dominant spatial codes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nfFXAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lottie Deno","description":"?One of the most mysterious of the petticoat dealers that roamed the Old West was the voluptuous Lottie Deno.

Former allies Adams and Jefferson, president versus vice president, Federalist versus Republican, squared off in a vicious contest that resulted in broken friendships, scandals, riots, slander, and jailings in the fourth presidential election under the Constitution. The election of 1800 (not unlike that of 2000) was a tumultuous one, replete with an attempt to steal the victory from a controversial winner; deadlocked parties hell-bent on success; and a nation divided. Thomas Jefferson vs. John Adams one of the most slanderous campaigns in the history of the nation. Added to that were backroom connivings and threatened riots serious enough to badly bend a young and shaky electoral system. The election ended in a tie between the Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidates. After 7 straight days of voting in the Congress, Jefferson finally became president. America Afire is a timely tale that not only enlightens and entertains, but reassures us of the continuity and durability of our institutions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YXU3KFC9lOcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Josepha : A Prairie Boy's Story","description":"Josepha, an immigrant boy, leaves school to begin working and says good-bye to his best friend.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kVH9N4rNDt4C&dq=Josepha+:+A+Prairie+Boy%27s+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Galton Case","description":"Twenty years ago, Anthony Galton vanished, along with his streetwise bride and several thousand dollars of the Galton fortune.

But what Archer finds - a headless skeleton, a clever con and a terrified blonde - reveals a game whose stakes are so high that someone is willing to kill. The Galton Case is a wonderfully devious and poetic look at poverty, greed, murder and identity. Ross Macdonald's Lew Archer mysteries rewrote the conventions of the detective novel with their credible, humane hero, and with Macdonald's insight and moral complexity won new literary respectability for the hardboiled genre previously pioneered by Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler. They have also received praise from such celebrated writers as William Goldman, Jonathan Kellerman, Eudora Welty and Elmore Leonard.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H3OIwdWH9o8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Puppet Motel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=SUg7uQAACAAJ&dq=Puppet+Motel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pettibone's Law","description":"The story of Vietnam pilot Smilin' Jack Rawlins, told with cinematic shifts from war scenes to the present day, traces one man's--and one nation's--journey into the heart of darkness and their steps back into the light.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JfybAAAACAAJ&dq=Pettibone%27s+Law&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The history of Henry Esmond, Esq: A colonel in the service of Her Majesty Queen Anne","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Baw2AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baby Om: Yoga for Mothers and Babies","description":"A dynamic yoga program for new mothers and their babies How does a new mother get back her shape without giving up precious time with her baby?

However, not many reveal in such an intimate way the struggle of innocent youth to adapt to the primitive code of  kill or be killed,  to transform from lads into combat soldiers. Another River, Another Town is the story of John P. Irwin, a teenage tank gunner whose idealistic desire to achieve heroism is shattered by the incredibly different view of life the world of combat demands. He comes to the realization that the realm of warfare has almost nothing in common with the civilian life from which he has come. The interminable fighting, dirt, fatigue, and hunger make the war seem endless. In addition to the killing and destruction on the battlefield, Irwin and his crew are caught up in the unbelievable depravity they encounter at Nordhausen Camp, where slave laborers are compelled to work themselves to death manufacturing the infamous V-rockets that have been causing so much destruction in London, and that are expected one day to devastate Washington, D.C. At the end of the war, the sense of victory is, for these men, overshadowed by the intense joy and relief they experience in knowing that the fighting is at last over.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lrdPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Another+River,+Another+Town:+A+Teenage+Tank+Gunner+Comes+of+Age+in+Combat--1945&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"There's a Porcupine in My Outhouse: Misadventures of a Mountain Man Wannabe (Capital Discovery)","description":"Tells the story of forty-year-old Rose Curtman's short marriage to seventy-year-old John, detailing their happiness together, his illness that resulted in his death, and the time she spent in Italy on the road to recovery.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-LO_S0V3mEEC&dq=There%27s+a+Porcupine+in+My+Outhouse:+Misadventures+of+a+Mountain+Man+Wannabe+(Capital+Discovery)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Epistles of St. Peter and St. Jude: Preached and explained","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gfVLAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Life: A Black Gay Anthology","description":"A Black Gay Anthology","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=THPmAAAAIAAJ&dq=In+the+Life:+A+Black+Gay+Anthology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Johnny Depp: The Biography","description":"Traces Johnny Depp's extraordinary journey from wild-child rebel to Hollywood mogul, examining his life and the roles he has played, from Willy Wonka and Edward Scissorhands to Captain Jack Sparrow and Barnabas Collins.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=17bFMQEACAAJ&dq=Johnny+Depp:+The+Biography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Food and Drink in Argentina: A Guide for Tourists and Residents","description":"Food and Drink in Argentina: A Guide for Tourists and Residents is a full-color, pocket-sized personal guide to the flavors and special nature of Argentina featuring: a dictionary of food terms, how to pick a great restaurant within your budget, information on exploring Argentina's wine country, a cultural and etiquette guide, tips for those traveling with children, with regional recipes to try.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=d49GAAAACAAJ&dq=Food+and+Drink+in+Argentina:+A+Guide+for+Tourists+and+Residents&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Miraculous Fever-Tree: Malaria and the Quest for a Cure That Changed the World","description":"Traces the historical search for a cure for malaria, describing the seventeenth-century establishment of pharmacies throughout South America by Jesuit priests, the discover of quinine, the fierce battles that were fought to control and distribute quinine supplies, and the American synthesis of the medicine. 25,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WPKzLDEHPR8C&dq=The+Miraculous+Fever-Tree:+Malaria+and+the+Quest+for+a+Cure+That+Changed+the+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Agent Your Agent","description":"Nancy Rainford takes the reader behind the scenes to reveal the techniques, politics, and unspoken rules of being an agent.

Anooshi Lingit Aani Ka / Russians in Tlingit America covers the period from the frist arrival of European and American fur traders in Tlingit territory to the establishment of a permanent Russian presence in the Pacific Northwest, presenting transcriptions and English translations of Tlingit oral traditions recorded almost fifty years ago and translations of newly available Russian historical documents. Although independent in origin and transmission, these accounts support one another to a remarkable degree on the main historical points. The Tlingit-Russian conflict is usually presented as a confrontation between \\"whites,\\" with superior arms, and brave but outnumbered and poorly armed Natives. Northing could be further from the truth. The Tlingits saw themselves as victors even as they formally ceded to the Russian the site of their village and fort, now known as Sitka. Setting aside ancient rules of story ownership, a new generation of Tlingit clan leaders has decided to publish the stories told by their ancestors so that the Tlingit point of view would be known and succeeding generations would not forget their people's history. Including Russian historical documents, travelers' accounts of informal interactions between the formerly warring parties after the battles, and Dr. W. Schuhmacher's work on the role played by British and American skippers, Anooshi Lingit Aani Ka inquires into and provides some answers to the fundamental question, Who owns history? Photographs of objects now in Russian and American museums - from the favorite battle hammer of Tlingit war chief Katlian to the metal ceremonial hat Baranov commissioned for the peace ceremony - enrich the book, along with portraits of key historical figures and eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century charts of Tlingit territory. Also included is the journal of Dmitrii Tarkhanov, a gazetteer, a glossary, and Tlingit and Russian name lists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yFa4anGH6U0C&dq=Anooshi+Lingit+Aani+Ka,+Russians+in+Tlingit+America+(Classics+of+Tlingit+Oral+Literature)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mrs. Murphy's Swedish Cook Book","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=r2ATAAAACAAJ&dq=Mrs.+Murphy%27s+Swedish+Cook+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brides in the Desert","description":"The Beguine movement arose in Europe during the thirteenth century and consisted of women living together in chastity and poverty, doing works of Christian charity. Although many of their number were wealthy, this urban phenomenon had no founder, no single rule, and no agreed way of life. The Beguine movement was part of a yearning to democratize religion, and it produced four great writers.Saskia Murk-Jansen, a specialist in medieval women's mysticism, looks at the lives and works of Beatrijs of Nazareth, Mechtild of Magdeburg, Hadewijch, and Marguerite Porete. These mystics used images, metaphor, and paradox to express the numinous aspect of God. They pioneered vernacular literature and forged theological visions out of their own experience. Their writings provide an invaluable supplement to the work of their male contemporaries.Saskia Murk-Jansen probes the key images in Beguine spirituality including the soul as the bride of God, suffering as an integral part of a relationship with the Holy One, and the desert as a place to focus on the transcendent. In this excellent, balanced treatment, Murk-Jansen clearly outlines the development of the movement, pointing to its influence as well as its repression by church authorities.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FtvOygAACAAJ&dq=Brides+in+the+Desert&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Writer's Guide to Book Editors, Publishers, and Literary Agents, 1998-1999: Who They Are!

Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings took first place in a recent national poll to find the greatest book of the century. He may be the most popular writer of our age, but Tolkien is often misunderstood. This major new study of his life, his character and his work reveals the facts and confronts the myths. It explores the background to the man and the culture in which he wrote. Tolkien: Man and Myth observes the relationships that the master writer had with his closest literary colleagues. It reveals his uneasy relationship with C.S. Lewis, the writer of the Narnia books, and the roots of their estrangement. In this original book about a leading literary life, Joseph Pearce enters the world created by Tolkien in the seven books published during his lifetime. He explores the significance of Middle Earth and what it represented in Tolkien's thinking. Myth, to him, was not a leap from reality but a leap into reality. The impact of his great notoriety, his relationship with material possessions and his traditional religious faith are all explored, making it possible to understand both the man and the myth he created. - Back cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Q3hbAAAAMAAJ&dq=Tolkien:+Man+and+Myth,+a+Literary+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Select practical writings of Robert Traill","description":"Robert Traill (1642-1716) lived to span the ripest period of the Puritan age.

Now since 1938 there have been many new developments and so a book on RICCI cal culus and its applications has to cover quite different ground from the book of 1923.

Such an age of revolution and innovation inspired a flood of fashions taking influence from everything including the newly discovered treasures of the ancient world, to radical new ideas like democracy.

PM as an academic discipline is discussed both in Management Science and in Operations Research. Management Science tends to focus on quantitative tools and the soft skills necessary to manage projects successfully. Operations Research gives the essential scientific contribution to the success of project management through the development of models and algorithms. In Management Science, Operations Research and Project Management, Jos  Ram?3n San Crist?3bal Mateo fills the gap between scientific research and the practical application of that research. Project managers need formal training in decision-making but sometimes, they do not have an in-depth knowledge of Operations Research or they lack the necessary theoretical background. This book, with its focus on the quantitative models of Operations Research and Management Science applied to Project Management, provides project managers with the tools and methods necessary to manage projects successfully. Project managers operate in a complex global environment, in which numerous factors need to be considered, such as minimizing total project costs, meeting contracted dates, and ensuring that activities achieve certain quality levels. The focus here on the application of quantitative models of Operations Research and Management Science applied to Project Management provides them with the tools and methods necessary to make sound decisions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lV1izAEACAAJ&dq=Managing+With+Operational+Research&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Old Quebec,: The fortress of New France,","description":"Excerpt from Old Quebec: The Fortress of New France Frenchmen turned to their over - sea dominions with imaginative hope, with conviction that the great continent of promise would renew in France the glories that were Greece and the grandeur that was Rome.

D. Professor of Semitic Languages School of Oriental Studies Cairo 1938 Oriental Institute Baroda Printed in Great Britain by Stephen Austin Sons, Ltd., Hertford, and Published on behalf of the Government of His Highness the Maharaja Gaekwad of Baroda by Benoytosh Bhattacharyya, Director, Oriental Institute, Baroda. Price Rs. 12-0 TO MY WIFE FOREWOKD Little further advance can be made in our interpretation of the Quran or of the life of Muhammad, until an exhaustive study has bee n made of the vocabulary of the Quran. It is interesting to note how recent work at Islamic origins, such as that done by the late Professor Horovitz and his pupils at Frankfurt, and in the books of Tor Andrae and Karl Ahrens, has tended to run to a discussion of vocabulary. The Quran is the first Arabic book, for though there was earlier poetry, it was not written down till much later, and some doubts have been raised as to the genuineness of what did get written down. For the interpretation of this first Arabic book, we have been content until recently to turn to the classical commentaries, but the tendency of the commentators is to interpret the book in the light of the Arabic language of their own day, and with few exceptions their philological lucubrations are of more interest for the study of the development of Muslim thought about the Quran, than they are for settling the meaning the words must have had for the Prophet and for those who listened to his utterances. Some day, it is to be hoped, we shall have a Glossary to the Quran comparable with the great Worterbucher we have to the Old and New Testaments, in which all the resources of philology, epigraphy, and textual criticism will be utilized for a thorough investigation of the vocabulary of the Quran. Meanwhile this present Essay attempts to make one small contribution to the subject by studying a number of the non-Arabic elements in the Quranic vocabulary. Emphasis has been placed in recent years on the too long forgotten fact that Arabia at the time of Muhammad was not isolated from the rest of the world, as Muslim authors would have us believe. There was at that time, as indeed for long before, full and constant contact with the surrounding peoples of Syria, Persia, and Abyssinia, and through intercourse there was a natural interchange of vocabulary. Where the Arabs came in contact with higher religion and higher civilization, they borrowed religious and cultural terms. This fact was fully recognized by the earliest circle of Muslim exegetes, who show no hesitation in noting words as of Jewish, Christian, or Iranian Viii FOREWORD origin. Later, under the influence of the great divines, especially of ash-Shafi this was pushed into the background, and an orthodox doctrine was elaborated to the effect that the Quran was a unique production of the Arabic language. The modern Muslim savant, indeed, IB as a rule seriously distressed by any discussion of the foreign origin of words in the Qurart. To the Western student the Jewish or Christian origin of many of the technical terms in the Quran is obvious at the first glance, and a little investigation makes it possible to identify many others. These identifications have been made by many scholars whose work is scattered in many periodicals in many languages. The present Essay is an attempt to gather them up and present them in aform convenient for the study of interested scholars both in the East and the West. The Essay was originally written in 1926, and in its original form was roughly four times the size of the present volume.

Deftly alternating between key historical episodes and his own work, Jauhar tells the colorful and little-known story of the doctors who risked their careers and the patients who risked their lives to know and heal our most vital organ. He introduces us to Daniel Hale Williams, the African American doctor who performed the world s first open heart surgery in Gilded Age Chicago. We meet C. Walton Lillehei, who connected a patient s circulatory system to a healthy donor s, paving the way for the heart-lung machine. And we encounter Wilson Greatbatch, who saved millions by inventing the pacemaker by accident. Jauhar deftly braids these tales of discovery, hubris, and sorrow with moving accounts of his family s history of heart ailments and the patients he s treated over many years. He also confronts the limits of medical technology, arguing that future progress will depend more on how we choose to live than on the devices we invent. Affecting, engaging, and beautifully written, Heart: A History takes the full measure of the only organ that can move itself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fTlIDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jerusalem's Heart (Center Point Platinum Fiction (Large Print))","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VOro0sfUCikC&dq=Jerusalem%27s+Heart+(Center+Point+Platinum+Fiction+(Large+Print))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Democracy on Trial: The Japanese American Evacuation and Relocation in World War II","description":"An account of the relocation of Japanese Americans to internment camps during World War II examines a tragic episode in contemporary American history","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WOxmAAAAMAAJ&dq=Democracy+on+Trial:+The+Japanese+American+Evacuation+and+Relocation+in+World+War+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chicago Cubs Encyclopedia","description":"Looks at the key seasons in the history of the ball club, its hall of famers, its managers and coaches, and its ballpark","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IMeDHAAACAAJ&dq=Chicago+Cubs+Encyclopedia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Climbing Your Family Tree: Online and Offline Genealogy for Kids","description":"An introduction to genealogy offers readers information on tracing a family's heritage, explaining how to use Internet resources to aid one's search, and including tips for nontraditional families and special situations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ms40OZ880lUC&dq=Climbing+Your+Family+Tree:+Online+and+Offline+Genealogy+for+Kids&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bmw K-Series, 1985-1997 (Clymer Motorcycle Repair)","description":"K75 Low Seat (1989), K75 (1989-1995), K75T (1986-1987), K75S (1987-1988, 1990-1995), K75C (1986-1988), K75RT (1990-1995), K100RS (1985-1988), K100RT (1985-1988), K100LT (1987-1988), K100RS-ABS (1988-1989, 1991-1992), K100LT-ABS (1989-1991), K1 (1990-1993)","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zzy7wAEACAAJ&dq=Bmw+K-Series,+1985-1997+(Clymer+Motorcycle+Repair)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dreamweaver","description":"Adobe Dreamweaver CC Classroom in a Book is the best-selling guide to Adobe's powerful web design application, fully updated.

Unlike paintings of ancient kings or mythic goddesses that in Europe were regarded as the highest achievement but in America were considered frivolous or morally corrupt, the land was a tangible presence, sometimes tranquil and serene, often mysterious and dangerous. Before 1820, depictions of the landscape had essentially served as backgrounds for portraits or as topographic documents. Thomas Cole transformed this \\"useful\\" landscape into a transcendental vision, where the hand of God was seen enlivening every aspect of nature. Cole's example opened the eyes of countless talented artists who sought the American soul in the vistas of its landscapes. This quest is vividly brought to life in the paintings included here, by 31 artists who painted in and around the Hudson River in the 19th century. They not only show an America that was, but an America that still exists in the core of our national consciousness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PfzqAAAAMAAJ&dq=This+Tranquil+Land:+Hudson+River+Paintings+from+the+Hersen+Collection&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Three Steps to Chess Mastery","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5_x_QgAACAAJ&dq=Three+Steps+to+Chess+Mastery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Jungle (What's Missing)","description":"Mack the Monkey is missing.

Critics contend that free trade brings economic pain, including plant closings and worker layoffs, and that trade agreements serve corporate interests, undercut domestic environmental regulations, and erode national sovereignty.

In Free Trade under Fire, Douglas Irwin sweeps aside the misconceptions that run rampant in the debate over trade and gives readers a clear understanding of the issues involved.

He suggests that these ideas are also found in the very structure of early human descriptions of where we come from and what it was like before we left it -- a Golden Age, a Paradise, and Eden. In nine chapters James Ozinga examines conceptual and historical examples of implementation of communal sharing and ideas. He looks at the source of these implementations and their future usefulness. The tenth chapter provides a summary and an analysis of the study and pushes the viewpoint that equality of opportunity is more desirable and more probable than absolute equality. This thoroughly descriptive and illuminative analysis will be highly appropriate for courses on communism or utopias, political philosophy, or the trade market.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YajaAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Recurring+Dream+of+Equality&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hebrew From Scratch Audio CD Set Part I","description":"Learning Hebrew Becomes Easier with This Helpful Guide to Verbs and Their Roots The most commonly used Hebrew verbs are arranged alphabetically in a table format, with English translation, and presented in all forms.

Krishnamurti","description":"A scathing critique of contemporary spirituality by one of its most unusual figures. In the well-known history of J Krishnamurti (no relation), few names have been so strongly associated as U G, with whom he shared a close but contentious relationship over many years. In a world in which spiritual techniques, teachers, concepts, and organisations are legion, U G Krishnamurti stands nearly alone in his rejection of it all: \\"I am only interested in describing this state, in clearing away the occultation and mystification in which those people in the 'holy business' have shrouded the whole thing. Maybe I can convince you not to waste a lot of time and energy looking for a state that does not exist except in your imagination... The natural state is causal; it just happens.' Krishnamurti does not equate the natural state with enlightenment, which he describes as an illusion created by our culture. He says emphatically that one can do nothing to attain the natural state. In fact, any movement towards it separates one from it. Since his own experience of coming into the natural state at age 49, he has spent his time travelling throughout the world, staying with friends or in rented apartments for a few months at a time. He gives no public talks, but meets with people who come to see him. References to U G Krishnamurti are often found in other spiritual books, but until now there has been no N American edition of his work. The Mystique of Enlightenment is considered by his closest associates to be the best summary of his ideas. This edition has further edited the informal talks (in one of which he relates his life story) and has a new two-page foreword by the publisher.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DymPVtco6jIC&dq=The+Mystique+of+Enlightenment:+The+Radical+Ideas+of+U.G.+Krishnamurti&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Educating Emily (Zebra Regency Romance)","description":"Fleeing a loveless marriage, Emily Walsingham runs away, only to fall prey to a gang of ruffians from whom she is rescued by James Garwood, Lord Northwycke, but when James and Emily enter into a marriage of convenience, their practical social arrangement soon becomes a true love match.

As a pilot in World War I he was credited with sixty-one confirmed kills on the Western Front. When World War II began in 1939, Air Commodore Collishaw commanded a Royal Air Force group in Egypt. It was in Egypt and Libya in 194041, during the Britain s Western Desert campaign, that he demonstrated the tenets of an effective air-ground cooperation system. Flying to Victory examines Raymond Collishaw s contribution to the British system of tactical air support a pattern of operations that eventually became standard in the Allied air forces and proved to be a key factor in the Allied victory. The British Army and Royal Air Force entered the war with conflicting views on the issue of air support that hindered the success of early operations. It was only after the chastening failure of Operation Battleaxe in June 1941, fought according to army doctrine, that Winston Churchill shifted strategy on the direction of future air campaigns ultimately endorsing the RAF's view of mission and target selection. This view adopted principles of air-ground cooperation that Collishaw had demonstrated in combat. Author Mike Bechthold traces the emergence of this strategy in the RAF air campaign in Operation Compass, the first British offensive in the Western Desert, in which Air Commodore Collishaw s small force overwhelmed its Italian counterpart and disrupted enemy logistics. Flying to Victory details the experiences that prepared Collishaw so well for this campaign and that taught him much about the application of air power, especially how to work effectively with the army and Royal Navy. As Bechthold shows, these lessons learned altered the Allied approach to tactical air support and, ultimately, changed the course of the Second World War.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OZhrDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"For the Good of the Earth and Sun: Teaching Poetry","description":"The principles of teaching poetry discussed are applicable to any classroom of student poets, regardless of age.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1BfuAAAAMAAJ&dq=For+the+Good+of+the+Earth+and+Sun:+Teaching+Poetry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The dachshund or teckel;: A complete treatise on the history, breeding, training, care and management-with chapters on diseases and their treatment,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AOPZPQAACAAJ&dq=The+dachshund+or+teckel%3B:+A+complete+treatise+on+the+history,+breeding,+training,+care+and+management-with+chapters+on+diseases+and+their+treatment,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Textbook of Immunology: An Introduction to Immunochemistry and Immunobiology","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LdiEAAAAIAAJ&dq=Textbook+of+Immunology:+An+Introduction+to+Immunochemistry+and+Immunobiology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Country Review, Cyprus 1998/1999","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zz3rPAAACAAJ&dq=Country+Review,+Cyprus+1998/1999&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"United States Government Information: Policies and Sources","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5jxlAQAACAAJ&dq=United+States+Government+Information:+Policies+and+Sources&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pascal","description":"Blaise Pascal, the precociously brilliant contemporary of Descartes, was a gifted mathematician and physicist, but it is his unfinished apologia for the Christian religion upon which his reputation now rests. The Pense s is a collection of philosohical fragments, notes and essays in which Pascal explores the contradictions of human nature in pscyhological, social, metaphysical and - above all - theological terms. Mankind emerges from Pascal's analysis as a wretched and desolate creature within an impersonal universe, but who can be transformed through faith in God's grace.

At the dawn of the modern age, many writers found the occult a powerful antidote to the rising scientification of human experience. In these reports from the dark side, the weird, enigmatic and unexplainable became symbols of the human spirit's resistance to a new, mechanistic, more rational world. The Dedalus Occult Reader brings together for the first time a unique collection of European fiction, including passages from Valery Bruisov, Andre Bely, William Beckford, Jacques Cazotte, Bulwer-Lytton, de Maupassant, de Nerval, Goethe, and Arthur Machen, offering some of the finest flowers from the hermetic gardens of literary occultism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RBICAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Garden+of+Hermetic+Dreams+(Dedalus+Occult+Reader)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Secret Love (Cynster Novels)","description":"And now, Stephanie Laurens has created her boldest Cynster yet - Gabriel - a man who has known the pleasure of many women, but who has given his heart to no one.

From Neolithic times through the earliest civilizations of the ancient Near East, in savannahs, river valleys and the terraces created by the Incas in the Andean mountains, an increasing range of agricultural techniques have developed in response to very different conditions. These developments are recounted in this book, with detailed attention to the ways in which plants, animals, soil, climate, and society have interacted. Mazoyer and Roudart s A History of World Agriculture is a path-breaking and panoramic work, beginning with the emergence of agriculture after thousands of years in which human societies had depended on hunting and gathering, showing how agricultural techniques developed in the different regions of the world, and how this extraordinary wealth of knowledge, tradition and natural variety is endangered today by global capitialism, as it forces the unequal agrarian heritages of the world to conform to the norms of profit. During the twentieth century, mechanization, motorization and specialization have brought to a halt the pattern of cultural and environmental responses that characterized the global history of agriculture until then. Today a small number of corporations have the capacity to impose the farming methods on the planet that they find most profitable. Mazoyer and Roudart propose an alternative global strategy that can safegaurd the economies of the poor countries, reinvigorate the global economy, and create a livable future for mankind.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vt0VCgAAQBAJ&dq=World+Agriculture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deviant Propulsion: Poems","description":"The poet captures the energy and vigor of queer culture, highlighting various deviants and forms of deviancy against the backdrop of the search for love and political defiance.

Part Three takes a closer look at biological treatments-including the use of antidepressants, and various types of psychotherapy-from cognitive behavioral treatments to EMDR and beyond.

Not so, nor was it ever so. Past--and present--tell us that tropical diseases are as American as the heart attack; yellow fever lived happily for centuries in Philadelphia. Malaria liked it fine in Washington, not to mention in the Carolinas where it took right over. The Ebola virus stopped off in Baltimore, and the Mexican pig tapeworm has settled comfortably among orthodox Jews in Brooklyn. This book starts with the little creatures the first American immigrants brought with them on the long walk from Siberia 50,000 years ago. It moves on to all that unwanted baggage that sailed over with the Spanish, French, and the English and killed native Americans in huge numbers in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. (The native Americans, it appears, got some revenge by passing syphilis--including Pinta, a feisty strain of syphilis--back to Europe with Columbus's returning sailors.) Nor have the effects of these diseases on people and economics been fully appreciated. Did slavery last so long because Africans were semi-immune to malaria and yellow fever, while Southern whites of all ranks fell in thousands to those diseases? In the final chapters, Robert S. Desowitz takes us through the Good Works of the twentieth century, Kid Rockefeller and the Battling Hookworm, and the rearrival of malaria; and he offers a glimpse into the future with a host of \\"Doomsday bugs\\" and jet-setting viruses that make life, quite literally, a jungle out there.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OBnRCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The great Chicago theater disaster: The complete story told by the survivors","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=O2_mO6E40-YC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mary Chesnuts Civil War","description":"An authorized account of the Civil War, drawn from the diaries of a Southern aristocrat, records the disintegration and final destruction of the Confederacy","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WojvfHAX4lgC&dq=Mary+Chesnuts+Civil+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This Is My God: The Jewish Way of Life","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k61HC_eBa3wC&dq=This+Is+My+God:+The+Jewish+Way+of+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Masterpieces of the J.

From the moment that they leave England's shores, you are swept along by their enthusiasm and lust for all that may face them - from recalcitrant hippopotami, charging elephants and a life-saving leopard, to welcoming tribesfolk and the glorious unspoilt African bush. Unfazed by minor setbacks such as the lack of electricity to drive the Hoover, and confrontations with unwelcoming snakes, the Dawtrey family revel in their new surroundings and the challenges of their new life under the Nyerere regime of Uhuru (Freedom).

One name is enough...\\"\\" \\"For the rest of her life, Eleni will be \\"Achilles' Fiancee,\\" fiancee of the guerilla leader, the brave, handsome kapetanios whose code-name is Achilles. In the demonstrations against the German occupiers of Greece, in prison where she waits for a death sentence during the post-war persecution of suspected leftists, in exile in Tashkent where the exiled Greek communists fight amongst themselves, and finally in Paris. But somewhere along the way Eleni becomes an independent character with a mind of her own. As she begins to doubt the slogans that she fought for when she was a blind follower of leaders like her fiance, Eleni involves us in her own private world of self-discovery. It is a woman's world, where human warmth and friendships matter more than abstract ideals.\\" \\"The Greek work for a novel is mythistorema, a word that combines myth and history. In her story of a young woman's struggle to survive through an extraordinary period of Greek history, Alki Zei has woven the threads of her own quasi-mythical life into the stuff of history.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

They were only trying to deal with bad situations at home when they became lifelines for each other. Their pipe dream was to someday meet in LA, where Lucas would design skyscrapers, and Gabriel would learn to fly. But then Gabriel disappeared without so much as a goodbye, and Lucas got himself in trouble with the law. Five years later, both men are at a loss when they run into each other at a Hollywood bar. Lucas is still angry, but it's not as if Gabriel could control how his mind and body had betrayed him. Being found on the ledge of that bridge had changed everything. The attraction is immediate, but it's more than their inability to keep their hands off each other. Neither man expects the fierce connection pulling them together. Unfortunately, ignoring their problems doesn't make them disappear. Gabriel's internal struggles are serious...dangerous. And no matter how much Lucas wants it to be true, saving Gabriel won't make up for not being able to save his mom. If they don't find the strength to face their own demons before the darkness takes hold, they risk more than just losing each other forever.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hzMNkAEACAAJ&dq=Touches+the+Sky&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A genealogy of the Quick family in Amrica (1625-1942) 317 years,","description":"Quick FAmily","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M4HpAAAACAAJ&dq=A+genealogy+of+the+Quick+family+in+Amrica+(1625-1942)+317+years,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Word 2002 from A to Z: A Quick Reference of More Than 300 Microsoft Word Tasks, Terms, and Tricks","description":"Written for any level of Microsoft Word 2002 user, this book provides a reference for everyone from students to mobile workers.

These 'light' troops fulfilled several important roles on the battlefield, such as 'masking' large bodies of close-order troops as they manoeuvred in battle, firing upon enemy troops to provoke them into attacking prematurely, and harassing enemy artillery crews and senior officers with aimed fire. On occasion, the skirmishers were tasked with special missions requiring individual initiative, such as the capture or defence of key battlefield positions, especially those situated in difficult terrain. While Napoleon's skirmishers carried the smoothbore musket, notoriously inaccurate and short-ranged, several elite units fighting for Britain were armed with the rifle, a far more accurate weapon that was hampered by a slower rate of fire. As well as the legendary 95th Rifles, Britain fielded rifle-armed German troops of the 60th Regiment and the King's German Legion, while France's light troops were fielded in individual companies but also entire regiments. In this study, David Greentree assesses the role and effectiveness of rifle-armed British troops and their French open-order opponents in three very different encounters: Roli?a (August 1808), the first British battle of the Peninsular War; the struggle for a key bridge at Barba del Puerco (March 1810); and the bitter fight for the La Haye Sainte farmhouse during the battle of Waterloo (June 1815).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-vPADwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Selected Short Fiction (Penguin English Library)","description":"This witty and amusing collection of short pieces shows Dickens liberated from the more formal and sustained demands of the novel and experimenting with a diverse range of fictional techniques.

Used as both a high-altitude escort fighter and a low-level fighter-bomber, it quickly gained a reputation for being tough and resilient. Many different air forces operated this plane, and it sported a wide range of camouflage schemes, finishes and markings, including stunning nose art. Modellers have been well served with Thunderbolt kits over the years, right up to the latest highly accurate releases. This book takes a step-by-step approach to modelling a wide variety of P-47 types in 1/48-scale, from 'Razorbacks' in USAAF colours to RAF T-bolts in the Far East.

The book has been carefully designed for the classroom. It is aimed at students with varying degrees of preparation, including those without prior exposure to semantics or formal logic. Moreover, it should make DRT easily accessible to those who want to learn about the theory on their own. Exercises are available to test understanding as well as to encourage independent theoretical thought. The book serves a double purpose. Besides a textbook, it is also the first comprehensive and fully explicit statement of DRT available in the form of a book. The first part of the book develops the basic principles of DRT for a small fragment of English (but which has nevertheless the power of standard predicate logic). The second part extends this fragment by adding plurals; it discusses a wide variety of problems connected with plural nouns and verbs. The third part applies the theory to the analysis of tense and aspect. Many of the problems raised in Parts Two and Three are novel, as are the solutions proposed. For undergraduate and graduate students interested in linguistics, theoretical linguistics, computational linguistics, artificial intelligence and cognitive science.

Little wonder, for readers are immediately drawn to Kent's vivid descriptions of the experience; we share \\"the feeling of wind and wet and cold, of lifting seas and steep descents, of rolling over as the wind gusts hit,\\" and the sound \\"of wind in the shrouds, of hard spray flung on a drum-tight canvas, of rushing water at the scuppers, of the gale shearing a tormented sea.\\" When the ship sinks in a storm-swept fjord within 50 miles of its destination, the story turns to the stranding and subsequent rescue of the three-man crew, salvage of the vessel, and life among native Greenlanders. Magnificently illustrated by Kent's wood-block prints and narrated in his poetic and highly entertaining style, this tale of the perils of killer nor'easters, treacherous icebergs, and impenetrable fog -- and the joys of sperm whales breaching or dawn unmasking a longed-for landfall -- is a rare treat for old salts and landlubbers alike.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lB1XE29hSgoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Legends of the saints","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6VI4AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Connecticut's Gun Confiscation Law First in Country.(Brief Article): An article from: State Legislatures","description":"Perhaps never before has an objective, evidence-based review of the intersection between gun violence and mental illness been more sorely needed or more timely. Gun Violence and Mental Illness, written by a multidisciplinary roster of authors who are leaders in the fields of mental health, public health, and public policy, is a practical guide to the issues surrounding the relation between firearms deaths and mental illness. Tragic mass shootings that capture headlines reinforce the mistaken beliefs that people with mental illness are violent and responsible for much of the gun violence in the United States. This misconception stigmatizes individuals with mental illness and distracts us from the awareness that approximately 65% of all firearm deaths each year are suicides. This book is an apolitical exploration of the misperceptions and realities that attend gun violence and mental illness. The authors frame both pressing social issues as public health problems subject to a variety of interventions on individual and collective levels, including utilization of a novel perspective: evidence-based interventions focusing on assessments and indicators of dangerousness, with or without indications of mental illness. Reader-friendly, well-structured, and accessible to professional and lay audiences, the book: * Reviews the epidemiology of gun violence and its relationship to mental illness, exploring what we know about those who perpetrate mass shootings and school shootings. * Examines the current legal provisions for prohibiting access to firearms for those with mental illness and whether these provisions and new mandated reporting interventions are effective or whether they reinforce negative stereotypes associated with mental illness. * Discusses the issues raised in accessing mental health treatment in regard to diminished treatment resources, barriers to access, and involuntary commitment.* Explores novel interventions for addressing these issues from a multilevel and multidisciplinary public health perspective that does not stigmatize people with mental illness. This includes reviews of suicide risk assessment; increasing treatment engagement; legal, social, and psychiatric means of restricting access to firearms when people are in crisis; and, when appropriate, restoration of firearm rights. Mental health clinicians and trainees will especially appreciate the risk assessment strategies presented here, and mental health, public health, and public policy researchers will find Gun Violence and Mental Illness a thoughtful and thought-provoking volume that eschews sensationalism and embraces serious scholarship.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DoUJDAAAQBAJ&dq=Connecticut%27s+Gun+Confiscation+Law+First+in+Country.(Brief+Article):+An+article+from:+State+Legislatures&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Favorite Mistake","description":"Afraid of getting her heart broken, Taylor Caldwell is intent on getting rid of new roommate Hunter Zaccadelli before she falls in love with him, but her determination gives way to desire as they begin to share secrets and romance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FSsbAAAAQBAJ&dq=My+Favorite+Mistake&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"No One Loved Gorillas More: Dian Fossey: Letters from the Mist","description":"Drawing on her previously unpublished letters, this deeply personal and illuminating portrait of preservationist Dian Fossey is accompanied by dazzling, full-color photographs by Campbell, who spent nearly four years making a visual journal of Fossey's work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=APXaAAAAMAAJ&dq=No+One+Loved+Gorillas+More:+Dian+Fossey:+Letters+from+the+Mist&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adoption agencies, orphanages, and maternity homes: An historical directory","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2NKfpwAACAAJ&dq=Adoption+agencies,+orphanages,+and+maternity+homes:+An+historical+directory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Liner","description":"David Easton believed his life was in complete ruins.

Since A Symphony in the Brain was first published, the scientific understanding of our bodies, brains, and minds has taken remarkable leaps. From neurofeedback with functional magnetic resonance imaging equipment, to the use of radio waves, to biofeedback of the heart and breath and coverage of biofeedback by health insurance plans, this expanded and updated edition of the groundbreaking book traces the fascinating untold story of the development of biofeedback. Discovered by a small corps of research scientists, this alternative treatment allows a patient to see real-time measurements of their bodily processes. Its advocates claim biofeedback can treat epilepsy, autism, attention deficit disorder, addictions, and depression with no drugs or side effects; bring patients out of vegetative states; and even improve golf scores or an opera singer s voice. But biofeedback has faced battles for acceptance in the conservative medical world despite positive signs that it could revolutionize the way a diverse range of medical and psychological problems are treated. Offering case studies, accessible scientific explanations, and dramatic personal accounts, this book explores the possibilities for the future of our health.  Robbins details the fascinating medical history of the therapy, tracing it back to French physician Paul Broca s discovery of the region in the brain where speech originates. At the heart of this riveting story are the people whose lives have been transformed by neurofeedback, from the doctors and psychologists who employ it to the patients who have undergone treatment.

In this new contribution to the anthropology of the state, Yael Navaro-Yashin brings recent poststructuralist and psychoanalytic theory to bear on the study of the political. Delving deeper than studies of nationalist discourse that would focus on consciously articulated narratives of political identity, the author explores sites of \\"fantasy\\" in the public-political domain of Istanbul. The book focuses on the conflict over secularism in the aftermath of an Islamist victory in the city's municipalities. In contrast with studies that would problematize and objectify religious movements, the author examines the agency of secularists under a state widely known for its \\"secularist\\" policies. The complexity and dynamism of the context studied moves well beyond scholarly distinctions between \\"secularity\\" and \\"religion,\\" as well as \\"state\\" and \\"society.\\" Here, secularism and Islamism emerge as different guises for a culture of statism where people from \\"society\\" compete to claim \\"Turkish culture\\" for themselves and their life practices. With this work that stretches the boundaries of regionalism, the author situates her anthropological study of Turkey not only in scholarship on the Middle East, but also in the broader problem of thinking \\"Europe\\" anew.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t2XcDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Human Condition (The Comparative Religious Ideas Project)","description":"Explores the human condition in a range of world religions and discusses the issue and philosophical implications of comparison itself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AJfowAEACAAJ&dq=The+Human+Condition+(The+Comparative+Religious+Ideas+Project)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Heart to Artemis: A Writer's Memoirs","description":"Bryher (1894-1985) adventurer, novelist, publisher flees Victorian Britain for the raucous streets of Cairo and sultry Parisian cafes.

Worldwide, it is estimated that women are the sole supporters in 18 to 30 percent of all families, and that their financial contribution in the remainder of families is substantial and often crucial. This book provides a solid documentary base that can be used to develop an agenda to guide research and health policy formulation on female health--both for Sub-Saharan Africa and for other regions of the developing world. This book could also help facilitate ongoing, collaboration between African researchers on women's health and their U.S. colleagues. Chapters cover such topics as demographics, nutritional status, obstetric morbidity and mortality, mental health problems, and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WClt4aETnDMC&dq=In+Her+Lifetime:+Female+Morbidity+and+Mortality+in+Sub-Saharan+Africa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Traditional Indonesian Textiles","description":"The fabrics of Indonesia have long held an allure.

(To this day, Trot asserts she felt mermaid arms about her during those terrible moments under water.) From here on, one perilous adventure crowds in upon another. In Jinxland they meet the Scarecrow who takes charge of things once Cap'n Bill is transformed into a tiny grasshopper with a wooden leg.

When Franklin Roosevelt ran for president in 1932, he gained the support of Joseph Kennedy, a little-known businessman with Wall Street connections. Instrumental in Roosevelt s victory, their partnership began a longstanding alliance between two of America s most ambitious power brokers. Kennedy worked closely with FDR as the first chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and later as ambassador to Great Britain. But at the outbreak of World War II, sensing a threat to his family and fortune, Kennedy lobbied against American intervention putting him in direct conflict with Roosevelt s intentions. Though he retreated from the spotlight to focus on the political careers of his sons, Kennedy s relationship with Roosevelt would eventually come full circle in 1960, when Franklin Roosevelt Jr. campaigned for John F. Kennedy s presidential win. With unprecedented access to Kennedy s private diaries as well as firsthand interviews with Roosevelt s family and White House aides, New York Timesbestselling author Michael Beschloss called  the nation s leading presidential historian  by Newsweek presents an insightful study in contrasts. Roosevelt, the scion of a political dynasty, had a genius for the machinery of government; Kennedy, who built his own fortune, was a political outsider determined to build a dynasty of his own. From the author of The Conquerors and Presidential Courage, this is a  fascinating account of the complex, ambiguous relationship of two shrewd, ruthless, power-hungry men  (The New York Times Book Review).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PQrBDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Something Like An Autobiography","description":"Translated by Audie E.

Now they bring their epic trilogy to an unforgettable conclusion in a novel of blazing imaginative brilliance... Elora Danan has done the unthinkable. She has slain the dragons that were the embodiment of the soul of Creation. It was a desperate act--the only way to save the dragons from the Deceiver, who would have used them to rule the Realms. Yet in Elora's possession are two last dragon eggs. To protect them, Elora spellbinds herself to her faithful companions Thorn Drumheller, the Nelwyn sorcerer and her sworn guardian, and Khory Bannefin, the long-dead woman warrior whose body is inhabited by a demon's offspring. It is a dire spell that ensures none of them will betray their cause...even at the cost of their lives. And if one of them dies, the magic of the eggs is lost forever. Pursued through a land of shadow predators by the dreaded Black Rose, the Deceiver's commando assassins, Elora and her allies must reach the free city-state of Sandeni. There they will be reunited with old friends: the brownies Franjean and Rool, the eagles Anele and Bastian, and the young warrior-scribe Luc-Jon. But Sandeni is besieged by mighty armies fueled by the Deceiver's sorcery, warrior wizards, and engines of evil magic. With defeat all but certain, Elora must convince the Sandeni people to continue the fight. What she doesn't tell them is that the greatest enemy lies within her. For the Deceiver is her own dark twin from a potential future of unimaginable evil...an evil that lies dormant in Elora's soul. And the only way Elora can stop the future is to befriend an enemy whose insatiable appetite for destruction could destroy all of Creation. Or is that, too, part of the Deceiver's plan?

Starting from the hypothesis that knowledge of Control Systems is not only a technical fact but also represents a discipline  that is,  A discipline is a developmental path for acquiring certain skills or competencies. (...) To practice a discipline is to be a lifelong learner. You  never arrive ; you spend your life mastering disciplines.  (Senge, 2006, p. 10)  Piero Mella has set the objective of making Control Systems a topic that is, in a certain sense, simple and attractive by turning to the effective symbolism typical of Systems Thinking models and avoiding too technical and formal a treatment of the subject. Thus readers should know that this is not an engineering, physics, biology or economics text, nor a mathematics one either. Technical or mathematical tools are not necessary to construct Control Systems; instead the book adopts a highly simple and universal logic behind the notion itself of control process and the simple and universal action of the Control Systems that produce this process. The Magic Ring: Systems Thinking Approach to Control Systems is divided into 10 chapters. Chapter 1 seeks to review the basic language of Systems Thinking and the models it allows us to create, while Chapter 2 introduces the control process, presenting the theoretical structure of four simple Control Systems we all can observe and manage. In Chapter 3 a general typology of Control Systems is proposed with examples taken from observations of reality. The view of Control Systems is broadened in Chapter 4 by introducing two important generalizations: 1. multi lever Control Systems, with levers that are independent or dependent of each other; 2. multi-objective systems, with independent or interdependent objectives. Chapter 5 outlines the guidelines for recognizing, observing or designing Control Systems and presents the problems that arise regarding their logical realization, introducing the fundamental distinction between symptomatic and structural control. Chapters 6-9 undertake a  mental journey  through various  environments , increasingly broader in scope, suggesting to the reader how to recognize therein Control Systems that, by their ubiquitous presence, make the world possible in all its manifestations. Finally Chapter 10 covers ideas about a Discipline of Control Systems and the human aspects of control.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UK8pBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sources of World Civilization, Volume I: to 1500 (2nd Edition)","description":"A collection of primary source documents in world history covering the events before 1500.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h-7vAAAAMAAJ&dq=Sources+of+World+Civilization,+Volume+I:+to+1500+(2nd+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Creed of Half Japan: Historical Sketches of Japanese Buddhism","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Y2UwAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Stainless Steel Rat","description":"A stainless steel rat for a stainless steel world . . .

Equally harmful, the praise of man is also a snare, capable of disqualifying God's servants from their highest inheritance. Bob Sorge reveals in this brief book how the truths that set us free from both extremes are amazingly similar. This book answers some crucial questions which grip virtually every believer: What do I do when others demean or hurt me? And how should I respond when others honor or compliment me? Rejection and praise are like twin gullies that flank the narrow highway of holiness. Every step counts. For Jesus, man's opinions were meaningless in light of the exuberant affection and passionate approval of His Father. Let God's truth set you free from the power of rejection's woundings and from the entrapment of man's praises. Learn how to hold your heart before God in a way that pleases Him in the midst of both rejection and praise from people.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QT2S6A1ECIcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tales of Troy and Greece","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xfEjEAAAQBAJ&dq=Tales+of+Troy+and+Greece&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Norman Conquest of Southern Italy and Sicily","description":"\\"This book is not an effort to tell the whole story of the Normans in Italy.

Addicted to opium as a young man and reduced to homelessness on the streets of London, the poet, in a last effort to regenerate himself, sends to the editor of a Catholic monthly samples of his writing. Months pass before the editor reads the soiled manuscript; he immediately perceives its genius and sets out to find the young poet but to no avail. He publishes the poetry in the hopes that Thompson will contact him. The Hound of Heaven at My Heels is a fictional reconstruction of the poet's lost diary; it is a heart-breaking and soul-lifting account of his spiritual, psychological, and physical regeneration. It is the story of a young man who finally finds his soul and his vocation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yuyLiKPY0FEC&dq=The+Hound+of+Heaven+at+My+Heels:+The+Lost+Diary+of+Francis+Thompson&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Healing With Whole Foods: Oriental Traditions and Modern Nutrition","description":"Used as a reference by students of acupuncture, Healing with Whole Foods is an invaluable guide to the theory and practice of Chinese medicine. With facts about green foods such as spirulina and blue-green algae and information about the \\"regeneration diets\\" used by cancer patients and arthritics, it is also an accessible primer on nutrition and a inspiring cookbook with more than 300 mostly vegetarian, nutrient-packed recipes. The information on Chinese medicine is useful for helping to diagnose health imbalances, especially nascent illnesses. It's smartly paired with the whole-foods program: because the Chinese have attributed various health-balancing properties to foods, you can tailor your diet to help alleviate symptoms of illness. For example, Chinese medicine dictates that someone with low energy and a pale complexion (a yin deficiency) would benefit from avoiding bitter foods and increasing \\"sweet\\" foods such as soy, black sesame seeds, parsnips, rice, and oats. (Note that the Chinese definition of sweet foods is much different from the American one!) Pitchford says in his dedication that he hopes the reader finds \\"healing, awareness, and peace\\" by following his program. The diet is certainly ascetic by American standards (no alcohol, caffeine, white flour, fried foods, or sugar, and a minimum of eggs and dairy) but the reasons he gives for avoiding these \\"negative energy\\" foods are compelling. From the adrenal damage imparted by coffee to the immune dysfunction brought on by excess refined sugar, Pitchford spurs you to rethink every dietary choice and its ultimate influence on your health. Without being alarmist, he offers dietary tips for protecting yourself against the dangers of modern life, including neutralizing damage from water fluoridation. There's further reading on food combining, female health, heart disease, pregnancy, fasting, and weight loss. Overall, this is a wonderful book for anyone who's serious about strengthening his or her body from the inside out.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BddLDwAAQBAJ&dq=Healing+With+Whole+Foods:+Oriental+Traditions+and+Modern+Nutrition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The guards came through,: And other poems,","description":"Men of the Twenty-first, Up by the Chalk Pit Wood, Weak from our wounds and our thirst, Wanting our sleep and our food After a day and a night.

It is a rare story that touches us so deeply with its humor, sadness, and powerful message that it transcends the walls of race, culture, and class that divide us. Why You Crying? is just such a story. Abandoned by his migrant-worker father at the tender age of two months, deserted by a wild, mixed-up mother at the age of ten years, Lopez grew up angry, alone, teased, and tormented in California's San Fernando Valley, raised by grandparents who viewed love as a four-letter word. Inspired by his idols, Freddie Prinze Sr. and Richard Pryor, Lopez sets out on a tumultuous twenty-year journey into the manic world of stand-up comedy -- trying to learn a skill nobody can teach; scoring one night and bombing the next; fighting anger, alcohol, depression, and doubt all while battling the barriers built to keep Chicanos from breaking through, especially on network TV. Today, the George Lopez show is a prime-time hit on ABC and his sold-out stand-up performances attract thousands of fans of all ages, each drawn to the sidesplitting riffs mined from a life so sad it had to be funny. Why You Crying? takes an outsider from the San Fernando Valley to Warner Bros. studios to inside the Emmys to plush Pebble Beach and all the way to the halls of Harvard. Along the way it's pure G.

As was well known at the time, Richter had spent several years in the Southwest, where he collected the material for his first successful book, Early Americans and Other Stories, but by 1933, he had returned to live in his hometown, Pine Grove, Pennsylvania. John Donner, the main protagonist in The Waters of Kronos, traces a similar route from west to east, although he finds that his family home and native town have been submerged under the deep waters of a lake formed by the construction of a hydroelectric dam. As Richter narrates his alter ego's efforts to salvage his past, he moves beyond &\\"semi-autobiography&\\" to offer what are widely recognized as his most haunting reflections upon the power of family history, the fragility of human memory, and art's role in structuring the communal ethos. David McCullough, a fellow Pulitzer Prize winner, met and befriended Richter in the 1960s and has called him &\\"an American master,&\\" praising The Waters of Kronos as &\\"his most beautiful book.&\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IVz094lPtWEC&dq=The+Waters+of+Kronos&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ASP.NET for Web Designers","description":"The only book that provides insight to designers on designing ASP.NET applications in an analogy manner that designers can understand and relate to, this guide also provides clear and concise, hands-on, real-world examples right from the beginning of the book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hL_-MlJdNkMC&dq=ASP.NET+for+Web+Designers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The California Cauldron: Immigration and the Fortunes of Local Communities","description":"Once the prime destination for westward-moving young Americans, California has become a magnet for a new wave of migration in recent years.

These women came from all walks of life but had one thing in common: a desire for freedom. History has largely ignored these female swashbucklers, until now. Here are their stories, from ancient Norse princess Alfhild and warrior Rusla to Sayyida al-Hurra of the Barbary corsairs; from Grace O'Malley, who terrorized shipping operations around the British Isles during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I; to Cheng I Sao, who commanded a fleet of four hundred ships off China in the early nineteenth century. Author Laura Sook Duncombe also looks beyond the stories to the storytellers and mythmakers. What biases and agendas motivated them? What did they leave out? Pirate Women explores why and how these stories are told and passed down, and how history changes depending on who is recording it. It's the most comprehensive overview of women pirates in one volume and chock-full of swashbuckling adventures that pull these unique women from the shadows into the spotlight that they deserve.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zA90DQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fortress of Solitude (Doc Savage, No. 23)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"[Ki anu amkha] =: Portfolio one : we are Thy people : glimpses of Lubavitcher life","description":"Includes entries for maps and atlases.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vOU8AQAAIAAJ&dq=%5BKi+anu+amkha%5D+%3D:+Portfolio+one+:+we+are+Thy+people+:+glimpses+of+Lubavitcher+life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Al-jazeera: The Story Of The Network That Is Rattling Governments And Redefining Modern Journalism Updated With A New Prologue And Epilogue","description":"Al-Jazeera, the independent, all-Arab television news network based in Qatar, emerged as ambassador to the Arab world in the events following September 11, 2001.

He was not one to romanticize undisturbed, primal landscapes, but rather in his attempts to satisfy his cravings for a richer, more authentic life, he came stumbled into the world of restoration and rewilding. When these concepts were first introduced in 2011, very recently, they focused on releasing captive animals into the wild. Soon the definition expanded to describe the reintroduction of animal and plant species to habitats from which they had been excised. Some people began using it to mean the rehabilitation not just of particular species, but of entire ecosystems: a restoration of wilderness. Rewilding recognizes that nature consists not just of a collection of species but also of their ever-shifting relationships with each other and with the physical environment. Ecologists have shown how the dynamics within communities are affected by even the seemingly minor changes in species assemblages. Predators and large herbivores have transformed entire landscapes, from the nature of the soil to the flow of rivers, the chemistry of the oceans, and the composition of the atmosphere. The complexity of earth systems is seemingly boundless.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CC-OBAAAQBAJ&dq=Feral&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Toppamono: Outlaw. Radical. Suspect.

In Lucy Audubon: A Biography, Carolyn E. DeLatte focuses on the early life of Lucy Audubon: her birth in England and youth in eastern Pennsylvania, her courtship and marriage to the eccentric young Audubon, their wanderings along the western fringe of the country, the birth of their children, and the preparation and publication of The Birds of America. Throughout, DeLatte emphasizes Lucy Audubon s own experiences, concerns, and point of view. She tells of Lucy s often stormy relationship with her brilliant but unreliable husband, her place at the head of their small family, and her crucial role in the creation and publication of her husband s magnum opus. Intelligent, adaptable, and strong-willed, Lucy was, DeLatte shows, the partner Audubon needed for his life and for his work.
